The botnet may also represent an overall change in how threat actors are looking to use botnets.\n\nBitdefender researchers first spotted the botnet on Jan. 10 before it disappeared for a few days only to return 10 days later in a significantly improved form. Before long, the botnet had spread from Asia to the United States with over 18,000 bots and counting, according to a Bitdefender blog post.\n\nThe botnet also uses multiple anti-tampering techniques to prevent a third party from hijacking or poisoning and can perform web exploitations against a series of devices via the same exploit as CVE-2016-10401 and other vulnerabilities against networking equipment.\n\nHNS also\u00a0embeds a plurality of commands such as data exfiltration, code execution and interference with a device's operation. The botnet also features a worm-like spreading mechanism that randomly generates a list of IP addresses to get potential targets.\n\nHide \u2018N Seek is the second known botnet to date, after Hajime, that has a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture. Bitdefender Senior E-threat Analyst Bogdan Botezatu said the virulence of the Hide \u2018N Seek botnet shows how easy it is for cyber-criminals to take over IoT devices. \n\n\u201cIt also shows that cybercriminals are looking into (or experimenting with) decentralized botnet architectures to prevent possible takedowns,\u201d Botezatu said. \u201cLast but not least, it also shows that botmasters are looking at changing the consecrated business model of IoT botnets, moving them away from DDoS and into cyber-espionage.\u201d\n\nBotezatu added that it is interesting that while most IoT botnet have a DDoS component, HNS overcompensates for the lack of the feature with file theft. In addition to the botnets exploits, HNS employs a large dictionary attack which Botezatu described as possibly the largest dictionary attack he has seen in the IoT space to date.\n\nAshley Stephenson, chief executive officer of Corero Network Security, told SC Media the botnet seems to be targeting devices running a particular distribution of Linux called \u201cbuildroot\u201d since it's looking for a login prompt that includes that string (\"buildroot login\u201d). She added that the botnet seems to spread from one botnet to another. \n\n\u201cIt's interesting that it will try TFTP or WEB downloads (the bot acting as the server to load the virus into the victim) based on whether the bot is on the same LAN as the victim,\u201d Stephenson said.\u00a0\u201cThis suggests that the author knows that TFTP is likely to be available on this Linux distribution.\u201d\n\nFurthermore the botnet digitally signs all its communications so that it can't be neutralized that way. Stephenson said the botnets features are worth noting as they are thought out and practical. She said the criminals behind the botnet borrowed from academics of distributed search theory and applied the methods to the dark side, some which could also come straight from Peer to Peer networking.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting components is collaborative/community nature of some of the commands, e.g. asking your neighboring bots (6 degrees of Kevin Bacon \u2013 5 hops away) to help search for something and also have them recruit/ask other bots to join the search (each within their own '6 degrees of Kevin Bacon'),\u201d Stephenson said.\n\nThe evolution of the botnet demonstrates how much threat actors are willing to invest in time and effort to develop more sophisticated and self-preserving botnets and both Stephenson and Botezatu expect to see more efforts like this with future botnets in the foreseeable future.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "661 blacklisted Bitcoin apps found in popular app stores", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/661-blacklisted-bitcoin-apps-found-in-popular-app-stores/article/739292/", "title": "661 blacklisted Bitcoin apps found in popular app stores", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "January 24, 2018", "body": "An analysis of 18,408 apps across 20 app stores has uncovered 661 Bitcoin apps blacklisted by cybersecurity vendors, according to RiskIQ.\n\nThe apps, found in the Google Play, Apple, SameAPK and APKPlz stores, could be used by hackers to get users to turn over money or personal information. \n\n\u201cWe are seeing threat actors around the world exploiting what is already a hostile currency in a lawless digital world.

The report said the GDGS is known to gather cyber intelligence to bolster its offensive cyber capabilities.\n\nThe group is believed to be currently running six distinct and concurrently operating campaigns some of which have been in operation since 2012.\n\nDark Caracal has ties to a previous operation uncovered by the EFF during its Operation Manul campaign which targeted journalists, lawyers, and dissidents critical of the Kazakhstan government.\n\nThe malicious group usual modus operandi is to use trojanized Android apps to install an APT normally utilizing social media, phishing and sometimes physical access to compromise a targeted system. The malware employed by Dark Caracal ranges from a custom-developed mobile spy tool called Pallas along with the more commonly used found FinFisher, Bandook RAT and other tools that are bought or rented off the Dark Web.\n\nA standard Dark Caracal attack starts with a lure placed on a Facebook group and WhatsApp messages. These normally included political messages or links to Facebook groups that Dark Caracal believes would interest the victim. Successful WhatsApp phishing attacks then lead the victim to a watering hole server, while those hooked via Facebook were sent to a specially constructed malicious website using a fake Google, Facebook or Twitter domain. In some cases the Facebook targets would go to the watering hole server.\n\nNo matter which server the victims landed on the target would be served a series of trojanized Android Apps, which after installation would begin communicating with a command and control server found at adobeair[.] net. \n\nThe EFF and Lookout's investigation was able to identify four \u201cpersonas\u201d, two phone numbers and two domains associated with Dark Caracal, all of which are somehow connected to the email address op13@mail[.]com. \n\n\u201cAliases associated with op13@mail[.]com include Nancy Razzouk, Hadi Mazeh, and Rami Jabbour. All of the physical addresses listed in the WHOIS domain registrations associated with op13@mail[.]com tend to cluster around the SSID: Bld3F6 Wi-Fi locations. This is near the General Security building in Beirut,\u201d the report stated.\n\nOnce inside a victim's device it would spread to encompass both desktop and mobile platforms gathering stored images, texts and even using a phone to snap photos of what the owner was doing. The report noted that largest amount of data came via six Android campaigns that eventually delivered 48GB of information to the adobeair[.] net. This server also had an additional 33GB of information harvested through Windows campaigns.\n\nThe countries hit included the United States, China, France, India, South Korea and several Middle Eastern nations.\n\nThe type of data exfiltrated is almost as diverse as the victimized countries. In its Androd campaigns the report noted that Dark Caracal was interested in SMS text messages were particularly popular and included the users two-factor authentication and one-time password pins, (some still valid) receipts and airline reservations, and company communications. Mobile contact lists, call logs, Wi-Fi network details and audio recordings were also snatched.\n\nThe Windows malware grabbed screenshots, corporate and legal documentation and even iPhone back up logs.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/social-media/topic/47245/", "topic_name": "Social Media"}]}, {"news_name": "Not-so-super Sonic?

It's a serious threat\u2026\u201d\n\nQuoting Malware Must Die researchers, a report from The Register\u00a0further warns that an analysis of Okiru revealed that its operators have been \u201cpreparing ARC binary specifically to target one particular Linux environment.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, is it possible that an Okiru-fueled DDoS assault against ARC-based machines could rival the size and scope of the infamous Mirai attack that disrupted Dyn?\n\n\u201cDue to there being over a billion likely ARC devices out there, there is definitely potential for us to see dramatically raised botnet numbers due to this development,\u201d said Daniel Miessler, director of advisory services at IOActive, in an interview with SC Media. \u201cBut it's not always a straight line from potential to reality, as there are many variables such as percentage of devices exposed, patch levels, malware robustness, speed of security response, etc. So it's pretty hard to know if this will actually lead to a Dyn-level or greater situation, but the potential attack surface of ARC devices does make it a possibility.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Okiru's cousin Satori is busy causing its own brand of mischief. (Reportedly, Satori malware has at times been previously referred to as Okiru, but the Okiru malware targeting ARC processors is markedly different, and not to be used interchangeably with Satori.)\n\nDespite a largely successful effort to sinkhole Satori botnet after it was uncovered late last year, researchers from Qihoo 360's Netlab team discovered on Jan. 8 that a new variant named Satori.Coin.Robber was starting to rebuild its own version of the malicious network. \n\nAccording to a Jan. 17 Qihoo blog post, the botnet targets devices primarily Windows-based machines running Claymore Dual GPU miner\u00a0software, hacking them by exploiting a vulnerability affecting Port 3333. \u201cIt works primarily on the Claymore Mining equipment that allows management actions on 3333 ports with no password authentication enabled (which is the default config),\u201d Qihoo reported, withholding additional details for security reasons. (Qihoo also warned that Claymore v.10.1 users are vulnerable to an exploit that leverages CVE-2017-16929, an authenticated directory traversal vulnerability.)\n\nThe researchers also determined that as of Jan. 11, \"Satori.Coin.Robber has got the first ETH coin paid... with another 0.76 coin in the balance. Although this total amounts to a relatively paltry sum \u2013 as of Jan. 18, one Ethereum is worth just over $1,000 \u2013 the implications of using an IoT botnet to target cryptocurrency enthusiasts is nonetheless an intriguing development.\n\nOddly, Qihoo also reported that\u00a0the author of Satori.Coin.Robber is publicly claiming his code is not malicious, even providing an email at which he or she purportedly can be contacted.\u00a0\n\nMirai-inspired botnet malware like Satori and Okiru were made possible after one of Mirai's original developers, Paras Jha, from Fanwood, N.J., released its code to the public shortly after performing an attack on security researcher Brian Krebs on Sept. 20, 2016. On Dec. 13, 2017, Jha pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from Mirai's creation, along with Josiah White, of\u00a0Washington, Penn. and Dalton Norman of\u00a0Metairie, La.\n\n\u201cOnce malware becomes public, it is very common for other malware creators or sometimes the originators to create variations to both foil detection systems and specifically target new systems,\u201d said Mike Ahmadi, global director of IoT Security at DigiCert, in emailed comments. \u201cIt is important to understand that the development community for malware is just as active and often more driven to create \u2018improved' versions as the conventional software industry is. System builders and device manufacturers need to have a greater focus on implementing mitigation's and controls that address the root issues that allow malware to flourish, rather than focusing on addressing the malware \u2018flavour du jour.'\u201d\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/botnet/topic/47256/", "topic_name": "Botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ddos/topic/47213/", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Malicious 'ChaiOS' link can crash Apple devices", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malicious-chaios-link-can-crash-apple-devices/article/737609/", "title": "Malicious 'ChaiOS' link can crash Apple devices", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 17, 2018", "body": "A quirky bug in Apple's Messages application is allowing a malicious GitHub link to cause crashes and other bothersome behavior on both macOS and iOS machines.\n\nVarious news sources have credited Twitter user Abraham Masri, aka @cheesecakeufo, with publicly disclosing the bug, referred to as\u00a0ChaiOS. \"Text the link below, it will freeze the recipient's device, and possibly restart it,\" reads a Jan. 17 tweet from Masri.\n\nAfter testing the link, 9to5Mac reported that it can make the Messaging app freeze and crash, cause Safari to crash or display the spinning wheel on macOS, force both the sender and recipient's device to respring, cause significant lags, and trigger battery issues.\n\nMasri and news reports have likened ChaiOS to a 2015 attack called \"Effective Power,\" that involved a sequence of texted characters that caused iPhones to reboot.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apple/topic/47233/", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ios/topic/47255/", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "AdultSwine malware helps porn ads and scams invade children's apps", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/adultswine-malware-helps-porn-ads-and-scams-invade-childrens-apps/article/736797/", "title": "AdultSwine malware helps porn ads and scams invade children's apps", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 12, 2018", "body": "Cybercriminals have been spiking game apps, including several aimed at children, with malware that displays pornographic ads, pushes fake security apps, and registers users for premium services with permission.\n\nThe malware, dubbed AdultSwine, was recently found in approximately 60 apps that collectively were downloaded from Google Play between 3 million and 7 million times, according to a Jan. 12\u00a0blog post\u00a0from\u00a0Check Point Software Technologies\u00a0that was accompanied by a more in-depth\u00a0research document.\n\nUpon disclosure of this discovery, Google... removed the apps from Play, disabled the developers' accounts, and will continue to show strong warnings to anyone that has installed them,\" a Google spokesperson told SC Media.

At this point, the mobile malware can upload and analyze any received SMS message and delete them locally, including those banks send with sensitive account information and security codes. The malware can also call an assigned phone number, send an SMS, and steal call logs and contact lists.\n\nAdditionally, Trend Micro found that FakeBank steals data including user phone numbers, installed banking apps, balances on linked bank cards, and location information, and transmits that information to a command-and-control server.\n\nTo prevent victims from uninstalling the app, Fake Bank prevents users from opening device settings. The malware also impedes victims from opening the targeted bank's legitimate app, thereby stopping users from modifying links between their bank card numbers and phone numbers.\n\nFakeBank also hides its payload three layers of obfuscation, and evades detection by exiting a device if it detects anti-virus software.\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, most of FakeBank's C&C domains have IP addresses located in Poland's Warmia-Masuria province and Russia, and most are registered by a company that has previously been connected to other fraudulent domains.

The fake app purports to perform such helpful tasks as system and cache cleaning and memory optimization, but in truth it is capable of malicious remote command execution, information theft, unauthorized SMS sending and URL forwarding, and click/ad fraud. It also signs up unwitting users for premium SMS subscription services, without permission.\n\nLorin Wu, a mobile threats analyst with Trend Micro, reports in the blog post that Google was notified of the threat, and responded by verifying that Google Play Protect has safeguards in place to protect users from the malware family in question. The offending app was also removed, Trend Micro told SC Media.\n\nIn May 2017, Google essentially endorsed Kotlin for Android development purposes by\u00a0announcing first-class support for the programming language. The official Kotlin website describes Kotlin as a statically typed programming language that is fully compatible with Java and Android and can be used to build apps for across multiple platforms. Its advantages, according to the site, include the reduction of boilerplate code, minimization of errors, interoperability across existing libraries, and its tool-friendly nature. However, Wu says it is unclear how these features might benefit a bad actor when developing new malware.\n\n\u201cThe discovery of a first Kotlin-developed malicious app is significant in a way that Google and other publications consider it as the next big thing when it comes to programming languages,\u201d a Trend Micro research spokesperson explained to SC Media.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that a malware was developed using it shows that no programming language, whatever their features are, can be immune to cybercriminal abuse.\u201d\n\nWhen launched, the Swift Cleaner malware sends the infected device's information to a remote command-and-control server. The C&C server sends back various tasks requests, as well as a specific number to which the malware sends an unauthorized SMS message.

While the apps are actually able to perform the advertised tasks, they also secretly harvest user data, tracked user location, and aggressively pushed advertisements on nearly every action a user performs.\n\nThe apps collect information such as the user's Android ID, Mac address, IMSI, information about the OS, brand and model of the device, device specifics, language, location information, and data on installed apps like Google Play and Facebook to sends to a remote server. \u00a0The malware is also capable of uploading installed app information, as well as attachments, user operational information, and data on activated events as well. \n\nWhen the apps are first launched they won't appear on the device launcher's list of applications, shortcuts will also not appear on the device screen and users will only be able to see notifications sent by the apps. \n\nThe \u201chide\u201d function is designed to not run on specified devices including the Google Nexus 6P, Xiaomi MI 4LTE, ZTE N958St and LGE LG-H525n, presumably to avoid being checked by Google Play during inspection periods, researchers said. \n\nOnce installed, users are bombarded with false security notifications and other messages from the malware while the app is running. Most of the notifications are false although they are designed to be believable. Notifications include\u201c10.0 GB files are being wasted\u201d or \u201cFraud SMS Broadcast Vulnerability\u201d which will prompt some kind of action.\n\nIf a user clicks the displayed button on the prompt the app will show a simple animation illustrating that the problem was resolved. \u00a0In addition to the security prompts, users are bombarded with different advertisements in many different scenarios such as after the app sends notices to unlock the device screen or if the user is told to connect to a charger. \n\n\u201cUsers are actually asked to sign and agree to a EULA (end-user license agreement) which describes the information that will be gathered and used by the app,\u201d researchers said in the report. \u201cBut we can still say that the app abuses privacy because the collection and transmission of personal data is unrelated to the functionality of the app.\u201d\n\nResearchers spotted the malicious apps in December 2017 and said the apps have since been removed by the time the blog was written.

By and large, these various services are reportedly using vulnerable tracking location software developed and licensed by ThinkRace, an Indian GPS tracker manufacturer, which also operates five of the affected services.\n\nAs of Jan. 2, four of the impacted websites have been confirmed fixed \u2013 https://www.one2trackgps.com (aka One2Track), http://kiddo-track.com, http://www.amber360.com, and http://tr.3g-elec.com (in this case, the subdomain was removed). Another 15 no longer appear vulnerable to the researchers' proof-of-concept exploit code, although it cannot be conclusively affirmed that they have been permanently patched.\n\nThe report states that ThinkRace also agreed to repair their own five affected websites by Jan. 2; however, the researchers claim the fixes so far are \u201cincomplete.\u201d SC Media has reached out to ThinkRace for comment and will update the story upon receiving a response.\n\nStykas and Gruhn's work updates and expands upon\u00a0previous research\u00a0conducted by fellow security researcher Lachlan Temple, aka @skoooch, who found similar or possibly identical issues back in 2015. According to the latest report as well as two accompanying technical advisories, the vulnerabilities, discovered in November, can be divided into two subsets.\n\nOne subset is a\u00a0series of authorization bypasses\u00a0in gpsui.net, a website that facilitates the master server for at least 615,000 GSM and GPS location tracking devices. When exploited, this flaw enables attackers to escalate their privileges until they can force disclosure of all location tracking information, as well as send commands to and take control of all connected devices.\n\nThe other subset of vulnerabilities consists of various\u00a0information disclosures as well as exposed APIs\u00a0in multiple websites that act as the web control panel server for roughly 6.3 million devices, comprised of an estimated 367 different product models. The report states that these coding errors can allow unauthenticated actors to \u201ctake full control of the exposed API features to control and manage the registered GPS tracking devices,\u201d as well as \u201cextract the locations as well as associated phone numbers (if set) and device model type[s] from the user database via the exposed API on each affected website.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, attackers may also be able to access images and audio recordings uploaded by devices, as well as on-board diagnostics features on devices used by vehicles.\n\nStykas and Gruhn say they tried to give notified vendors sufficient time to fix the vulnerabilities before public disclosure, but also felt the need to come forward so that device owners could start to protect themselves, especially against the threat of having their live locations identified by malicious actors.\n\nThe researchers recommend that consumers stop using any location-tracking device that relies on an unpatched service, and remove as much data as possible from these vulnerable websites. Users are also advised to change their passwords for their device's online service, even if the site has been adequately patched.\n\nMark James, security specialist at ESET, told SC Media UK that data such as GPS location could enable bad actors to tailor an attack, both digital or physical, with optimum effectiveness. \u201cWith this type of information, it shows a very clear footprint of your every move \u2013 something that, if exploited, could be the difference between a failed or successful attack,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn attacker with access to the data could use this information to determine your whereabouts and tailor a specific attack either with you, or without you present, depending on the attack vector.\u201d\n\nIn emailed comments, Lamar Bailey, director of security research and development at Tripwire, said that this report demonstrates how many small IoT device manufacturers and services providers \u201care very small and do not have adequate security practices, training, or staff to setup secure product and services, or they are more interested in getting products to market instead of spending the time and money to make sure the products are secure.\u00a0Think of them like a new bank that just popped up and they are giving 10 percent interest on savings accounts to gain customers, but the bank branches are built like tents with no vault or security guards.\u201d\n\nMoreover, added Bailey, many of these companies have no establish means for researchers to easily report security concerns or disclose vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Smartphone sensors exploited to steal login PINs", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/researchers-crack-smartphone-pins-by-gleaning-phones-own-sensors/article/734268/", "title": "Smartphone sensors exploited to steal login PINs", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "January 02, 2018", "body": "Researchers from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore developed a technique to leverage a phones sensors to guess a user's PIN code. \n\nUsing a custom application, the researchers used a combination of information gathered from six different sensors found in smart phones to machine learning and deep learning algorithms to unlock a user's phone with a 99.5 percent accuracy rate within only three tries if a user has one of the 50 most commonly used PINs, according to a recent report.\n\nResearchers were able to classify all 10,000 PIN combinations with up to an 83.7 percent success rate within 20 tries in a single user setting which is still an impressive feat, given that the previous phone-cracking record using the most common 50 PIN combinations was a success rate of 74 percent, the report said.\n\nThe app leverages the phones accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, proximity sensor, barometer, and ambient light sensor. \u00a0The sensors were described as \u201czero-permission sensors\u201d as they currently require no user approval for apps to access its data. \n\nThe information gleaned from the sensors is then matched to data collected from three test subjects who each entered a random set of 70 four-digit PIN numbers on a phone. Although the sample size is small, researchers said their algorithm will improve success rates as it monitors more users entering their PINs. Using this method, researchers were able to identify which buttons were pressed based on how the phone was tilted and how much light was blocked by the thumb or fingers.\n\n\u201cWhen you hold your phone and key in the PIN, the way the phone moves when you press 1, 5, or 9, is very different,\u201d Dr Shivam Bhasin, NTU Senior Research Scientist said in the press release. \u201cLikewise, pressing 1 with your right thumb will block more light than if you pressed 9.\u201d \n\nDr. Bhasin recommends mobile operating systems to restrict access to the sensors so that users can actively choose to only give permissions to trusted apps that require access to the sensors.

Loapi was found on more than 20 resources whose domains refer to popular antivirus solutions and even a famous porn site.\n\nResearchers have seen 46,266 infections in 86 countries, including Mexico, the United States, Italy, France and Germany although the majority of infections were spotted in India, the Russian Federation and South Africa.\n\nThe trojan's \"features\" modules, which allow the malware to conduct a variety of malicious activities such as mine cryptocurrencies, annoy users with constant ads, launch DDoS attacks from the affected device, manipulate a user's text messages, subscribe users to various services and send HTTP requests from the victim's device.\n\nOnce installed, the application tries to obtain device administrator permissions by asking for them in a loop until the user agrees. The malware also checks if the device is rooted, but never subsequently uses root privileges. Researchers said there is no doubt the feature will be used in a new module in the future. \n\nAfter admin privileges are acquired, the malicious app then either hides its icon in the menu or simulates various antivirus activity depending on the application the app is mimicking. Loapi also fights tooth and nail to ensure it maintains its admin privileges.\n\nIf a user attempts to revoke the permissions, the app will lock the phone's screen, close the device manager settings window, and execute code to prevent the application from being removed. \n\nThe trojan also detects apps that pose a threat to itself, such as legitimate security apps, and repeatedly prompts the user to delete the app until the user finally agrees and deletes the application.\n\nLoapi is built on a layered architecture with the first stage consisting of a dropper to deliver malware apk, a second stage controller payload DEX, and third stage modules which include ad, proxy, crawler, sms, and miner modules.\n\n\u201cIt has a well-thought out modular architecture,\u201d Kaspersky Lab\u00a0malware analyst Nikita Buchka told SC Media, adding, \u201cThe malware authors have the ability to turn their Trojan into something new in very little time by just adding or removing new modules.\u201d\n\nThe app is the descendant of the Podec trojan from 2015 making the app an anomaly as such continuity through generations is rare for Android malware.

The problem stems from the fact that the platform allows a file to be a valid APK file and a valid DEX file at the same time. The name Janus references the name of the Roman god of duality.\n\n\u201cWhen designing data formats, protocols, data structures\u00a0and code in general, one should always strive to avoid redundancy,\u201d researchers said in the post. \u201cAny discrepancies lead to bugs or worse.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, an\u00a0APK file\u00a0is a zip archive, which can contain arbitrary bytes at the start, before its zip entries while on the other hand, a\u00a0DEX file\u00a0can contain arbitrary bytes at the end, after the regular sections of strings, classes, method definitions, etc.\n\nAn attacker can leverage the duality by prepend a malicious DEX file to an APK file, without affecting its signature. The Android runtime will then accept the APK file as a valid update of a legitimate earlier version of the app however, the Dalvik VM loads the code from the injected DEX file, researchers said in the post.\n\nAn attacker exploiting the flaw could replace a trusted application that already has high privileges, such as a system app, with one of their updates to abuse the permissions that have already been granted. This could enable the attack to access sensitive information stored in the devices or enable the attacker to seize control over the device completely. \n\nIn another scenario, the attacker could pass a modified clone of a sensitive application off as a legitimate update such as a banking or communications application and use the clone to look and behave like the original application but inject malicious behavior. \n\nFortunately the attack is still just a proof of concept and was reported to Google on July 31, 2017 and published in the\u00a0Android Security Bulletin\u00a0on December 4, 2017.\n\n\u201cAny scenario still requires the user to install the malicious update from a source outside the Google Play store,\u201d researchers said. \u201cIt may be relatively easy to trick some users\u00a0because the application can still look exactly like the original application\u00a0and has the proper signature.\u201d\n\nRusty Carter, VP of\u00a0product management at Arxan told SC media the vulnerability is significantly different as it would allow an attacker to augment or inject code into an application on a non- rooted device without disrupting the application's signature. \n\n\u201cThis example is evidence that these vulnerabilities DO exist and without protection, app users, creators and owners run the risk of an attacker finding that next 0-day,\u201d Carter said. \u201cAs such, organizations with apps must be sure they are implementing anti-tamper technology within their apps.\u201d \n\nUsers are encouraged to update as soon as possible if they already haven't.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "BlackBerry pitches connected car security recommendations, self-driving truck huge cybercrime target", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/blackberry-pitches-iotconnected-car-security-autonomous-trucks-pose-big-threat/article/712415/", "title": "BlackBerry pitches connected car security recommendations, self-driving truck huge cybercrime target", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "December 07, 2017", "body": "As our cars become more connected and our society moves closer to wide spread autonomous driving, researchers and companies alike are calling for national standards to help secure connected vehicles.\n\nBlackBerry recently released a whitepaper highlighting what it calls a 7-Pillar Recommendation or list of seven recommendations to help reduce vulnerabilities in vehicles thereby lessening the chances of a threat actor exploiting them for mischievous purposes. \u00a0\n\nThe seven recommendations include securing the supply chain, using trusted components, isolating critical systems, the use of in-field health checks, rapid incident response networks, lifecycle management systems, and building safety and security into the culture. BlackBerry argued these principles could also be adopted by other IoT devices as well to ensure safer products in other industries.\n\nThe recommendations were also offered as guidelines for legislators to adopt a minimum set of requirements similar to the NHTSA (National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration) 5-Star scoring system. \n\n\u201cWe feel that NHTSA and DOT can mandate a minimum set of requirements, such as the 7-pillars, with certain criteria to be met to achieve a certain score,\u201d the company said in the report. \u201cA 5- Star scoring system can be used to initially educate consumers and later to make their score a differentiator for their automobiles.\u201d\n\nScoring would be set based on how many of the recommended requirements are followed and how many objective criteria are met with tests. BlackBerry argued that the implementations shouldn't be mandated, but left to the automakers to differentiate their offerings.\n\nAcalvio\u00a0Chief Security Architect Chris Roberts told SC Media that this is one area where the government has been ahead of the industry. As an example he cited\u00a0proposals made earlier this year to have safety and security standards for IoT devices, particularly those used in government. \n\n\u201cThe challenge in any of this is simply getting the manufacturers and companies that are developing all of these solutions to collaborate and build more secure devices,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cTherefore, you have to marshal \u201cmost\u201d of Silicon Valley, change the philosophy of \u201cbuild it cheap/fast\u201d to one of \u201cbuild it secure/safe\u201d and then have that propagated to countries such as China, India etc\u2026\u201d\n\nHe added that other companies have been calling for similar initiatives and that BlackBerry is not leading the way in this but added that more companies like BlackBerry are needed to join the efforts to provide a baseline of what security and safety should be.\n\nWhile many vulnerabilities and attack scenarios have been well documented for connected cars, some researchers warn the threats posed by connected trucks could pose much more imminent threats as more harm can be done with trucks, Jeffrey Carr, a consultant and founder of the Suits and Spooks cybersecurity conference series told Trucks.com.\n\nLast month, Tesla unveiled its electric semi-truck and many companies are already following suit with their own versions, all of which are prime targets for cybercriminals looking to attacks use GPS-spoofing to redirect trucks along with the valuable loads they haul. These attacks can be carried out for as little as $10,000 which could be a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of damage they could cause.\n\n\u201cThey won't waste that on an individual vehicle,\u201d Carr told the publication. \u201cIt has to be a high-value target. Giant rigs moving down the highway under the control of computerized navigation systems utilizing GPS \u2014 you have a high-value target.\u201d \n\nTrucks are also more vulnerable to these attacks as they use a common protocol making it easier to compromise a fleet of trucks, Argus Cyber Security researcher Monique Lance told Trucks.com. \n\n\u201cThere's a common communications standard in trucks called J 1939 that makes it possible to craft one attack that fits all,\u201d Lance said. \u201cAn attack that accesses one truck will potentially access most trucks.\u201d\n\nAlthough many of these attacks are still in proof of concept stages, researchers are urging manufactures to start preparing for the increasing threat landscape now before its too late. \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Apple releases security updates for multiple products", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apple-security-updates-address-remote-exploit-flaws/article/712709/", "title": "Apple releases security updates for multiple products", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "December 07, 2017", "body": "Apple released security updates to patch vulnerabilities in its iOS, mac OS, tvOS and watchOS platforms, some of which could have been used to remotely exploit the affected devices.\n\n The iOS 11.2 update addressed multiple memory corruption issues that could result in an application being able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges, through improved state management, according to the advisory.\n\nApple also released \u00a0macOS High Sierra 10.13.2, Security Update 2017-002 Sierra, and Security Update 2017-005 El Capitan to address multiple issues that could allow the processing a maliciously crafted Apache configuration directive to result in the disclosure of process memory.\n\nThe tvOS and watch OS updates a memory corruption issue that could allow an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

(Certificate pinning is when developers choose to only accept certificates signed by a single pinned CA root certificate.)\n\nResearchers Chris Stone, Tom Chothia, and Flavio Garcia observed this very scenario in a series of apps that collectively have been installed millions of times, including those issued by Bank of America and HSBC, as well as the popular TunnelBear VPN. Altogether, the nine affected apps were: Bank of America Health, TunnelBear VPN, Meezan Bank, and Smile Bank for Android, and HSBC, HSBC Business, HSBC Identity, HSBCnet, and HSBC Private for iOS. All of the companies involved repaired the flaw prior to the publishing of the paper.\n\nThe researchers uncovered the vulnerability after analyzing 400 security-sensitive Android and iPhone apps using a new semi-automated tool they developed called Spinner, which is designed to identify, on a large scale, instances of improper hostname verification in apps that perform certificate pinning.\n\nPrior to this tool, testing for this scenario \u201cwould typically require the tester to own a high security certificate from the same issuer (and often same intermediate CA) as the one used by the app,\u201d the report explains. But Spinner does not require purchasing any certificates. \u201cBy redirecting traffic to websites which use the relevant certificates and then analyzing the (encrypted) network traffic, we are able to determine whether the hostname check is correctly done, even in the presence of certificate pinning,\u201d the report explains.\n\nFifteen other applications that do not practice certificate pinning were also flagged by Spinner, either for failing to perform a hostname check or for issuing a self-signed certificate. These apps, also now patched were: Emirates NBD, Kotak Bank, Al Rajhi Bank, Santander UK (biocatch), and CommBank Property for iOS, and American Bank of Sydney Ulster Bank NI, Ulster Bank RI, BofAML Research Library First Financial Bank, ACU Mobile, Bitcoin.co.id, Britline, Opal Transfer, and Aman Bank for Android.\n\nIn response to the study, Bank of America claims that some of the information in the report was dated.\u00a0\u201cThe vulnerability identified was resolved in Bank of America's Health app nearly two years ago in January 2016. The app is no longer available as of June 2017. At no time was customer information impacted,\u201d said a company spokesperson via email.\n\nIn their paper, the researchers explain that their process constitutes \u201ca black-box method to detect apps... that, when using TLS, pin to a root or intermediate certificate but do not check the hostname of the host they connect to. Instead of trying to get certificates from all possible certificate authorities, which we argue is infeasible, we build a tool that makes use of the Censys Internet scanning search engine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the certificate for a target domain, the tool queries for certificate chains for alternate hosts that only differ in the leaf certificate,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThe tool then redirects the traffic from the app under test to a website which has a certificate signed by the same CA certificate, but of course a different hostname (Common Name). If the connection fails during the establishment phase, then we know the app detected the wrong hostname. Whereas, if the connection is established and encrypted application data is transferred by the client before the connection fails, then we know the app has accepted the hostname and is vulnerable.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ios/topic/47255/", "topic_name": "iOS"}]}, {"news_name": "Study: 90 percent of top cryptocurrency apps carry security and privacy risks", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/study-90-percent-of-top-cryptocurrency-apps-carry-security-and-privacy-risks/article/710383/", "title": "Study: 90 percent of top cryptocurrency apps carry security and privacy risks", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "November 29, 2017", "body": "A study of 90 cryptocurrency mobile applications available on Google Play found that 90 percent of them contain security vulnerabilities or privacy risks.\n\nWeb security company High-Tech Bridge conducted the research, using dynamic, static, and interactive testing to search mobile apps for weaknesses, including the top ten mobile flaws listed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).\n\n\u201cWe took the most popular cryptocurrency mobile applications from Google Play from the \u2018Finance' category and tested them for security flaws and design weaknesses that can endanger the user, his or her data stored on the device or send/received via the network, or the mobile device itself,\u201d High-Tech Bridge reported in a Nov. 29 blog post.\n\nThe company divided the apps into three groups of 30: the most popular apps with a maximum of 100,000 installations, the top apps with up to 500,000 installations, and the top apps with more than 500,000 installations.\n\nWhen combined together, 84.6 percent of the apps were determined to contain at least two high-risk vulnerabilities, while 84.3 percent were found with a minimum of three medium-risk bugs.\n\nNearly half of the apps, 47 percent, were deemed vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, while 48 percent were found to contain hardcoded sensitive data such as passwords or API keys.

The credential admin/CentryL1nk first appeared in an exploit about ZyXEL PK5001Z modem in\u00a0exploit-db\u00a0less than a month ago.\n\nThey added that the misuse of these two credentials began at around\u00a011 am on 22 November, reaching a peak, a day later. Around 100,000 IPs were recorded scanning for exploitable devices using the credentials, mostly from Argentina, as a source of 65,700.\n\n\u201cThis leaves us wondering if it is an attack focus on several specific types of IoT device, as \u00a0these devices are widely deployed in Argentina, just as happened at last year's\u00a0Telekom event,\u201d said researchers.\n\nBogdan Botezatu, senior e-threat analyst at Bitdefender, told SC Media UK that Mirai\u00a0went open source in October 2016. \n\n\u201cIts original code has served as an inspiration to other cyber-criminals, so, currently, there are tens or even hundreds of variations of the\u00a0Mirai\u00a0bot attacking IoT devices. We are aware of at least 10 major botnets derived from\u00a0Mirai. By major, I mean 10 K bots and up. New versions come and go, as hackers have easy access to both the bot's source code and to devices to infect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe presume that the uptick in attacks originating from Argentina is closely related to the publication of a proof-of-concept attack against the old ZyXEL PK5001Z routers that have been shipped with hardcoded credentials for the Telnet service. In terms of functionality, nothing has changed much,\u00a0Mirai\u00a0is still a basic bot with DDoS capabilities, but the recently posted credentials have helped operators seize significantly more vulnerable devices than they usually do,\u201d he added.\n\nChris Doman, security researcher at AlienVault, told SC Media UK that the distribution servers seem to have been taken down today (Monday 27th), however given this is a worm the damage will likely already have been done in the preceding days.\n\n\u201cWhilst hard-coded credentials can make management easier for ISPs, it's inevitable that using the same credentials on every router like this will lead to security failure of some kind,\u201d he added.\n\nKen Munro, partner in Pen Test Partners, told SC Media UK that the TCP/2323 vector is interesting and \u201csmacks of the telnet port obfuscation used by the Lilin DVR (TCP/12323).\u201d\n\n\u201cRouters shouldn't be running telnet or any other service exposed to the Internet. TR-069 and similar exist for remote configuration and diagnostics and this can be IP filtered by the device so that arbitrary people can't connect.\u00a0It is also trivially easy to find out these passwords as weaknesses in the supply chain see them published online,\u201d he added.\n\nChristopher Littlejohns, EMEA manager at Synopsys, told SC Media UK that the ZyXEL PK5001Z Modem is yet another device with hard-coded credentials that is deployed in enough numbers to be worthy of interest to enable potential future DoS attacks. \n\n\u201cWhat is perhaps more worrying is that the target is a router, therefore all internet and network traffic within a house or small business is likely to pass through it. This potentially makes the target all the more valuable to the attacker as it may facilitate more sophisticated credential stealing attacks that can be monetised,\u201d he said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/internet-security/topic/47231/", "topic_name": "Internet Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}]}, {"news_name": "Top 10 ways to stay safe while shopping online this holiday season", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/top-10-ways-to-stay-safe-while-shopping-online-this-holiday-season/article/708668/", "title": "Top 10 ways to stay safe while shopping online this holiday season", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 23, 2017", "body": "Cyber Monday may still be \u201ca thing\u201d but online shopping for the holidays is already well under way so with that in mind Malwarebyte's has pulled together a list of safe trips for all those who would rather not brave the crowds and weather and shop from home.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/retail/topic/47210/", "topic_name": "Retail"}]}, {"news_name": "Mobile malware a universal threat around the globe: Check Point", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-malware-a-universal-threat-around-the-globe-check-point/article/708664/", "title": "Mobile malware a universal threat around the globe: Check Point", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 20, 2017", "body": "When it comes to avoiding mobile malware no company anywhere on the planet is immune.\n\nThe recent Check Point Mobile Threat Research report found that of the 850 organizations worldwide, 51 percent in the EMEA, 31 percent in the Americas and 19 percent in APAC, all had experienced at least one mobile attack in the last year with the average being 54 per company. Behind this was the finding that 75 percent of the surveyed companies had at least one jailbroken iOS or rooted Android device with the average number per organization being 35.\n\n\u201cThese results are concerning because the process of rooting or jailbreaking a device strips away all built-in security provided by the iOS and Android operating systems,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe financial and government sectors were the most targeted with malware with the former area absorbing 29 percent of the attacks and the latter close behind with 26 percent. Technology firms were third with 18 percent, while telcos, manufacturing and retail were in the 6 percent to 8 percent range. \n\nCheck Point broke down this part of the report a bit further disproving the notion that iOS devices are less likely to be targeted. \u00a0Instead it found financial industry was particularly hit with iOS malware with 40 percent hitting this sector, twice as much government which was the next most hit industry.\n\nThe report also showed that different sectors attracted specific type of attacks. Government was very popular with cybercriminals pushing premium dialers, which abuse SMS and call permissions to charge the device's owner for fraudulent calls and text messages to premium services. \n\nThe financial sector was also the primary target for the remaining three types of mobile malware that was studied, info stealers, rough ad networks and RATs. The last attack is incredibly dangerous as it can use all the sensor types available on the device. This includes activating the camera or audio so the criminal can see and listen in to the device owner's activities. \n\nMobile malware attacks were spread more or less evenly between the three regions studied. The Americas region, comprised of North and South America, was hit the worst garnering 39 percent of the mobile malware attacks \u2014 mostly in the United States \u00ad\u2014 with APAC suffering 33 percent of the attacks and the EMEA 28 percent.\n\nEven though Check Point said mobile malware is basically ubiquitous the company concluded that it is probably going to get much worse with every region experiencing an increased amount of malware.\n\n\u201cWe can only expect mobile attacks to increase in proportion and sophistication in the years ahead. For perpetrators the world of mobile devices holds great potential: they are easier to hack and they possess even more sensitive information than PCs. We expect the financial services sector to continue to be a primary target of cybercriminals, followed by government agencies, as these two sectors protect the most valuable assets,\u201d the report said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ios/topic/47255/", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Manhattan DA speaks on burden of hiring hackers to beat smartphone encryption", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cy-vance-speaks-on-burdens-of-tech-firm-smartphone-encryption/article/708308/", "title": "Manhattan DA speaks on burden of hiring hackers to beat smartphone encryption", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "November 17, 2017", "body": "Manhattan\u00a0District Attorney Cy Vance, Jr.\u00a0touted his agency's use of mercenary hackers to crack phone encryption while criticizing the lack of federal legislation to force tech giants to make exceptions in smartphone encryption for when judicial warrants are issued.\n\n\"It's just impossible to overstate the value of this kind of direct evidence,\" Vance said, Thursday addressing a crowd at a cybersecurity conference hosted by his office at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nThe DA went on to cite a case in which his agency contracted official hackers to break into an iPhone 4S running an iOS8 operating system to obtain evidence that lead to the conviction of a pedophile. \n\nVance said the conversations has shifted from regulating consumer products to whether or not law enforcement should break into tech giant's products leading to a destructive cat-and-mouse game. \n\nVance went on to criticize how law enforcement spent $1 million, resources many smaller agencies don't have, to break into the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist's encrypted phone.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/encryption/topic/47214/", "topic_name": "Encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Three more Android malware families invade Google Play Store", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/three-more-android-malware-families-invade-google-play-store/article/707693/", "title": "Three more Android malware families invade Google Play Store", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "November 16, 2017", "body": "Collectively downloaded millions of times, 158 fake Android applications containing mobile malware were recently found smuggled into the Google Play Store, according to a trio of separate research reports that were published within days of each other.\n\nResearchers at McAfee did the heaviest lifting, spotting Grobas, a program that pushes unwanted apps, in 144 trojanized apps. Meanwhile, analysts at ESET identified eight apps carrying a multi-stage downloader dubbed Android/TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY, and experts at Malwarebytes found six apps sabotaged with Android/Trojan.AsiaHitGroup, which contains hidden adware and attempts to download an SMS trojan.\n\nIn all three cases, Google was alerted to the troublesome APKs and promptly removed them. However, these latest discoveries are further evidence that Google alone is not able to prevent every malicious actor from sneaking malware into its software store.\n\nGrabos\n\nThe Grabos malware that McAfee identified\u00a0was found primarily in file explorer and music player applications, some of which were open source in nature. Its malicious activity includes gathering and exfiltrating a device's specs (e.g. Android version, build model and country code), location, and configuration. It also appears to check if certain social and Google apps are installed and reports its findings to the command-and-control server.\n\nMcAfee believes such information helps Grabos create custom notifications designed to trick users into downloading and installing additional mobile software.\n\n\"Grabos gained popularity on Google Play because it allowed users to download music for free while constantly asking them to rate the app. However, users were not aware of the hidden functionality that comes with those apps, exposing them to custom notifications to download and install additional apps and open them without their consent,\" states McAfee mobile malware researcher Carlos Castillo in a McAfee\u00a0blog post. \"Considering that Grabos also reports the presence of specific social and Google apps on infected devices, cybercriminals could use that information to deliver additional apps by tricking users into installing them using any of the notification methods implemented in the code.\"\u00a0\n\nGrabos constantly analyzes the current state of the phone to determine whether it is safe to run its malicious code or execute only its legitimate functionality. When the user is not actively using the open app, and if there are no indicators that the app is running in test environment or being dynamically analyzed, then Grabos begins reaching out to its C&C server.\u00a0Grabos further evades analysis by updating its remote settings every 24 hours and likely dodged Google Play's security measures by obfuscating its its injected code, Castillo explains.\n\nTo improve its odds of spreading, Grabos is also designed to\u00a0ask the user to share the app with friends, promising faster download speeds in return.\n\nGrabos was initially found in an application called Aristotle Music audio player 2017, which was reportedly downloaded between\u00a0one and five million times. McAfee also found the download histories of 34 other malicious Grabos apps, which collectively were downloaded somewhere between 4.2 and 17.4 million times. One app update dates as far back as Apr. 6, 2017, but the rest were last updated between July and October. A full list of Grabos apps is available in McAfee's blog post report.\n\nTrojanDropper.Agent.BKY\n\nIn its own blog post, ESET reports that it discovered the downloader\u00a0TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY in six fake apps called\u00a0MEX Tools, Clear Android, Cleaner for Android, World News, WORLD NEWS, and World News PRO, as well as two Russian online slots apps.\n\nAccording to ESET, the malicious apps behave normally on the surface, but behind the scenes they decrypt and execute a first-stage payload, which in turn activates a secondary payload. This second-stage malware then downloads a tertiary payload from a hardcoded URL, which is disguised to look like a normal program like Adobe Flash Player or an Android update. (ESET has learned that one of the malicious URL links was visited nearly 3,000 times, with most activity coming from the Netherlands.)\n\nFive minutes later, the device owner receives a prompt to download this additional app. Once this happens, the app drops the final payload and obtains the necessary permissions for it to work. TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY is known to drop\u00a0banking trojans, including MazarBot, and in some cases spyware, reports ESET malware researcher and blog post author Lukas Stefanko.\n\nAsiaHitGroup\n\n\nMalwarebytes found at least six Android apps containing\u00a0AsiaHitGroup, including an alarm clock app, a QR scanner app, a compass app, a photo editor app, an Internet speed test app, and a file explorer app. All of them was most likely added to Google Play in October and November, writes Nathan Collier, senior malware intelligence analyst, in a company blog post.\n\nUpon analyzing the fake QR scanner app, Malwarebytes found that the malware analyzes a device's location checks with a\u00a0website that provides geo-IP services in order to determine an infected device's location. Malwarebytes believes that it the phone is based in Asia, the malware will then download Android/Trojan.SMS.AsiaHitGroup, a trojan that intercepts SMS text messages.\n\nAsiaHitGroup also contains another hidden APK, Android/Adware.AsiaHitGroup, which is designed to push adware on the victim.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Phishing kits meet $2,100 second hand iPhones on black market, study", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime-meets-physical-crime-on-the-stolen-phone-black-market/article/707392/", "title": "Phishing kits meet $2,100 second hand iPhones on black market, study ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "November 14, 2017", "body": "As Americans begin to worry more\u00a0about cybercrime than the conventional kind, researchers warn users to remain cautious of both, as stolen iPhones are so valuable in criminal circles that they can go for as much as $2,100 in some countries.\u00a0\n\nWhile a Gallup\u00a0study found more Americans worry about hackers stealing their personal information and identity theft than having their vehicle stolen, new research by Trend Micro suggests Americans may want to reprioritize their fears as cybercriminals have found a new use for swiped iPhones.\n\nHowever, the bad guys are not interested in just obtaining an overpriced smartphone, but instead have in place an elaborate scam that will have the phone's former owner willingly giving up all the information needed to not only unlock the phone, but give the criminals access to their iCloud account.\n\nLast year alone 23,000 phones were stolen from the Miami International Airport and the demand for these devices is staggering with even long out of date stolen iPhones going for as much as $2,100 in Eastern European countries, according to a Nov 14 report. At retail Apple's most expensive phone costs $1,149 for the flagship iPhone X with 256 GB of storage in the U.S. to put the markups in perspective. \n\nCybercriminals are stealing the phones, waiting for victims to activate the Find My iPhone services and then sending a phishing email designed to spoof an Apple notification prompting the victim to log in to their iCloud accounts. The thieves then use this information to log into the victim's account and unlock the stolen device so that it can be reused and resold. \n\nResearchers found that thieves will often contract with third-party phishing services to unlock the devices and that they were using tools including MagicApp, Applekit, and Find My iPhone (FMI.php) framework to automate iCloud unlocks.\n\nMany of the providers also offer additional resale services and rent out servers for sending phishing messages. The phishing kits are actively advertised on social media and include full tutorials on how to use them. \n\nSome of the services offer the attackers email notifications which included the victim's IP, HTTP referral, browser user-agent and other information. Kits were also spotted with anti-crawler and AV scanner capabilities.\n\nTo combat these threats, the researchers said users should always apply best practices when securing their mobile devices, enable two factor authentication on iCloud accounts, and set up or enable the device's internal security features.\n\nUsers should also frequently back up their data to mitigate the impact of a device loss and report device's loss or theft to your carrier to deter fraudsters from reusing it.

To the naked eye, the end result doesn't look that convincing, with only the eyes, nose and mouth area exposed, while the remainder of the mask is specially processed in a manner that looks as if it's been cast in plaster or wrapped in white bandages. But it's reportedly enough to trick Face ID, which Apple programmed to\u00a0construct a mathematical representation of a device owner's visage by combining a depth map of his or her face with a 2D infrared image.\n\nCurrently, such an exploit would be too time-consuming, expensive and impractical to use on any kind of massive scale. But in an FAQ web page describing its methodology, Bkav warns that a highly targeted attack could plausibly be levied against an important world leader or corporate leader whose iPhone fell into the wrong hands.\n\nAt the iPhone X's launch event, Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller said that company researchers successfully trained its Face ID neural network to distinguish between real and fake facial images by using masks created by Hollywood make-up artists. But according to the Bkav researchers, the flaw in this strategy is that the masks' designers didn't truly understand how the technology works.\n\n\u201cIt is quite hard to make the \u2018correct' mask without certain knowledge of security. We were able to trick Apple's AI...because we understood how their AI worked and how to bypass it,\u201d the Bkav FAQ page states. \u201cTake the nose of our mask for example: its creation is not complicated at all. We had an artist make it by silicone first. Then, when we found that the nose did not perfectly meet our demand, we fixed it on our own. Then the hack worked.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Bkav researchers reported that designing a mask that fools Face ID was easier than they imagined, as the recognition mechanism is \u201cnot as strict as you think,\u201d with only half a face needed to create a masks that defeats the security measures. \u201cApple has done this not so well,\u201d claims Bkav, suggesting that Apple's rush to market may have resulted in a security feature that was inferior to its predecessor, Touch ID, which required only a fingerprint to unlock a phone.\n\nLast month, Apple disputed claims that it ordered manufacturers to lower the accuracy of its\u00a0face recognition\u00a0to make the iPhone X easier to produce.\n\nSome experts have downplayed the seriousness of Bkav's findings, considering the effort that needs to be put into their method of attack. \u201cDetailed dimensions would have to be taken to create the mask, and the security firm alluded to the fact that they had to use a special material on the mask too,\" said Paul Norris, senior systems engineer, EMEA, at Tripwire, adding, \u201cWhat they didn't disclose was how many attempts and what level of effort it took to get the mask to work flawlessly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0compromise\u00a0Face ID authentication, the attacker would have\u00a0to\u00a0have a detailed map of the face of the user [and] create a mask that would map the exact details of the victim's face,\u201d Norris continued. Furthermore, the attacker would have to avoid scenarios in which the iPhone X does not accept Face ID and requires an Apple passcode to unlock itself \u2013 including after a phone is restarted, after\u00a0five unsuccessful attempts\u00a0at matching a face, and if the device hasn't been unlocked for 48 hours.\n\nAnd of course, any attack of this sort would have to be uniquely tailored to each target. \u201cIt's important\u00a0to\u00a0note that the attacks being talked about are individual \u2018bespoke attacks' that must be built and executed against each victim separately,\u201d said Terry Ray, CTO of\u00a0Imperva. \u201cThis is\u00a0in\u00a0addition\u00a0to\u00a0stealing the individual's phone and getting access\u00a0to\u00a0it before the owner can remotely wipe the device. Is your data so valuable that someone would go\u00a0to\u00a0this effort?\u201d\n\nStill, Ray acknowledged that over time, cybercriminals will only get better at finding ways to defeat the iPhone's X's biometric defenses. Fortunately, anyone who is concerned about this can simply disable the Face ID feature and rely solely on passcodes, he added.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apple/topic/47233/", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "ToastAmigo malware uses new twist to attack Toast overlay vulnerability", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/toastamigo-malware-uses-new-twist-to-attack-toast-overlay-vulnerability/article/706640/", "title": "ToastAmigo malware uses new twist to attack Toast overlay vulnerability", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 09, 2017", "body": "A new malware has been uncovered that uses an updated methodology to abuse the previously patched Android Toast overlay vulnerability, which once installed, can download additional malware as well as use various permissions to access the phone.\n\nThe malware is called ToastAmigo, detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_TOASTAMIGO, and is believed to represent the first observed weaponized use of vulnerability CVE-2017-0752 in Toast, Trend Micro\u00a0mobile threat analyst Lorin Wu reported. This type of attack was shown as possible in a proof of concept earlier this year and Google issued a patch for the flaw in September.\n\nTrend Micro found two apps, disguised as app lockers and both named Smart AppLocker, that are being used to spread ToastAmigo. One of the apps has been downloaded more than 500,000 times (Wu did not say which) as of November 6. The full extent of the malware's capabilities are not known, but it is thought to have ad-clicking, app-installing, and self-protecting/persistence capabilities.\n\nWhat makes using Toast as an attack vector nasty is that it is a totally legitimate function that allows for what are essentially pop-up windows to appear over another open app. In the proof of concept tests that took place earlier this year, Toast was abused when the malicious app overlayed a legitimate-looking screen over a malicious app. The legit screen's clickable icons align with malicious icons located on the \u201cunderneath\u201d app so when the user thought he or she was clicking something safe like \u201cupdate\u201d they were in fact giving the malicious app vital permissions or even downloading more malware.\n\nHowever, this older attack method had to overcome two major hurdles to be effective. It had to request the \u201cdraw on top\u201d permission from the user when installed and could only be installed from Google Play.\n\nToastAmigo does away with these two mitigating factors, making it much more dangerous. Now the malicious app merely has to reside on the phone to function without requiring any user permissions, and the app can be downloaded from sources other than Google Play.\n\nThe fake app lockers that were recently found by Trend Micro used a simple overlay that was placed over the app's actual user interface. Here it asks the user to click a \u201cconfirm\u201d link that is supposed to send the user into the device's setting. Instead the \u201cconfirm\u201d link starts the attack. To keep the victim from becoming worried, the app shows a window indicating that it is being scanned.\n\n\n\nEnd users have few options to protect themselves from ToastAmigo. The most effective step is to ensure the September patch has been downloaded, but otherwise only practicing good mobile device hygiene will be effective.

These phishing pages generally resolve to domains that incorporate the bank's name, in order to further exude credibility.\n\nOnce users enter their information into the phishing page, thereby giving away their information to the cybercriminals, the Marcher phase of the attack begins. The victims are falsely informed via the malicious mobile web page that they do not have their bank's security app installed on their phones, and must download it in order to comply with\u00a0new European Union money laundering guidelines as well as to encrypt sensitive data such as mTan SMS and online banking connections.\n\nIn the case of a fake BankAustria security app used in a Nov. 2 campaign, Proofpoint found that 7 percent of visitors were socially engineered into downloading this so-called \"application,\" which is actually the Marcher banking trojan.\n\nProofpoint further warns that the faux security application asks for a wide range of suspicious permissions that would elevate Marcher's privileges and give it increased control over the infected device. Chief among these is the request to act as\u00a0device administrator.\n\nLater, when the victim opens up a specific banking app, Marcher attacks in its usual manner, by overriding the app's true screen with a fake overlay that imitates the bank and steals the user's credentials information as it's being entered.\n\nIt might seem redundant for the cybercriminals to employ Marcher in this manner if the initial phishing attack already captured the victim's credentials in phase one of the attack. But not so -- because unlike with phishing attacks, Marcher can repeatedly harvest victims' credentials even after they are changed, explained\u00a0Patrick Wheeler, director of threat intelligence at Proofpoint, in an email interview. Moreover, banking trojans like Marcher often target \"multiple banks and financial services, so even if victims turned over credentials for one bank, the trojan may be able to harvest credentials for others as they use their phones,\u201d Wheeler added.\n\nIn what constitutes a third method of attack, the Marcher trojan in this particular case also presented credit card phishing screens when users opened non-banking apps such as the Google Play Store.\n\n\"...As we use mobile devices to access the web and phishing templates extend to mobile environments, we should expect to see a greater variety of integrated threats like the scheme we detail here,\" Proofpoint reports in the blog post. \"As on the desktop, mobile users need to be wary of installing applications from outside of legitimate app stores and sources and be on the lookout for bogus banking sites that ask for more information than users would normally provide on legitimate sites. Unusual domains, the use of URL shorteners, and solicitations that do not come from verifiable sources are also red flags for potential phishing and malware.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Celebgate 3.0?

The lax or absent protection mechanisms which caused the vulnerabilities were caused by deliberate choices made by industry to shortchange security in favor of reducing network delays and increasing data processing speeds, according to the report.\n\n\u201cAny changes to the quantity or quality of equipment affect network configuration, and therefore can degrade network security,\u201d the report said. \u201cKeeping security settings up to date requires special tools for monitoring, analyzing, and filtering messages that cross network boundaries.\u201d\n\nBecause the implementation of any security measures is a network by network task, it's the responsibility of individual mobile operators and the contractors maintaining networks on their behalf to ensure that networks are secure. \n\nThis could pose a threat when additional factors like government are added to the equation such as in the case of smart cities using traffic lights that are networked together using 4G technology. \n\n\"If such a network is hacked and denial of service hits just a few traffic lights, for example, this may lead to road accidents and traffic at a standstill,\" Positive Technologies Head of Research Group for Telecom Security Pavel Novikov said in a press release. \"That is why mobile operators involved in city automation should pay particular attention to methods of preventing network threats.\"\n\nResearchers recommend networks analyze the security of the mobile network and apply measures to protect data from unauthorized access suing tools such as encryption and special instruments for monitoring, analyzing, and filtering of messages that cross network boundaries.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "AI helping drive down Android malware infection ate", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ai-helping-drive-down-android-malware-infection-ate/article/696316/", "title": "AI helping drive down Android malware infection ate", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 28, 2017", "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking off as Google's primary method of detecting malware effecting Android devices and is now detecting more than half of all issues discovered.\n\nThe AI, or machine learning, functionality is installed on 2 billion devices worldwide through Google Play Protect, Google security head Adrian Ludwig told Cyberscoop.

This all changed recently when Trend Micro researchers captured samples of ZNIU, the first malware family designed to exploit the Dirty COW vulnerability. \n\nSince then Trend Micro has exposed how the malware has sprawled.\n\n\u201cOur data also shows that more than 1,200 malicious apps that carry ZNIU were found in malicious websites with an existing rootkit that exploits Dirty COW, disguising themselves as pornography and game apps, among others,\u201d wrote Trend researchers Jason Gu, Veo Zhang, and Seven Shen.\n\nZNIU is a somewhat more discerning piece of malware compared to what the original Dirty Cow vulnerability could have allowed to be created.

Once on board it is able to use its escalation of privileges capability to install a backdoor that will be used for future remote attacks.\n\nThe malware then goes to work on the system harvesting the user's information from the device and then contacting the carrier through an SMS-enabled payment service. This allows the cybercriminal to pose as the device owner.\n\n\u201cThrough the victim's mobile device, the operator behind ZNIU will collect money through the carrier's payment service. In one of our samples, we saw in its code that payments were directed to a dummy company, which, based on network traffic, we were able to locate in a city in China,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nThe transaction amount is kept small, usually about $3 per month, in order to avoid being noticed and as an additional level of protection when the fraudulent transaction is completed ZNIU deletes the message string eliminating that piece of evidence.\n\nOnly victims in China are susceptible as an SMS transaction with the carrier cannot take place outside of that country.

To get a consensus view of the internet's prospects, the organization surveyed 3,000 members, professionals and partners in 160 countries.\n\nAccording to the study, stakeholders worldwide still believe that the internet's benefits will continue to outweigh the risks in the coming years, transforming lives through the efficient delivery of critical services and revolutionizing industries across multiple sectors. But they also sense that the threat is growing, especially as\u00a0businesses create new attack vectors by relying on a growing number of interconnected data sources.\n\n\"Cybersecurity will be the most pressing challenge of the next decade,\" the report states. \"Responses to date have been thoroughly insufficient and the costs are escalating.\" And based on recent precedent, \"...it is not far-fetched to imagine a digital pandemic with attacks crippling entire economies.\"\n\nThe ISOC also expects to see more destructive acts of cyber war, coupled with online disinformation campaigns in an effort to destabilize countries and their economies. However, the organization believes these acts will be perpetrated by not only nation-states, but also \"their surrogates, and by independent political movements and private actors.\"\n\nUltimately, the growth of the internet could largely depend on how well the security community at large responds to attacks, the report cautions. With the stakes so high, some nations may feel compelled to scale back online freedoms and restrict global connectivity in the name of national security, resulting in the creation of \"walled gardens,\" the balkanization of the internet, and the weakening or banishment of encryption technologies. Indeed, ISOC's survey-takers generally said they believe future\u00a0government regulations will be more intrusive and restrictive than they are today.\n\nTo prevent such a scenario, the report calls for \"new accountability, incentive and liability models\" to \"increase cybersecurity readiness and reduce vulnerabilities but also to ensure end-user security.\" The ISOC is also pushing for worldwide, multi-stakeholder collaboration to address these threats, as opposed to fragmented, unilateral efforts.\n\n\"I think there are some major architectural changes which need to take place in the internet,\u00a0and I'd like to see more effort put forward [toward] new innovative architectural changes,\" said Leonard Kleinrock, a renowned computer scientist, considered among the fathers of the internet, in an ISOC webcast panel discussion on Monday.\u00a0\n\nBut even such architectural changes won't necessarily secure the \"edge\" of the internet, where IOT devices reside. This unprotected edge, where you'll find\u00a0devices \"put together by a small company, thrown on your wall with a camera, with a microphone, with access to the internet in a typically unprotected, insecure fashion \u2013\u00a0that's where the penetrations will take place,\" Kleinrock added.\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise then that the ISOC devoted a large section of its report to IoT devices, noting that as we rapidly approach a connected world,\u00a0devices will generate and collect vast amounts of personal user data that nations could potentially leverage to create a surveillance state.\n\nIn addition to seeing even more attacks from threats modeled after the Mirai IoT botnet, \"We may see increased mass surveillance, the further erosion of privacy, and a growing dependence on data collection, analytics, and curation,\" the report states. \"The implications for privacy are profound. Without essential safeguards, greater amounts of data will be collected and used without the user's knowledge or control.\"\n\nISOC has recommended pursuing a collaborative and proactive effort among stakeholders to instill effective IoT safeguards. For instance, device manufacturers and service providers should be taking steps to bake privacy and security into the actual design process, the report suggests, while the insurance industry could do its part by requiring IoT devices to have security certifications before owners of these products can be insured.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump can be exploited to compromise operations", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/medfusion-4000-wireless-syringe-infusion-pump-can-be-exploited-to-compromise-operations/article/689007/", "title": "Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump can be exploited to compromise operations", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "September 15, 2017", "body": "Until a new version of Smiths Medical's Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump is issued in January 2018, its operators should be wary of eight vulnerabilities that can be remotely exploited to gain access to the device and compromise its functionality.\n\nHealth care professionals use the pump in acute care facilities to deliver small doses of medication to patients from a variety of syringe sizes.\n\nCrediting independent researcher Scott Gayou with the bugs' discovery, the ICS-CERT reported\u00a0in an\u00a0advisory\u00a0last week that attackers \"with high skill\" can leverage the flaws to sabotage the pump's communications module and therapeutic module, despite the segmented design of the device.\n\nFound in versions 1.1, 1.5, and 1.6 of the pump, the flaws consist of a buffer overflow in a third-party component (CVE-2017-12718), an out-of-bounds read in a\u00a0third-party component (CVE-2017-12722), the use of hard-coded credentials in the FTP server (CVE-2017-12724) and while automatically establishing a wireless network connection (CVE-2017-12725), improper access control in the pump's FTP server (CVE-2017-12720), use of a hard-coded password by Telnet (CVE-2017-12726), improper certificate validation that can enable a man-in-the-middle attack (CVE-2017-12721),\u00a0and the storage of accessible passwords within the configuration file (CVE-2017-12723).\n\nThe ICS-CERT, which operates within the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), and Plymouth, Minn.-based Smiths Medical have recommended several defensive measures to protect against the threat of an exploit until the new product version 1.6.1 of the pump is released.

And two, because of the highly eclectic and fragmented nature of devices relying on Bluetooth, it could take weeks or months for some product manufacturers to apply software patches, while others may never issue secure updates.\n\n\"Bluetooth is complicated. Too complicated,\" states a technical paper published by IoT security company Armis, whose researchers discovered the eight BlueBorne vulnerabilities on products running on Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows. \"Too many specific applications are defined in the stack layer, with endless replication of facilities and features. These over-complications are a direct result of the immense work and over-engineering that was put into creating the Bluetooth specification.\"\n\n\"The complications in the specifications translate into multiple pitfall junctions in the various implementations of the Bluetooth standard,\" adds Armis, which posits that the complex nature of Bluetooth has dissuaded researchers \"from auditing its implementations at the same level of scrutiny that other highly exposed protocols, and outwards-facing interfaces have been treated with.\"\n\nFor that reason, a large number of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth may yet remain, noted Armis, warning that BlueBorne may be just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn a blog post today, Check Point Software Technologies agreed with the premise that the Bluetooth protocol has been \"discarded and ignored by the research community for years,\" noting that bug hunters may have been misled by two common misconceptions.\n\n\"The first misconception is that Bluetooth cannot be intercepted via the air, the second [is] that it always requires some sort of user interaction,\" the Check Point research team states. Armis disabused the security community of these false notions, after announcing that attackers can leverage BlueBorne flaws to intercept Bluetooth devices' communications and infect them over the air, and that a device's Bluetooth feature only needs to be turned on for such exploits to work.\n\nExperts also pointed out the difficulties of patching vulnerable Bluetooth devices, both on the part of the consumer and the original equipment manufacturers who must implement security updates issued by the OS developer.\n\nFrom the consumer's perspective, \"It's not easy for the average person to ensure their laptop is running the latest OS. Add a dozen IoT enabled devices into the mix, and it becomes nearly impossible to ensure every product and system is patch, especially when patches aren't available for many of these item,\" said\u00a0Mike Buckbee, security engineer at\u00a0Varonis Systems,\u00a0a data protection company focused on insider threats and cyberattacks.\n\nAnd from the OEM's perspective, BlueBorne underscores the\u00a0\"fragmented and forgotten manner in which OS updates and patches are distributed to connected devices,\" continued Buckbee, who predicted that many devices will remain unpatched and vulnerable to BlueBorne \"for years to come.\" (Google and Microsoft have already developed patches for Android and Windows devices, respectively, while Apple resolved the issue with the introduction of iOS 10.)\n\nLeigh-Anne Galloway, cyber security resilience officer at\u00a0Positive Technologies, said that patching efforts will depend on the type of device affected.\n\n\n\n\"While patches for smartphones, laptops and other internet-enabled devices are relatively easy to push out, for\u00a0dumber\u00a0gadgets\u00a0the same can't be said,\" stated Galloway. \"There's a huge number of \u2018things' that rely on Bluetooth to perform their function, like speakers, or computer keyboards and mice. And short of turning them off, there isn't a fix and that is going to leave millions vulnerable.\"\n\nLamar Bailey, director of security research and development with advanced threat, security, and compliance solutions provider\u00a0Tripwire, said manufacturers\u00a0will be distributing patches for months, and that the situation could especially tricky for IoT device-makers.\n\nAccording to Bailey, some of these companies \"will not have patches either because they do not know they are vulnerable, will not know how to patch the issue, or will consider the products out of support and just release new versions... Consumers should look at the devices they own and contact the vendors to see if they are vulnerable. The larger well-established vendors should be putting out information in their support section and contacting registered customers.\u201d\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nDespite the magnitude of BlueBorne,\u00a0Mike Weber, VP of labs at\u00a0IT audit and compliance firm\u00a0Coalfire, suggested that the resulting outcry may be somewhat of an overreaction. \"While the research discusses the possibility of worm-style attacks being possible in the wild, there are no currently known instances of this actually occurring and the difficulty level of writing a single worm to impact all devices would be high,\" said Weber.\n\nWeber also noted that BlueBorne \"can only be used against devices within the effective Bluetooth range of the attacker, which is 33 feet on average in mobile phones and headsets, and 328 feet on average in laptops and desktops.\" However, it must be noted that infected devices, in theory, can be compromised to launch more attacks on other devices within their range, creating a chain reaction of additional infections.\n\nBoth Buckbee and Galloway said that the BlueBorne disclosure is a key lesson for manufacturers to start approaching security from within.\n\n\"We've gotten the IoT wake-up call loud and clear and now it's up to manufacturers to heed the warning and bake in security into their products before jumping in feet first with the latest connected devices,\" said Buckbee.\n\n\u201cLong term, the answer is that if any device can connect to another in any way, it needs to have security built in from the outset or hackers are going to take advantage of it,\" concurred Galloway.\n\nAnd consumers must do their part as well by stay up-to-date with patches and using Bluetooth responsibly.\n\n\"Bluetooth should be treated like any open port: if you do not need it, then turn it off,\" said Bailey. \"That may not always be easy with Bluetooth keyboards and mice/trackpads, but in situations where non-employees are within 40 feet of systems, like banks at teller windows, it is best to use wired input devices and not reply on Bluetooth.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/zero-day/topic/49474/", "topic_name": "Zero Day"}]}, {"news_name": "More BankBot apps sneak into Google store; UAE banks added to malware's targets", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/more-bankbot-apps-sneak-into-google-store-uae-banks-added-to-malwares-targets/article/688379/", "title": "More BankBot apps sneak into Google store; UAE banks added to malware's targets", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "September 13, 2017", "body": "The Google Play store once again has been invaded with apps carrying BankBot Android banking malware that uses fake overlay screens to fool banking app users into giving away their credentials.

The device simply has to have its Bluetooth feature turned on, which for most products is the default setting.\n\nEven worse, compromised devices can then be further leveraged to attack additional nearby systems over the air, including any segregated or air-gapped devices that happen to be\u00a0Bluetooth-enabled. \"Basically, it's an airborne delivery method or attack vector that could be very easily abused,\" said Nadis Izrael, CTO and co-founder of Armis, in an interview with SC Media.\n\nDubbed BlueBorne, the collection of vulnerabilities \u2013\u00a0eight in total, three of which are critical \u2013 was discovered by researchers from Internet of Things security company Armis. The flaws potentially impact at least 5.3 billion Bluetooth-enabled devices, including computers, smartphones, and IoT devices such as watches, smart TVs, and some automobile systems.\n\n\u201cThese silent attacks are invisible to traditional security controls and procedures. Companies don't monitor these types of device-to-device connections in their environment, so they can't see these attacks or stop them,\u201d said Yevgeny Dibrov, CEO of Armis, in a company\u00a0press release. \u201cThe research illustrates the types of threats facing us in this new connected age.\u201d\n\nBecause phones compromised via BlueBorne bugs can quickly infect nearby devices over the air, attacks can quickly spread like wildfire, creating potentially unprecedented scenarios. Michael Parker,\u00a0VP of marketing at Armis, used the\u00a0WannaCry\u00a0ransomware attack as an example. \"You had WannaCry. Now imagine WannaCry 'Blue,'\" said Parker to SC Media. \"It is ransomware that is spread through Bluetooth...It can spread from device to device, unnoticed by current security measures, locking down smartphones, desktops, laptops, and it can't be stopped by traditional methods.\" Or, the attacker could stay under radar, perhaps delivering botnet malware that \"just lays and waits to be activated\" at just the right moment.\n\nBetween April and August 2017, Armis researchers contacted Apple, Google, Linux, and Microsoft Corporation to disclose the various BlueBorne vulnerabilities. In response, Google has developed a patch for Android 6 and 7 devices, and has notified its manufacturing partners of the update.\n\nMicrosoft announced today that it released a security update back in July that addressed BlueBorne vulnerabilities in devices running on all supported Windows versions. (Windows Phones were not impacted by the flaws.) \"...Customers who have Windows Update enabled and applied the security updates, are protected automatically,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told SC Media via email. \"We updated to protect customers as soon as possible, but as a responsible industry partner, we withheld disclosure until other vendors could develop and release updates.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe Linux kernel security team has confirmed that it will release a patch as well, but there is confirmation on when this will happen.\n\nAnd Apple is well ahead of the game, as the specific BlueBorne vulnerability that Armis researchers discovered in iOS was actually fixed with the distribution of version 10 of the mobile operating system. However, any\u00a0devices running on iOS versions 9.3.5 and earlier, as well as AppleTV devices using version 7.2.2 or lower, remain vulnerable.\n\nArmis lists the eight vulnerabilities as follows:\n\nThe Android\u00a0information leak bug is located\u00a0in the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) server, which enables a device to identify other Bluetooth services in its vicinity. According to an Armis blog post published today, the flaw \"enables the attacker to send a set of crafted requests to the server, causing it to disclose memory bits in response.\" This data can then be leveraged to defeat a device's security measures, exploit RCE vulnerabilities, take over the device, and break Bluetooth encryption in order to eavesdrop on communications.\n\nThe two Android RCE flaws\u00a0reside, respectively, in the Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) service (which enables tethering) and the\u00a0Personal Area Networking (PAN) profile, which exists within BNEP. In both cases, attackers can exploit these errors to create a memory corruption that allows them to run code on the device.\n\nThe Android Bluetooth Pineapple vulnerability also exists within the PAN profile, and allows attackers to intercept traffic between Bluetooth devices as well as impersonate a legitimate Bluetooth device with which a victim is attempting to communicate. This is possible, the Armis blog post explains, because the vulnerability allows bad actors \"to create a malicious network interface on the victim's device, re-configure IP routing and force the device to transmit all communication through the malicious network interface.\"\u00a0\n\nA second, similar vulnerability in\u00a0the Bluetooth stack, referred to as the\u00a0Bluetooth Pineapple in Windows,\u00a0affects both Android and Windows devices.\u00a0The Pineapple flaws are named so when exploited, the impacted devices essentially behave like a Wi-Fi Pineapple\u00a0wireless penetration testing tool that's conducting a man-in-the-middle attack. But unlike a WiFi-based MITM scenario, this attack does not require any special equipment or a connection request from the targeted device to pull off.\n\nThe first of two BlueBorne vulnerabilities found in Linux devices consists of an information leak vulnerability \u2013 similar to the Android data leak bug\u00a0\u2013 in the user space process of the Bluetooth stack. \"When the process receives a response which is too long, it stores the excess part without proper validation. This can be used by an attacker to anticipate the process' activity and expose sensitive data it withholds,\" the Armis blog post explains.\n\nThe second Linux flaw is a stack overflow within the BlueZ\u00a0kernel\u00a0that causes a memory corruption that attackers can exploit to gain full control of the affected device.\n\nFinally, the Apple vulnerability that was patched with iOS 10 was an RCE bug in the Low Energy Audio Protocol (LEAP), a new protocol for streaming audio to certain peripheral devices. The flaw allows attackers to gain control of a drive via a memory corruption that's triggered by a crafted audio command.\n\nArmis researchers Ben Seri and Gregory Vishnepolsky are specifically credited with discovering the BlueBorne bugs.

The issue was brought Google's attention by Palo Alto on May 30, 2017 and the fix was included with the September 5 Android Security Bulletin. However, the patch must be deployed by users.\n\nThe starting point for this attack has the malicious actor spoofing the device owner into enabling the Android Accessibility Service and granting them device administrator privilege by changing what the victim sees on the display. This is usually accomplished through a clickjacker overlay attack. \n\nThe Toast overlay is a powerful and useful tool for the perpetrators as it has several built in abilities that can be co-opted. \n\n\u201cThe Toast overlay is typically used to display a quick message over all other apps. For example, a message indicating that an e-mail has been saved as draft when a user navigates away without sending an e-mail. It naturally inherits all configuration options as for other windows types. However, our research has found using the Toast window as an overlay window allows an app to write over the interface of another App without requesting the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW privilege this typically requires,\u201d Unit 42 said.\n\nAndroid versions 7.0 and earlier are vulnerable due to a missing permissions and operation check. Normally an overlay requires both, but with TYPE_TOAST neither check is in place and the request is just granted. \n\nTwo layers of protection are included in version 7.1, but these can be defeated. The layers include a timeout and only allowing a single layer to be used at a time. However, the single-layer protection is defeated with a LooperThread to continuously show a Toast window, this also confuses the timeout feature because with layers continuously appearing it cannot tell if it has been clicked.\n\nAndroid 8.0, the newest, is fully protected.\n\nOnce the attacker as administrative rights it can install an app allowing that person to lock the device screen, reset the PIN, wipe the data and prevent the user from uninstalling the app.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "DJI implements bug bounty program", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/dji-implements-bug-bounty-program/article/685223/", "title": "DJI implements bug bounty program", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "August 30, 2017", "body": "Drone maker DJI has launched a bug bounty program offering rewards ranging from $100 to $30,000 to those who find, disclose and remediate issues affecting the security of DJI's software.\n\nHackers and drone enthusiasts have been able to jailbreak the drone's software enabling the devices to circumvent built in restrictions, such as elevation limits and speed.

Affected device owners became infected after they downloaded malware-tainted apps, including roughly 300 found in the Google Play Store.\n\nIn emailed comments, Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, called WireX \"particularly significant\" because it's \"one of a handful of Android mobile device botnets used for DDoS attacks.\"\n\nWireX\u00a0first stirred to life on Aug. 2, as the botnet conducted minor DDoS tests that generally went unnoticed. According to data compiled from various sources, it was around Aug. 7 that the attacks began using larger numbers of devices, with more prolonged attacks beginning on Aug. 15. At their peak, the attacks leveraged anywhere from 70,000 to 120,000 unique IP addresses per hour in order to generate malicious traffic.\n\nMost of the malicious traffic generated in the attacks was produced via HTTP GET requests, with some variants of Android Clicker issuing POST requests. \"The attacks were in the range of 1.1 million well-formed HTTP/HTTPS requests per minute,\" said\u00a0Tim April, senior security architect at Akamai Technologies, in an email interview.\n\nAt this point, security researchers were well aware of the threat and had begun noticing distinctive attack signatures. Around Aug. 17, experts from\u00a0Akamai,\u00a0Cloudflare,\u00a0Flashpoint, Google, Oracle Dyn,\u00a0RiskIQ, Team Cymru, and other unnamed organizations banded together to share data on the attacks and launch a counteroffensive. Of this group,\u00a0Akamai, Cloudflare, Flashpoint, and RiskIQ later collaborated on a joint blog post describing the WireX attack and subsequent investigation.\n\n\"The group had a real-time feed of attack targets and attack signatures that it was able to share with targeted organizations. Members of the group worked with the targets whenever possible to help them mitigate the attacks,\" said Justin Paine, head of trust and safety at Cloudflare, in an email interview. Paine noted that the targets were primarily companies providing hospitality, gambling, pornography, and domain name registrar services.\n\nThe group also informed Google that the malware was found in applications that were available in its app store, including media and video players, ringtone apps, and storage management tools. Generally, device owners wouldn't even realize something was amiss with the apps, which appeared benign despite their frequent communications with command-and-control servers and execution of DDoS attacks, sometimes even while running in the background.\n\nGoogle quickly took action to remove those offenders. \"We identified approximately 300 apps associated with the issue, blocked them from the Play Store, and we're in the process of removing them from all affected devices,\" the company asserted in a statement that was included in the joint blog post.\n\nTo further minimize the botnet's impact, \"We also passed information to ISPs and network operators about confirmed infected DDoS bots on their networks,\"\u00a0said Allison Nixon, director of security research at Flashpoint, in an email interview.

The document has already taken a picture from the victim's Facebook page and created a dynamic landing page which looks like a playable movie.\n\n\u201cWhen the victim clicks on the fake playable movie, the malware redirects them to a set of websites which enumerate their browser, operating system and other vital information. Depending on their operating system they are directed to other websites,\u201d said Jacoby.\n\nHe added that the malware works in both Windows and MacOS, and is browser independent. \n\n\u201cWhat I noticed during my research was that when changing the User-Agent header (browser information) the malware redirects you to different landing pages. For example, when using Firefox I was redirected to a website displaying a fake Flash Update notice, and then offered a Windows executable. The executable is flagged as adware,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that when using Chrome, he was redirected to a website which mimics the layout of YouTube, even including the YouTube logo. The website then displays a fake error message tricking the user to download a malicious Google Chrome extension from the Google Web Store. He said that the Chrome Extension is a Downloader, which means that it downloads a file to a victim's computer. \u201cAt the time of writing, the file which should have been downloaded was not available,\u201d said Jacoby.\n\nJacoby said that the campaign is unique in that it also uses Google Docs, with customised landing pages. \u201cAs far as I can see no actual malware (Trojans,\u00a0exploits) are being downloaded but the people behind this are most likely making a lot of money in ads and getting access to a lot of Facebook accounts.\u201d\n\nHe said that the initial spreading mechanism seems to be Facebook Messenger, but how it actually spreads via Messenger is still unknown.\n\n\u201cIt may be from stolen credentials,\u00a0hijacked browsers\u00a0or\u00a0clickjacking.\u00a0At the moment, we are not sure because this research is still ongoing,\u201d said Jacoby.\n\nHe warned users not to click on random links sent by friends on Facebook.\n\nChris Doman, security researcher at AlienVault, told SC Media UK that attacks like this are not uncommon as previous Javascript\u00a0worms have spread these messages to all Facebook contacts. \u201cIt seems as though the final payload of this attack is Adware, which is well detected by most anti-virus vendors,\u201d he said.\n\nMark James, security specialist at ESET, told SC Media UK that even if you think you know the sender you should always be very weary of links in messages. They are often shortened so will give you no clue as to their destination.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world double check with the sender through an alternative contact method.

And worse, these paid apps don't actually do what they claim to do.\"\n\nAs for Android systems, Malwarebytes has observed a 137.8 increase in screen locker ransomware from Q1 to Q2.\u00a0Fortunately, said Reed, Google is introducing new protections into its forthcoming Android Oreo operating system, that will makes render many screen lockers ineffective.\u00a0\u201cOne of the big features of Android Oreo is it's going to prevent apps from taking over the screen, so that will really address the screen locker issue in large part,\u201d said Reed.\n\nIn the first half of 2017, three malware families, Jisut and SLocker\u00a0and\u00a0Koler, compromised nearly 95 percent of ransomware detected on Malwarebytes-protected Android devices, with Jisut alone making up 60 percent of detections. \"These threats are typically distributed to Android mobile users masked as fake software updates or they are bundled in infected applications,\" the report explains.\n\nAndroid malware detections in general increased 5.5 percent from Q1 to Q2, largely to due to an increase in the detection of trojans, which can include ransomware, banking malware and backdoor programs. Trojans were responsible for 48.4 percent of Malwarebytes' Android malware detections in the first half of the year, with PUPs comprising another 47.1 percent of detections over the same time period.\n\nIn its report, Malwarebytes said it foresees an increase in hidden advertising and click fraud malware in 2018, as well as a rise in ransomware actually introduces legitimate encryption functionality into their attacks. \"Most ransomware on Android has not used encryption, but... that will change in order for attackers to keep their revenue stream active,\" the report states.\n\n\"This really just follows ransomware's similar evolution on Windows,\" Reed added.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apple/topic/47233/", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}]}, {"news_name": "Malicious replacement touchscreens could completely compromise phones, researchers demonstrate", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malicious-replacement-touchscreens-could-completely-compromise-phones-researchers-demonstrate/article/684016/", "title": "Malicious replacement touchscreens could completely compromise phones, researchers demonstrate", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 24, 2017", "body": "Mobile users who substitute their damaged phone touchscreens or other hardware components with third-party replacements could be infecting their phones with malicious components that could allow attackers to completely compromise the device.\n\nIndeed, after installing a replacement touchscreen containing a malicious microcontroller on a Huawei Nexus 6P smartphone, researchers Omer Shwartz, Amir Cohen, Asaf Shabtai, and Yossi Oren from Israel's\u00a0Ben-Gurion University of the Negev proved they could perform a \"touch injection attack\" that records, exfiltrates, or injects touch events on a device, as well as a buffer overflow attack that lets the attacker execute arbitrary code within the privileged kernel.\n\nIn their research paper, which was publicly presented this month at a Canadian security conference, the researchers explain that combining these two techniques allowed them to conduct end-to-end attacks on the phone, including:\u00a0maliciously installing software and apps into a device, taking a picture of the phone's user and exfiltrating the image via email,\u00a0replacing a hand-typed URL with a phishing URL, and recording and exfiltrating the user's screen unlock pattern to an online whiteboard website. Worst of all, the researchers revealed that they could perform an attack that completely \"compromises the phone, disables SELinux, and opens a reverse shell to a remote attacker.\"\n\nThe root cause of the problem, according to the research paper, is that third-party driver source code to support hardware components such as touchscreens is \"integrated into the vendor's source code,\" and the \"component driver's source code implicitly assumes that the component hardware is authentic and trustworthy,\" regardless of who supplies it. Consequently, there are very few integrity checks performed on communications between the phone processor and the component, allowing attackers to capitalize on this deficiency.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability and protect phones from malicious touchscreens, the researchers suggest implementing an I2C interface proxy firewall.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Android Oreo includes new Google Play Protect security feature", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/android-oreo-announces-improved-security-features/article/683905/", "title": "Android Oreo includes new Google Play Protect security feature", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "August 23, 2017", "body": "Google's Android Oreo includes new security features designed to protect users' devices and data from malicious apps with a host of new security features. \n\nThe eight major version of Android now includes Google Play Protect which scans more than 50 billion applications per day on more than a billion devices and will be available for devices running version 4.2 or later.

While not all of the apps ultimately possessed the spyware functionality, they could have, had the SDK administrators at any time initiated a download of the malicious plug-in. This technique is how the malware's authors were able to evade detection in the first place and wind up in apps sold in Google's store. (Google confirmed Lookout's account to SC Media.)\n\nIgexin is not a new threat. Symantec Corporation, for instance, has labelled the SDK a potentially unwanted app (PUA) since early 2015 because of its suspicious permissions and its ability to download secondary code. However, this is the first time Igexin is known to have downloaded spyware specifically designed to collect and exfiltrate a user's phone record logs, including specific call times and phone numbers. \"That function [took Igexin] from potentially unwanted to really unwanted,\" said\u00a0Mike\u00a0Murray, VP of security intelligence at Lookout, in an interview with SC Media.\n\nIn the course of their investigation, which took place from June through August, Lookout researchers found that Igexen was primarily targeting Chinese developers of apps specializing in teen-friendly games, weather forecasts, Internet radio, photo editing, education, health and fitness, emojis and home video capabilities. One teen-oriented game alone was downloaded between 50 million and 100 million times.\n\nLookout noted in its blog post that it was not these app developers' intention to spy on users, \"nor are they in control or even aware of the malicious payload that may subsequently execute. Instead, the invasive activity initiates from an Igexin-controlled server.\"\u00a0But by including the Igexin SDK, these apps were essentially used as trojans to deliver spyware code to their own customers, Murray explained.\n\nDespite the fact that Igexin has garnered a reputation as a PUA, Murray said that the average app developer, which might rely on 10 or more SDKs, cannot be blamed for failing to recognize Igenix's hidden functionality.\u00a0\"It's unreasonable to expect then to reserve-engineer any piece of code that comes from a trusted third party,\" said Murray. Lookout's blog post further notes that the discovery of Igexin's spyware capabilities required a \"deep analysis of the apps' and ad SDK's behavior by our researchers... Not only is the functionality not immediately obvious, it could be altered at any time on the remote server,\" perhaps to include even more intrusive features.\n\nLookout's investigation intensified after its researchers observed an affected app downloading large encrypted files after first communicating with an endpoint known for its use by Igexin. According to Lookout, this sort of activity is indicative of an app attempting to download and execute malicious code after a clean version of that program is initially installed by the user. \"They're actually trying to evade detection, they're trying not to get caught, which tells you something,\" said Murray.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}]}, {"news_name": "New version of Faketoken Android banking trojan records calls, targets transportation apps", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/new-version-of-faketoken-android-banking-trojan-records-calls-targets-transportation-apps/article/682427/", "title": "New version of Faketoken Android banking trojan records calls, targets transportation apps", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 17, 2017", "body": "A mobile banking trojan known for using malicious overlays to trick financial app users into giving away their credentials has evolved further to target travel, transportation and traffic ticket payment apps, as well as record phone calls.\n\nAccording to a Kaspersky Lab Securelist blog post on Thursday, a newly discovered version of the Faketoken Android malware called Faketoken.q monitors an infected device's calls and launched apps. When calls are made to or received from certain numbers, the malware records them and sends the file to the attackers.\n\nAdditionally, when certain targeted apps are opened, Faketoken.q will display a fake\u00a0user interface where victims are encouraged to enter their data, which can later be used to initiate fraudulent transactions.\u00a0The trojan can even steal incoming SMS codes that banks send to users for security purposes in order to authorize said transactions.\n\nIn order to look more credible, the fraudulent app interfaces feature the same color schemes as the genuine app being imitated; however, certain obvious formatting mistakes suggest that the sample Kaspersky analysts observed is still an unfinished test version. The fact that Kaspersky has not seen a large amount of attacks using this trojan supports this theory.\n\nTargeted apps include Android Pay, the Google Play Store, and programs for paying traffic tickets and booking flights, taxis and hotel rooms. A successful attack against any of these apps could be especially damaging, considering that they all give customers the option of linking to a bank card for payment purposes, and in some cases actually require this, Kaspersky notes in its blog post, authored by\u00a0research development team lead\u00a0Victor Chebyshev.\n\nSpecifically, the malware is focused on Russian-speaking users, as indicated by the use of Russian language on the user interface. (There is also Russian in the code itself.) Additionally, the traffic ticket app that Kaspersky references as a target applies to tickets issued by the Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety, a division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.\n\nKaspersky analysts suspect that the adversaries behind this campaign are using bulk SMS messages as their attack vector, prompting victims to download a supposed picture file that in reality is the Faketoken.q. The first stage of the trojan is an an obfuscated dropper, which decrypts and launches an encrypted second file containing DAT extensions, which serves as the main payload.\n\nThe first known version of Faketoken was discovered over a year ago. Originally, the trojan was designed to intercept transaction authentication numbers during financial transactions and later added malicious overlays for roughly 2,000 financial apps, the blog post reports, noting that this latest version maintained the malicious overlays, but \"simplified them considerably.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Top 10 Security Challenges for 2017", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/top-10-security-challenges-for-2017/article/682314/", "title": "Top 10 Security Challenges for 2017", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "August 17, 2017", "body": "The first half of 2017 has not exactly been a ride in the park for cybersecurity professionals. \n\nSome of the highlight events so far this year have been the Shadow Brokers regularly dumping NSA hacking tools for public consumption, cybercriminals then using these shiny new toys to run amok producing WannaCry and NotPetya and most recently HBO being threatened with having its hottest show unveiled early unless a $6 million ransom is paid.\n\nSo will the last few months of 2017 see a continued level of activity or will things calm down as the bad guys take off for the holidays? SC Media asked some of the top executives in the field for what they see as the biggest threats and problems that will be faced in the next few months. This will be a living list with more threats being added as they appear.\n\n1. Malware with worm capabilities \n\nJerome Segura - Lead malware intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes\n\nWannacry shocked the world by its rapid spread and this wouldn't have been possible without its worm component. It reminded us of how quickly malware can propagate with devastating effects. Sadly, other malware authors have realized it also and are starting to add worm capabilities to their malware, such as recently with the Trickbot banking trojan.\n\n\n\n2. Release of more Shadow Brokers tools\n\nJeff Schilling - Chief Security Officer at \u200eArmor\n\nEternalBlue and DoublePulsar, the critical component of the WannaCry worm are potentially just the tip of the iceberg of what may be coming from the Shadow Brokers.\u00a0 These sophisticated tools, in the hands of a less than a sophisticated adversary, had massive global impact.\u00a0 Expect more to come.\n\n3. Getting back to basics (patching, endpoint, hygiene)\n\nMatt Pascucci\u00a0- Cybersecurity Practice Manager at CCSI\u00a0\n\nThis is the biggest issue of the year and the malware has shown just how easy it is to comprise systems.\n\n4. The vulnerability of mobile carriers\n\n\u00a0Elad Yoran - Executive Chairman of KoolSpan\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly one of the more important security challenges facing us today is the growing realization that the carrier networks that transport the world's voice and data communications are systemically vulnerable to interception and monitoring. Hackers, terrorist organizations, foreign governments and others take advantage of these internetworking protocols and exploit them on a regular basis from anywhere around the world.\n\n5. Stop overwhelming clients with alerts!\n\nBen Herzberg, head of application security research at Imperva \n\nSecurity controls generate a lot of alerts that can easily overwhelm an organization. In large organizations such as banks, it is common to have over 100,000 security alerts per day.\u00a0 As you can imagine, this requires a battalion of security engineers and analysts to sort through.\n\n6. Adapting the firewall to face new threats\n\nJody Brazil, co-founder and chief product strategist, FireMon\n\n\u201cThe evolution of the firewall is not complete. Networking technology is changing rapidly and the firewall will have to adapt. Cloud, SDN and containers threaten the traditional role of the firewall. The traditional network segmentation is being replaced with very flat networks - which removes a lot of network complexity, but introduces a significant challenge to the firewall.\n\n7. Monitoring Cloud Configuration and Security\n\nTim Erlin, Vice President, product management and strategy at Tripwire\n\nOrganizations continue to adopt cloud technologies at a rapid rate, but information security isn't keeping up. There have been discovered misconfigurations leading to data leaks, but for every one of these found, there are likely many more that aren't published. With a rapid rate of technological change, huge variation of skills, and fast paced adoption, it's clear that monitoring cloud assets and infrastructure will continue to be a challenge.\u00a0 \n\n8. High Impact Attacks\n\nLimor Kessem - executive security advisor at IBM Security \n\nThinking about the biggest challenges for the remainder of the year, the one that stands out the most to me is \u201cimpact.\u201d No one can deny the destructive effect of attacks we encountered this year so far, from Shamoon v2, to WannaCry, and NotPetya, the world witnessed the power of malicious code at its highest impact to date. For the rest of year, organizations cannot ignore the overall increasing risk of highly advanced leaked code which has been used widely against organizations of all types and sizes and spreads quickly without discrimination. These attacks have shown us that it's not just simply an organizations customer data, trade secrets, or finances that are at stake \u2013 entire operations have been shut down with devastating effects on business, employees and end users. \n\n9. The Insider Threat\n\nItsik Mantin - head of data security research at Imperva\n\nSimilar to previous years, many of the breaches seen in the last year were not the result of hackers penetrating the organization and stealing data from it, but employees and third-parties that have access to sensitive data for the sake of their work, that in some cases steal the data, where in other cases leak it by sending it accidentally to unauthorized recipients. The challenge with data breaches involving insiders and third-parties is double. Not only do the attackers have much more inside info than an external attacker, but since no malware is involved and no penetration happens through the organization perimeter, many of the common security mechanisms, like firewalls and anti-viruses, become blind to these attacks happening.\n\n10. Operationalizing GDPR\n\nChris Olson - CEO of The Media Trust \u00a0\n\nThe EU's pending data protection regulation ushers in a world of change for enterprise security teams. Beyond identifying and documenting data elements and data collection activity, IT and security professionals will join forces with privacy, risk and compliance officers to operationalize data governance policies. Implementation of compliance mechanisms to ensure data protection policies--including data unknowingly collected by third parties from everyday website operations--are actively monitored and enforced will be a key focus leading up to May 2018.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud-security/topic/49913/", "topic_name": "Cloud Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacking/topic/47220/", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/insider-threat/topic/52185/", "topic_name": "Insider Threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "SMEs ahead of larger orgs in IoT security, study", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/smes-ahead-of-larger-orgs-in-iot-security-study/article/681446/", "title": "SMEs ahead of larger orgs in IoT security, study", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "August 11, 2017", "body": "When it comes to Internet of Things (IoT) security, size really does matter, though bigger isn't necessarily better \u2013 as it turns out small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are better prepared to handle the threats posed by IoT.\n\nSMEs may not have the resources of their larger peers but they're training them on identifying threats and determining the potential dangers connected devices pose, according to a study of 950 professionals conducted by Pwnie Express.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit counterintuitive, because large companies have the finances and the people to secure their connected devices and critical infrastructure, but smaller operations are doing more with less,\u201d said\u00a0Pwnie\u00a0Express CEO Paul Paget. \u201cThat said, it is clear that the introduction of IoT into the enterprise is challenging the status quo of IT security across the board.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cIs Bigger Better\u201d study found that 41 percent of security pros in larger companies \u2013 those with more than 1,000 employees \u2013 didn't know the types of attacks launched against their IoT devices over the last year compared to 25 percent of their counterparts at SMEs.\n\nSmaller companies have a better fix on the number of devices on their networks \u2013 62 percent of the SMEs versus 47 percent of larger companies \u2013 as well as how many employees own (SMEs at 39 percent edged out larger enterprises who weighed in at 25 percent).\n\n\u201cIt's one thing to say you are ready, but we believe you can't really be ready if you don't know what connected devices are coming into your office,\u201d said Paget.
