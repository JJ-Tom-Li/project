As part of the inauguration CYBERUK security conference, National Cyber Security Center, NCSC, launched a new framework yesterday which comprises of 6 levels.The levels start from a minor individual attack and led all the way up to a huge catastrophic attack on the infrastructure of United Kingdom. Once the attack is identified, the NCSC\u2019s team will use the new framework to not only classify the attack but will also use the appropriate resources and deal with the attack based on its strength.The NCSC director of operations, Paul Chichester says that, \u201cThis new joint approach, developed in partnership with UK law enforcement, will strengthen the UK\u2019s ability to respond to the significant, growing and diverse cyber threats we face. The new system will offer an improved framework for dealing with incidents, especially as GDPR and the NIS Directive come into force shortly.\u201dThe categories of the attack range from one to six and are based upon the impact and the strength.During an attack such as level 6, NCSC will lead the response directly and will not only provide on-site support but will also provide remote analysis of the attack, The highest level of attack is level 1 and is a \u201cNational cyber emergency\u201d- this type of attack will disrupt infrastructures such as the power grid, hospitals, utilities and according to NCSC head Ciaran Martin- UK will face such an attack sooner or later.Ciaran Martin claims that the consequences of a category one attack will include \u201csevere economic or social consequences or to loss of life.\u201dThe framework made by the NCSC is as follows:Defined as: A cyber-attack which causes sustained disruption of UK essential services or affects UK national security, leading to severe economic or social consequences or to loss of life.Who Responds? : Immediate, rapid and coordinated cross-government response. Strategic leadership from Ministers / Cabinet Office (COBR), tactical cross-government coordination by NCSC, working closely with Law EnforcementWhat Do They Do: Coordinated on-site presence for evidence gathering, forensic acquisition and support.

There were many other videos too that were defaced.Who Are The Hackers?The group behind the hack calls itself as Prosox and Kuroi\u2019sh. They changed the official Vevo\u2019s image with a gang of masked individuals carrying guns (an image from Casa De Papel, a Netflix show).Reports say that the account was pretty easy to hack as there was no proper security on this account, including a lack of two-factor authorization. This is because most corporate accounts do not use such security as it can make it difficult to run a page.Which Other Music Videos Were Compromised?Following the removal of Despacito, there was a chain of defacing music videos which included a few of Shakira\u2019s music videos, and videos from other singers including Drake, Selena Gomez, Key Perry and even Taylor Swift.

People over the age of 60 are increasingly vulnerable to online scams according to Santander and so they decided to take the over 60s back to school and launched a SAS, Scam Avoidance School to help older people avoid scams and handle this cyber terror.Santander carried out a research amongst people in this age group to figure out what scares them the most when it comes to fraud attacks and scams. They even took help from the expert Dr. Paul Seager who is a Psychology Professor at Lancashire University.This Scam Avoidance School has been designed especially for people over 60s and was rolled out across all of the Santander\u2019s 806 branches last month and asked their staff to deliver which led to \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of people over the age of 60 to book for this course.The lessons SAS School give require interactive studies and even a handout that the people can take away. The handout covers the tricks that scammers use to attract people towards them and the handout even tells them how to spot an email or a text that might be a con. These lessons even cover cashpoint fraud and contactless fraud that the research proved was the main concern for people over 60s.Former Strictly Come Dancing Head Judge, Len Goodman age 73 was the first graduate of Santanders SAS. He not only wanted to do all that he can for people over the age of 60 but he also wanted them to recognize the tricks scammers use. Len Goodman was the first to sign up to this School and had a personal experience of fraud as well, when his daughter-in-law lost \u00a316,000 to these scammers.Santanders research revealed that 64% of people over the age of 60 are worried about the threat of fraud and 53% of people above the age of 60 have been targeted by these scammers. What makes these older people highly susceptible is that they were vulnerable due to a disability or illness (74%), some are financially unaware (54%) and some are left on their own (37%).Those who had fallen into the scam admitted to being ill at the time and Age UK figures shows that those who got defrauded are 2.5 times more likely to either go into residential care or die within a year.The head of fraud strategy at Santander UK, Chris Ainsley commented saying that, \u201c\u201cOur SAS has been developed to address the fact that more needs to be done to help older people who may be vulnerable to falling victim to fraudsters and scammers.

A few hours after, the videos were changed back to their original state.All the artists targeted by the hacker run their YouTube account via Vevo, a multinational video-hosting service established in 2009.

A threat researcher Nick Biasini who works at Cisco\u2019s Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group said in a blog published on Tuesday that \u201cThere have been several incidents in multiple countries which includes some specifically targeting critical infrastructure and have involved the misuse of the Smart Install Protocol.\u201dHe further added saying that as a result of this hacking they are now taking an active stance and are urging customers once again about the \u201celevated risk and available remediation paths\u201d on the Cisco router.On Saturday evening, Cisco claimed that those postings were a tool to help their clients identify the vulnerabilities and learn how to repel a cyber-attack. Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, Iran\u2019s IT Minister posted a picture on twitters which contained the US Flag and the hacker messages and added saying that it is still not clear who carried out the attack.Azari-Jahromi claims that the attack mainly affected India, Europe and the United States as reported by the state.

She even noticed that many of the files on her desktop had been renamed with \u201cimsorry\u201d and \u201cweapologize\u201d extensions.Amanda immediately called the citys chief information security officer to report this unusual problem and left a message. The next call she made was to the help desk and they left her on hold for a while. Amanda soon realized that she wasn\u2019t the only one in the office with this computer problem.These computer problems were all part of a very sophisticated \u201cransomware\u201d cyber-attack on the City of Atlanta. This cyber-attack lasted for two weeks and has yet to be resolved completely. During that time of 2 weeks the metropolis struggled to recover the encrypted data from the employees computers and to restore the services on the municipal Web site.The cyber-criminals at first gave the city only a week to pay a fine of $51,000 in crypto-currency bitcoin to get the key for decrypting their data. This deadline came and went last week however several services still remain offline. Since the website are still knocked off this suggests that the city did not pay the required ransom and when the City Officials were contacted by Scientific American, they refuse to comment.The Department of Watershed Management is still not able to accept online payments for water or sewage bills or any calls; neither can the Department of Finance issue any business licenses through their web page. Even the Atlanta Municipal Court is not able to process any ticket payments online as well as in person due to this outage and they had to reschedule their hearings.According to Anne Torres, Atlanta\u2019s director of communications, Atlanta city took down two of their online services voluntarily for security measures and these services are the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport\u2019 Wi-Fi network and also the took down the ability to process service requests through the citys 311 Web page portal. Both have been restored on Tuesday Morning with the Wi-Fi back on.The ransomeware that attacked Atlanta is called SamSam and like all other malicious virus it enters the computer networks through a software that has not been updated. As soon as the hackers find any vulnerability in a certain network they use the malware to encrypt files and then demand money to unlock the encrypted files.Jake Williams the founder of computer security firm, Rendition Infose says that, \u201cThe SamSam ransomware used to attack Atlanta is interesting because it gets into a network and spreads to multiple computers before locking them up.\u201d He further added saying that the victim then has a greater incentive to pay a large amount of money as ransom to gain back the control of their network and locked computers.SamSam has been the most successful ransomware up till now and has managed to pull $850,000 in ransom money.Source: GIZMODO"}, {"title": "Third Largest Data Breach In Finland", "date": "April 10, 2018", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News"], "authur": "Michael Wight", "body": "More than 130,000 of Finland residents login and passwords got compromised by hackers recently.

US intelligence officials spoke to the Washington Post anonymously and claimed that the Russian agents attacked around 300 computers that were being used by the Olympics Authorities.These Russian agents managed to hack routers and even distributed a new malicious virus leading up to and during the Olympics opening ceremony which was held in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Earlier in the month of February, Olympic officials confirmed that the Games were attacked by cyber-criminals during the opening of the ceremony on February 9th. This cyber-attack resulted in the official Pyeongchang site to go offline and the Wi-Fi networks in the stadium were also disrupted which led to Internet Protocol Televisions (IPTVs) to not work at the Main Press Center.The officials refused to let the public know who was behind this cyber-attack. The cyber security researchers at Cisco\u2019s Talos, CrowdStrike and FireEye have identified this malware as the Olympic Destroyer and they believe that its main aim was to destroy targeted systems and wipe any file on the shared network drives. It also caused the website to shut down for over 2 hours which left many attendees unable to get a ticket for the ceremony.Security experts believe that this attack was carried out to embarrass the organizers and ruin their event instead of stealing data. When speaking to The Post, two US officials claim that Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU, is behind this attack and that the Russians infiltrated 300 computers which had data regarding the Olympics. They also added saying that the GRU made the attack seem like it was carried out by North Korea and their hackers by using North Korean IP address. They said that this tactic is known as the \u2018false-flag operation\u2019.It is still not clear whether the Russians wanted to disrupt the opening ceremony or steal the data. The hackers who did this dirty work are believed to be working for GRU and are the same experts who carried out the NoyPetya cyber-attack. The NoyPetya attack of 2017, took down a large number of computers in Ukraine.Officials believe that this Olympic attack was carried out in retaliation due to the decision made by the International Olympic Committee to ban Russia from the games. This decision was made over the alleged state-sponsored doping scandal. Some Russian athletes did compete in this game but were under a neutral flag as the \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201dUS officials were worried about the closing ceremony of the winter Olympic back then and claimed that they were watching it closely and will help the Koreans as they request it.Prior to the Games, Russia has denied any hand in the Cyber-attacks that targeted the event and tried to disrupt it. The Russian ministry told Reuters at that time, \u201cWe know that Western media are planning pseudo-investigations on the theme of \u2018Russian fingerprints\u2019 in hacking attacks on information resources related to the hosting of the Winter Olympic Games in the Republic of Korea.

The truly paranoid ones freak out about their microphones, some even try to open up their computers and cell phones to try and disable the audio component from their devices so that their device cannot be hijacked and taken over by hacker.A group of Israeli researchers took control of the \u2018spy-versus-spy delusions\u2019 dilemma and introduced a malware that may be able to convert your headphones into a makeshift microphone that will start to record your conversations.\nThe group of Israelis belonging to Israels Ben Gurion University produced a concept code as a piece of proof called \u201cSpeake(a)r\u201d and this was designed to exhibit how hackers will find a way to stealthily hijack your device to record audio and the worst part is that these hackers will be able to record your conversations even when you remove or disable your microphones.This preliminary malware changes the speakers in the ear buds of the headphones and uses it as a microphone. This further leads to converting the vibrations into electromagnetic signals. This allows the cyber-criminals to capture the audio very clearly even from across the room.The research leader of the group from Ben Gurions, Mordechai Guri says that, \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about the vulnerability in privacy. Even if your microphones are removed from your computer- your headphones can help record conversations.\u201dIt comes as no surprise that ear buds can be used as a microphone as well and you can watch many YouTube videos that demonstrate this procedure. The malware which still has no name; used the RealTek audio codec chips and using this chip the Ben Gurion researchers silently repurposed the computers output channel to an input channel. This altering of the channels allowed the malware to record audio even with the headphones plugged into an output only jack.The headphones can be hacked in such a way that they will allow you to record the conversations even without the presence of a microphone channel. The researchers further said that the RealTek chips are incredibly common due to which the attack can work on any desktop computer whether it is based on an iOS or Windows.These eavesdropping attack mostly matter to those who have been cyber-robbed before and have fallen down the hole of obsessive security measures. But in this modern age there are many techniques that can help you get rid of the laptops microphone by putting a tape over it as demonstrated by Mark Zuckerburg and you can even remove the internal mic from your phone. However, Guri claims that none of these techniques can defeat the malware.Until then, paranoiacs must take note and know that if a determined hacker is out to hear your conversations then removal surgery will not work; you will have to unplug the cheap headphones and throw them away.Sources: Independent "}, {"title": "LAPD Twitter Account Was Hacked", "date": "April 5, 2018", "topics": ["Did you know ?", "Hacking News", "News", "Tech"], "authur": "Arslan Butt", "body": "The hacker gained access in to their twitter account to proclaim that the members of the LAPD police force are \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d.

Uber somehow managed to cover up the loss of their information for over a year but here is what we know about this hacking up till now.The ride-hailing company was hacked in such a way that the customer and drivers information was stolen from its system in this security breach. Uber confirmed that they have paid their hackers $100,000 to delete the stolen data and to keep this mess away from public eyes as reported by Bloomberg.Uber\u2019s Chief Executive, Dara Khosrowshahi claimed in a statement \u201cNone of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,\u201d while acknowledging the breach and trying to cover it up. He also said that \u201cWhile I can\u2019t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes.\u201dThese hackers only stole personal data which included their names, email addresses, phone addresses and the name and license number of over 600,000 drivers in the United States. However, highly sensitive information such as credit card numbers, bank account number, birth dates, social security numbers and data location were not compromised and are still secure with the company.Khoswrowshahi also exclaimed that the downloaded and stolen data has been destroyed to provide assurance to their customers and their company has increased their security as well. The company\u2019s failure to notify the affected individuals and regulators has made Uber take some serious steps which included the firing of their two employees that were responsible for the response in 2016.Joe Sullivan Uber\u2019s Chief security officer was one of the employees who left the company as reported by Bloomberg. Chris Hoofnagle from Berkeley Center of Law and Technology agrees that the company\u2019s refusal to unveiling the hacking was an unprofessional move and he says that \u201cTo have direct liability under security breach notification status is to not give notice.\u201dAccording to the Californian State Law, companies are required to notify the resident of the states regarding any breach of their encrypted information and the company must also inform the attorney general if over 500 residents have been affected in any breach or chaos of such kind.An Uber driver from Pittsburgh, Robert Hudge says that \u201cThe hack and the cover-up is typical Uber only caring about themselves\u201d and he said this because he has still not heard from the company and he found out about this breach through the media.

Honda Motor Company had to halt their vehicle production after they found WannaCry ransom ware in their computer network.The Sayama Plant of Honda in northwest Tokyo produces an output of 1000 vehicles on average and their models range from Accord to Odyssey. However, this plan was forced to close down on June 19 Monday due to the ransom ware that was discovered on Sunday, June 18.  The production has continued up to today but the data breach left a lasting effect.A spokesperson from Reuters that the virus not only attacked networks in Japan but also in North America, China, Europe and other regions. These regions tried very hard to secure their systems in Mid-May when it was on its peak but still these efforts weren\u2019t enough to stop it.The WannaCry virus found a weak spot in the Sayama plants operational system. The plant was using Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 operating system and the virus used a backdoor to enter the systems and seize it. At first it looked as if the Sayama Plant was the only Honda production facility that was affected but Renault and Nissan were affected in a similar way by WannaCry last month.This caused their production to be stopped forcefully in Britain, India, France and other countries.  Securities have warned these companies that after this attack other iterations of viruses could come in as well. However these plants were not the only thing affected by WannaCry; this virus even affected the traffic camera\u2019s in Australia.The Victoria Police confirmed that the virus wreaked 55 traffic cameras as well as speed cameras that were operated by a third-party, Redflex. The police claimed in a statement that the virus has been detected however the camera system was affected. The police decided to look into the incidents identified by speed and red light camera throughout the time in question. The integrity of the camera system was not affected.The security officials from UK claim that WannaCry ransom ware has ties with a hacking group in North Korea. According to BBC\u2019s report they believe that this attack was launched by a group called Lazarus. This group is strongly connected to North Korea and this is not the first time Lazarus has been connected with ransom ware.Symantex says that it is sure that WannaCry ransom ware is connected to Lazarus. Lazarus is also the cybercrime organization that is responsible for the hack in Sony Pictures and that stole millions of dollars from the Central Bank in Bangladesh. When Symantec\u2019s Security Response Team, carried out an analysis of the WannaCry attacks they unraveled that the ample commonalities in techniques, the tools use and infrastructures were similar to the previous Lazarus attack making it very unlikely that Lazarus is behind this attack by WannaCry.

The agent running this group gave access to a gateway and gave them a login ID and password to enter into any Aadhaar number in the portal.

The information that was exposed did not include any biometric data but contained personal information regarding name, emails, photographs and phone numbers.The UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority Of India) claims that over 1.20 billion people have registered in the system since the early 2009.

This online researcher, going by the name of Elliot Alderson showed that the app has very poor security and further claimed that it is super easy to get the password of the database of the app.He claimed that Aadhaar saves your biometric settings in a local database and you can enter in it using a password that you can guess. Aadhaar is in actual fact becoming de facto essential with more and more people trying to link it with banks and phone accounts. The UIDAI officials in Chandigarh were very shocked on this data being accessed and immediately took up the matter with technical consultants.So in short, everyone\u2019s personal information is at a great risk and the only way to stop this from happening is to cause more precautionary measures and better hacking protection.Sources: IndiaTimes."}, {"title": "150 Million MyFitnessPal Users have been hacked", "date": "March 31, 2018", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News", "Uncategorized"], "authur": "Harikrishna Mekala", "body": "According to Under Armour Inc\u2019s statement on Thursday, data of 150 Million users have been hacked.

However, Mathy Vanhoef, an academic researcher from the University of Leuven, believes that the brute-force security in WPA3 will be resolved by switching to a new key exchange protocol called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), or Dragonfly.A few months ago, Vanhoef discovered a serious weakness in the four-way handshake of the WPA2 protocol, which is used by customers who know a Wi-Fi network\u2019s pre-shared key (password) to negotiate an encryption key with the access point.

The moment I noticed the departure board announce that my flight was going to be delayed, I immediately thought, \u201cwhat am I going to do here for four hours?\u201d. As I headed down the hall to the terminal along with dozens of other passengers, almost all of the shops and restaurants in the departures lounge had closed.I asked a passenger sitting across from me, how the free Wi-Fi option measures up. \u201cIs it any good?\u201d He replied in a heavy British accent. \u201cLet me put it like this: I wouldn\u2019t be relying on it if I wanted to do serious work.\u201d Nonetheless, who would pay for premium, when free is available? I thought to myself.So, I came up with an idea! Why not check it out myself, through a little experiment, how many travellers would pay for premium Wi-Fi and how secure is a public network, when internet users exchange sensitive information, credit card number, confidential documents possibly. Man in the middle attack was my plan of attack. This specific method works on the basis of the attacker secretly relaying/ altering the communication between two parties (internet provider and the user), who believe they are directly communicating with each other.One example of man-in-the-middle attacks, in which the attacker makes independent internet hot spot connections with the victim and relays messages between them to make them believe they are connected directly over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. Anyone can imagine that relevant messages passing between the victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point, can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle. That was the plan in my case.First of all, I cloned Heathrows\u2019 \u201cAccess the Internet\u201d site, changing a few things on the welcome screen of the page such as, increase the price from 4 pounds to 8 pounds, reduce free internet time from four hours to 1 hour, . Then I had to implement the payment integration form, allowing potential victims to easily process their credit cards. I simply used my phone as a hot-spot, changed the SSID name to make it similar to the free one the airport emitted in the area and sat back to wait for the first person to join the \u201cfree network\u201d.It took no less than half an hour for someone to connect on my hot-spot and use the standard Wi-Fi free. I had to randomly disconnect few of the active connections on my personal hotspot just to avoid overcharging my phone bill. After one hour, I had my first visitor willing to pay for premium Wi-Fi network and, as simple as that, I had compromised the first credit card. This fake, private hot-spot emitted for at least three hours and gathered approximately 18 credit cards from unsuspecting travellers.  And that was it. Afterwards I dropped the connection and erased the data from my computer.It\u2019s kind of scary how easily I could get the credit card number in a solid format ready for any payment on the web or even sell it in the dark web. A self-described hacker affiliated with the Anonymous post on random darknet site: it is simpler and quicker to buy credit card numbers from villains who hack computers, set up phoney online stores selling non-existent goods at bargain prices, \u201cscan\u201d the numbers from ATMs, rather steal them at restaurants or official documents.It is important to remember how easily someone can create a counterfeit hot-spot and gain access to valuable information.  Care must be taken to avoid using public Wi-Fi on your phone, tablet or computer to check your email, your bank account balance, or any other site that contains or requires your personal data. In most cases, using Internet security software could save you from a lot of trouble, however this case is a little different.The main purpose of this article is to educate and create awareness for users which is relatively easy to do in a public Wi-Fi hotspot environment.

The variances include most of Sullivan\u2019s direct reports.None of the four directly replied to requests for an explanation. Emails in association with the departures, represented by the separate source, complained of nervous and physical strain from the past year.Sullivan in August told News that his security team added around 500 employees.Leadership in the unit has been in confusion since the end last week of Sullivan and a deputy, as well as Uber\u2019s access that it paid $100,000 to hackers to delete taken data from the October 2016 breach and keep it secret, while failing to notify the incident to controls or warn consumers that their phone numbers and other data had been exposed.In the Waymo case, deposition at a pretrial hearing this week focused on allegations by former employee Richard Jacobs that Uber had a distinctive unit within its security team that tried to obtain programming code and other trade puzzles from rivals.Take your time to comment on this article."}, {"title": "Fake Windows Troubleshooting Support Scam Convince Users Into Purchasing A Fake Windows Defender", "date": "November 30, 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "Eslam Medhat", "body": "\u201cWindows Troubleshooting\u201d is a new nasty scam that distributes as cracked software installer, it displays a fake BSOD, or Blue Screen of Death, on the infected machine and then shows Troubleshooting Windows pop up that seems like legit Windows Troubleshooter.The Troubleshooting scam has been detected by Pieter Arntz (a security researcher from Malwarebytes), the researcher said that Tech Support Scammers use different techniques for distributing themselves.
