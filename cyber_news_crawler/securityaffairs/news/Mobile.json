Facebook was collecting such kind of data, this is not a surprise for tech-savvy people because we have discussed it in the past.\n\nIn January, the popular Italian expert Simone Margaritelli wrote a blog post (Italian) on Medium inviting users to uninstall  Facebook and Whatsapp.\n\nThe programmer Dylan McKay was able to find data, including logs of calls and SMS messages, in an archive he downloaded (as a ZIP file) from Facebook.\n\nMat Johnson, a Professor at the University of Houston Creative Writing Program, also made the same disturbing discovery.\n\nOh wow my deleted Facebook Zip file contains info on every single phone cellphone call and text I made for about a year- cool totally not creepy.\n\n\u2014 Mat Johnson (@mat_johnson) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica case has is giving users another point of view regarding the collection of such kind of data made by Facebook and the real way they are using for.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson explained that the platform collects this data to improve the users\u2019 experience.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis [above] screen in the Messenger application offers to conveniently track all your calls and messages. But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.\u201d wrote Sean Gallagher, Ars Technica\u2019s IT and National Security Editor.\n\n\u201cFacebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \u201chelp friends find each other\u201d after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \u201copt-in\u201d for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \u201cOK\u201d button to approve \u201ckeeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\u201d\u201d\n\nFacebook denied to collect call data surreptitiously with an official blog post, the social network giant highlighted that it never commercialized the data and that users are in total control of the data uploaded to the platform.\n\n\u201cWhen you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history.\u201d reads the blog post published by Facebook. \u201cFor Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose \u2018learn more\u2019 or \u2018not now\u2019.

The IRRAT malware reports to a Telegram bot, hides its icon from the phone\u2019s app menu and runs in the background waiting for commands.\n\nThe TeleRAT Android malware operates in a different way, it creates two files on the device, telerat2.txt containing device information (i.e. system bootloader version number, available memory, and a number of processor cores), and thisapk_slm.txt containing a Telegram channel and a list of commands.\n\nOnce installed, the malicious code informs attackers on this by sending a message to a Telegram bot via the Telegram bot API with the current date and time. The malware also starts a background service that listens for changes made to the clipboard, and finally, the app fetches updates from the Telegram bot API every 4.6 second listening for several commands written in Farsi (Persian).\n\nThe TeleRAT is able to receive commands to grab contacts, location, app list, or the content of the clipboard; receive charging information; get file list or root file list; download files, create contacts, set wallpaper, receive or send SMS; take photos; receive or make calls; turn phone to silent or loud; turn off the phone screen; delete apps; cause the phone to vibrate; and get photos from the gallery.\n\nTeleRAT is also able of uploading exfiltrated data using Telegram\u2019s sendDocument API method, in this way it evades network-based detection.\n\n\u201cTeleRAT is an upgrade from IRRAT in that it eliminates the possibility of network-based detection that is based on traffic to known upload servers, as all communication (including uploads) is done via the Telegram bot API.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cAside from additional commands, this new family\u2019s main differentiator to IRRAT is that it also uploads exfiltrated data using Telegram\u2019s sendDocument API method\u201d\n\nThe malware is able to get updates in two ways, namely the getUpdates method (which exposes a history of all the commands sent to the bot, including the usernames the commands originated from), and the use of a Webhook (bot updates can be redirected to a HTTPS URL specified by means of a Webhook).\n\nThe TeleRAT malware is distributed via seemingly legitimate applications in third-party Android app stores and also via both legitimate and nefarious Iranian Telegram channels. According to PaloAlto networks, a total of 2,293 users were apparently infected, most of them (82%) having Iranian phone numbers.\n\n\n\nThe campaign has a poor OPSEC, the experts have found an image of the botmaster testing out the malware, along with exfiltrated messages to confirm it. The analysis of the malicious code revealed that it contains the developer\u2019s username in the code and reference to \u2018vahidmail67\u2019 Telegram channel that advertises applications to help users get likes and followers on Instagram, ransomware, and even the source code for an unnamed RAT.\n\n\u201cAside from the Telegram channel, while looking for references to certain TeleRAT components we stumbled upon somethreads on an Iranian programmers\u2019 forum advertising the sale of a Telegram bot control library. The forum is frequented by some of the developers whose code is heavily reused in a big portion of the TeleRAT samples we came across.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nExperts pointed out that TeleRAT puts together code written by several developers, including freely available source code via Telegram channels and code offered for sale on several forums, making it difficult to attribute the malware to one single bad actor behind both IRRAT and TeleRAT.\n\nThe experts concluded that the malware could be the work of several actors possibly operating inside of Iran.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 TeleRAT, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/telerat", "topic_name": "TeleRAT"}]}, {"news_name": "New attacks on 4G LTE networks can allow to spy on users and spoof emergency alerts", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69852/hacking/4g-lte-networks-flaws.html", "title": "New attacks on 4G LTE networks can allow to spy on users and spoof emergency alerts\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 5, 2018", "body": "A group of researchers from Purdue and the University of Iowa have discovered a number of vulnerabilities affecting the 4G LTE networks that could be exploited by attackers to eavesdrop on phone calls and text messages, knock devices offline, track location, and spoof emergency alerts.\n\nThe experts detailed ten different attacks in a research paper, the experts leverage weaknesses in three critical protocol operations of the cellular network, such as securely attaching a device to 4G LTE networks and maintaining a connection to receive calls and messages.\n\n\u201cIn this paper, we investigate the security and privacy of the three critical procedures of the 4G LTE protocol (i.e., attach, detach, and paging), and in the process, uncover potential design flaws of the protocol and unsafe practices employed by the stakeholders.\u201d reads the paper published by the experts.\u201dFor exposing vulnerabilities, we propose a model based testing approach LTEInspector which lazily combines a symbolic model checker and a cryptographic protocol verifier in the symbolic attacker model.\u201d\n\nThe researchers devised a testing framework dubbed LTEInspector that they used to detect vulnerabilities in LTE radios and networks.\n\nThe group tested eight of the ten attacks using SIM cards from four large US carriers.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated how to conduct authentication relay attacks that allow them to bypass the network authentication and masquerade as a victim\u2019s device.\n\nAn attacker can access 4G LTE networks and impersonate the victim.\n\n\u201d Using LTEInspector, we have uncovered 10 new attacks along with 9 prior attacks, categorized into three abstract classes (i.e., security, user privacy, and disruption of service), in the three procedures of 4G LTE.\u201d continues the paper.\n\u201cNotable among our findings is the authentication relay attack that enables an adversary to spoof the location of a legitimate user to the core network without possessing appropriate credentials. To ensure that the exposed attacks pose real threats and are indeed realizable in practice, we have validated 8 of the 10 new attacks and their accompanying adversarial assumptions through experimentation in a real testbed\u201d\n\n\n\nThe researchers highlighted the dangers related to the exploitation of the flaws, an attacker can spoof the location of the victim device, which could lead to interference in criminal investigations by planting false location information, which could allow crooks to create fake evidence.\n\nThe weaknesses could be exploited by threat actors to cause the chaos by injecting warning messages, emergency notices, and Amber alerts in the 4G LTE networks.\n\nOne of the scenarios tested by the researchers, a major US carrier never used encryption for control plane messages allowing an attacker to exploit the issues to eavesdrop the SMS and other sensitive data. The good news is that the US carrier has promptly addressed the flaw and deployed a fix.\n\nThe scary aspect of this research is that a cheap equipment (common software-defined radio devices) and open source 4G LTE protocol software could be bought by anyone to carry out the attacks.\n\nAnyone can build the equipment to power the attacks for as little as $1,300 to $3,900.\n\nThe researchers announced that they plan to release the proof-of-concept code once the vulnerabilities will be fixed.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 4G LTE networks, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/4g-lte-network", "topic_name": "4G LTE network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/eavesdroping", "topic_name": "eavesdroping"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lteinspector", "topic_name": "LTEInspector"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Over 40 models of low-cost Android devices shipped with Triada banking Trojan", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69794/malware/smartphone-pre-installed-triada.html", "title": "Over 40 models of low-cost Android devices shipped with Triada banking Trojan\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 3, 2018", "body": "Security researchers at Antivirus firm Dr.Web have discovered that 42 models of low-cost Android smartphones are shipped with the Android.Triada.231 banking malware.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of 2017, Doctor Web analysts discovered a new Trojan Android.Triada.231 in the firmware of some cheap models of Android devices.

The most interesting characteristic of the Triada Trojan apart is its modular architecture, which gives it theoretically a wide range of abilities.\n\nThe only way to remove the threat is to wipe the smartphone and reinstall the OS.\n\nResearchers at Dr.Web discovered the Triada Trojan pre-installed on newly shipped devices several minor brands, including Advan, Cherry Mobile, Doogee, and Leagoo.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the company discovered a pre-installed malware on Android device, back in in July 2017 Dr..Web researchers discovered the many smartphone models were shipped with the dreaded Triada trojan such as Leagoo M5 Plus, Leagoo M8, Nomu S10, and Nomu S20.\n\n\n\nThe researchers at Dr.Web who investigated the issue discovered that a software developer from Shanghai was responsible for the infection.\n\n\u201cFor example, it was detected on the Leagoo M9 smartphone that was announced in December 2017. Additionally, our analysts\u2019 research showed that the Trojan\u2019s penetration into firmware happened at request of the Leagoo partner, the software developer from Shanghai.\u201d continues the blog post.\n\n\u201cThis company provided Leagoo with one of its applications to be included into an image of the mobile operating system, as well as with an instruction to add third-party code into the system libraries before their compilation.

You should, and it seems like every security vendor has a branded piece of plastic to take care of that for you \u2014 just ask.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t as easy to cover the camera on your phone. You use it for many functions that aren\u2019t video conferencing and it is constantly in and out of your pocket or bag. Anything you stick on the camera lens is unlikely to stay for long. Like most mobile security requirements, we are reliant on software and fortunately, Google is stepping up. The next version of the mobile OS, Android P, is expected to include a neat feature that prevents apps running in the background from spying on you through the camera or microphone on your cell phone.\n\nIn 2014, one of the surprising revelations from Edward Snowden was the NSA\u2019s ability to spy on targets through cellphone microphones and cameras. By 2017, cellphone specific malware like Chrysaor, Lipizzan and SonicSpy provide the same capability to hackers. There are even \u201clegitimate\u201d applications marketed to concerned parents and partners who feel the need to keep tabs on their family members. The techniques and capabilities are now so commonplace, it isn\u2019t just the paranoid that should be concerned \u2014 everyone who is cares about their privacy should consider the threats that exist in their cellphones.\n\nMost often, the malicious software makes its way onto a cellphone under the guise of something the user actually wants. For example, one enterprising hacker started with the popular Telegram messaging application, added the SonicSpy malware and then distributed messaging software under a variety of different names. Users enjoyed the benefits of the messaging software they downloaded, unaware that it was also spying on everything they did. When installing the application, Android pops up a warning about the app requesting access to your camera microphone, contacts, etc. but this seems acceptable for a messaging application. The insidious part is that even if you think you have closed the messaging app, it is still running in the background \u2014 spying on you through the camera and microphone. This is the trick that Android P is going to resolve.\n\nThe folks at xdadevelopers who scrutinize all changes to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code were the first ones to identify the changes and determine the impact as summarized in this blog post. When an application is installed on Android it is assigned an unchanging User ID (UID) which Android leverages the new privacy changes.\n\nKyle Wiggers explains, \u201cIn Android P, when the camera service detects that a UID is \u201cidle\u201d\u2014that is to say, when the device is in the idle Doze state and background apps\u2019 access to CPU and network-intensive services is restricted\u2014Android will generate an error and close access to the camera. Subsequent camera requests from the inactive UID will immediately generate an error.\u201d\n\nIn other words, your phone will tell you when an app you didn\u2019t realize was running tries to access the camera. There are likely to be cases where you want to allow an app in the background to access camera and microphone resources on your phone, but you should be able to make the determination yourself, with a complete understanding of what is happening. The upcoming changes in Android P will help you take back your privacy.\n\n\n\nAn official release date for Android P has not been announced, although it is usually available as a preview for developers around the time of the Google I/O conference which is scheduled for May this year. Hopefully, we will see how well the proposed changes will work in the real world.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android P, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-p", "topic_name": "Android P"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "SIM Hijacking \u2013 T-Mobile customers were victims an info disclosure exploit", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69279/hacking/sim-hijacking-t-mobile.html", "title": "SIM Hijacking \u2013 T-Mobile customers were victims an info disclosure exploit\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 19, 2018", "body": "In 2017, hackers stole some personal information belonging to T-Mobile customers by exploiting a well-known vulnerability.\n\nA video tutorial titled \u2018T-Mobile Info Disclosure exploit\u2019 showing how to use the flaw was also published on the Internet.\n\n\n\nExploiting the vulnerability it is possible to access certain customers\u2019 data, including email addresses, billing account numbers, and the phone\u2019s IMSI numbers.\n\nSuch kind of info could be used by hackers in social engineering attack against T-Mobile\u2019s customer support employees with the intent of stealing the victim\u2019s phone number.\n\n\n\nThe attackers can use them to impersonate the target customer, crooks call the T-Mobile customer care posing as the victim with the intent to trick the operator to issue a new SIM card for the victim\u2019s number.\n\nThe crooks activate the new SIM and take control of your phone number, then they can use is to steal the victim\u2019s identity.

The applications for intelligence and law enforcement agencies to solve crimes like kidnapping, missing people and terrorism are very significant.\n\nAs the researchers notice, the application utilizes a series of algorithms to locate and track someone using information like the phone IP address and time zone combined with data from its sensors. The phone sensors collect compass details from the gyroscope, air pressure reading from barometer and accelerometer data while remaining undetected from the user. The resulting data processed can be used to extract contextual information about users\u2019 habits, regular activities, and even relationships.\n\nThis technology as many others have two sides: Help solving crimes at large, and implications on privacy and security of the users.  The researchers hope to be fomenting the development of security measures to switch off sensor data by revealing this sensor security flaw. Nowadays such sensor data is collected by fitness and game applications to track people movement.\n\nAnother key point where the application can be a game changer is an alternative navigation tool, as highlighted by the researchers. Gps signals used in autonomous cars and ships can be the target of hackers putting the safety of the passengers in danger. The researchers conducted their experiment using Galaxy S4 i9500, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. To determine the last Wi-Fi connection, the PinMe application read the latest IP address used and the network status.\n\n\n\nTo determine how a user is traveling, the application utilizes a machine learning algorithm that recognizes the different patterns of walking, driving and flying by gathering data from the phones sensor like speed, direction of travel, delay between movement and altitude.\n\nOnce determined the pattern of activity of a user, the application then executes one of four additional algorithms to determine the type transportation. By comparing the phone data against public information the route of the user is determined. Maps from Google and the U.S. Geological Survey were used to determine the altitude details of every point on Earth. Details regarding temperature, humidity, and air pressure reports were also used to determine the use of trains or planes.\n\nThe researchers wanted also to raise the question about privacy and data collected without the user consent as Prateek Mittal states: \u201cPinMe demonstrates how information from seemingly innocuous sensors can be exploited using machine-learning techniques to infer sensitive details about our lives\u201d.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371\n\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/12/19/gps-is-off-so-you-cant-be-tracked-right-wrong/\n\nhttps://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/11/29/phones-vulnerable-location-tracking-even-when-gps-services\n\nhttps://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/07/boffins_crack_location_tracking_even_if_youve_turned_off_the_gps/\n\nhttps://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/02/07/location-tracking-no-gps/\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apps-can-track-users-even-when-gps-is-turned-off/\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01468.pdf\n\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8038870/?reload=true\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and an enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

Swiping right, the Tinder user likes a particular profile, in this case, the response generated is composed of 374 bytes.\n\nThe researchers also noticed that Tinder member pictures are downloaded to the app via HTTP connection, this makes possible for an attacker to view the profile images of those users being swiped left and right.\n\nIn order to mitigate this issue, researchers suggest padding requests, if the responses were padded to a fixed size, it would be impossible to discriminate the user\u2019s action.\n\nCheckmarx disclosed both vulnerabilities to Tinder.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Tinder, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mitm", "topic_name": "MITM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tinder", "topic_name": "Tinder"}]}, {"news_name": "Three Sonic apps in the Google Play are leaking data to uncertified servers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68083/digital-id/sonic-apps-data-leak.html", "title": "Three Sonic apps in the Google Play are leaking data to uncertified servers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 23, 2018", "body": "According to a researcher from security firm Predeo, some game applications in the Google Play published by SEGA leak users\u2019 data to uncertified servers.\n\nThe Android apps are Sonic Dash,  Sonic the Hedgehog\u2122 Classic, and Sonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom, that have been totally downloaded millions of times.\n\nThe expert discovered that the apps are leaking users\u2019 geolocation and device data to suspicious servers, thereby posing a privacy threat to mobile gamers, according to researchers.\n\n\u201cPradeo\u2019s Lab discovered that some game applications in the Google Play published by SEGA, the famous video games developer and publisher, access and leak users\u2019 geolocation and device data.

At a high-level, the hackers have designed three different kinds of phishing messages to trick victims into visiting a compromised website, a typical watering hole attack.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe malicious app could exfiltrate text messages, including two-factor authentication codes, and other data from the victim\u2019s device. Dark Caracal malware is also able to use devices cameras and the microphone to spy on the victims.\n\nUnfortunately, the APT group also used another powerful surveillance software in its campaign, the malware is the dreaded FinFisher, a spyware that is often marketed to law enforcement and government agencies.\n\n\u201cDevices for testing and operating the campaign were traced back to a building belonging to the Lebanese General Directorate of General Security (GDGS), one of Lebanon\u2019s intelligence agencies. Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the GDGS is associated with or directly supporting the actors behind Dark Caracal. \u201d continues the report.\n\nDark Caracal also has a Windows malware in its arsenal, the malicious code was able to collect screenshots and files from the infected PCs.\n\n\n\nLookout and the EFF launched their investigation in July 2017, the researchers were able to identify the Command and Control infrastructure and determined that the Dark Caracal hackers were running six unique campaigns.

In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago \u2013 at the end of 2014.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\n\u201cSince then, the implant\u2019s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals.\u201d\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll show you that the malware was first found by the security researcher at ESET Lukas Stefanko and the first detailed analysis of the spyware (titled \u201cMalware Analysis Report: Fake 3MobileUpdater\u201c) was published by the experts at the CSE Cybsec ZLab.\n\nThe Android Italian Job \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\n\nAndroid Spy Trojan steals sensitive info from victimsSpreads in #Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 as fake telecommunication company @Tre_ItRemotely controlled, capable of: install apps, upload files, uses accessibility, take pics, record audio, get sms/location, XMPP\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1dHSW1wGQ3\n\n\u2014 Lukas Stefanko (@LukasStefanko) November 9, 2017\n\n\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Skygofree has being distributed through fake web pages mimicking leading mobile network operators. The attackers registered some of the domains used in the attack since 2015.\n\nThe most recently observed domain was registered on October 31, 2017, according to Kaspersky data the malicious code was used against several infected individuals, exclusively in Italy.\n\nThe team of researchers at CSE CybSec ZLab analyzed in November a fake 3 Mobile Updater that was used pose itself as a legitimate application of the Italian Telco company, TRE Italia.\n\n\u201cThe most classic and efficient method used to lure the users is to believe that the application does something good. This is just what 3 Mobile Updater does. In fact, this malicious Android application looks like a legitimate app used to retrieve mobile system update and it improperly uses the logo of the notorious Italian Telco company, TRE Italia, in order to trick victims into trusting it.\u201d reads the report published by CSE CybSec.\n\n\n\nThe analysis conducted by Kaspersky suggests the involvement of an Italian firm due to the presence in the code of strings in Italian.\n\n\u201cAs can be seen from the comparison, there are similar strings and also a unique comment in Italian, so it looks like the attackers created this exploit payload based on android-rooting-tools project source code.\u201d states Kaspersky.\n\nThe CSE CybSec researchers arrived atthe same conclusion, below a portion of the code analyzed by the members of the ZLab.\n\n\n\n\u201cMoreover, both in the logcat messages and in the code, the malware writers used the Italian language. So, we can say with high confidence that this malicious app has been written by an Italian firm that intended to target users of the Italian telco company Tre.\u201d CSE wrote in the analysis.\n\nThe artifacts analyzed by Kaspersky in the malware code and information gathered on the control infrastrucure suggest the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works for surveillance solutions.\n\n\n\n \n\nKaspersky Lab has not confirmed the name of the Italian company behind this spyware, we at the CSE CybSec ZLab opted for the same decision in October due to the possible involvement of law enforcement or intelligence Agencies.\n\nUnfortunately, the OPsec implemented by the firm is very poor. The name of the company is present in multiple reference of the code. Not only, one of the domains used to control registered by the attacker is linked to an Italian technology company.\n\n\u201cAlthough the security firm has not confirmed the name of the Italian company behind this spyware, it found multiple references to Rome-based technology company \u201cNegg\u201d in the spyware\u2019s code. Negg is also specialized in developing and trading legal hacking tools.\u201d states the blog post published by THN.\n\nOnce installed, Skygofree hides its icon and starts background services to conceal its malicious actions from the victim, one interesting feature implemented by the malicious code prevents its services from being killed.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, a self-protection feature was implemented in almost every service. Since in Android 8.0 (SDK API 26) the system is able to kill idle services, this code raises a fake update notification to prevent it\u201d continues Kaspersky.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the Skygofree malware was enhanced since October implementing a sophisticated multi-stage attack and using a reverse shell payload.\n\nThe malicious code includes multiple exploits to escalate privileges for root access used by attackers to execute sophisticated payloads, including a shellcode used to spy on popular applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Line, and Viber.\n\nThe same spying abilities were implemented in the app we analyzed at the CSE CybSec.\n\n\u201cThe capabilities of this malicious app are enormous and include the information gathering from various sources, including the most popular social apps, including Whatsapp, Telegram, Skype, Instagram, Snapchat. It is able to steal picture from the gallery, SMS and calls registry apps. All this data is first stored in a local database, created by the malicious app, and later it is sent to the C2C.\u201d reads the preliminary analysis published on SecurityAffairs.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, [and] never-before-seen surveillance features,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nSkygofree is able to take pictures and videos remotely, monitor SMS, call records and calendar event, of course, it also able to gather target\u2019 location and access any information stored on the mobile.\n\nSkygofree also can record audio via the microphone, the attacker can also force the victim\u2019s device to connect to compromised Wi-Fi networks it controls in order to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nKaspersky also found a variant of Skygofree targeting Windows users, a circumstance that suggests the same company is also targeting machines running Windows OS.\n\nThe best way to prevent yourself from being a victim is to avoid downloading apps via third-party websites, app stores or links provided in SMS messages or emails.\n\nComparative analysis fake 3 Mobile Updater vs SkyGoFree\n\nI asked my colleague Dr. Antonio Pirozzi, Director of the CSE CybSec ZLab, to compare the stubs of code shared by Kaspersky with the ones related to the code we analyzed back in November.\n\nThis is what has emerged:\n\nThese classes are identical:\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android malware, Skygofree)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/italy", "topic_name": "Italy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-analysis", "topic_name": "Malware Analysis"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/skygofree", "topic_name": "Skygofree"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tre-italia", "topic_name": "Tre Italia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zlab", "topic_name": "ZLAB"}]}, {"news_name": "Trend Micro spotted 36 malicious apps advertised as security tools in Google Play", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67516/malware/google-play-security-tools.html", "title": "Trend Micro spotted 36 malicious apps advertised as security tools in Google Play\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 8, 2018", "body": "Once again crooks bypassed security checks implemented by Google, researchers from Trend Micro have discovered 36 malicious apps on Google Play that are posing as security tools.\n\nCrooks advertised the apps as security tools as applications developed by major security firms, including Security Defender, Security Keeper, Smart Security, Advanced Boost.\n\nThe applications were developed to steal user information and flood them with ads.\n\n\u201cThese apps posed as useful security tools under the names Security Defender, Security Keeper, Smart Security, Advanced Boost, and more.

pre-installed on Android devices is affected by a critical flaw, tracked as CVE-2017-17692, that could be exploited by an attacker to steal data from browser tabs if the user visits an attacker-controlled site.\n\nThe SOP bypass issue in the Samsung Internet Browser was discovered by the security researcher Dhiraj Mishra.\n\nThe Same Origin Policy is one of the most important security mechanisms implemented in modern browsers, the basic idea behind the SOP is the javaScript from one origin should not be able to access the properties of a website on another origin.\n\nA SOP bypass occurs when a sitea.com is somehow able to access the properties of siteb.com such as cookies, location, response etc.\n\nAn attacker can copy victim\u2019s session cookie or hijack his session and read and write webmail on your behalf.\n\nMishra developed a Metasploit Module for the exploitation of the SOP bypass issue and reported the flaw to the MITRE to assign CVE.\n\nMishra also reported the flaw to Samsung, who acknowledged it and confirmed that \u201cthe patch is already preloaded in our upcoming model Galaxy Note 8, and the application will be updated via Apps store update in October.\u201c\n\nHere is the Source Code for Bypassing Same Origin Policy in Samsung Internet Browser in Metasploit,\n\n\u201cWhen the Samsung Internet browser opens a new tab in a given domain (say, google.com) through a Javascript action, that Javascript can come in after the fact and rewrite the contents of that page with whatever it wants,\u201d reads a blog post published by researchers from security firm Rapid7.\n\n\u201cThis is a no-no in browser design since it means that Javascript can violate the Same-Origin Policy, and can direct Javascript actions from one site (controlled by the attacker) to act in the context of another site (the one the attacker is interested in). Essentially, the attacker can insert custom Javascript into any domain, provided the victim user visits the attacker-controlled web page first.\u201d\n\nThe experts from Rapid7 have also published a video PoC of the attack.\n\n\n\nThe availability online of the Metasploit exploit code pose a serious risk to Android users that are still using the old Android Stock browser.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SOP bypass issue, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/same-origin-policy", "topic_name": "Same Origin Policy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sop-bypass-issue", "topic_name": "SOP bypass issue"}]}, {"news_name": "The Twitter account of the popular security expert John McAfee was hacked", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67183/hacking/john-mcafee-twitter-hacked.html", "title": "The Twitter account of the popular security expert John McAfee was hacked\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 28, 2017", "body": "The official Twitter account of legendary security expert John McAfee was hacked today, attackers used it to send several tweets promoting alternative cryptocurrencies like Siacoin, NXT, XRP, PTOY, and BAT.\n\nAt the time of writing, there aren\u2019t further info related to the attack, John McAfee explained that its account was protected with a two-factor authentication process.\n\nThis suggests that the attackers have found a way to obtain the authentication code sent by Twitter, this is possible by compromising the mobile device or via an SS7 attack.\n\nIn this latter scenario, hackers can exploit a flaw in the SS7 protocol to steal the victim\u2019s identity on the messaging services with just basic skills.\n\nThe principal instant messaging services, including WhatsApp and Telegram, rely on the SMS authentication as the primary security verification mechanism, which is routed through SS7 signalling.

These two functions are also responsible for managing the resources associated with each message similar to the ipc_kobject_server routine in the kernel.\u201d wrote Beer.\n\n\u201cExploitability hinges on being able to get the memory reallocated in between the two vm_deallocate calls, probably in another thread.\u201d\n\nBeer published a proof-of-concept code to exploit a second bug that provided the vector to attack MIG.\n\nThe expert exploited \u201ca recent addition to the kernel, presumably as a debugging tool to help enumerate places where the kernel is accidentally disclosing pointers to userspace. The implementation currently enumerates kqueues and dumps a bunch of values from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIOSurfaceRootUserClient external method 17 (s_set_surface_notify) will drop a reference on the wake_port (via IOUserClient::releaseAsyncReference64) then return an error code if the client has previously registered a port with the same callback function.\u201d reads the security advisory published by Beer.\n\n\u201cThe external method\u2019s error return value propagates via the return value of is_io_connect_async_method back to the MIG generated code which will drop a futher reference on the wake_port when only one was taken.

DoubleLocker is the first-ever ransomware to abuse the Android accessibility feature that implements alternative ways to interact with a mobile device, it was a new malware that not only encrypts the Android mobile devices but also changes PIN lock.\n\n\n\nWell, experts at Carbon Black reported a case of a cybercriminal that wanted $854 for the Locker Android ransomware kit.\n\n\u201cWe are already seeing an uptick in Android Ransomware kits in underground markets, selling for a much higher price. In our research, we discovered that the median price of ransomware targeting Windows OS is $10, whereas Android-capable ransomware has a median range of $200.\u201d reads a report published by Carbon Black.\n\nRick McElroy, a Carbon Black security strategist, explained that there is a significant difference between typical iOS users and Android ones. Apple users have a tendency to buy new devices everytime a new model is on the market and update their applications and operating systems on a regular basis.\n\nAndroid users being remiss in updating their devices, giving much more opportunities to the attackers.\n\n\u201cOne of the most surprising things was how many Android devices are out there that have not been updated for two years now, and probably never will,\u201d McElroy says. \u201cUpdates are usually simple to conduct, but many users simply don\u2019t do them.\u201d\n\nCrooks choose to target Android users because Android holds the largest OS marketshare worldwide for smartphones, roughly 86% in the first quarter of Q1.\n\nAnother factor that influences the median price higher for Android ransomware kits is the level of coding sophistication that is needed to create these tools compared to the efforts necessary to develop similar kits for Windows.\n\n\u201cThis speaks a bit to how easy it is to get ransomware onto a Windows system versus other operation systems,\u201d McElroy says. \u201cThe longer a developer has to spend to get his ransomware to work effectively at scale the higher the price will be.\u201d\n\nThe last catalyst that is driving the median price higher for Android ransomware kits is the spike in the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the currency used for payments of the ransom, \u201cwith Bitcoin value increasing so quickly, the expansion of this space will likely be connected closely to the value of BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, as those attacks become tougher, and crypto-currency, such as Bitcoin, gains popularity; we believe ransom-based attacks such as screen-lock and file-encryption will gain popularity going forward.\u201d concludes the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android ransomware kits, Dark Web)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-ransomware-kits", "topic_name": "Android ransomware kits"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Android Janus vulnerability allows attackers to inject Malware into legitimate apps avoiding detection", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66513/hacking/janus-vulnerability-android.html", "title": "Android Janus vulnerability allows attackers to inject Malware into legitimate apps avoiding detection\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 9, 2017", "body": "Google fixed four dozen vulnerabilities this week, including a bug dubbed Janus that could be exploited by attackers to inject malicious code into Android apps without affecting an app\u2019s signature verification certificates.\n\nMillions of Android devices are at risk of a cyber attack due to this flaw (CVE-2017-13156), that allows attackers to secretly overwrite legitimate applications installed on victims\u2019 mobile devices with a malware.\n\nThe vulnerability was reported to Google by security researchers from mobile security firm GuardSquare this summer and has been fixed now as part of the December Android Security Bulletin.\n\nThe attack technique discovered by Guardsquare allows by bypass anti-malware protection mechanisms and escalate privileges on targeted devices using signed apps that appear to be from trusted publishers.\n\n\u201cA serious vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156) in Android allows attackers to modify the code in applications without affecting their signatures. The root of the problem is that a file can be a valid APK file and a valid DEX file at the same time. We have named it the Janus vulnerability, after the Roman god of duality.\u201d states the analysis published by Guardsquare.\n\nThe vulnerability affects in the way Android handles APK installation for some apps, allowing to add extra bytes of code to an APK file without modifying the app\u2019s signature.\n\nAn APK file is an archive, just like Zip, that includes application code, resources, assets, signatures, certificates, and manifest file.\n\nEarlier versions of Android (5.0 Lollipop and Marshmallow 6.0) also support a process virtual machine that helps to execute APK archives containing a compiled version of application code and files, compressed with DEX (Dalvik EXecutable) file format.\n\nWhile installing an app, the OS checks APK header information to determine if the archive contains code in the compressed DEX files. If the APK archive contains DEX files, the process virtual machine decompiles the code accordingly and executes it; otherwise, it runs the code as a regular APK file.\n\nIt turns out that an APK archive can contain DEX files as well as regular application code simultaneously, without affecting its validity and signatures.Researchers discovered that it is possible to add extra bytes of code to the archive due to lack of file integrity checking.\n\n\u201cThe Janus vulnerability stems from the possibility to add extra bytes to APK files and to DEX files. On the one hand, an APK file is a zip archive, which can contain arbitrary bytes at the start, before its zip entries (actually more generally, between its zip entries). The JAR signature scheme only takes into account the zip entries. It ignores any extra bytes when computing or verifying the application\u2019s signature.\u201d continue the analysis.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, a DEX file can contain arbitrary bytes at the end, after the regular sections of strings, classes, method definitions, etc. A file can, therefore, be a valid APK file and a valid DEX file at the same time.\u201d\n\nAttackers can prepend malicious code compiled in DEX format into an APK archive containing legitimate code with valid signatures, tricking app installation process to execute both codes on the device avoid detection.\n\nThe researchers developed a simple tool to create Janus applications as a proof of concept, the good news is that according to the experts, at this time, there are similar applications in the wild.\n\nThe Janus tool allows an attacker to inject an APK file with a malicious DEX (Dalvik Executable) file. DEX files make up the code inside Android programs that are zipped into single APKs.\n\nThe researchers described also possible attack scenarios, for example, an attacker can replace a trusted application with high privileges (i.e. a system app) by a modified update to abuse its permissions. Another attack scenario sees a hacker passing a modified clone of a sensitive application as a legitimate update, for instance in the context of banking or communications.\n\nAndroid versions older than Nougat (7.0) and any Android devices that support the APK signature scheme v1 are affected by the Janus vulnerability.\n\nThe Android devices updated to support APK signature scheme v2, introduced in July 2016, are not impacted.\n\nUnfortunately, most of Android users would not receive these patches for the next month, until their device manufacturers (OEMs) release custom updates for them.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Janus vulnerability, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"},

researchers has discovered a critical vulnerability in major mobile banking applications that left banking credentials vulnerable to hackers.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered by researchers of the Security and Privacy Group at the University of Birmingham, who analyzed hundreds of iOS and Android banking apps.\n\nThe experts discovered that several of them were vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThe list of affected banking apps includes Allied Irish bank, Co-op, HSBC, NatWest, and Santander.\n\nAn attacker sharing the same network segment of the victim could intercept SSL connection and retrieve the user\u2019s banking credentials even if the apps are using SSL pinning feature.\n\nResearchers found that due to the wrong implementation of the authentication process the apps were vulnerable to MITM attacks. The lack of hostname verification left many banking applications open to attacks because they were not able to check if they connected to a trusted source.\n\nThe apps fail to check that they connect to a URL having the hostname that matches the hostname in the digital certificate that the server exposes.\n\n\u201cAutomated tools do exist to test a variety of TLS flaws. Lack of certificate signature verification can be tested for by serving the client a self-signed certificate, lack of hostname verification by serving a valid certificate for a different hostname, and lack of certificate pinning can be checked for by adding a custom CA to the device\u2019s trust store. \u201d continues the paper. \n\n\u201cThese tests have been shown to be effective at finding vulnerabilities in apps [10] and poor TLS certificate validation [5]. However, none of these tools can detect the possibility that an app will pin to the root or intermediate certificate used but fail to validate the hostname\u201d\n\nThe experts created a new automated tool, dubbed Spinner, to test hundreds of banking apps quickly and without requiring purchasing certificates.\n\nThe tool leverages Censys IoT search engine for finding certificate chains for alternate hosts that only differ in the leaf certificate.\n\n\u201cGiven the certificate for a target domain, the tool queries for certificate chains for alternate hosts that only differ in the leaf certificate. The tool then redirects the traffic from the app under test to a website which has a certificate signed by the same CA certificate, but of course a different hostname (Common Name),\u201d continues the paper. \n\n\u201cIf the connection fails during the establishment phase then we know the app detected the wrong hostname. Whereas, if the connection is established and encrypted application data is transferred by the client before the connection fails then we know the app has accepted the hostname and is vulnerable.\u201d\n\nThe security experts with the help of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) notified all affected banks that addressed the issues before they publicly disclosed their findings.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 pinning, banking applications)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking-apps", "topic_name": "banking apps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mitm", "topic_name": "MITM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl-pinning", "topic_name": "SSL pinning"}]}, {"news_name": "31 Million of client records belonging to the virtual keyboard app AI.type leaked online", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66392/data-breach/keyboard-app-ai-type-data-leak.html", "title": "31 Million of client records belonging to the virtual keyboard app AI.type leaked online\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 6, 2017", "body": "This story reminds us that every time we download an app we are enlarging our surface of attack, in the majority of cases we are not aware of exact amount of data they collect and how they use them\n\nA group of researchers at the Kromtech Security Center has discovered online a huge trove of personal data belonging to more than 31 million users of the popular virtual keyboard app, AI.type.\n\nThe data was included in a MongoDB database that has been accidentally exposed online without any mechanism of protection.\n\n\u201cThe Kromtech Security Center has discovered a massive amount of customer files leaked online and publically available.

An attacker could trivially bypass this mechanism by tap-jacking this pop-up using publicly known methods to grant their applications the ability to capture the user\u2019s screen.\u201d added MWR.\n\n\u201cThis vulnerability would allow an attacker to capture the user\u2019s screen should the user tap of the SystemUI popup that has been overlayed by the attacker with an arbitrary message.\u201d \n\nGoogle patched the vulnerability only in Android Oreo Android Oreo (8.0), older versions are still affected by the bug.\n\nResearchers highlighted that the attack exploiting this flaw is not entirely undetectable. When an application gains access to the MediaProjection Service, it generates a Virtual Display which activates the screencast icon in the notification bar as the following image shows:\n\n\n\nIt is unclear if Google plans to fix the vulnerability also for older affected versions of Android, for this reason users should update their devices.\n\nMWR also provided a workaround to Android application developers that can address the issue by enabling the FLAG_SECURE layout parameter via the application\u2019s WindowManager. This would ensure that the content of the applications windows is treated as secure, preventing it from appearing in screenshots or from being viewed on non-secure displays.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android, MediaProjection service)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mediaprojection-service", "topic_name": "MediaProjection service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tap-jacking-attack", "topic_name": "tap-jacking attack"}]}, {"news_name": "Multi-Stage Android/TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY\u00a0Malware bypasses Google Play detection once again", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65608/malware/trojandropper-android-malware.html", "title": "Multi-Stage Android/TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY\u00a0Malware bypasses Google Play detection once again\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 16, 2017", "body": "Security experts at ESET have discovered a multi-stage Android malware, tracked as Android/TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY, that was available for download in the official Google Play store.\n\nThe researchers have found eight malicious applications in the official application store (MEX Tools, Clear Android, Cleaner for Android, World News, WORLD NEWS, World News PRO, \u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0442\u044b \u041e\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d, and \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0442\u044b \u041e\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d \u041a\u043b\u0443\u0431 \u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b), they appear as legitimate applications and use advanced anti-detection features.\n\n\u201cDetected by ESET security systems as Android/TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY, these apps form a new family of multi-stage Android malware, legitimate-looking and with delayed onset of malicious activity.\u201d states the analysis published by ESET.\n\nThe experts highlighted the use of advanced anti-detection features implemented by these apps that were downloaded only by several hundred users.\n\nThe Android/TrojanDropper.Agent.BKY samples analyzed by ESET employ a multi-stage architecture along with encryption.\n\nOnce downloaded and installed, the malicious apps do not request any suspicious permissions and even mimic the activity they were supposed to.\n\nIn background, the apps decrypt and execute a first-stage payload designed to decrypt and execute the second-stage payload from the assets of the app downloaded from Google Play.\n\nThe malware implements obfuscatory measures to remain under the radar.\n\nThe second-stage payload downloads a malicious application from a hardcoded URL it waits around 5 minutes before asking users to install the third-stage payload that masquerades as Adobe Flash Player or another popular app.\n\n\u201cThe app downloaded by the second-stage payload is disguised as well-known software like Adobe Flash Player or as something legitimate-sounding yet completely fictional \u2013 for example \u201cAndroid Update\u201d or \u201cAdobe Update\u201d.

These are actual masks used by the engineering team to train the neural network to protect against them in Face ID. It\u2019s incredible!\u201d, Phil Schiller said (Apple\u2019s Keynote September 2017, from 1:27:10 to 1:27:26).\n\nThe experts at the firm Bkav were able to unlock the iPhone X using a mask that re-creates the owner\u2019s face through a combination of 3D printed mask, makeup, and 2D images some \u201cspecial processing done on the cheeks and around the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mask is crafted by combining 3D printing with makeup and 2D images, besides some special processing on the cheeks and around the face, where there are large skin areas, to fool AI of Face ID\u201d.\u201d said Mr. Ngo Tuan Anh, Bkav\u2019s Vice President of Cyber Security.\n\n\n\nThe experts also published a proof-of-concept video, demonstrating how to unlock a brand-new iPhone X using the mask.\n\nThe mask is composed of silicone for the nose and 3D printing for some areas while special processing for others, the experts explained that they have understood how AI of Face ID works and how to bypass it.\n\u201cMany people in the world have tried different kinds of masks but all failed. It is because we understand how AI of Face ID works and how to bypass it,\u201d an FAQ on the Bkav website said.\n\n\u201cYou can try it out with your own iPhone X, the phone shall recognize you even when you cover a half of your face. It means the recognition mechanism is not as strict as you think, Apple seems to rely too much on Face ID\u2019s AI. We just need a half face to create the mask. It was even simpler than we ourselves had thought.\u201d\n\nThe researchers spent about five days after they got iPhone X on November 5th, the face used for the test belongs to one of the members of the team, and they haven\u2019t\u2019 trained the iPhone X to recognize any components of the mask.\n\n\u201cWe used a popular 3D printer. The nose was made by a handmade artist. We use 2D printing for other parts (similar to how we tricked Face Recognition 9 years ago). The skin was also hand-made to trick Apple\u2019s AI,\u201d the firm said.\n\nThe researchers highlighted that creating such a mask to unlock someone\u2019s iPhone is a time-consuming process, potential targets shall not be regular users, but persons of interest such as leaders of major corporations, national leaders, and billionaires.\n\nDan Goodin from ArsTechnica expressed some doubts about the hack, he believes the researchers and artist required the help of the target to create the mask.\n\n\u201cOne way of reading the responses suggests that the researchers and artist required the help of the target to create the mask, but in the future, the researchers think it will be possible to design similar masks that will instead require only the aid of 3D scans or photographs that could be taken without the target\u2019s knowledge or consent. If this interpretation is correct, the bypass is still interesting because it undermines Apple\u2019s contention that only a live face can be used to unlock a Face-ID enabled phone. But a hack that requires the help of the target would nonetheless suggest that for the time being, Face ID remains relatively secure.\u201d wrote Goodin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBkav researchers should publish a longer video that documents what was required to make the mask and whether it\u2019s able to fool Face ID immediately after a real face has been enrolled. Until then, it\u2019s impossible to say if this is a real hack.\u201d\n\nWaiting for improvements in the Apple\u2019s Face ID facial recognition technology, it is possible to use a passcode as an alternative to biometric authentication.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 iPhone X, Face ID)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/face-id", "topic_name": "Face ID"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facial-recognition", "topic_name": "facial recognition"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iphone-x", "topic_name": "iPhone X"}]}, {"news_name": "TOASTAMIGO \u2013 the first known strain of malware that uses the Toast Overlay exploit", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65391/malware/toastamigo-toast-overlay-attack.html", "title": "TOASTAMIGO \u2013 the first known strain of malware that uses the Toast Overlay exploit\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 10, 2017", "body": "Malware researchers at Trend Micro have spotted the first known strain of malware that triggers the recently patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-0752, that ties with the Toast Overlay attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered in September by security researchers with Palo Alto Networks Unit 42.\n\nThe experts reported that it is possible to abuse Android\u2019s toast notification, a feature that is used to provide feedback about an operation in a small short-lived pop up notification, to obtain admin rights on targeted phones and take over the device.\n\nThe vulnerability affects all versions of the Android operating system prior to the latest Android 8.0, (Oreo), nearly all Android users.\n\n\u201cWhat our researchers have found is a vulnerability that can be used to more easily enable an \u201coverlay attack,\u201d a type of attack that is already known on the Android platform. This type of attack is most likely to be used to get malicious software on the user\u2019s Android device.\u201d reads the analysis published by Palo Alto Networks. \u201cThis type of attack can also be used to give malicious software total control over the device. In a worst-case attack scenario, this vulnerability could be used to render the phone unusable (i.e., a \u201cbrick\u201d) or to install any kind of malware including (but not limited to) ransomware or information stealers. In simplest terms, this vulnerability could be used to take control of devices, lock devices and steal information after it is attacked.\u201d\n\nThe toast attack is exploitable for \u201coverlay\u201d attacks on Android phones, attackers use them to create a UI overlay to be displayed on top of legitimate Android applications and trick victims into providing sensitive information or clicking confirmation buttons.\n\n\n\n \n\nGoogle fixed the flaw in its monthly Android security updates.\n\nThis week, Trend Micro experts reported seeing the first piece of malware exploiting the Toast overlay flaw, for this reason, it was dubbed TOASTAMIGO. The Android malware was disguised as apps named Smart AppLocker that had been available on Google Play, it has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times before Google removed it.\n\nThe TOASTAMIGO app claims to secure devices with a PIN code, but once the victim installed it, the app requests Accessibility permissions and inform the user that they need to scan the phone for unsecure apps. The malware uses the Toast exploit to display a progress screen for the \u201cscan,\u201d while it executes commands from the attackers in background and installs a second-stage malware named by Trend Micro AMIGOCLICKER.\n\n\u201cThe malware ironically pose as legitimate app lockers that supposedly secure the device\u2019s applications with a PIN code. Upon installation, these apps will notify the user that they need to be granted Accessibility permissions for it to work. It\u2019s all a ruse to sidestep Android\u2019s countermeasure that requires apps to have explicit user permission.\u201d states Trend Micro. \u201cAfter granting permissions, the apps will launch a window to purportedly \u201canalyze\u201d the apps. Behind the scenes, however, the apps carry out actions or commands, including the installation of a second malware (since it already has the permissions).\u201d\n\n\n\nTOASTAMIGO also implements features to prevent its removal by security software. AMIGOCLICKER is able to collect Google accounts and perform other actions, including click on buttons in system dialogs, click on Facebook ads, and give itself a five-star rating on Google Play.\n\n\u201cThe miscellany of the malware\u2019s malicious functionalities, combined with a relatively unique attack vector, makes them credible threats. In fact, the aforementioned functionalities can actually be modified for further cyberattacks,\u201d Trend Micro researchers said in a blog post. \u201cSince TOASTAMIGO and AMIGOCLICKER can misuse Android\u2019s Accessibility feature to virtually do anything, this malware can update itself when getting the remote server\u2019s commands.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Toast Overlay attacks, Toastamigo app)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2017-0752", "topic_name": "CVE-2017-0752"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/toast-overlay-attacks", "topic_name": "Toast Overlay attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/toastamigo", "topic_name": "TOASTAMIGO"}]}, {"news_name": "Android Security Bulletin\u2014November 2017 \u2013 Google addresses critical flaws and high-risk KRACK vulnerabilities in Android", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65287/mobile-2/krack-android-security-bulletin.html", "title": "Android Security Bulletin\u2014November 2017 \u2013 Google addresses critical flaws and high-risk KRACK vulnerabilities in Android\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 8, 2017", "body": "Google released the Android Security Bulletin\u2014November 2017 that address 31 vulnerabilities, 9 of which are critical remote code execution flaws.\n\nThe Android Security Bulletin includes three different security patch levels.\n\n\u201cAndroid partners were notified of all issues in the 2017-11-01 and 2017-11-05 patch levels at least a month before publication.

Once the malicious code has obtained the accessibility permissions, it uses them to activate device administrator rights and set itself as the default Home application without the user\u2019s consent.\n\n\u201cSetting itself as a default home app \u2013 a launcher \u2013 is a trick that improves the malware\u2019s persistence. Whenever the user clicks on the home button, the ransomware gets activated and the device gets locked again. Thanks to using the accessibility service, the user doesn\u2019t know that they launch malware by hitting Home,\u201d explains \u0160tefanko.\n\nDoubleLockerr, once executed on the device, first changes the device PIN to a random value that neither crooks know nor stored anywhere. At the same time, the ransomware encrypts all the files using AES encryption algorithm, it appends the extension \u201c.cryeye\u201d to each file.\n\nUnfortunately, encryption process has no bugs making impossible to recover the files without receiving the encryption key from the crooks.\n\nThe ransomware demands 0.0130 BTC (approximately USD 73.83 at time of writing). the ransom payment must be completed within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nThe researchers highlighted that there is no way to unlock encrypted files for non-rooted devices, in this case, the unique way to clean the device is to factory-reset their phone.\n\nUsers with rooted Android devices with debugging mode enabled can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool to reset PIN without formatting their phones.\n\n\u201cFor rooted devices, however, there is a method to get past the PIN lock without a factory reset. For the method to work, the device needed to be in the debugging mode before the ransomware got activated.\u201d reads the analysis from ESET.\n\nAs usual, the best way to protect your device is to install applications only from trusted stores, like Google Play and pay attention to the reputation of the developers.\n\nBe vigilant with any links provided in an unsolicited email, SMS or instant messaging app message.\n\nDo not forget to install an antivirus app on your mobile device and keep all running software up-to-date.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Doublelocker ransomware, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/doublelocker", "topic_name": "DoubleLocker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Which are most frequently blacklisted apps by enterprises?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63826/mobile-2/blacklisted-apps-report.html", "title": "Which are most frequently blacklisted apps by enterprises?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 4, 2017", "body": "Mobile security firm Appthority published an interesting report that revealed which Android and iOS applications are most frequently blacklisted by enterprises.\n\nThe company Appthority has published an interesting report that reveals which mobile apps, both Android and iOS, are most frequently blacklisted by enterprises.\n\n\u201cThe mobile ecosystem in an enterprise comprises apps from managed devices, BYOD and COPE. Appthority compiled a list of the top 100 apps (50 iOS and 50 Android)\nbased on millions of scans of devices and apps in the enterprise. Using our Mobile Threat Protection solution, we determined the most common apps and their Mobile Threat Risk Scores\u201d states the report.\n\nAccording to the company, iOS apps are mainly blacklisted because many of them leak data. Whatsapp is the most commonly blacklisted iOS app because it sends information from the device\u2019s address book to a remote server.\n\nGiving a close look at the list of commonly blacklisted iOS apps, we can notice the presence of Pokemon GO, the risks for this app are related to the accesses to the device\u2019s address book and camera, and tracking of the user\u2019s location that poses users\u2019 privacy at risk.\n\nAnother app that is commonly blacklisted is WinZip, the reason is that the application sends SMS messages.\n\nThis type of behavior can pose a serious risk in an enterprise environment, especially if the data is transmitted without being encrypted.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see now which are commonly blacklisted apps for Android. The firth thing that is immediately verifiable is that most of the top blacklisted iOS apps are in the social networking and entertainment category, meanwhile, in the case of Android apps they are in the \u2018tools\u2019 category.\n\nThe most frequently blacklisted Android app is Poot, a tool used by its users to root their devices. Other commonly blacklisted applications are AndroidSystemTheme, Where\u2019s My Droid Pro, Weather, and Wild Crocodile Simulator.\n\nThe Android apps have been mainly blacklisted for data leakage or because they exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n\n\n \n\nAccording to the Appthority report based on the analysis of 150 apps used in enterprise environments, for 86.7% of Android apps the connections are to a server located in the United States, followed by Ireland (7.7%), Germany (2.1%) and Sweden (0.7%). In the case of iOS apps, nearly 94% of connections go to servers in the United States, followed by Ireland (3.82%), the Netherlands (0.86%) and Germany (0.86%).\n\n\u201cA top enterprise security concern is often the countries to which mobile data is being sent. These maps reveal the top locations to which backend servers are connecting via the top 150 mobile apps in enterprise environments.\nIn this quarter\u2019s data, we see a difference in the profile of backend connections between Android and iOS. \u201d continues the report.\n\n\u201cAndroid developers are connecting to a wider set of geographic locations, possibly leveraging lower cost structures overseas. Popular iOS apps have a much lower percentage of connections to countries such as China, Saudi Arabia and Chile than Android apps.\u201d\n\nThe situation is similar for iOS apps for which 94% of connections go to servers in the United States, followed by Ireland (3.82%), the Netherlands (0.86%) and Germany (0.86%).\n\nThe management of mobile devices in enterprise environments is a crucial aspect of their security posture, for this reason, it is essential to assess and evaluate the risks they bring.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look at the report, it also includes the list of the top 100 Android and iOS applications used in enterprises, along with their risk score.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 blacklisted apps, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blacklisted-apps", "topic_name": "blacklisted apps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/byod", "topic_name": "BYOD"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-leakage", "topic_name": "data leakage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Signal announces private contact discovery to improve users\u2019privacy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63536/mobile-2/signal-private-contact-discovery.html", "title": "Signal announces private contact discovery to improve users\u2019privacy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 28, 2017", "body": "Signal is considered the most secure instant messaging app, searching for it on the Internet it is possible to read the Edward Snowden\u2019 testimony:\n\n\u201cUse anything by Open Whisper Systems\u201d Snowden says.\n\nThe Cryptographer and Professor at Johns Hopkins University Matt Green and the popular security expert Bruce Schneier are other two admirers of the Signal app\n\nSignal was also approved by the U.S. Senate for official communications among staff members.\n\nOpen Whisper Systems aims to improve the contact discovery feature, currently when a user signs up for Signal, the phone numbers in their device\u2019s address book are compared to entries in a database on Open Whisper Systems servers to determine which interlocutors use Signal.\n\nThe verification uses truncated SHA256 hashes of the phone numbers, but as you know hashes can be cracked by attackers.\n\nEven if Open Whisper Systems does not log contact discovery requests, theoretically a persistent attacker (i.e. APT group) can modify the code on Signal servers and starts these requests.\n\nSignal developers are working to avoid such attack scenario leveraging in Intel\u2019s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology supported by modern Intel chips.\n\nThe SGX technology allows developers to protect a certain portion of code and data from disclosure or modifications. The code is placed in a secure memory area of execution dubbed \u201cenclave.\u201d\n\n\u201cModern Intel chips support a feature called Software Guard Extensions (SGX). SGX allows applications to provision a \u201csecure enclave\u201d that is isolated from the host operating system and kernel, similar to technologies like ARM\u2019s TrustZone. SGX enclaves also support a feature called remote attestation. Remote attestation provides a cryptographic guarantee of the code that is running in a remote enclave over a network.\u201d states Open Whisper Systems.\n\nThe idea of the Signal development team is to run contact discovery service in an SGX enclave.\n\nThe private contact discovery leveraging the SGX technology could be composed of the following steps at a high level:\n\nThe SGX also supports what \u201cremote attestation\u201d that allows the client to guarantee of the code that is running in a remote enclave over a network.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis would allow a server to stream media content to a client enclave with the assurance that the client software requesting the media is the \u201cauthentic\u201d software that will play the media only once, instead of custom software that reverse engineered the network API call and will publish the media as a torrent instead.\u201d continues Open Whisper Systems.\n\n\u201cSince the enclave attests to the software that\u2019s running remotely, and since the remote server and OS have no visibility into the enclave, the service learns nothing about the contents of the client request. It\u2019s almost as if the client is executing the query locally on the client device,\u201d .\n\nOpen Whisper Systems plans to integrate the feature in the next few months.\n\nIf you are interested in analyzing source code for the private contact discovery service you can visit the official GitHub repository.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 private contact discovery, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/private-contact-discovery", "topic_name": "private contact discovery"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/signal", "topic_name": "Signal"}]}, {"news_name": "iOS apps can access metadata revealing users\u2019 locations and much more", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63525/mobile-2/metadata-ios-apps.html", "title": "iOS apps can access metadata revealing users\u2019 locations and much more\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 28, 2017", "body": "The developer Felix Krause, founder of Fastlane.Tools, has discovered that iOS apps can access image metadata revealing users\u2019 location history.\n\nKrause published a detailed analysis on the Open Radar community, he explained that the app just needs to get permission to access the image library.\n\n\u201cIf an app gets permission to access the image library, it will get full access to all image metadata also, including the exact location.\u201d wrote Krause.\n\u201cThis is a serious privacy issue, as third party camera apps that want to just store a picture the user took, will also get full access to all photos and their locations in their image library.\u201d\n\nThe developer explained that it is too easy to access image metadata with the following procedure:\n\nThe expert also published a  proof-of-concept code at GitHub, he explained it was very easy to write it.\n\n\u201cDoes your iOS app have access to the user\u2019s image library?

The exploit is able to bypass SELinux and establish a root backdoor.\n\n\u201cWe worked on a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for Dirty COW last year and found out that all versions of the Android OS were susceptible to exploitation, while ZNIU\u2019s leveraging of Dirty COW only works on Android devices with ARM/X86 64-bit architecture. However, this recent exploit can bypass SELinux and plant a root backdoor, while the PoC can only modify the service code of the system.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cWe monitored six ZNIU rootkits, four of which were Dirty COW exploits. The other two were KingoRoot, a rooting app, and the Iovyroot exploit (CVE-2015-1805). ZNIU used KingoRoot and Iovyroot because they can root ARM 32-bit CPU devices, which the rootkit for Dirty COW cannot.\u201d\n\nThe malicious code is concealed behind an apparent porn app that once installed contact the C&C server to updates itself. The malware fetches the appropriate rootkits from the C&C server, use the exploit to escalate privileges and establish a backdoor.\n\nThe domain and command and control server used by the ZNIU malware is located in China.\n\nZNIU harvest the carrier information and starts interacting with the carrier through a SMS-enabled payment service. The malware operators collect money through the carrier\u2019s payment service, this specific service leveraging on SMS transactions is available only with carriers in China. This means that the malware would not be effective outside the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn one of our samples, we saw in its code that payments were directed to a dummy company, which, based on network traffic, we were able to locate in a city in China censored in the picture below. When the SMS transaction is over, the malware will delete the messages from the device, leaving no sign of the transaction between the carrier and the malware operator,\u201d states Trend Micro.\n\nAs usual, to stay safe install only apps from the Google Play or trusted third-party app stores, and use mobile security solutions\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dirty COW, ZNIU Android malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2016-5195", "topic_name": "CVE-2016-5195"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dirty-cow", "topic_name": "Dirty COW"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kernel", "topic_name": "kernel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linux", "topic_name": "LINUX"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rootkit", "topic_name": "rootkit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zniu", "topic_name": "ZNIU"}]}, {"news_name": "Premium SMS malware EXPENSIVEWALL infected millions of Android handsets", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63036/malware/expensivewall-android-malware.html", "title": "Premium SMS malware EXPENSIVEWALL infected millions of Android handsets\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 15, 2017", "body": "Google has removed 50 malicious apps from the official Play Store after experts with security firm Check Point discovered a new malware, dubbed ExpensiveWall,  eluded the checks of the Google\u2019s Bouncer.\n\nThe ExpensiveWall malware was found in the Lovely Wallpaper app,  it includes a payload that registers victims for paid online services and sends premium SMS messages from their devices. The malicious code was discovered in 50 apps on the Play Store that were downloaded by between 1 million and 4.2 million users.\n\n\u201cCheck Point\u2019s mobile threat research team identified a new variant of an Android malware that sends fraudulent premium SMS messages and charges users\u2019 accounts for fake services without their knowledge.\u201d states the analysis shared by Check Point researchers.\n\n\u201cThe new strain of malware is dubbed \u201cExpensiveWall,\u201d after one of the apps it uses to infect devices, \u201cLovely Wallpaper.\u201d \u201c\n\n\n\nThe malware is not totally new to security experts, malware researchers with McAfee first spotted it in the Play Store in January, but they highlighted that the payloads have significant differences.\n\nThe ExpensiveWall authors encrypted and compressed the malicious code in order to by bypass Google\u2019s automated checking processes, and they succeeded!\n\nOnce the application is installed by the victims, it requests the permission to access the internet and send and receive SMS messages. Then ExpensiveWall sends back to the C&C server handset information, including its location, MAC and IP addresses, IMSI, and IMEI numbers.\n\nThe C&C server, in turn, sends the malware a URL that it opens in an embedded WebView window and downloads the JavaScript code used to send the premium SMS messages.\n\nAccording to Check Point researchers, the malicious code is spread to different applications as a software development kit called GTK.\n\n\u201cAfter analyzing different samples of the malware, Check Point mobile threat researchers believe ExpensiveWall is spread to different apps as an SDK called \u201cgtk,\u201d which developers embed in their own apps. Three versions of apps containing the malicious code exist. The first is the unpacked version, which was discovered earlier this year. The second is the packed version, which is being discussed here, and the third contains the code but does not actively use it.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nCheck Point reported the discovery to Google on August 7, 2017, and the company promptly removed the malicious apps from Google Play Store.

The unique condition for BlueBorne attacks is that targeted devices must have Bluetooth enabled.\n\nThe new attack technique, dubbed BlueBorne, was devised by experts with Armis Labs. Researchers have discovered a total of eight vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth design that expose devices to cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cArmis Labs revealed a new attack vector endangering major mobile, desktop, and IoT operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux, and the devices using them. The new vector is dubbed \u201cBlueBorne\u201d, as it spread through the air (airborne) and attacks devices via Bluetooth.\u201d reads the analysis published by Amis  Labs.\n\n\u201cArmis has also disclosed eight related zero-day vulnerabilities, four of which are classified as critical. BlueBorne allows attackers to take control of devices, access corporate data and networks, penetrate secure \u201cair-gapped\u201d networks, and spread malware laterally to adjacent devices. Armis reported these vulnerabilities to the responsible actors, and is working with them as patches are being identified and released.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe attacker needs to determine the operating system running on the targeted device in order to use the correct exploit.\n\nA hacker in range of the targeted device can trigger one of the Bluetooth implementation issues for malicious purposes, including remote code execution and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.\n\nAccording to the experts, in order to launch a BlueBorne attack, it is not necessary to trick the victim into clicking on a link or opening a malicious file.\n\nThe attack is stealthy and victims will not notice any suspicious activity on their device. Unfortunately, most current security solutions fail in detecting the malicious activity.\n\n\u201cAirborne attacks, unfortunately, provide a number of opportunities for the attacker. First, spreading through the air renders the attack much more contagious, and allows it to spread with minimum effort. Second, it allows the attack to bypass current security measures and remain undetected, as traditional methods do not protect from airborne threats. Airborne attacks can also allow hackers to penetrate secure internal networks which are \u201cair gapped,\u201d meaning they are disconnected from any other network for protection. This can endanger industrial systems, government agencies, and critical infrastructure.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cFinally, unlike traditional malware or attacks, the user does not have to click on a link or download a questionable file. No action by the user is necessary to enable the attack.\u201d\n\nThe researchers have discovered information disclosure and code execution flaws in Linux, four code execution, MitM and information disclosure vulnerabilities in Android (CVE-2017-0781, CVE-2017-0782, CVE-2017-0783 and CVE-2017-0785), one vulnerability that allows MitM attacks in Windows (CVE-2017-8628) and one code execution flaw in the Bluetooth Low Energy Audio protocol used by iOS.\n\nThe attack vector could be exploited by threat actors to deliver malware with wormable capabilities.\n\nArmis demonstrated that it is also possible for an attacker to exploit one BlueBorne vulnerability to launch MitM attacks against Windows machines and hijack the victim\u2019s browsing session to a phishing website.\n\n\n\nIn the following video, a hacker can exploit the BlueBorne flaw to take over a Samsung smartwatch running the Tizen OS.\n\n\n\nGoogle patched the vulnerabilities in Android with its September security updates, Microsoft should do it on Tuesday. highlighted that Apple has already addressed the vulnerabilities with the release of iOS 10, but earlier versions of the Apple OS remain vulnerable to the BlueBorne attack.\n\nThe development teams of Linux distributions are working to address the issues.\n\nFurther information is available on the BlueBorne technical paper published by Armis.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Bluetooth hacking, BlueBorne attack)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blueborne-attack", "topic_name": "BlueBorne attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bluetooth-hacking", "topic_name": "Bluetooth hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mitm", "topic_name": "MITM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "Toast Overlay attacks, a Cloak and Dagger with No Permissions, fixed by Google", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62925/hacking/toast-overlay-attacks.html", "title": "Toast Overlay attacks, a Cloak and Dagger with No Permissions, fixed by Google\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 11, 2017", "body": "Security researchers with Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, warned of a high-severity Android vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-0752, that ties with the \u201ctoast attack\u201d overlay vulnerability.\n\nThe experts reported that it is possible to abuse Android\u2019s toast notification, a feature that is used to provide feedback about an operation in a small short-lived pop up notification, to obtain admin rights on targeted phones and take over the device.\n\nThe vulnerability affects all versions of the Android operating system prior to the latest Android 8.0, (Oreo), nearly all Android users.\n\n\u201cWhat our researchers have found is a vulnerability that can be used to more easily enable an \u201coverlay attack,\u201d a type of attack that is already known on the Android platform. This type of attack is most likely to be used to get malicious software on the user\u2019s Android device.\u201d reads the analysis published by Palo Alto Networks. \u201cThis type of attack can also be used to give malicious software total control over the device. In a worst-case attack scenario, this vulnerability could be used to render the phone unusable (i.e., a \u201cbrick\u201d) or to install any kind of malware including (but not limited to) ransomware or information stealers. In simplest terms, this vulnerability could be used to take control of devices, lock devices and steal information after it is attacked.\u201d\n\nThe toast attack is exploitable for \u201coverlay\u201d attacks on Android phones, attackers use them to create a UI overlay to be displayed on top of legitimate Android applications and trick victims into providing sensitive information or clicking confirmation buttons.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe overlay attack can also be exploited to trigger a denial-of-service condition by creating a toast window that overlays an entire screen of the mobile device.\n\nA toast-type overlay is similar to the Cloak and Dagger attack method that was discovered earlier this year.\n\n\u201cCloak & Dagger is a new class of potential attacks affecting Android devices. These attacks allow a malicious app to completely control the UI feedback loop and take over the device \u2014 without giving the user a chance to notice the malicious activity. These attacks only require two permissions that, in case the app is installed from the Play Store, the user does not need to explicitly grant and for which she is not even notified. Our user study indicates that these attacks are practical. These attacks affect all recent versions of Android (including the latest version, Android 7.1.2), and they are yet to be fixed.\u201d states the researchers.\n\nCloak and Dagger attacks abuse the following basic Android permissions:\n\nThe Toast overlay attacks are quite similar but do not require specific Android permissions to be granted by users.\n\n\u201cOverlay attacks permit an attacker to draw on top of other windows and apps running on the affected device. To launch such an attack, malware normally needs to request the \u201cdraw on top\u201d permission\u201d reads the analysis from PaloAlto Networks.\n\n\u201cThis newly discovered overlay attack does not require any specific permissions or conditions to be effective. Malware launching this attack does not need to possess the overlay permission or to be installed from Google Play. With this new overlay attack, malware can entice users to enable the Android Accessibility Service and grant the Device Administrator privilege or perform other dangerous actions,\u201d\n\nThe Google\u2019s September Android Security Bulletin already addresses the CVE-2017-0752 flaw.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Toast Overlay attacks, CVE-2017-0752)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2017-0752", "topic_name": "CVE-2017-0752"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/toast-overlay-attacks", "topic_name": "Toast Overlay attacks"}]}, {"news_name": "DolphinAttack \u2013 Hackers control Siri, Google Now, Alexa voice assistants with ultrasound", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62838/hacking/dolphinattack-ultrasound-mobile.html", "title": "DolphinAttack \u2013 Hackers control Siri, Google Now, Alexa voice assistants with ultrasound\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 8, 2017", "body": "A team of researchers from the Chinese Zhejiang University has demonstrated how to control several popular speech recognition systems using ultrasound.\n\nThe attack technique was dubbed \u2018DolphinAttack\u2019, it was successfully tested against Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Now, Huawei HiVoice, Microsoft Cortana, Samsung S Voice,  and also the speech recognition system installed an Audi Q3 models.\n\n\n\nThe researchers were able to modulate various voice commands on ultrasonic carriers making them inaudible to humans.

The malware is associated with the high-profile Xsser / mRAT malware, which made headlines after targeting both iOS and Android devices of pro-democracy Hong Kong activists in late 2014.\u201d reads the analysis published by Lookout.\n\nxRAT has many similarities with mRAT, it has the same structure and uses the same decryption key. The analysis of the code revealed that both malware uses the same naming conventions that suggest both malicious codes were developed by the same threat actor.\n\n\n\nAccording to researchers from security firm Lookout, the command and control (C&C) servers used for the xRAT malware is the same of a Windows malware,  a circumstance that suggests the threat actor is composed of experienced experts.\n\nThe xRAT mobile Trojan seems to be specifically developed to target political groups, it includes detection evasion and implements common spying features, including the ability to gather data from instant messaging applications such as WeChat and QQ.\n\n\u201cLike mRAT, xRAT supports an impressive set of capabilities that include flexible reconnaissance and information gathering, detection evasion, specific checks for antivirus, app and file deletion functionality, and other functionality listed below. It also searches for data belonging to popular communications apps like QQ and WeChat. The threat actors themselves are able to remotely control much of its functionality in real time (e.g., which files to retrieve and what the settings of its automatic file retrieval module should be). \u201d continues the analysis.\n\nBelow the complete list of features implemented by the xRAT mobile malware.\n\nTo avoid detection, the xRAT implements a \u201csuicide\u201d function that could be triggered to clean the installation on the infected mobile device.

After analyzing recently acquired samples, we further identified attacker infrastructure on the East Coast of the United States.

Affected users in South Korea have not reported downloads or attempted installation of additional APK files. This suggest that the fake update functionality is probably not implemented or is at least not currently used by the malware authors.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe MoqHao banking Trojan was first spotted in January, likely it was just a test version that was continuously updated in February and March arriving at a stable release in May.\n\nExperts linked the malware to a hacking campaign that in May 2015 targeted users in South Korea via a phishing message in the default web browser.\n\nAlthough the two malwares have very similar behaviors, they have completely different code bases.\n\n\u201cThe similarities between the 2015 and 2017 phishing campaigns suggests the same cybercriminals, who have shifted from DNS redirection attacks to a smishing campaign.

The malicious code also checks which apps the victim is using and when detects the launch of an app whose interface it can clone, it overlays the app with a fake user interface.\n\nThe fake user interface presented by Faketoken.q prompts victims to enter their payment card data, including the bank\u2019s verification code.\n\nResearchers observed that the malware is able to display fake interface for many mobile banking apps and other applications, such as:\n\nThe Trojan is able to intercept the incoming SMS messages to obtain the SMS code sent by the bank to authorize transactions, then it forwards the code to C&C server.\n\nIt seems that Faketoken.q has been developed to target Russian-speaking users because it only uses the Russian language on the user interface.\n\nTo avoid being infected by Faketoken and apps similar malware, do not install applications from third-party stores and pay attentions to unsolicited SMSs and email messages you receive on your mobile device.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Faketoken, Android malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking-malware", "topic_name": "Banking Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/faketoken", "topic_name": "Faketoken"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Google adds Anti-Phishing feature also to Gmail app for iOS", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62029/mobile-2/anti-phishing-gmail-app-ios.html", "title": "Google adds Anti-Phishing feature also to Gmail app for iOS\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 15, 2017", "body": "Phishing continues to be one of the most dangerous threats, crooks continue to devise new techniques to trick victims into providing sensitive information.

In this modification, the cybercriminals have added new functionality: it now also works as a keylogger, stealing entered text through the use of accessibility services.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\nThe Accessibility Services is an Android feature that provides user interface (UI) enhancements for users with disabilities or those temporarily unable to interact with a device.\n\nThis new feature allows the Svpeng Trojan to log all keystrokes on the device and to get the malware obtaining more permissions and rights to prevent victims from uninstalling it.\n\nIn November 2016 the number of Android devices infected with the Svpeng banking trojan was more than 318,000 worldwide. Crooks exploited a Chrome Zero-Day vulnerability to deliver the Android Svpeng Trojan to Android users via Google AdSense.\n\nIn May, malware researchers discovered another attack technique dubbed Cloak and Dagger attack that exploit the Android\u2019s Accessibility Services to silently take full control of the infected devices.\n\nThe new strain of the Svpeng Trojan has already infected devices in 23 countries, including Russia (29%), Germany (27%), Turkey (15%), Poland (6%) and France (3%).\n\nThe malware researchers noticed that the malware doesn\u2019t perform malicious actions on devices belonging to Russian users.\n\nThe Svpeng Trojan distinguish Russian users by checking the device\u2019s language. If the language is Russian, the malware doesn\u2019t perform further malicious tasks.\n\nThis circumstance suggests the gang behind the threat is Russian.\n\nThe latest variant of the Svpeng discovered in July was being distributed through malicious websites that disguised as a fake Flash Player.\n\n\n\nOnce installed, the malware asks the device to use Accessibility Services that allows it grants itself device administrator rights, displays an overlay on the top of legitimate apps. The malware is also able to grant itself some dynamic permissions, such as the ability to make calls, send and receive SMS, and access the victim\u2019s contacts.\n\n\u201cUsing accessibility services allows the Trojan to get access to the UI of other apps and to steal data from them, such as the names of the interface elements and their content, if it is available. This includes entered text. Furthermore, it takes screenshots every time the user presses a button on the keyboard, and uploads them to the malicious server. It supports not only the standard Android keyboard but also a few third-party keyboards.\u201d states Kaspersky.\n\n\u201cSome apps, mainly banking ones, do not allow screenshots to be taken when they are on top. In such cases, the Trojan has another option to steal data \u2013 it draws its phishing window over the attacked app. It is interesting that, in order to find out which app is on top, it uses accessibility services too.\u201d\n\nThe researchers intercepted an encrypted configuration file from the malware\u2019s C&C server, the analysis of the file allowed them to identify other apps targeted by the Svpeng Trojan along with phishing URLs to overlay them.\n\nThe config file decrypted by the experts contained a phishing URL for the PayPal and eBay mobile apps to steal credentials and URLs for banking apps from different countries:\n\nThe file also allows the malware to receive various commands from the C&C server, including instructions:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Svpeng Trojan, Android malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/keylogger", "topic_name": "keylogger"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/svpeng-trojan", "topic_name": "Svpeng Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Experts spotted Triada Trojan in firmware of low-cost Android smartphones", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/61467/malware/triada-trojan-android-smartphones.html", "title": "Experts spotted Triada Trojan in firmware of low-cost Android smartphones\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 29, 2017", "body": "Another case of pre-installed malware make the headlines, malware researchers at the Russian anti-virus firm Dr.Web have spotted the Triada Trojan in the firmware of several low-cost Android smartphones, including Leagoo M5 Plus, Leagoo M8, Nomu S10, and Nomu S20.\n\nExperts speculate that threat actors compromised the supply chain infecting a small number of smartphones of the above models.\n\n\u201cVirus analytics from Dr.Web detected a malicious program built into the firmware of several mobile devices running Android. The Trojan called Android.Triada.231 is embedded into one of the system libraries. It penetrates processes of all running applications and can secretly download and run additional modules.\u201d reads the analysis published by Dr Web.\n\n\n\nThe Triada Trojan was found inside the Android OS Zygote core process, the component used to launch programs on mobile devices.\n\n\u201cBy infecting Zygote, Trojans embed into processes of all running applications get their privileges and function as part of applications. Then, they secretly download and launch malicious modules.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe Triada trojan was first discovered in March 2016 by researchers at Kaspersky Lab that at time recognized it as the most advanced mobile threat ever seen.  The range of techniques used by the threat to compromise mobile devices was not implemented in any other known mobile malware.\n\nTriada was designed with the specific intent to implement financial frauds, typically hijacking the financial SMS transactions. The most interesting characteristic of the Triada Trojan apart is the modular architecture, which gives it theoretically a wide range of abilities.\n\n\n\nOnce the malware was initialized it sets up some parameters, creates a working directory, and checks the environment it is running. If the malware is running in the Dalvik environment, it hooks up one of the system methods to track the start of all applications and perform malicious activity immediately after they start.\n\n\u201cThe main function of Android.Triada.231 is to secretly run additional malicious modules that can download other Trojan components. To run additional modules, Android.Triada.231 checks if there is a special subdirectory in the working directory previously created by the Trojan. The subdirectory name should include the MD5 value of the software package name of the application, into the process of which the Trojan is infiltrated.\u201d states the analysis.\n\nExperts at Dr Web explained that the Triada Trojan cannot be deleted using standard methods because it is hidden into one of the libraries of the operating system and located in the system section.

Although there are many Android anti-malware solutions available in the market, almost all of them are based on malware signatures, and more advanced solutions based on machine learning techniques are not deemed to be practical for the limited computational resources of mobile devices.\n\nThere are many reasons for a user to have an intelligent security tool capable of identifying potential malware on the device.\n\n1. The Google Play Store is not totally free of malware. Many zero-day mobile malware has been found in Google Play in the past.\n\n2. Third-party app stores are popular among mobile users. Nevertheless, security checks on the third-party stores are not as effective as those available on the Google Play Store.\n\n3. It is quite often that users can be dodged by fake tempting titles like free games when browsing the web, so that applications are downloaded and installed directly on devices from untrusted websites.\n\n4. Another source of infection is phishing SMS messages that contain links to malicious applications. Recent reports by Lookout and Google show how a targeted attack malware, namely Pegasus(Chrysaor), which is suspected of infecting devices via a phishing attack, could remain undetected for a few years.\n\n5. One of the main concerns for any computing device in the industry is to make sure that the device a user buys is free of malware. Mobile devices make no exception, and securing the supply chain is paramount difficult, for the number of people and companies involved in the supply chain of the components.\nThere is a recent report that shows how some malware was added to Android devices somewhere along the supply chain before the user received the phone.\n\n6. Almost all of the Android anti-malware\nproducts are mostly signature-based, which lets both malware variants of known families, and zero-day threats to devices. There are claims by a few Android anti-malware vendors that they use machine learning approaches, even if no detail is\navailable on the mechanisms that are actually implemented on the device.\n\n7. Offline machine learning systems would fail against wrapper/downloder malware\nas the wrapper/downloader app usually doesn\u2019t reveal enough malicious activities.\n\nIntelliAV (http://www.intelliav.com) is a practical intelligent anti-malware solution for Android devices based on the open-source and multi-platform TensorFlow library.\nThe detail of the system can be found in a paper that the authors will present at CD-MAKE 2017 conference in September at Reggio Calabria, Italy.\n\nIntelliAV does not aim to propose yet another learning-based system for Android malware detection, but by leveraging on the existing literature, they tested the feasibility of having an on-device intelligent anti-malware tool to tackle the deficiencies of existing\nAndroid anti-malware products, mainly based on pattern matching techniques.\nThe architecture of the proposed IntelliAV system is depicted as follows:\nits design consists of two main phases, namely offline training the model, and then its operation on the device to detect potential malware samples.\nAs the first phase, a classification model is built offline, by resorting to a conventional\ncomputing environment. It is not necessary to perform the training phase on the device because it has to be performed on a substantial set of samples whenever needed to take into account the evolution of malware. The number of times the model needs to be updated should be quite small, as reports by AV-TEST showed that just the 4% of the total number of Android malware is actually new malware.\nAs the second phase, the model is embedded in the IntelliAV Android application that will provide a risk score for each application on the device.\n\n\n\nIntelliAV can scan all of the installed applications on the device, and verify their risk scores (Quick Scan). In addition, when a user downloads an apk, it can be analyzed by IntelliAV before installation to check the related risk score, and take the appropriate decision (Custom Scan).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nChallenging Modern AV vendors\n\nBased on the recent reports by Virustotal, there is an increase in the number of anti-malware developers that resort to machine learning approaches for malware detection. However, the main focus of these products appears to be on desktop malware, especially Windows PE malware. Based on the available public information, there are just a few pieces of evidence of two anti-malware developers that use machine learning approaches for Android malware detection, namely Symantec and TrustLook. Their products are installed by more than 10 million users. While it is not clear how these products use machine learning, the authors considered them as two candidates for\ncomparison with IntelliAV. To provide a sound comparison, in addition to the Symantec and Trustlook products, the authors selected three other Android anti-malware products, i.e., AVG, Avast, and Qihoo 360, that are the most popular among\nAndroid users as they have been installed more than 100 million times. the authors\ncompared the performances of IntelliAV on 2311 recent Android malware\n(between January to March 2017).\n\n\n\nAs an independent test, IntelliAV has been tested by AV-TEST on 500 recent and common Android malware in July 2017.\nInteresting, they could achieve 96% detection rate although the last model update of IntelliAV is December 2016, which shows the power of IntelliAV on detecting unknown malware.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author Mansour Ahmadi\n\nIntelliAV has been developed at the University of Cagliari, Italy, by Mansour Ahmadi, Angelo Sotgiu, and Giorgio Giacinto.

Unfortunately, that also means that Android phones have as many instances of malware as desktop and laptop computers. In 2016, Kaspersky Lab registered nearly 40 million attacks by malicious mobile software. Since smartphones are essentially full computers in your pocket, the bad guys are able to use many of the same techniques and in sometimes even the same tools! In late 2015 researchers at Avast discovered bad guys using the OmniRat remote administration tool (RAT) to compromise Android phones. On its own OmniRat is not malicious. It is a very capable tool for IT folks to provide remote support for Android users and even allows for remote access to Windows, Linux and Mac systems. It was also a very good tool for the bad guys to access your systems.\n\nAfter several quiet months, OmniRat variants have been spotted in the wild and the software has benefitted from some significant updates since we last saw it. Dubbed GhostCtrl by Trend Micro researchers, it can do some \u201ctraditional\u201d mobile malware things like:\n\nAs well as some very cool, and scary new things like:\n\n\u201cThe information-stealing RETADUP worm that affected Israeli hospitals is actually just part of an attack that turned out to be bigger than we first thought\u2014at least in terms of impact. It was accompanied by an even more dangerous threat: an Android malware that can take over the device.\u201d states the analysis from Trend Micro.\n\n\u201cDetected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_GHOSTCTRL.OPS / ANDROIDOS_GHOSTCTRL.OPSA, we\u2019ve named this Android backdoor GhostCtrl as it can stealthily control many of the infected device\u2019s functionalities.\u201d\n\nThis is scary enough \u2014 especially when you consider that there are a lot of bad guys out there that are only now starting to think of creative ways to exploit these new capabilities \u2014 GhostCtrl doesn\u2019t limit itself to Android devices. Compromising a smartphone gives you access to a powerful computer, but most bad guys are after information. GhostCtrl comes with the RETADUP worm which was recently discovered stealing information from Windows systems in Israeli hospitals.\n\n\u201cGhostCtrl\u2019s combination with an information-stealing worm, while potent, is also telling. The attackers tried to cover their bases, and made sure that they didn\u2019t just infect endpoints. And with the ubiquity of mobile devices among corporate and everyday end users, GhostCtrl\u2019s capabilities can indeed deliver the scares.\u201d continues Trend Micro.\n\nHow Do You Get Infected?\n\nGhostCtrl comes as an Android Application Package (APK) masquerading as a legitimate Android app such as WhatsApp, Pokemon Go, MMS \u2014 anything that will appeal to users. When the wrapper APK is launched, it decodes text from the resource file, writes this string as another APK and then launches this Malicious APK prompting the user to install it. It is easy to see how a user could be fooled or confused as to what file is asking to be installed and proceeding. Once the malicious software is installed the wrapper APK runs it as a service with no visible icon allowing the malware to run silently in the background.\n\n\n\nOnce the malicious application is running in the background, it contacts Command and Control (C&C) servers on the Internet to determine its next actions as described above. Depending on the infected target and the motivations of the bad guys the GhostCtrl malware could be used for any number of malicious activities. If the infected phone is only used by an individual at home, ransomeware at the lock screen or pay-for-use SMS messaging is a good bet. However, since GhostCtrl has also been linked with RETADUP, bad guys could find themselves with an Android-based back channel into a Windows environment inside an enterprise, which offers many more opportunities for money making.\n\nThere have already been three versions of the GhostCtrl RAT identified in the wild, each adding features and capabilities to the previous version.

Investigators suspected that Russian-speaking individuals were responsible for the Operation Emmental due clues discovered in the source code analyzed.\n\nThe hackers behind the Operation Emmental have continued to improve their malicious codes. The hackers used on Android malware and a Windows banking Trojan tracked as Retefe and WERDLOD.\n\nThe novelty in the operation of the group is represented by the usage of a new variant of the Dok malware in a new wave of attacks against the Swiss banks.\n\nThe malicious code is delivered via email, once the DOK malware infects a macOS system, it gains administrative privileges and installs a new root certificate. The root certificate allows the malicious code to intercept all victim\u2019s communications, including SSL encrypted traffic.\n\nAccording to researchers at Trend Micro, the malware variant tracked as OSX_DOK.C is configured to hijack traffic only if the victim\u2019s external IP is located in Switzerland.  OSX_DOK.C redirects users to bogus login pages for the financial organizations whose domain is included in a hardcoded list.\n\n\u201cThe OSX_DOK malware (Detected by Trend Micro as OSX_DOK.

SpyDealer uses exploits from a commercial rooting app to gain root privilege, which enables the subsequent data theft.\u201d states the analysis published by PaloAlto Network.\n\nSpyDealer steals messages from communication apps using the Android accessibility service feature and leverages the exploits from a commercial rooting app called Baidu Easy Root to gain rooting privileges and to maintain persistence on the target.\n\nThe mobile malware only works Android versions from 2.2 up to 4.4 releases (roughly 25% of all Android devices), that are the versions supported by the rooting tool.\n\nOnce installed, the malware registers \u201ctwo broadcast receivers to listen for events related to the device booting up and network connection status.\u201d\n\nEven when the malware is not able to root the device, it is able to steal a significant amount of sensitive data.\n\nAttackers can remotely control the infected Android device via UDP, TCP and SMS channels.\n\n\n\nThe SpyDealer Trojan can gather a huge quantity of information from the target devices, including the phone number, IMEI, IMSI, SMS, MMS, contacts, accounts, phone call history, location, and connected Wi-Fi information. It can also answer incoming phone calls from a specific number, can record phone calls and the surrounding audio and video, can take photos with the device\u2019s cameras, monitor location, and take screenshots.\n\nThe malware is also able to answer calls from a specific number, can record phone calls and can work as a spying device, recording calls and the surrounding audio and video, it can also take photos using device\u2019s cameras, take screenshots, and track the device location.\n\nThe good news is that SpyDealer isn\u2019t distributed through the official Google Play store, the malware experts observed Chinese users being infected compromised wireless networks.\n\nPaloAlto Networks believe the malware is under active development, the researchers already detected 1,046 samples of SpyDealer belonging to at least three differed variants.\n\nThe first variant spotted is dated back October, 2015, the last one was created in May, 2017, this means that the SpyDealer Trojan has been active for more than 18 months.\n\n\u201cAs of June 2017, we have captured 1046 samples of SpyDealer.

Check Point researchers estimate that the malware generated $1.5 million for the group behind the campaign.\u201d\n\nResearchers with Check Point\u2019s Mobile Research Team spotted CopyCat in March, the largest number of infections is in Southeast Asia (55%) and Africa (18%), but the infections in the US are increasing.\n\nAttackers spread the malware by trojanizing popular apps that were made available for download on third-party app stores.\n\nOnce installed on the target mobile device, the malware waits for it reboot, then it downloads a series of exploits from an Amazon S3 bucket in order to root the device.\n\n\u201cOnce the device has restarted, CopyCat downloads an \u201cupgrade\u201d pack from an S3 bucket, a web storage service provided by Amazon. This pack contains six common exploits with which the malware attempts to root the device.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cIf successful, CopyCat installs another component to the device\u2019s system directory, an activity which requires root permissions, and establishes persistency, making it difficult to remove\u201d\n\nThe malicious code injects code into the Zygote process in the Android core that launches apps, with this technique the attackers gain admin privileges.\n\nCopyCat isn\u2019t the first malware targeting Zygote, in 2016 experts at Kaspersky and at Checkpoint found the Triada Android Trojan using the same technique.\n\nAccording to the experts at Check Point, the authors of the CopyCat malware use to inject code into the Zygote process to get credit for fraudulently installed apps on the device by swapping out referrer IDs for legitimate apps with their own.\n\nThe crooks also earn money by displaying fake ads and installs fake apps.\n\nThe analysis of C&C servers revealed that between April and May the attackers served fake ads to 3.8 million of the devices while crooks were stealing credit for installing apps on Google Play from 4.4 million of other devices.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that the CopyCat malware used a bulk of old exploits to root millions of devices, such as the Towelroot, other exploits were from 2014 and 2013. This means that the success of the CopyCat attack that possible due to a large number of unpatched devices.\n\n\n\nMalware experts believe that the Chinese MobiSummer ad network could be behind the CopyCat malware.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear who is behind the CopyCat attack, however, there are several connections to MobiSummer, an ad network located in China. It is important to note that while these connections exist, it does not necessarily mean the malware was created by the company, and it is possible the perpetrators behind it used MobiSummer\u2019s code and infrastructure without the firm\u2019s knowledge.\u201d states the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe first connection between the company and the malware is the server, which operates both the malware and some of MobiSummer\u2019s activity. In addition, some of the malware\u2019s code is signed by MobiSummer itself, and some of the remote services used by the malware were created by the company.

But when the software is malware, an update could be the worst thing to do. The Google Play Store is always working to prevent malware from being downloaded by unsuspecting users and recently two apps built with the Ztorg malware were removed. The two apps, \u201cMagic Browser\u201d and \u201cNoise Detector,\u201d are believed to have been benign when they were originally uploaded to the Play Store, but the bad guys were updated the software using the malware toolkit over time.\n\n\n\nThe Ztorg Malware toolkit was identified by Kaspersky Labs in September, 2016 with \u201cGuide for Pok\u00e9mon Go.\u201d At the time it was identified the Guide had been downloaded over 500,000 times and researchers estimate at least 6,000 successful infections. Since that time, dozens of apps associated with Ztorg have been distributed and eventually removed from the Google Play Store. And like all good developers, the bad guys using Ztorg are adding features and capabilities over time.\n\nOnce the initial app is installed, it utilizes a wide range of advanced techniques to evade detection, get updates from the Command and Control infrastructure and ultimately try to get Root on the phone. From Fortinet researchers:\n\nWhat happens when your smartphone is infected with a Ztorg trojan? Like most malware, the bad guys\u2019 ultimate objective is to make money. Initial Ztorg trojans leveraged AdWare to generate money for the bad guys through legitimate advertising networks. Some of the techniques included redirecting webpages, messing with search results and collecting information about what sites you visit. These are legitimate, if unwanted, business activities, but in the case of the bad guys distributing trojan apps, the users participate unknowingly. The bad guys get all the profits, and the users get a poorly performing phone, that may even become unstable or unusable.\n\nThe two apps recently removed from the Google Play Store, \u201cMagic Browser\u201d and \u201cNoise Detector\u201d show an evolution of Ztorg Trojan capabilities and include some nifty new techniques for making illegitimate money. Premium Rate SMS is a business model where an individual sends a specific text message and the fees are automatically charged to the user\u2019s mobile phone bill. For example, you could donate money for disaster relief simply by texting an amount with your phone. The latest Ztorg trojan leverages this Premium Rate SMS system, with the proceeds going to the bad guys. And like the rest of the Ztorg system, they use some sophisticated techniques to maximize their profits and minimize their chances of being caught.\n\nOnce infected, the trojan lies dormant for 10 minutes. In this way, if the user notices something odd, they are less likely to associate it with the app they just installed. After the delay, the trojan sends the first five digits of the phone\u2019s International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) to the C&C servers. This part of the IMSI identifies what network the phone is connected to, and in what country. With this information the C&C can determine which Premium Rate SMS services are available and the trojan starts racking up the bills. And since most of these SMS services will reply with a txt message receipt or notice, the Ztorg Trojans delete incoming SMS messages. It seems obvious that a user would notice missing legitimate messages, but in the meantime the bad guys are counting their profits.\n\nMobile phones are convenient because they are compact, powerful and use a lot of simple shortcuts to makeup for the lack of a keyboard and a large screen. App stores make it easy to install new apps but it isn\u2019t always obvious what the apps themselves are doing.\n\n\u201cThe Ztorg Trojan continues to appear on the Google Play Store, accompanied by new tricks to bypass security and infect as many different Android devices and OS versions as possible. Even if a victim downloads what is clearly a clean app, there is no guarantee that it will still be clean in a few days\u2019 time. Users, Google and security researchers need to remain vigilant at all times and to be proactive about protection,\u201d says Roman Unuchek, researcher at Kaspersky Labs.\n\n \n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Ztorg Trojans, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ztorg-trojans", "topic_name": "Ztorg Trojans"}]}, {"news_name": "Mexican Government was spying on Journalists and Activists with Pegasus Surveillance software", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60253/digital-id/mexican-government-pegasus.html", "title": "Mexican Government was spying on Journalists and Activists with Pegasus Surveillance software\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 20, 2017", "body": "Journalists and activists in Mexico accused the government of spying on them with a powerful surveillance software.

NSO can say they\u2019re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place.\u201d\n\nThe discovery is the result of an investigation conducted by Mexican NGOs and the CitizenLab organization.\n\nR3D, SocialTic, Article 19 and CitizenLab published a report that details the surveillance illegally operated by the Mexican government through the spyware.\n\nAuthorities have been sending malicious links to individuals\u2019 phones, in order to trick victims into opening the messages they were specifically crafted and in some cases, the attack involved also family members if the victims were not compromised.\n\n\u201cThe targets received SMS messages that included links to NSO exploits paired with troubling personal and sexual taunts, messages impersonating official communications by the Embassy of the United States in Mexico, fake AMBER Alerts, warnings of kidnappings, and other threats.\u201d states the report. \u201cThe operation also included more mundane tactics, such as messages sending fake bills for phone services and sex-lines. Some targets only received a handful of texts, while others were barraged with dozens of messages over more than one and a half years. A majority of the infection attempts, however, took place during two periods: August 2015 and April-July 2016\u2033.\n\n\n\nThe Pegasus spyware leverages zero-day exploits to compromise both iOS and Android devices.\n\nThe government targeted individuals that exposed evidence on government corruption and activists who revealed human rights violations by the Mexican Government.\n\nThe researchers observed at least two periods of intense targeting:\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Times report, at least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased some $80 million of spyware from NSO Group since 2011.\n\nCompanies like the NSO Group operate in the dark, in a sort of \u201clegal gray area,\u201d despite the Israeli government exercises strict control of the export of such kind of software, surveillance applications could be abused by threat actors and authoritarian regimes worldwide.\n\nLet me close with Key Findings of the report\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Pegasus Spyware, Mexican government)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mexico", "topic_name": "Mexico"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nso-group", "topic_name": "NSO Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pegasus-spyware", "topic_name": "Pegasus Spyware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "A New malware dubbed dvmap for android was found and removed from play store", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60134/malware/dvmap-android-fmalware.html", "title": "A New malware dubbed dvmap for android was found and removed from play store\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 16, 2017", "body": "A New malware dubbed dvmap for Android was found and removed from the official Google Play store\n\nKaspersky Lab had discovered the new malware that is capable of obtaining root access on Android devices and is capable of taking over the system library with the execution of a code injection attack.\n\nThe malware named DVMAP was seen being distributed as a game called Colourblock and has a new feature in mobile malware.\n\n\u201cIn April 2017 we started observing new rooting malware being distributed through the Google Play Store. Unlike other rooting malware, this Trojan not only installs its modules into the system, it also injects malicious code into the system runtime libraries. Kaspersky Lab products detect it as Trojan.AndroidOS.Dvmap.a.\u201d states Kaspersky Lab.\n\n\n\nThe ability to deploy code injection is a new capability unseen until now and represents a dangerous evolution on Android menaces.\n\nThe malware tries to gain root access after the application installation and launches a file to verify the Android version and what library it will inject the code. Once successful the malware tries to connect to C&C server that keeps updating every process of the malware. DVMAP can also disable the user\u2019s security settings to try gain root access over the device.\n\nThe creators of the malware were able to bypass Play Store security mechanisms by embedding it with a game, in a two-phase infection method. First, a game was uploaded to the Play Store free of malware, and then the application was substituted with the malware itself bypassing this way the security mechanisms of Google. Before its removal, the malware was able to infect at least 50,000 devices that downloaded the game application.\n\n\u201cThis makes Dvmap the first Android malware that injects malicious code into the system libraries in runtime, and it has been downloaded from the Google Play Store more than 50,000 times. Kaspersky Lab reported the Trojan to Google, and it has now been removed from the store.\u201d continues Kaspersky.\n\nDVMAP can disable runtime libraries depending which version of Android is in use, so it can install other payloads linked to third parties that could compromise sensitive data as banking accounts. One of these payloads is \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices\u201d The malware can also work on 32 and 64 bits of Android.\n\nUntil now there is no correction for the malware, but users can count on simple best practices of security do avoid or detain the infection. It is highly recommended that users download only from developer\u2019s official site, maintain an up to date backup of data and always verify which privilege will be granted to the application that will be installed. A full factory reset also is highly recommended to users who have been infected and also maintaining up to date the definitions of antivirus.\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and an enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e-Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics, and reverse engineering.

The new malware \u2013 code named \u201cJudy\u201d \u2013 is designed to infect Android devices and generate false clicks on advertisements. According to Checkpoint Software, which discovered Judy, the payoff for the malware developers is to generate revenue on the false advertising clicks.\n\nThe new malicious app bypassed Google checks and may have been inside 41 popular games on the Play store for years, infecting as many as 36 million users.\n\n\u201cCheck Point researchers discovered another widespread malware campaign on Google Play, Google\u2019s official app store. The malware, dubbed \u201cJudy\u201d, is an auto-clicking adware which was found on 41 apps developed by a Korean company. \u201d states the analysis published by CheckPoint. \u201cThe malicious apps reached an astonishing spread between 4.5 million and 18.5 million downloads. \u201d \u201cWe also found several apps containing the malware, which were developed by other developers on Google Play.\u201d \u201cThese apps also had a large amount of downloads between 4 and 18 million, meaning the total spread of the malware may have reached between 8.5 and 36.5 million users.\u201d\n\nThe tainted software packages containing the malware were developed by a Korean company and have all been pulled from the Google Play Store. Several other vendor packages have also been pulled that reportedly contained the same malware code. However, it is not clear if these apps were intentionally designed with the Judy malware or simply suffered the same fate because of shared code.\n\n\n\nThe disclosure comes on the heels of two similar malware programs, \u201cFalseguide\u201d and \u201cSkinner\u201d which bypassed Google\u2019s safety and check system. All the malware designs appear to be similar in that they used communications links with a Command and Control server for operation. Once the link was established, the Command Server would then download the malicious software on the unsuspecting user.\n\nThe malware developers first would design and upload a bait program to the Google Play Store. Most of the bait apps used by Judy appear to be games or simulated doll dress designs aimed at children. The bait programs would appear to be innocent to the user and pass the Google checking system since they contained no malicious code. The apps apparently look valid because they are designed to communicate with a specific URL for additional user game data such as updated dress designs for children\u2019s dolls. Both the user and Google were unaware that the URL was actually a link to the malicious Command server.\n\nOne a user downloaded and started the app, the command server would infect the unknowing user with a silent and invisible web browser using JavaScript. The malware used the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from Google ads once a targeted series of websites are launched inside the silent web browser. The silent browser would then simulate a computer by clicking on the paying advertisements and banners. Each infected user would then unknowingly be clicking thousands of times a day against advertisements. The fake clicks against the websites generated revenue for the malware developer cheating the paying advertisers.\n\nOne feature of Judy, however, was that some of the spammed ads also required the user to click on them in order to get the home screen functional again. While many of the apps were apparently popular, some of them received 4 and 5-star reviews, users often complained about the large number of ads that they were seeing. This tell-tale clue should have been a warning sign that the apps were doing more than simply dressing simulated dolls.\n\nAccording to Checkpoint, the malware apps were all developed by a single Korean company named Kiniwini, registered on Google Play as ENISTUDIO corp.\n\n\u201cThe company develops mobile apps for both Android and iOS platform,\u201d states the Checkpoint bulletin.\n\n\u201cIt is quite unusual to find an actual organization behind mobile malware, as most of them are developed by purely malicious actors. It is important to note that the activity conducted by the malware is not borderline advertising, but definitely an illegitimate use of the users\u2019 mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks, benefiting the attackers.\u201d\n\nGoogle has recently attempted to beef-up its Play Store, releasing new privacy and security guidelines to developers and increasing checks against potentially malevolent software apps. However, the use of a secondary communications system seems to bypass security checks since Google cannot see the hidden malware stored on a separate Command server during the upload and activation process for developers.\n\nIt is not unusual for app developers to utilize a communications link to specific URLs. Many games and user applications require a link in order to update common data, generate game revenue and add additional features. The design of using a malicious Command server to install functioning malware is something that previously had been reserved for intelligence agencies and criminal hacker organizations.\n\nWhile, the abuse of millions of users to generate illegal income via hidden clicks on paying ads is not entirely new, there are darker possible designs that can target the individual users with more than just advertisements; stealing financial information, violating privacy, stalking and tracking. Both Google and Apple should take note of this new design that can bypass traditional upload and install security features of their store fronts.\n\nLink to Checkpoint alert on Judy malware:\nhttp://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/05/25/judy-malware-possibly-largest-malware-campaign-found-google-play/\n\nAbout the author: Charles R.

The ultrasonic beacon sounds vibrate at 18,000 to 20,000 times a second which is well above the hearing of most people.  These beacon sounds are monitored covertly by the android phone applications which then transmit the results to the developer who in turn sells the information that you were in a specific store, or watching the tagged ad on TV or the Internet.\n\nThe process is relatively simple by programming standards.  The covert surveillance software is embedded into popular programs such as coupon offers, games or text message systems offered for free by various organizations.  The first time you run the program \u2013 it embeds an endless loop called a \u201cservice\u201d so the surveillance portion is always running even when you are not using the app or have restarted your phone.  The surveillance software is also keyed to listen for specific frequencies of sound and will transmit that information when it detects that sound via a hidden internet link.\n\nThe technology and design employed by the app developers is similar in format to that used by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for surveillance as revealed by Wikileaks in their VAULT7 publications.  Companies caught using these apps so far include the Philippines versions of the McDonald\u2019s and Krispy Kreme.  The German researchers also found four local retail stores also had ultrasonic beacons installed designed to trigger any listening cell phone.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to find beacons at the entrance of some stores in two German cities,\u201d says Erwin Quiring, a privacy researcher who worked on the study. \u201cIt affects all of us if there\u2019s some kind of privacy invasive technique we don\u2019t know about and which runs silently on phones.\u201d\n\nThe applications, most of which are available on the Google Play Store, have not informed customers that they are being monitored and may continue to monitor them even after the app is uninstalled.  The app developers, companies and advertisers involved are clearly in violation of the privacy agreement to post on Google Play which requires developers to \u201ccomprehensively disclose how an app collects, uses and shares user data, including the types of parties with whom it\u2019s shared.\u201d\n\nGoogle has not commented publically if they intend to pursue the developers for their privacy violations.  Under Google policy \u2013 the developers and the advertising corporations may be prohibited from using the Play store but a similar privacy violation by Uber against Apple only resulted in a quiet scolding and an apology.  It is unlikely that Google will banish large corporations such as McDonalds for breaking privacy requirements with surveillance apps distributed by the Play Store.\n\nThe researchers were able to focus their attention on one particular provider named Silverpush which now claims that it has disabled the tracking features in its applications.  However, the data shows that tracking apps developed with the Silverpush implanted covert surveillance technology have been downloaded more that 2 million times from Google Play.\n\nPhone owners have few options when it comes to defending against this surveillance.  The most effective is to closely inspect your applications using the SETTINGS menu.  Each application has a permissions list which will show if they are allowed to record audio.\n\nA hint to newbie users here \u2013 if you download a free flashlight app and it has audio recording permissions \u2013 it is doing more than turn on or off your cellphone light.\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate how easy it is to develop and use such a surveillance system we put together a card game program that has a secret listener hidden inside it.  The demonstration Black Jack program does not perform the \u201cservice\u201d installation and only records 1 time after the game is started and stops when a player selects the \u201cHIT\u201d option.  The output is written to a file in MP4 format and stored openly on the external SD card under the name \u201cBJ(date/time).mp4\u201d.  The source code and signed Android APK run file are included in a zip file with a SHA256 check at:\n\nhttps://www.softwar.net/blackjack.html\n\nThe differences between the demonstration program and the operational ultrasonic surveillance app systems are:\n\nHowever, as the demonstrator quickly shows, a surveillance application designed to pick up sound does not limit itself to just ultrasonic beacons but can pick up all sounds.  The ultrasonic beacon detection has to be programmed into the system to filter out other sounds.  While companies that employ this kind of targeting state they did not listen to conversations \u2013 the potential is there to re-transmit your conversations to a controller just as the CIA versions do.\n\nAll that is required is to remove the code filtering out the ultrasonic beacon sound, and insert a routine to transmit all the sounds that are picked up.  The end program would resemble a hidden one-way ISP phone service with everything within detection being relayed in real-time, or stored for later downloading if the phone is outside the range of an internet connection.\n\nIn addition, other information such as your phone number, GPS location and even proximity to the nearest beacons can be pinpointed, by advertisers who then market to you as if they were a salesman in your pocket, or by others who can abuse this technology.  When combined with GPS location and even video surveillance your cell phone not only becomes a major threat to privacy but to your personal security as well.\n\nThe question for phone makers, owners, and government officials is exactly what are we all going to do about this?  Phone makers can do a better job showing what powers each application is using and how the consumer can limit them.  Owners can actually take the time to be more cautious; observing that Caveat emptor \u2013 \u201cLet the buyer beware\u201d \u2013 applies to free downloaded applications.  Finally, government officials may want to consider new regulations on the use of such surveillance technology for marketing purposes.\n\nAbout the author: Charles R.

Despite the huge investment in security made by telco companies, the adoption of flawed protocols exposes customers to serious privacy and security risks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you secure the front door of the house, but the back door is wide open,\u201d said Tobias Engel, one of the German researchers.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Tobias Engel Slides presented at CCC Berlin\n\n\nWhat does the network know about your location?\n\n\nTobias explained that the network knows the location of the cell tower that could be used to have a pretty good approximation of a user\u2019s location. Despite the access to the information managed by operators is restricted to the technical operation of the network, voice calls, and short messages can be initiated to your phone number from almost anywhere in the global SS7 network.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Tobias Engel Slides presented at CCC Berlin\n\n\nAttacks relying on these security issues already happened in the past, one of the major incidents was registered by the NKRZI (which is the National Commission for the State Regulation of Communications and Informatization in Ukraine) and involved Russian addresses back in April 2014.\n\nThe expert noticed that many Ukrainian mobile phone holders have been targeted by SS7 packets sent from Russia to track them and steal information from the mobile devices.\n\nBack to the present, security experts are observing the first massive hacking campaign exploiting the design flaws in the SS7 protocol to drain bank accounts. Multiple sources confirmed that hackers used this technique in the past few months.\n\nThe company O2-Telefonica in Germany has confirmed to S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung agency that some of its customers suffered cyber heists exploiting the SS7 flaws to bypass SFA authentication mechanisms.\n\nHackers exploited the vulnerabilities in the SS7 protocol to intercept authentication code sent by the banking services to the customers using the two-factor authentication process.\n\nHackers exploited a two-factor authentication system of transaction authentication numbers used by sine German banks. The attackers first conducted a spam campaign to deliver a malware on the bank customers PC in order to collect financial information (the bank account balance, login credentials, and the mobile number).\n\nThen hackers purchased access to a rogue telecommunications provider and set up a redirect for the victim\u2019s mobile phone number to a handset controlled by the attackers.\n\nAt night time crooks logged into victims\u2019 bank accounts and drained them exploiting the SS7 flaws to access the account and authorize the fraudulent transactions.\n\nThis is the first publicly confirmed attack exploiting the design flaws in the SS7 protocol in Europe.\n\nWhich is a possible solution?\n\nTelco experts propose a replacement for SS7 on 5G networks, dubbed the Diameter protocol, unfortunately also this protocol is affected by critical security holes.\n\nSecurity researchers discovered that Diameter is also affected by security issues, one of them is the lack of mandatory implementation of the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol.\n\nAccording to researchers from Nokia Bell Labs and Aalto University in Finland, this means that Diameter could be hacked with the same techniques that are effective against SS7.\n\nLast year, the team of experts made several tests to evaluate attacks against users connected to the LTE network. They simulated the attacks on a test network set up by an unnamed global mobile operator. In the tests, they powered a cyber attack against UK subscribers from Finland and discovered several methods of disrupting service to users.\n\nThe researchers were able to temporarily and permanently shut down users connections, they were also able to target entire regions.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SS7, Hacking bank accounts)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Poorly designed apps leave millions of phones at risk of open port attack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58542/hacking/open-port-attack-mobile.html", "title": "Poorly designed apps leave millions of phones at risk of open port attack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 30, 2017", "body": "A group of security researchers from the University of Michigan ( Yunhan Jack Jia, Qi Alfred Chen, Yikai Lin, Chao Kong, and Prof. Z.

Usually, mobile applications open ports to allow the communications with other entities, for example, to exchange data with a web service, clearly these ports are a potential entry point for hackers in presence of a vulnerability like authentication flaws, buffer overflow vulnerabilities, or a remote code execution issues.\n\nThe researchers devised a tool called OPAnalyzer that was used to scan more than 100,000 Android applications and discovered 410 potentially vulnerable applications. The potential impact of the issue is severe because the applications have been downloaded between 10 and 50 Million times and at least one mobile app comes pre-installed on Android smartphones.\n\n\u201cFrom the identified vulnerable usage, we discover 410 vulnerable applications with 956 potential exploits in total. We manually confirmed the vulnerabilities for 57 applications, including popular ones with 10 to 50 million downloads on the official market, and also an app that is pre-installed on some device models.\u201d reads the research paper (\u201cOpen Doors for Bob and Mallory: Open Port Usage in Android Apps and Security Implications\u201c) published by the experts  \u201cThese vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause highly-severe damage such as remotely stealing contacts, photos, and even security credentials, and also performing sensitive actions such as malware installation and malicious code execution.\u201d\n\nThe most common issue is related to the apps like WiFi File Transfer, which allow users to connect to a port on their smartphone via Wi-Fi in order to transfer files from a mobile device to a computer. However, applications like WiFi File Transfer require attackers to share the same network as the target, this means that only users accessing a public Wi-Fi network or a compromised private network are at risk.\n\nInitially, the researchers made a port scanning in its campus network, and in just 2 minutes they found a large number of potentially exposed devices.\n\n\n\nThe researchers published several PoC videos for a number of attack scenarios.\n\n\n\nResearchers concluded that the best way to protect mobile devices from open ports attack is to uninstall those mobile apps that open insecure ports, or in an alternative, to protect these applications behind a firewall.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 open port attack, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/open-port-attack", "topic_name": "open port attack"}]}, {"news_name": "Fake app hiding a SMSVova spyware went undetected for years in the Google Play Stores", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58244/malware/smsvova-spyware-google-store.html", "title": "Fake app hiding a SMSVova spyware went undetected for years in the Google Play Stores\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 23, 2017", "body": "Bad news for millions of Android users looking to get software updates, they have been tricked into downloading a spyware called SMSVova through the official Google Play store.\n\nExperts at Zscaler discovered that the bogus app was posing as a legitimate application called \u201cSystem Update\u201d and claiming to provide users with access to the latest Android software release.\n\n\n\nIt has been estimated that the fake application hiding the SMSVova spyware was uploaded in the Google Play in 2014, and has been downloaded between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 times.\n\nExperts reported the discovery to Google that promptly removed it from the store.\n\nThe SMSVova spyware was developed to track the physical location of the users, it was controlled by attackers via SMS messages.\n\n\u201cIn our ongoing effort to hunt malware, the Zscaler ThreatLabz team came across a highly suspicious app on the U.S. Google Play Store that has been downloaded between one and five million times since 2014.\u201d reads the analysis published Zscaler. \u201cUpon analysis, we found it to be an SMS-based Spyware, which can steal and relay a victim\u2019s location to an attacker in real time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zscaler, once the app was installed when users try to open it they were displayed the message:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, Update Service has stopped.\u2019\n\n\n\nthen the app hides itself from the main screen and launches the phone\u2019s MyLocationService which collect location data and stores it in the Shared Preferences directory of the mobile device.\n\nDespite the error message, the spyware sets up an Android service and broadcast receiver:\n\nSMSVova monitors specific incoming SMS messages with specific characteristics, messages with more than 23 characters in length and that contain the text string \u201cvova-\u201d and \u201cget faq.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce the spyware has been installed on the victim\u2019s device, an attacker can send an SMS message \u2018get faq\u2019 and this spyware will respond with a set of commands,\u201d according to Zscaler.\n\nThe SMSVova spyware implements other commands, including \u201cchanging current password\u201d and \u201csetting low battery notification.\u201d According to Desai, those behind the spyware use the SMS commands in order to instruct SMSVova to retrieve and text back location data. The \u201csetting low battery notification\u201d message is used to instruct the phone to text location data when the battery runs low.\n\nIt\u2019s still a mystery why threat actor behind the spyware is collecting location data.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the SMS-based behavior and exception generation at the initial stage of the startup weren\u2019t detected by the antivirus engines on VirusTotal.\n\nAuthors of the SMSVova spyware have designed the threat to evade detection by antivirus solutions and Google Play\u2019s malware detector. The app was last updated in December 2014, at that time the controls implemented by Google weren\u2019t so stringent, anyway the malicious code eluded Google detector for years.\n\nIt is curious to note that according to the recent Google Android Security 2016 Year In Review report, in 2016 devices that installed applications only from Google Play had fewer than 0.05 percent of potentially harmful applications installed.\n\n\u201cThere are many apps on the Google Play store that act as a spyware; for example, those that spy on the SMS messages of one\u2019s spouse or fetch the location of children for concerned parents.

The Balong application processor is called Kirin, it is produced by the Hisilicon Technologies, a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies. The affected firmware is present in several Huawei Honor smartphones, including the P10, Huawei Mate 9, Honor 9, 7, 5c and 6.\n\n\n\nWeinmann believes that millions of Honor smartphones could be exposed to the to attack.\n\nWeinmann presented multiple baseband vulnerabilities found in the Kirin application processor.\n\nThe expert also revealed that many laptops produced by IT vendors leverage the HiSilicon Balong integrated modem, such as a number IoT devices.\n\n\u201cThis baseband is much easier to exploit than other basebands. Why? I\u2019m not sure if this was intentional, but the vendor actually published the source code for the baseband which is unusual,\u201d Weinmann said. \u201cAlso, the malleability of this baseband implantation doesn\u2019t just make it good for device experimenting, but also network testing.\u201d\n\nWeinmann speculates HiSilicon may have wrong released the Kirin source code as part of a developer tar archive associated with the Huawei H60 Linux kernel data.\n\nWeinmann demonstrated several attack scenarios against mobile phones.\n\nA first attack scenario presented by the researcher involves setting up a bogus base station using open-source software called OpenLTE that is used by an attacker to simulate a network operator. The attacker can send specially crafted packets over the air that trigger a stack buffer overflow in the LTE stack causing the phone crashing. Once the phone rebooted an attacker can gain persistence installing a rootkit.\n\nIn a second attack scenario, the attacker with a physical access to the phone and private key pair data would install malicious tools on the firmware.\n\n\u201cIt requires key material that is stored both by the carrier and on the SIM card in order to pass the mutual authentication between the phone and the network. Without this key material, a base station cannot pose as a legit network towards the device.\u201d\n\nWeinmann used for its test his own VxWorks build environment using an evaluation version of VxWorks 7.0 that shipped with Intel Galileo several years ago. The expert explained that the existence of a Lua scripting interpreter running in the baseband gives him further offensive options.\n\nWeinmann did not disclose the technical details to avoid threat actors in the wild will abuse his technology.\n\n\u201cI have chosen to only disclose lower-severity findings for now.

In order to increase the awareness of user towards the possibility of data leakage and the importance of protecting personal data stored in smartphones, we developed: \u2018Privacy Guard\u2018.\n\nPrivacy Guard is an Android app that evaluates the risks of data privacy relying on the permissions requested by the apps installed on a device.\n\nPrivacy Guard was developed at Iswatlab (http://www.iswatlab.eu/?page_id=499), the cyber security lab of the Department of Engineering of the University of Sannio (Italy), from an idea of and under the supervision of Corrado Aaron Visaggio, which is the responsible of the lab and: Antonio Altieri, Fabrizio Giorgione, Alfredo Nazzaro, and Assunta Oropallo.\n\nOn the basis of our studies on malicious apps that exfiltrate sensitive data (http://www.iswatlab.eu/?p=461), we found out that both trusted apps and malicious apps take a lot of sensitive data. Such data can be then used for different purposes that produce revenue for the adversary who obtained it: to sell user\u2019s profile to a third party for marketing purposes, to feed OSINT platforms, to realize identity thefts or for accomplishing frauds and scams.\n\nThe point is that the user grants those permissions which allow the data exfiltration when installs the application on the device. The core problem is that the common user ignores completely the kind of permissions that are granted, and, what is more severe, ignores which risk a certain combination of permissions exposes her privacy too.\n\nIf an app requires the permission to send SMS and the permission to read contacts, SMS, and some other personal identifiable information stored in the device, it exposes the user to the possibility that the app sends that sensitive information to a third party by SMS.\n\nRelying on such observations, we created a model that identifies which apps have the most dangerous combination of permssions for data privacy.\n\nIt is important to remark that Privacy Guard does not evaluate if a data exfiltration happens on a device, but it just identifies those apps which require a combination of permissions that can be strong indicators of activities that affect data privacy preservation.\n\nPrivacy Guard is intended to first monitor the potential risks for a user\u2019s data privacy and, as second aim, to stimulate and increase the awareness of user towards the kind of apps she installs on her device, from a security perspective.\n\nLet\u2019s now look at how Privacy Guard works.\n\nPermissions have been grouped into categories and each permission has been assigned a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to describe its dangerousness.\n\nThe permissions have been divided into four categories:\n\nTo compute a value representing applications\u2019 data leakage capabilities the followed formula has been developed:\n\n                                                                (1) (Hn*Wh +Dn * Wd) * MAX(C)\n\nHowever, (1) to represent data leakage capabilities of applications is not enough: some permissions are far more dangerous if used in combination with other permissions. In order to take this into account, the hardware and data access categories have been divided into sub-categories:\n\nNetwork access                                                             Data Acquisition\n\nChange hardware configuration                               Personal data access\n\nNon-combinable\n\nThe communication permissions have been divided considering range and bandwidth. Every combination of this subcategories was considered, assigning a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to each combination. These values act as a penalty to the base score.range and bandwidth. Every combination of this subcategories was considered, assigning a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to each combination. These values act as a penalty to the base score.range and bandwidth. Every combination of .range and bandwidth. Every combination of this subcategories was considered, assigning a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to each combination. These values act as a penalty to the base score.\n\nFirst of all the application shows a message to synthesize the results and the list of all the applications with the related data leakage score, while if there are one or more applications that exceed a certain threshold, at the top of screen will be shown a message that indicates the number of applications that exceed this value.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible to explore the details of each app. Privacy Guard shows the list of all the activated permissions with a brief description. If one application requires a permission particularly suspect, the application shows a warning to explain at the user how that permission can be used for malicious purposes.\n\n\n\n \n\nIt\u2019s possible to explore the details of each app. Privacy Guard shows the list of all the activated permissions with a brief description.

The researchers discovered that even if the user deletes the history, iCloud doesn\u2019t actually erase it but keeps it in a format invisible to the user.\n\n\u201cHowever, those same records will be kept in Apple iCloud for much longer. In fact, we were able to access records dated more than one year back. The user does not see those records and does not know they still exist on Apple servers.\u201d reads a blog post published by the Elcomsoft\u2019s CEO Vladimir Katalov. \n\n\u201cIn fact, we were able to access records dated more than one year back,\u201d \n\nThe experts used the Elcomsoft Phone Breaker forensic tool to extract files from an iCloud account.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIn order to extract Safari history from iCloud it is necessary to be authenticated into the user\u2019s Apple ID. The operation can be carried on using login credentials or by using an authentication token extracted from the user\u2019s computer. The authentication tokens are automatically created by iCloud Control Panel on Windows and Mac computers that were synced with iCloud.\n\nThe Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can be used by experts to extract iCloud authentication tokens.\n\n\u201cBy using the token to log in, you\u2019ll bypass both the password and the secondary authentication prompt if two-factor authentication is enabled on the user\u2019s account.

Unlike cloud backups that are created daily at best, iCloud sync works nearly in real-time. Being able to track suspect\u2019s activities almost no delay can be invaluable for surveillance and investigations.\u201d states Katalov.\n\n\u201cSince deleting browsing history from iCloud is nearly impossible for the user, discovering illicit activities becomes much easier. Experts will be able to recover visits to extremist and other illicit Web sites even if the suspect deletes their browser history or wipes their iPhone.\u201d\n\nKeeping a copy of a user\u2019s browser history can certainly be \u201cinvaluable for surveillance and investigations,\u201d Katalov said. But it\u2019s unclear if Apple knew that its iCloud service was storing the deleted records.\n\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment, but experts from Elcomsoft noticed that after they disclosed the issue, Apple started \u201cpurging\u201d older browser history records from iCloud.\n\n\u201cwe have informed media about this issue in advance, and they reached Apple for comments. As far as we know, Apple has not responded, but started purging older history records. For what we know, they could be just moving them to other servers, making deleted records inaccessible from the outside; but we never know for sure. Either way, as of right now, for most iCloud accounts we can see history records for the last two weeks only (deleted records for those two weeks are still there though).\u201d states the blog post.

The Google security engineer Eduardo Vela has discovered that the jQuery Mobile framework can expose websites to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in case they are affected also by an open redirect vulnerability.\n\nA few months ago, Vela was searching for CSP bypasses and noticed an interesting behavior of the jQuery Mobile. The jQuery Mobile would fetch any URL in the location.hash and put it in innerHTML, this behavior would be exploited by an attacker under specific conditions.  I thought that was pretty weird, so decided to see if it was vulnerable to XSS.\n\nVela started searching for XSS vulnerability and devised the following attack:\n\nThe expert explained that despite the history.pushState should prevent XSS attacks, it is still possible to exploit such kind of flaws if the website is affected by an open redirect vulnerability.\n\nBelow the demo provided by Vela:\n\nhttp://jquery-mobile-xss.appspot.com/#/redirect?url=http://sirdarckcat.github.io/xss/img-src.html\n\nAccording to the expert, there are many websites vulnerable to such attacks because many organizations don\u2019t consider open redirects as security vulnerabilities, such kind of issues are present in major websites such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Baidu, and Yahoo.\n\n\n\nNow the bad news!\n\nVela reported the flaw to jQuery Mobile development team, but likely it will not be fixed due to the potential impact of a fix on the existing applications. The development team confirmed the risks to their users.\n\n\u201cThe jQuery Mobile team explained that they consider the Open Redirect to be the vulnerability, and not their behavior of fetching and inlining, and that they wouldn\u2019t want to make a change because that might break existing applications. This means that there won\u2019t be a patch as far as I have been informed. The jQuery mobile team suggests to 403 all requests made from XHR that might result in a redirect.\u201d wrote Vela.\n\n\u201cThis means that every website that uses jQuery Mobile, and has any open redirect anywhere is vulnerable to XSS.\u201c\n\nVela is inviting experts to try to exploit the same XSS in the absence of the open redirect vulnerability, he already tested it but without success.\n\n\u201cOne opportunity for further research, if you have time in your hands is to try to find a way to make this bug work without the need of an Open Redirect. I tried to make it work, but it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d added Vela.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, Open Redirects are very common, and they are also a common source of bugs. Perhaps we should start fixing Open Redirects. Or perhaps we should be more consistent on not treating them as vulnerabilities.

However, with its highly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take notice,\u201d reported Symantec.\n\n\u201cLast week, Unit 42 came across new Disttrack samples that appear to have been used in an updated attack campaign. The attack targeted at least one organization in Saudi Arabia, which aligns with the targeting of the initial Shamoon attacks. It appears the purpose of the new Disttrack samples were solely focused on destruction, as the samples were configured with a non-operational C2 server to report to and were set to begin wiping data exactly on 2016/11/17 20:45. In another similarity to Shamoon, this is the end of the work week in Saudi Arabia (their work week is from Sunday to Thursdays), so the malware had potentially the entire weekend to spread.  The Shamoon attacks took place on Lailat al Qadr, the holiest night of the year for Muslims; another time the attackers could be reasonably certain employees would not be at work.\u201d reads an analysis published by Palo Alto Networks.\n\n\n\nShamoon, also known as Disttrack, was first spotted in a wave of attacks that targeted companies in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Among the victims, there was the petrol giant Saudi Aramco. The principal capability of Shamoon is a feature that allows it to wipe data from hard drives of the infected systems.\n\nIn the attack against Saudi Aramco Shamoon wipe data on over 30,000 computers and rewrite the hard drive MBR (Master Boot Record) with an image of a burning US flag.\n\nThe second variant of Shamoon 2 was spotted by Palo Alto Networks that had been configured to start wiping infected systems at 1:30 AM (Saudi Arabia time) on November 29, when the employees of the targeted organization\u2019 were likely at home.\n\nThe first variant of Shamoon 2 analyzed by the experts presented a default configuration that allowed the execution of the disk-wiping component at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17. Considering that in Saudi Arabia the working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, the attacker tried to exploit the pause in order to maximize the effects of the attack.\n\nBoth payloads were similar, but the analysis of the experts revealed some differences.\n\nThreat actors used stolen credentials to deliver the malware on the target systems, according to researchers at Symantec they may have been provided by another cyber espionage group called Greenbug.\n\nGreenbug hackers used the Ismdoor remote access Trojan (RAT) and other tools in attacks against organizations in the Middle East.\n\nThe Ismdoor establish a backdoor on the target machine and leverages PowerShell for command and control (C&C).\n\nThe group targeted organizations in multiple industries, including aviation, investment, government and education organizations in several countries (i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkey, and a Saudi company in Australia).\n\n\u201cGreenbug was discovered targeting a range of organizations in the Middle East including companies in the aviation, energy, government, investment, and education sectors. The group uses a custom information-stealing remote access Trojan (RAT) known as Trojan.Ismdoor as well as a selection of hacking tools to steal sensitive credentials from compromised organizations.\u201d states the Symanted report on Greenbug.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is no definitive link between Greenbug and Shamoon, the group compromised at least one administrator computer within a Shamoon-targeted organization\u2019s network prior to W32.Disttrack.B being deployed on November 17, 2016.\u201d\n\nThe Greenbug launched spear phishing attacks against its victims in order to trick users into downloading the malicious code onto their systems. The email messages are fake business proposals that delivered a RAR archive that stored a clean PDF and a compiled HTML help file (.chm) that contained the Ismdoor Trojan.\n\nThe Greenbug hackers exploited the alternate data streams (ADS) to avoid detection.\n\n\u201cWindows Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a feature of NTFS which is used to store details about a file. The information stored in ADS is hidden to the user, which makes it an attractive feature for attackers. ADS is sometimes abused by attackers to hide malware or other hacking tools on a compromised computer.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nResearchers at Symantec speculate that Greenbug may have supplied credentials for the Shamoon 2 attacks. The experts detecting the Ismdoor malware on an administrator computer belonging to one of the organizations targeted with Shamoon 2.\n\nIt is important to highlight that there is no technical evidence that Greenbug and Shamoon 2 attackers are linked, but it is interesting to note that Greenbug seems to have vanished one day before the November 17 attacks.\n\n\u201cThe presence of Greenbug within an organization prior to the destructive attack involving W32.Disttrack.B provides only a tentative connection to Shamoon. Greenbug\u2019s choice of targets and the fact that Ismdoor and associated tools downloaded by the threat appear to have gone quiet a day prior to the November 17, 2016 Shamoon attack is, however, suspicious.\u201d reads the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Shamoon 2, Greenbug)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/greenbug", "topic_name": "Greenbug"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ismdoor", "topic_name": "Ismdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/saudi-arabia", "topic_name": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shamoon", "topic_name": "Shamoon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shamoon-2", "topic_name": "Shamoon 2"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wiper", "topic_name": "Wiper"}]}, {"news_name": "Crashing iPhone Or iPad with a simple Emoji text message", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55462/hacking/emoji-text-message.html", "title": "Crashing iPhone Or iPad with a simple Emoji text message\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 19, 2017", "body": "A new Apple\u2019s iOS bug was discovered in the community of mobile tech experts, it can be exploited to crash iPhone or iPad devices by just sending an Emoji text message.\n\nSeveral users are already reporting the issue and the popular YouTube EverythingApplePro published a video proof-of-concept for the bug.

According to a blog post published by The Guardian, the application was affected by a vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to intercept and read messages.\n\nThe issue could not be considered as a backdoor either a vulnerability, it is an issue related to the implementation of the cryptography in the app, in the specific case of user\u2019s encryption key changes.\n\nEven when a new key is generated, for example using a new device,  the user will be able to continue an old conversation without informing the sender of the change. Anyway, specific settings in Whatsapp can enable the notification that the sender transmitted message using a new Key.\n\nThe security issue was discovered by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cIf WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.\u201d Boelter told the Guardian\n\nResuming the issue is a serious threat to the users\u2019 privacy, WhatsApp can read encrypted messages sent through the service.\n\nThe researcher reported the flaw to WhatsApp in April, but the loophole is still present.\n\nBoelter highlights WhatsApp by default trusts the use of new key without any sender\u2019s notification, he also remarked that the application notifies the sender of the change only after the message is sent even when that default is changed.\n\nOn the other end, the application Signal, for example, requires a sender to manually verify keys, WhatsApp doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe notorious Moxie Marlinspike, who is considered the mind behind the encryption protocol behind both Signal and WhatsApp explained that the issue could not be considered as a backdoor.\n\n\u201cThe fact that WhatsApp handles key changes is not a \u2018backdoor,'\u201d reads a blog post published by Moxie. \u201cIt is how cryptography works. Any attempt to intercept messages in transmit by the server is detectable by the sender, just like with Signal, PGP, or any other end-to-end encrypted communication system.\u201d\n\nMoxie highlighted that WhatsApp takes strict precautions to prevent its servers from knowing which users have enabled security notifications. This means that it should be impossible for attackers to gather information about potential victims that turned off the notification.\n\nBoelter highlighted that an attacker can hack WhatApp servers and gain administrative control over them.\n\nThe attacker could force a change of the encryption key for a targeted mobile device allowing the application to use his key to encrypt messages without ever warning the receiver.\n\n\n\nThe attacker then has to take the targeted phone temporarily unavailable (for a period of hours or days). All the messages that were sent during that time will be stored in a queue and once the phone became available again, the messages will be encrypted with the new attacker key.\n\nThe attack anyway is very complex from the attacker perspective because:\n\nWhich is the WhatsApp reply?\n\n\u201cWhatsApp does not give governments a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor. The design decision referenced in the Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks. WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report.\u201d states WhatsApp\n\n\u201cUltimately, there\u2019s little evidence of a vulnerability and certainly none of a backdoor\u2014which is usually defined as secret functionality for defeating security measures. WhatsApp users should strongly consider turning on security notifications by accessing Settings > Account > Security.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Backdoor, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/whatsapp-backdoor", "topic_name": "WhatsApp Backdoor"}]}, {"news_name": "Analyzing a variant of the GM Bot Android malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55125/malware/gm-bot-android-malware.html", "title": "Analyzing a variant of the GM Bot Android malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 6, 2017", "body": "The sample explored is confirmed as a variant of the GM Bot Android malware \u2013 who\u2019s source was released publicly in early 2016. The code appears to have been forked by a second author and has additions that target the Danske Bank MobilePay application and the popular Danish Nem ID two factor authentication (2FA) system.\n\nThis article shows the process of walking through Static and Dynamic analysis to unlock the packed source code for the malware.\n\nWe see how even with basic static analysis a full picture of the intent of the malware can be readily assembled, and with a little debugging we can quickly get to readable source code.\n\nAs part of my journey into Cyber Security I thought it would be interesting to see how modern mobile malware operates. I chose the following sample at random based on an article here.\n\nA quick google search for these hashes will lead you to the file used if you would also like to explore this sample.\n\nThe article above demonstrates that the analyst has gone from sample to source code, but it is not clear how this is achieved. There are references to suggest that the code has been packed, but again no information on how it was unpacked for analysis.\n\nThis post will break down the process I used to analyse this sample, hopefully with enough detail to provide some tips and guidance for others wishing to attempt similar. The process I followed can be logically broken into the following stages:\n\nFirst off let\u2019s see what we can find about this in the public domain. Searching for the file hashes on Virus Total, where we see approximately 50% of AV products have identified it as malicious:\n\nHowever, we also note that all classify it heuristically as a generic strain of malware \u2013 either a Trojan, Dropper, Fake Installer etc. Nothing to suggest it is in fact GM Bot Android, or any specific type of malware. Other than this we don\u2019t see much from google with either the SHA256, or MD5 hashes.\n\nThe original Security Intelligence article references IBM X-Force research, so this is the next stop \u2013 but again nothing immediately obvious with regards to this sample could be located.\n\nA wider search of the internet reveals some history of GM bot, originally built and sold by Ganga Man on dark web forums. Following a dispute the source code for both client APK and C2 server were released publicly. A copy is hosted here on Github and will provide useful for cross referencing with this sample later in the analysis.\n\nhttps://github.com/gbrindisi/malware/tree/master/android/gmbot\n\nFirst up we are going to unpack the APK file using APK tool. This will unzip the contents, as well as providing a disassembly of the DEX code into Smali:\n\nThe results of this can be seen below and the tool has also provided a human readable version of the AndroidManifest.xml file.\n\nFirst stop is to take a look at the Android Manifest file, that should provide an overview of the components of the application and permissions requested.\n\nInitial analysis shows a broad range of permissions that indicate malicious behavior including permissions to:\n\nA summarized view of referenced class files for the main application, activities (15) and services (2) can be seen below:\n\nIn addition, we see 4 further classes mapped as Broadcast Receivers which will process event messages (Android system Intents) as shown below:\n\nFrom this we can see the application is capable of:\n\nBefore proceeding with any reverse engineering of the code, the next step is to explore the other files in the APK for clues.\n\nThe following files were noted as of interest:\n\nA binary file with no immediately obvious format. Possible code to be unencrypted / unpacked at run time?\n\nEnglish language strings for the application, as shown below:\n\nThe strings clearly indicate that this malware is targeting capturing victims credit card information. It is interesting to note that:\n\nThis file contains a list of country codes and specifically a group that are \u201cnon vbv\u201d. This is understood to mean that they do not use the \u201cVerified by Visa\u201d process which is used to enforce additional verification checks during online purchases. It is likely that the attackers would seek to obtain additional VBV credentials via the malware in order to allow online purchases with the card details (or avoid these countries).\n\nImages and icons/logos including:\n\nAdditionally there are png images prefixed \u201coverlay_\u201d, indicating a possible use in fraudulent overlay activity.\n\nNext we attempt to reverse engineer the DEX file back to original Java source code. For this we use dex2jar as follows to translate the DEX file (in the APK) into a Java Class file archive:\n\nThe resulting jar file can then be disassembled using JD-GUI as follows:\n\nThe resulting java classes that we see in JD-GUI show that there are only 4 java classes contained in the application. This is in direct contrast to the 16 different classes we saw declared in the application manifest. This confirms that there must be additional code that is loaded dynamically at run time \u2013 it is most likely that these four classes are in fact an unpacker.\n\nExamining the code we see that it is heavily obfuscated and has been crafted in a way to prevent clean decompiling of the code. This aside, we can start to get an understanding of the function of these four classes by examining the system classes that are imported (and therefore used) when the application is first executed.\n\nAfter exporting the java source from JD-GUI and unzipping to a new folder, we can extract the imported classes from these files:\n\nThe classes we find are shown below :\n\nEssentially we have a very small set of libraries that are being imported and used. These consist of functionality for:\n\nThis confirms the hypothesis that we are most likely dealing with an unpacker that unpacks it\u2019s executable code from a local file resource (as opposed to pulling dynamically from network for example).\n\nAs the Java code cannot be readily decompiled (due to protections injected by the malware author) we will instead debug the executable against the Smali assembly code. Smali is a disassembly of the DEX code used by the Dalvik Virtual Machine.\n\nThe Smali/Baksmali plugin for Android Studio is required, and then the output from Apktool is imported as a new project. We next set the breakpoints as required across the three classes that we are interested in (a,b,c):\n\nWe will initially debug the calls to interesting reflection methods identified, which are as below:\n\na.smali (a line that creates a new instance of a class based on a java.lang.reflect.Constructor instance)\n\n\n\nb.smali (a line that invokes a method on an object via reflection)\n\n\n\nc.smali (a line similar to that described above for a.smali)\n\n\n\nNow we install the application to the emulator (via ADB to ensure it doesn\u2019t start automatically as in some emulators).\n\nTo enable the debugger to connect to the application, we perform the following prior to starting the application:\n\nNow start the application from the launcher, you will be prompted to attach the debugger:\n\nIn Android Studio, attach the debugger using the icon. Choose the malicious application process. The debugger then stops at our first breakpoint as shown below:\n\nNote you should now set some variables to watch \u2013 as per above I have set v0 through v10 and p1 through p3. Our first breakpoint is hit and we see we are about to execute a method by reflection. Noting that we have not yet called newInstance() we can assume this is calling existing (loaded) classes \u2013 either one of the four loaded by the application, or some other Android framework classes.\n\nNext we forces step into the method to see which method it is calling (the smali debugger seems a little buggy and we can\u2019t at this point see the parameters being passed).\n\nAn initial call to get the current context object -presumably to start retrieving local resources from the APK. We now allow the debugger to continue, and repeat this exercise several times to build up a flow of the reflected method calls:\n\nPausing here, we can see the code is attempting to load the file that we had previously flagged as of interest in the static analysis section. Continuing we see the file is read, presumably decrypted and then written out again as a jar file:\n\nFinally a DexClassLoader is invoked to load the additional code into the system:\n\nLooking at the API for the DexClassLoader we can see that it takes two arguments \u2013 the location of the file to load, and a writeable area that it will use to re-write an optimised version of the code for the specific machine architecture \u2013 eg the Android Run Time (ART). Further information on this can be seen in the Android API documentation:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/DexClassLoader.html\n\nWe can see the exact location of the jar file in the debugger below, and the next step is to recover this file via ADB command line.\n\nAfter execution of the classloader, connecting via ADB shell we see the two files, the original and the DEX optimised code:\n\nWe copy these files to /sdcard/Download (+chmod) and then pull the .jar file to local machine for further analysis with adb pull.\n\nExtracting the jar file we find the classes.dex file.\n\nRepeating the steps to convert this to a jar file using dex2jar and decompiling with JD-GUI, we confirm we now have the full (un-obfuscated) source code for this malware sample.\n\nUpon initial analysis we can see the codebase bear remarkable similarities with the leaked source identified in the static analysis. However there are significant differences, and the code has been customised to specifically target the Danske Bank MobilePay application.\n\nAs the code is basically un-obfuscated, I\u2019ll now briefly walk through the key functionality of this malware, starting from first installation.\n\nUpon first installation and execution the application will perform two primary functions. It will initially harvest a range of the users data, including phone contacts, all SMS messages and other key data and send this to the C&C server. The C&C server then returns a unique installation identifier that is then used for all future communication to uniquely identify the compromised device.\n\nSecondly the malware will then nag the user to accept the software as a device administrator. If the user declines the request is re-triggered, making it very difficult for most users to escape this screen without accepting. With this permission in place, the malware achieves two objectives:\n\nThe malware maintains a regular heartbeat to the C2 server, which provides a mechanism for the attacker to issue specific commands to the device. Each hearbeat contains the installation ID and the current screen status. It is hypothesised that the attacker would ideally choose to execute malicious activities when the screen was off, and the user was not watching the phone.\n\nFirstly we see the ability to \u201clock\u201d and \u201cunlock\u201d the phone. This simulates an Android software update screen, and effectively hides any other activity that is occurring behind the screen overlay (such as sending, receiving or deleting SMS messages). Additionally this could be used to disable the user, and prevent them from using the phone whilst their accounts or cards are being compromised in real time.\n\nNext we see another function that is intended to intercept and forward SMS messages to the C2 server, and specifically trying to remove evidence that they ever existed by deleting them. This is used to steal 2FA credentials.\n\nNext from a C2 server perspective we see two \u201creset\u201d commands. The first, a \u201csoft\u201d reset, is used to reset the internal flag to re-attempt stealing Nem ID credentials. The second is the \u201chard\u201d reset that performs and immediate wipe of the device data.\n\nFinally, we see the ability to send an arbitrary SMS message to a mobile defined by the attacker and a function to launch a customised push notification to another application on the device. It was not clear what this could be used for.\n\nBy listening for incoming SMS messages the malware could also trigger a fake Android update screen that would then harvest, forward and attempt to delete messages as they arrived on the phone. This mode could be enabled and disabled by customised SMS command messages delivered to the phone via SMS.\n\nAs per the original article and many of the indicators from the static analysis, the primary purpose of the application is to steal data by performing overlays on top of legitimate applications. The malware targets three specific classes of applications:\n\nUpon launching the MobilePay application the overlay attempts to steal the users CPR number (unique social security type id), mobile number and Nem pass code. It then asks the user to take a photo of their Nem ID passbook, containing one time use codes which can be used by the attacker to then log into MobilePay (and other Danish systems) and issue payments.\n\nUpon launching one of the targeted applications, a credit card overlay is displayed with a configurable icon depending on the application launched. After basic card details are collected, the application then attempts to recover the Verified by Visa password for the user. These details are then forwarded to the C2 server.\n\nFinally we see the functionality that is targeted to capture the user\u2019s phone number, presumably to enable further abuse of the victims account via abuse of text message 2FA.\n\nThe sample appears to be a specifically customised variant that is being used in a campaign to target the Danske Bank MobilePay application. We see evidence that it is probably not the original GM Bot authors work \u2013 the coding style compared with the public source code is different, and the mix of languages in the resource files implies the sample has been adapted in a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d fashion to achieve the objectives.\n\nThis is a good example of how once released, complex code can be quickly and easily forked by less skilled authors and a pattern we also see today with the release of the Mirai botnet code. Quickly we see a spread of variants of the codebase that become harder to trace and detect and importantly attribute to any individual or group.\n\nAs ever, the best advice to prevent becoming a victim of such malware is to ensure that your phone is not configured to install 3rd party applications, and always review requests for permissions carefully \u2013 eg, are they aligned with the expected purpose of the application?\n\nDue to time constraints there are a few further areas I would have liked to explore.

When victims install the malicious app, the Trojan attempts to guess the login credentials of the Wi-Fi router.\n\n\u201d Instead of attacking a user, it attacks the Wi-Fi network the user is connected to, or, to be precise, the wireless router that serves the network. The trojan, dubbed Trojan.AndroidOS.Switcher, performs a brute-force password guessing attack on the router\u2019s admin web interface.\u201d states the analysis published by Kaspersky Lab.\u201dIf the attack succeeds, the malware changes the addresses of the DNS servers in the router\u2019s settings, thereby rerouting all DNS queries from devices in the attacked Wi-Fi network to the servers of the cybercriminals (such an attack is also known as DNS-hijacking)\u201d\n\nThe malware includes dozens of login credentials that it uses to perform a brute-force attack against the router that serves the network and to access its web administration interface.\n\nThe infection process starts with malware getting the BSSID of the network. The information is sent back to the C&C that is so informed that the Switcher Trojan has been activated in a network with this BSSID. The malicious code will get the name of the ISP (Internet Service Provider) in order to determine which rogue DNS server will be used for DNS-hijacking and launches a brute-force attack with a predefined dictionary of logins and passwords:\n\n\u201cThe trojan gets the default gateway address and then tries to access it in the embedded browser. With the help of JavaScript it tries to login using different combinations of logins and passwords. Judging by the hardcoded names of input fields and the structures of the HTML documents that the trojan tries to access, the JavaScript code used will work only on web interfaces of TP-LINK Wi-Fi routers.\u201d continues the report from Kaspersky Lab.\n\nWhan the malware access the web administration interface of the router, it replaces the primary and secondary DNS servers with IP addresses pointing to rogue DNS servers (i.e. 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11 and 120.76.249.59).\n\n\n\nOnce the malware changed the DNS settings, traffic is redirected to malicious websites instead of the ones. Users could be redirected to phishing websites or to domains hosting exploit kits used to serve malware.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, crooks already broke into 1,280 Wi-Fi networks redirecting traffic of all the users attached to them.\n\n\u201cThe Trojan targets the entire network, exposing all its users, whether individuals or businesses, to a wide range of attacks \u2013 from phishing to secondary infection,\u201d said Buchka. \u201cA successful attack can be hard to detect and even harder to shift: the new settings can survive a router reboot, and even if the rogue DNS is disabled, the secondary DNS server is on hand to carry on.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Switcher Trojan, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/switcher", "topic_name": "Switcher"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyanogen is shutting down CyanogenMod, it will go on as Lineage, maybe", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54753/mobile-2/cyanogen-shut-down.html", "title": "Cyanogen is shutting down CyanogenMod, it will go on as Lineage, maybe\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 26, 2016", "body": "Bad news for users of the most popular custom Android ROM, the Cyanogen OS, that is now closing its services.\n\nCyanogen was launched with the intent to provide an improved version of the Google Android operating system but following some technical and potential legal issues, it decided to shut down its custom services.\n\nCyanogenMod OS is not a commercial operating system that implements features not available in the official firmware distributed by mobile device vendors.\n\nIt is managed by a community of developers led by Steve Kondik, which is one of the co-founder of Cyanogen.\n\n\u201cAs part of the ongoing consolidation of Cyanogen, all services and Cyanogen-supported nightly builds will be discontinued no later than 12/31/16. The open source project and source code will remain available for anyone who wants to build CyanogenMod personally.\u201d reads an official statement published on the official website.\n\nThe planned shutdown of Cyanogen was officially announced late Friday through a very brief blog post made by the company, saying \u201cas part of the ongoing consolidation of Cyanogen,\u201d it\u2019s shutting down all services and nightly builds on December 31.\n\nWhat does it mean for end-users?\n\nStarting from January 2017, there will be no more Android ROM updates, anyway, the open source project and source code will remain available for those people that want to build their own CyanogenMod.\n\nCyanogen will stop providing nightly builds and security updates for its OS, mobile devices running Cyanogen OS (i.e. OnePlus One), will have to switch to the open-source version of the CyanogenMod OS.\n\nAt the time I was writing the www.cyanogenmod.org is down.\n\nThe CyanogenMod team has published a post to confirm the shutdown of the CM infrastructure and revealing a plan to continue the open-source initiative as Lineage.\n\nBelow the full message from the team:\n\n\u201cLast week, we released the final CM-13.0 releases, updated to the latest security patches, in anticipation of what follows.\n\nYesterday, Cyanogen Inc (Cyngn) announced that they were shutting down the infrastructure behind CyanogenMod (CM). This is an action that was not unpredictable given the public departure of Kondik (cyanogen himself) from the company, and with him our last remaining advocate inside Cyngn\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure being retired, we in the CM community have lost our voice in the future direction of CM \u2013 the brand could be sold to a third party entity as it was an asset that Kondik risked to start his business and dream. Even if we were to regroup and rebuild our own infrastructure, continuing development of CM would mean to operate with the threat of sale of the brand looming over our heads. Then there is the stigma that has grown to be attached to anything named \u2018Cyanogen\u2019. Many of you reading this have been champions of clarifying that the CM product and CyngnOS were distinct, yet the stain of many PR actions from Cyngn is a hard one to remove from CM. Given CM\u2019s reliance on Cyngn for monetary support and the shared source base, it\u2019s not hard to understand why the confusion remains.\n\nIt will come as no surprise that this most recent action from Cyngn is definitely a death blow for CyanogenMod.\n\nHowever, CM has always been more than the name and more than the infrastructure. CM has been a success based on the spirit, ingenuity and effort of its individual contributors \u2013 back when it was Kondik in his home, to the now thousands of contributors past and present.\n\nEmbracing that spirit, we the community of developers, designers, device maintainers and translators have taken the steps necessary to produce a fork of the CM source code and pending patches. This is more than just a \u2018rebrand\u2019. This fork will return to the grassroots community effort that used to define CM while maintaining the professional quality and reliability you have come to expect more recently.\n\nCM has served the community well over its 8 long years. It has been our home, bringing together friends from all over the world to celebrate our joy of building and giving. Its apt then that on this Eve of a holiday we pay our respects. We will take pride in our Lineage as we move forward and continue to build on its legacy.\n\nThank you & Goodbye,\nThe CyanogenMod Team\u201d\n\n\n\nThe CyanogenMod community is now working to produce a fork of the CyanogenMod source code and pending patches.\n\nAndroid community believes that a new project, dubbed LineageOS, will bo continue to live on it, but it is still in its infancy.\n\nAccording to the CyanogenMod (CM) team, Lineage \u201cis more than just a \u2018rebrand\u2019\u201d and \u201cwill return to the grassroots community effort that used to define CM while maintaining the professional quality and reliability you have come to expect more recently.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in LineageOS you can give a look at its website, the files of the Lineage Android Distribution can be found on a repository on GitHub.\n\n\u201cSo, yes, this is us. LineageOS will be a continuation of what CyanogenMod was. To quote Andy Rubin, this is the definition of open.

The Government of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates applied measures to block Signal, for this reason, the Open Whisper Systems who develop the app has revised the Android version introducing a technique called domain fronting.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s release, domain fronting is enabled for Signal users who have a phone number with a country code from Egypt or the UAE,\u201d said company founder Moxie Marlinspike in a blog post. \u201cWhen those users send a Signal message, it will look like a normal HTTPS request to www.google.com. To block Signal messages, these countries would also have to block all of google.com.\u201d\n\nThe domain fronting is a technique that relies on the use of different domain names at different application layers to evade censorship.\n\n\n\nThe domain fronting techniques \u201chides the remote endpoint of a communication. Domain fronting works at the application layer, using HTTPS, to communicate with a forbidden host while appearing to communicate with some other host, permitted by the censor,\u201d as described in a paper published by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Psiphon, and Brave New Software.\n\n\u201cThe key idea is the use of different domain names at different layers of communication. One domain appears on the \u201coutside\u201d of an HTTPS request\u2014in the DNS request and TLS Server Name Indication\u2014while another domain appears on the \u201cinside\u201d\u2014in the HTTP Host header, invisible to the censor under HTTPS encryption.\u201d continues the paper.\u201dA censor, unable to distinguish fronted and nonfronted traffic to a domain, must choose between allowing circumvention traffic and blocking the domain entirely, which results in expensive collateral damage\u201d \n\nThe Domain fronting technique is easy to deploy and use and doesn\u2019t require special activities by network intermediaries.\n\nIf the front domain is a popular website like \u2018google.com, if the censor will block it would have a serious impact on the users.\n\nDomain fronting has a cost.\n\nDomain fronting leverages a CDN that have to receive the request and forward it to the domain in the HTTP host header, or a service that provides similar functionality, like Google\u2019s App Engine.\n\nSuch services typically have a cost that according to the paper ranges from $0.10\u20130.25 per GB using a service like Google App Engine, Amazon CloudFront, Microsoft Azure, Fastly, and CloudFlare. This may explain why Signal isn\u2019t making domain fronting a default everywhere.\n\nDue to this cost, Signal isn\u2019t providing domain fronting by default.\n\nWhat about domain fronting for the iOS version of Signal?\n\nMarlinspike confirmed that an iOS version of Signal that supports domain fronting is expected soon, meantime it is available a beta version.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Signal, domain fronting)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/domain-fronting", "topic_name": "domain fronting"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/secure-messaging", "topic_name": "secure messaging"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/signal", "topic_name": "Signal"}]}, {"news_name": "Fancy Bear APT tracked Ukrainian artillery units with an Android implant", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54635/cyber-warfare-2/implant-ukrainian-artillery-units.html", "title": "Fancy Bear APT tracked Ukrainian artillery units with an Android implant\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 22, 2016", "body": "The popular hacking group, known as Fancy Bear, APT 28, Pawn Storm, Sednit or Sofacy, is once again in the headlines. Experts from the cyber security firm CrowdStrike reported the alleged Russian nation-state actor used malware implant on Android devices to track and target Ukrainian artillery units from late 2014 through 2016.\n\nThe malicious code was used by spy on target communication and retrieve locational data of the Ukrainian artillery units, this information would have likely been used by pro-Russian separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine to launch attacks against Ukrainian units. Late in the summer of 2016, researchers from CrowdStrike Intelligence began investigating a curious Android Package (APK) named \u2018\u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk\u2019 (MD5: 6f7523d3019fa190499f327211e01fcb). The APK contains a number of Russian language artifacts that were military in nature.  Hackers used an implant for a legitimate app, but there is no evidence the application was made available in the Android app store.\n\n\u201cFrom late 2014 and through 2016, FANCY BEAR X-Agent implant was covertly distributed on Ukrainian military forums within a legitimate Android application developed by Ukrainian artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk.\u201d states the report published by Crowdstrike. \u201cThe original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from minutes to under 15 seconds. According to Sherstuk\u2019s interviews with the press, over 9000 artillery personnel have been using the application in Ukrainian military.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cInitial research identified that the filename suggested a relationship to the D-30 122mm towed howitzer, an artillery weapon first manufactured in the Soviet Union in the 1960s but still in use today.\u201d states the report.\n\nIf the analysis published by the experts it correct, it means that the Kremlin military strategy made a large use of hacking campaigns to influence internal affairs of foreign governments and to support military operations.\n\nExperts believe the Fancy Bear hacker group operates on behalf of the Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, GRU.

The backdoor affects mobile phones from BLU Products that are available for sale on both Amazon and Best Buy.\n\nThe backdoor resides in the commercial Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) update software that is installed on BLU Android devices provided as a service to BLU by AdUps.\n\nNow researchers from Anubis Networks have discovered that a third-party firmware included in more than 2.8 million low-cost Android devices could be exploited to compromise the smartphones Over-the-Air (OTA) updates and gain root privileges.\n\nThe firmware affected by the backdoor is developed by the Chinese company Ragentek Group. The problem resides in the lack of encryption for the OTA mechanisms that expose users to MITM attacks. The analysis revealed that the Ragentek firmware running on the smartphone implements an insecure Over-the-Air update mechanism that establishes an unprotected connection to remote servers via an unencrypted communications channel.\n\nCompared to the Adups backdoor discovered a few days ago, the Ragentek didn\u2019t collect user data, but a malicious update could also implement such kind of behavior.\n\nExperts highlighted that the OTA mechanism is pre-installed on million devices and runs as root without SSL protection, a perfect backdoor for attackers.\n\n\u201cIt allowed for adversaries to remotely execute commands on the devices as a privileged user if they were in a position to conduct a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The binary responsible appears to be an insecure implementation of an OTA (Over-the-air) mechanism for device updates associated to the software company, Ragentek Group, in China.\u201d reads the analysis published by Anubisnetworks.\n\n \u201cAll transactions from the binary to the third-party endpoint occur over an unencrypted channel, which not only exposes user-specific information during these communications, but would allow an adversary to issue commands supported by the protocol. One of these commands allows for the execution of system commands. This issue affected devices out of the box.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was made after a researcher bought a BLU Studio G smartphone from Best Buy, a circumstance similar to the previous discovery made by the experts at Kryptowire.\n\nThe researchers from AnubisNetworks found another disconcerting discovery, the firmware components that implement the OTA update mechanism also includes code to disguise its presence from the Android OS. This means that there in no evidence in the list of active Android processes of ongoing OTA updates.\n\nFurthermore, the OTA code was distributed with a set of domains preconfigured in the binary. Surprisingly, only one of these domains was registered at the time of the discovery of this issue, this means that if an adversary will register these remaining two domains, they would potentially send malicious updates to almost 3,000,000 devices. AnubisNetworks bought these two domains to prevent any abuse.\n\nSeveral low-price Android models are affected by the issues, mostly BLU Product, other impacted vendors are Infinix Mobility, DOOGEE, LEAGOO, IKU Mobile, Beeline, and XOLO.\n\n\n\n \n\nAnubis, alongside with Google, BLU, and the US-CERT is notifying all affected vendors.

Your contacts and calendars, system backups and photos can be stored in the cloud on Apple servers. This time, we discovered that yet another piece of data is stored in the cloud for no apparent reason. Using an iPhone and have an active iCloud account? Your calls will sync with iCloud whether you want it or not. In fact, most users we\u2019ve heard from don\u2019t want this \u201cfeature\u201d, yet Apple has no official way to turn off this behavior other than telling people \u201cnot using the same Apple ID on different devices\u201d. What\u2019s up with that? Let\u2019s try to find out.\u201d reads the analysis published by Elcomsoft.\n\nElcomsoft tools could allow determining what personal data is synchronized with Apple servers and how to prevent it.\n\nWhen the iCloud feature is enabled, Apple mobile devices automatically collect and send back to the company private information such as call history, phone numbers, phone call metadata (i.e. Length of calls).\n\nThe iPhone also sends information collected from other third-party VoOP applications, including Facebook Messenger, Viber, WhatsApp, and Skype.\n\n\n\nSecurity experts highlighted the low level of protection of users\u2019 data in Apple iCloud, that could be easily accessed by law enforcement.\n\n\u201cSo far, we had no reasons to doubt this policy. However, we\u2019ve seen Apple moving more and more data into the cloud. iCloud data (backups, call logs, contacts and so on) is very loosely protected, allowing Apple itself or any third party with access to proper credentials extracting this information. Information stored in Apple iCloud is of course available to law enforcement.\u201d continues Elcomsoft .\n\nEven logs are sent in real time to Apple when iCloud Drive is enabled. If users want to stop sharing their logs with Apple need to disable iCloud Drive completely, an operation that has an impact on many applications.\n\n\u201cSyncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,\u201d says Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov. \u201cBut all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. In that case, many applications will stop working or lose iCloud-related features completely.\u201d\n\nApple, of course, defends its iCloud Sync feature ensuring that customers\u2019 data is encrypted and protected with a two-factor authentication mechanism.\n\n\u201cWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices.

The group was targeting Android customers of a number of Russian banks.\n\nAmong the features implemented by the mobile malware there is the privilege escalation ability, intercepting and sending SMS messages, delivering ransomware, phishing payment card data, and disabling mobile security solutions.\n\nNews of the day is that Kaspersky Lab in August discovered a new strain of the Svpeng Trojan delivered through popular news websites using Google\u2019s AdSense.\n\n\u201cIn early August we detected several cases of a banking Trojan being downloaded automatically when users viewed certain news sites on their Android devices. Later it became apparent that this was being caused by advertising messages from the Google AdSense network, and was not restricted to news sites.\u201d reported Kaspersky.\n\nUnfortunately, when Kaspersky discovered the malvertising attack it estimated roughly 318,000 infections over a two-month period.\n\n\u201cAs you can see from the graphs, within a two-month period Svpeng was detected on the computers of approximately 318,000 users, with the detection rate peaking at around 37,000 attacked users in one day. \u201d reads the analysis from Kaspersky.\n\n\n\nThe latest versions of Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng is limited to Russia and the CIS.\n\nThe company reported the incident to Google that developed a patch to fix the flaw in Google Chrome, the security update will become available to users the next time the browser is updated.\n\nIt is interesting to highlight that the malicious payload served via ads were automatically downloaded to Android mobile devices, without any warning to the victim. Researchers determined that the cybercriminals exploited a zero-day in the Android version of Chrome.\n\nChrome normally warns users when a potentially dangerous file is downloaded to their Android device and prompts them to confirm the download, but crooks bypassed this mechanism by breaking down the file into smaller pieces.\n\n\u201c\u201cWhen an APK file is broken down into pieces and handed over to the save function via Blob() class, there is no check for the type of the content being saved, so the browser saves the APK file without notifying the user,\u201d researchers explained.\u201d continues Kaspersky.\n\nKaspersky pointed out that the Svpeng Trojan is not automatically installed on Android devices after the download via the Chrome zero-day vulnerability. The attackers used a social engineering technique in order to trick the victims into installing it. Experts observed the attackers using malicious files names such as \u201cWhatsApp.apk,\u201d \u201clast-browser-update.apk\u201d or \u201cAndroid_update_6.apk\u201d in the attempt of tricking users into installing them.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android , Svpeng Trojan)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-malvertising", "topic_name": "malware malvertising"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/svpeng-trojan", "topic_name": "Svpeng Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Abusing protocols in LTE networks to knock mobile devices off networks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/53180/hacking/hacking-lte-networks.html", "title": "Abusing protocols in LTE networks to knock mobile devices off networks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 8, 2016", "body": "We discussed several times the rule of the SS7 signaling protocol in mobile communications and how to exploit its flaws to track users.\n\nWhen mobile users travel between countries, their mobile devices connect to the infrastructure of a local operator that communicates with their operator back home. The SS7 protocol allows to implement roaming, but as explained it is also affected by many vulnerabilities that could be exploited for:\n\nDiameter is considered the evolution of the SS7 protocol for modern Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks, respect its predecessor it is more secure, isn\u2019t it?\n\nAnyway. experts discovered that Diameter is also affected by security issues, one if them, is the lack of mandatory implementation of the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol.\n\nAccording to researchers from Nokia Bell Labs and Aalto University in Finland, this means that Diameter could be hacked with the same techniques that are effective against SS7.\n\nThe team of experts made several tests to evaluate attacks against users connected to the LTE network. They simulated the attacks on a test network set up by an unnamed global mobile operator. In the tests, they powered a cyber attack against UK subscribers from Finland and discovered several methods of disrupting service to users.\n\nThe researchers were able to temporarily and permanently shut down users connections, they were also able to target entire regions.\n\nThe team presented the results of tests at the Black Hat Europe security conference in London.\n\nIn order to launch the attack against another operator\u2019s systems or subscribers, the researchers need to access to the private interconnection network (IPX).The experts demonstrated that there are several ways to access IPX, for example, a persistent attacker like a government could oblige a local operator to gain access through it.\n\nAttackers could act as a virtual network operator and get access to the roaming network through an existing operator. They could also hack into one of the nodes run by an operator that is accessible from the internet. Let\u2019s give a close look at LTE networks and their main components:\n\nGreat now the attacker has the info to start the attack!\n\nAt this point, the attacker masquerading as a partner\u2019s HSS sends a Cancel Location Request (CLR) message to the victim\u2019s MME causing the disconnection of the specific subscriber.\n\nThe CLR messages are normally used inside the LTE network when subscribers switch from one MME to another because of a change in location.\n\nThe researchers also highlighted another possible to exploit this mechanism to obtain a sort of amplification factor of the request. The researchers noticed that when the subscriber re-attaches, their device will send 20 different messages to the MME.\n\n\n\nImagine the case the attackers force the detachment of hundreds of subscribers at the same time, the MME will be flooded by \u2018re-attach\u2019 messages causing a DoS in large areas covered by Mobility Management Entities.\n\nThere is also a second DoS attack scenario in which the attackers can impersonate an HSS and send an Insert Subscriber Data Request (IDR) to the victim\u2019s MME with a special value that means no service. This will permanently detach the mobile user from the network because their subscription will be changed in the MME\u2019s records.\n\nIn this case, the only way to attach the network again is contacting the mobile operator.\n\nAs you can see also LTE networks and Diameter are vulnerable to hacking attack, for this reason, the researchers highlighted the need for further security measures.\n\nFor further information give a look at the slides (\u201cDetach me not DoS attacks against 4G cellular users worldwide from your desk\u201c) presented at the BlackHatEurope 2016.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 LTE Network, Hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackhat-europe", "topic_name": "BlackHat EUROPE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dos", "topic_name": "DOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lte-network", "topic_name": "LTE Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ss7", "topic_name": "SS7"}]}, {"news_name": "How to Exploit Belkin WEMO gear to hack Android devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/53131/hacking/belkin-wemo-hack.html", "title": "How to Exploit Belkin WEMO gear to hack Android devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 6, 2016", "body": "Belkin\u2019s WeMo home automation firmware that\u2019s in use in its light bulbs, switches, security cameras, coffee makers and room heaters has recently been found vulnerable to an SQL injection.\n\nThe hack allows root privileges to a third party, which already has access to the devices\u2019 local network.\n\nResearchers at Virginia based Invincea Labs discovered the vulnerability and also warned of a related knock on exploit path which allows for compromise of the Android device used to control the Belkin home automation systems.\n\nThe flaw exploits a weakness in field validation by allowing a threat actor to inject malicious JavaScript via the device name field.\n\nScott Tenaglia, Research Director at Invincea stated that the flaws were previously unknown and not linked to earlier flaws in the WeMo home automation products.\n\nInvincea Labs privately disclosed the flaws on Thursday the 11th of August with Belkin publicly announcing the vulnerability the next day.\n\nOn September the 1st, Belkin released a patch, which remedied the code injection vulnerability on the Android app. A further patch was released by Belkin to fix the WeMo appliances on November the 1st\n\nIt\u2019s unknown how many WeMo products are vulnerable to this particular weakness, however, in 2015 it was reported that Belkin WeMo had approximately 1.5 million products in use.\n\nResearchers at Invincea stated that every one of their devices that allow for remote control or administration is vulnerable to the attack.\n\nIn order to exploit this particular set of vulnerabilities, a malicious actor would first have to gain access to the local network where the smart devices were located. They would then have to leverage the shared network infrastructure in order to move the malicious code from their entry point to the vulnerable devices.\n\nAccording to Tenaglia \u201cThe goal of the attacker is to hop from one device \u2013 a PC that can be later disinfected \u2013 to another device that can\u2019t be protected \u2013 such as an IoT device,\u201d. He then went on to explain, \u201cOnce the attacker has access to the IoT device they can do whatever they want from downloading Mirai-type malware for creating a botnet or just control the device in question. They can also infect or re-infect any PC on the same network with malware of their choice.\u201d\n\nInvincea Labs tested their concept by infecting a WeMo device with a malicious PowerShell script and from there open a telnet connection on the device and have it supply a root shell to requesters.\n\nTenaglia also stated that once infected the device could be configured to deny requests to patch the system and default setting reset attempts unless patched with the recently released firmware update.\n\nOnce the access had been granted the researchers found that the attack could progress to target Android devices running the WeMo app used to control the home automation devices.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time anyone has discovered a way for IoT devices to hack your phone\u201d, according to Tenaglia.\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability affects devices by placing unsanitized JavaScript into the name fields of the device, instead of only being recognized as a string the malicious code is executed instead.\n\n\u201cEvery WeMo device can be assigned a name. What we found is you can set the name property in the device to a malicious string. The malicious string contains JavaScript code. And when the Android app requests the name of the devices it needs to connect to, it will download the malicious JavaScript code that is the name of the device, and execute the code,\u201d\n\nUtilizing the hack in the lab environment Tenaglia reported that they were able to both access the photo gallery on the phone as well as activate the GPS beaconing system, allowing third parties to track and locate the device.\n\n\u201cAll this hack allows us to do is run code in the context of the WeMo app. We do not have root access to the phone,\u201d Tenaglia said. Furthermore, access to the Android device is limited to only when the app is active or running in memory on the phone. Once the WeMo remote app is shut down, access is terminated. \u201cWhat we have is an in-memory infection. The code does not persist on the phone when you force quit the app. However the name of the device is still that malicious string. So when you connect to that device again the reinfection occurs,\u201d\nWritten by: Steven Boyd\n\n\n\n\nSteven is a security consultant, researcher, ethical hacker and freelance writer with over 16 years of experience in the industry.

An attacker can use the technique to sign into any victim\u2019s mobile app account without any knowledge of the legitimate user.\n\nThe research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong is composed of Ronghai Yang, Wing Cheong Lau, and Tianyu Liu. The experts discovered that the vast majority of popular mobile apps that use the single sign-on (SSO) service doesn\u2019t properly implement the OAuth 2.0 protocol.\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol is widely used on social networking sites, every day billion of users access their profiles on Facebook and Google+ using it.\n\nUsing the OAuth 2.0, users can sign in for third-party services by verifying existing identity through their accounts on popular web services such as Google, Facebook, or Sina.\n\nOnce authenticated, the users haven\u2019t to provide their credentials to access other services implementing the OAuth 2.0 protocol.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe problem is a pretty basic mistake,\u201d Lau told Forbes. \n\n\u201cThe impact, he said, could be severe. For instance, if the hacker broke into a travel app, they could learn the full itinerary of an individual. For a hotel booking app, they could book a room and have the victim pay for it. Or they could simply steal personal data, like addresses or bank details.\u201d wrote Thomas Fox-Brewster from Forbes.\n\n\u201cA lot of third party developers are ma and pa shops, they don\u2019t have the capability.

Rowhammer is classified as a problem affecting some recent DRAM devices in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows, this means that theoretically an attacker can change any value of the bit in the memory.\n\nThe Rowhammer attack for mobile device involves a malicious application that once in execution repeatedly accesses the same \u201crow\u201d of transistors on a memory chip in a tiny fraction of a second (Hammering process)\n\nHammering a specific portion of memory can electrically interfere with neighboring row. This interference can cause the row to leak electricity into the next row, which eventually causes a bit to flip and consequent data modification.\n\nAn attacker can exploit these modifications to execute its code and gain control of the device.\n\nIn short, Rowhammer is an issue with new generation DRAM chips in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause \u201cbit flipping\u201d in an adjacent row that could allow anyone to change the value of contents stored in the memory.\n\nThe researchers created a proof-of-concept exploit, dubbed DRAMMER, to test mobile the Rowhammer attack on mobile devices.\n\nDetails on the DRAMMER attack are included in a paper published by the experts and on this page.\n\nTo test the Rowhammer attack on mobile phones, the researchers created a new proof-of-concept exploit, dubbed DRAMMER. The hack could modify crucial bits of data allowing attacker to root Android devices from major vendors, including Samsung, OnePlus, LG, and Motorola.\n\nThe experts exploited the Android mechanism known as the ION memory allocator to give an app a direct access to the dynamic random access memory (DRAM). The ION memory allocator also allows the attackers to identify adjacent rows on the DRAM, which is essential to power the Rowhammer attack by generating bit flips.\n\nThe ability allowed the researchers to achieve root access on the victim\u2019s device, giving them full control of the mobile device.\n\n\u201cOn a high level, our technique works by exhausting available memory chunks of different sizes to drive the physical memory allocator into a state in which it has to start serving memory from regions that we can reliably predict,\u201d states the paper.\n\u201cWe then force the allocator to place the target security-sensitive data, i.e., a page table, at a position in physical memory which is vulnerable to bit flips and which we can hammer from adjacent parts of memory under our control.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDrammer is a new attack that exploits the Rowhammer hardware vulnerability on Android devices. It allows attackers to take control over your mobile device by hiding it in a malicious app that requires no permissions. Practically all devices are possibly vulnerable and must wait for a fix from Google in order to be patched. Drammer has the potential to put millions of users at risk, especially when combined with existing attack vectors like Stagefright or BAndroid.\u201d states a blog post published by the researchers.\n\nThe experts successfully rooted Android handsets including Google\u2019s Nexus 4 and Nexus 5; LG\u2019s G4; Samsung Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5, Motorola\u2019s Moto G models from 2013 and 2014; and OnePlus One.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot only does our [DRAMMER] attack show that practical, deterministic Rowhammer attacks are a real threat to billions of mobile users, but it is also the first effort to show that Rowhammer is\u2026(reliably exploitable) on any platform other than x86 and with a much more limited software feature set than existing solutions,\u201d reads a paper published by the experts.\n\nThe DRAMMER app is able to take over the victim\u2019s mobile within minutes and doesn\u2019t request user\u2019s interaction.\n\nThe researchers published two following proof-of-concept videos that demonstrate DRAMMER attack in action against an unrooted LG Nexus 5.\n\nIn the first video, the phone is running Android 6.0.1 with security patches Google released on October 5, while in the second one the researchers show how the DRAMMER attack can be combined with Stagefright bug that is still unpatched in many older Android devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers have released on GitHub the source code of the DRAMMER app in order to allow users to test their mobile device and anonymously share their results.\n\nThe experts reported the issue to Google in July, and the tech giant recognized it as a \u201ccritical\u201d vulnerability and awarded the researchers $4,000 under its bug bounty program.\n\nThe issue is expected to be partially solved with the upcoming November security bulletin, in this way it will be more difficult for attacker to launch a DRAMMER attack.\n\nThe problem is that some software features that DRAMMER exploits are so essential to any OS, it is not possible to remove or modify them without a significant impact on the overall design of the device.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android, DRAMMER attack)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "The \u2018Sin\u2019 Card: How criminals unlocked a stolen iPhone 6S", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52432/hacking/unlocked-stolen-iphone-6s.html", "title": "The \u2018Sin\u2019 Card: How criminals unlocked a stolen iPhone 6S\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 18, 2016", "body": "1. Introduction\n\nYou have an iPhone 6S protected by a 6 digits password plus the touch ID fingerprint and you may think that nobody can unlock it without the code, right? Wrong! At least not, according to the incident we analyzed this week at Morphus Labs.\n\nAn iPhone 6S, exactly as described in the previous paragraph, was stolen three days ago. The victim told us that, right after the incident, the criminals did reset some of their online services passwords, like Apple ID and contacted his bank pretending to be him in an attempt to retrieve the bank account\u2019s passwords. Fortunately, they couldn\u2019t reach the victim\u2019s money, but, how could they reset the Apple ID password from a locked device?\n\nTo better understand this scenario, we\u2019ve collected more information about the victim:\n\na) Could it have been a targeted attack, I mean, was the thief focused on stealing that iPhone specifically? Could the thief have previously grabbed the victim\u2019s credentials using an e-mail phishing scam or something like that?\n\nProbably not. According to the information we collected, the iPhone was the last item that the thief asked the victim.\n\nb) Did some ID or other documents with the victim\u2019s information also stolen? It is important to understand if the thief knew the victim\u2019s name or e-mail address.\n\nNo. No ID or document with the victim\u2019s name or any other information was stolen. They just asked for money and the iPhone.\n\nc) How long did it take to the victim to lock the iPhone and SIM card?\n\nApproximately 2 hours after the theft.\n\nd) Was the iPhone password \u201cguessable\u201d?\n\nNo. The 6 digits password wasn\u2019t easily guessable and had no relation to the victim\u2019s car plate number or personal information that the thief might have.\n\nSo, given this mysterious scenario, we decided to dive into the situation and understand how the victim\u2019s iPhone was unlocked.\n\n2. The timeline\n\nWe will now establish a timeline to organize the facts that happened last October 14th afternoon:\n\na)   14:00 \u2013 the theft occurred;\n\nb)   16:03 \u2013 the victim activated the lost mode of its iPhone and asked for it to be remotely erased through iCloud;\n\nc)    16:28 \u2013 the victim\u2019s Google Account password was changed;\n\nd)   16:37 \u2013 the victim received an e-mail with a link to redefine its Apple ID\u2019s password;\n\ne)   16:38 \u2013 a new e-mail informing the victim that the Apple ID password has been changed;\n\nf)    16:43 \u2013 a new e-mail informing that the iPhone has been located;\n\ng)   16:43 \u2013 a new e-mail informing that the iPhone was being erased;\n\nSo, as we can see, the victim\u2019s Google and Apple accounts passwords were reset by the thief of the iPhone. As we all know, unlocking an iPhone without the proper credentials is a \u201chard to unfeasible\u201d work. So, how did they do it?\n\nBased on the facts that we established on the timeline, we started to work on some questions that might explain what happened:\n\n1)   To change a Google account password, you have to inform at least your login, in other words, your e-mail address. How the e-mail address might have been discovered?\n\nDespite the fact the latest IOS version shows information and notifications even on a locked iPhone, in our simulations, nothing appeared on the screen that could give the user\u2019s Gmail address away;\n\n2)   Is there a way to discover the Apple ID from the device\u2019s IMEI?\n\nWe searched on the Web and found paid services that offer exactly that: \u201cdiscover the Apple\u2019s ID from a given IMEI\u201d. But all of them inform that this isn\u2019t an online process. It could take 24 to 48 hours for you to get the information you want. This was not the case. The whole process took around 2 hours.\n\n3)   Is there a way to discover a Gmail account based on the only information that the criminal had, that is, the phone number?\n\nWe did some search again and realized that Google offers a way to discover an e-mail address based on some given data: the phone number that you associate to your account, a name and a surname. As the phone number could be easily discovered in this scenario, discovering the name and surname from that phone number could be less than hard. We\u2019re starting to get somewhere\u2026\n\n3. The hypothesis simulation\n\nSo, we decided to follow that way and try to find the name and surname of the victim from the perspective of the thief. This time, arranging our lab wasn\u2019t a tough task. The victim bought a new iPhone 6S smartphone, configured exactly the way the stolen one was and gave to us for the purpose of this research. That way, our scenario was as close as possible to the real scenario \u2013 including the same Google and Apple accounts.\n\n3.1. Discovering the phone number\n\nTo obtain the phone number, we removed the SIM card from the iPhone and inserted it on another phone. Similar to the real scenario, no PIN lock was in place. On the other phone, it was easy to identify the phone number.\n\n3.2. Low-hanging fruit\n\nNow, having the phone number, we followed the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d strategy at first. We tried to find the victim\u2019s name putting his phone number on the Internet search engines. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t find anything useful.\n\nThe next approach was to look for the phone number on Facebook. We know that if you have your phone number associated to your profile, it\u2019s easy to find you by your phone number. Once again, nothing was found.\n\n3.3. Thinking outside the box\n\nNothing on the low-hanging fruit, so, time to think outside the box. Of course that there could exist different ways to find out a person name by its phone number, but we decided to insist a little more in finding it with the information we have on our hands.\n\nSo, I remembered that recently I changed my smartphone. While configuring the new one, my WhatsApp profile came with my photo \u2013 and I didn\u2019t restore if from the backup. But I didn\u2019t remember if it came with my profile name and I decided to see if this strategy could give us the victim\u2019s name.\n\nTo do so, we removed the SIM card from the locked iPhone and inserted it on a second smartphone with Whatsapp installed. We followed the initial configuration, receiving the SMS and so on, but unfortunately (of fortunately), WhatsApp did not load the profile name. It brought just the profile photo and status.\n\nYet related to WhatsApp, a second idea came into place. You might remember that if you are in a WhatsApp group and receive a message from a person that is not in your contact list, its name appears just after its phone number (ie: 9999-9999 ~Mike Arnold). So, it would be possible to send a message from that locked iPhone to a WhatsApp group, we could get the name associated to that profile.\n\n3.4. (Whatsapp + Locked screen notification response) hacking\n\nSo, firstly, we confirmed that the iPhone was configured to show WhatsApp notifications on the locked screen sending it a single message. The message was shown as expected. The next step was to try to answer that message from the locked iPhone. Using the \u201c3D touch\u201d functionality, we were able to answer that message.\n\nInitial validations were done, time to try the group message approach. We created a group and included the contact associated with the locked iPhone\u2019s number. As there is no validation for you to enter a new group, as we did this and a new message was shown on the locked iPhone screen informing that it is now part of that new group.\n\nAs we had to create a contact associated with the iPhone number on the smartphone that created the group, we had to include a third participant in the same group. This third participant has no contact data related to the iPhone\u2019s number.\n\nSo, that was all set. We sent a message from one of the group participants. As expected, the message arrived on the locked iPhone screen. We answered it from the locked iPhone and, as expected again, the message sent to the third participant came associated to the iPhone\u2019s Whatsapp profile name. Stage completed.\n\n\n\nThe next and easiest step was to put those three parameters we discovered (phone number, name and a surname) in the Google form and get the e-mail address associated with that person. Stage completed.\n\n3.4. Changing the Google account password\n\nNow, let\u2019s try to replay the password change made by the criminal. The next steps were:\n\n\u2013      Enter Google login screen;\n\n\u2013      Choose \u201cforget my password\u201d option;\n\n\u2013      Insert any text on the \u201clast password that you remember\u201d;\n\n\u2013      On the next screen, Google asks for the phone number associated with the account. They only show a partial of the phone number, but the last two digits allowed us to believe we were on the right track;\n\n\u2013      Inserting the iPhone\u2019s phone number, Google sent to iPhone a code through SMS to be inserted on the next screen;\n\n\u2013      After doing that, Google offered us to input a new password for that account.\n\nAt that moment, we reproduced the Google account password change by mimicking what the criminal did and started to think how easy it could be, depending on the way it was set, to change someone\u2019s Google account password having only its phone or SIM card and its first and last name \u2013 even for some minutes (or seconds).\n\n3.5. Changing the Apple ID password\n\nSo, we continued following the incident timeline. On the next step we used the previous discovered Google e-mail as the Apple ID account login and choose the option \u201cforget password\u201d again. After that, a message was shown informing that an e-mail was sent to the Google account with a link to reset the password. The rest of this paragraph is easy to figure out. We had success changing the password associated with that Apple ID.\n\n3.6. Unlocking the \u201cnew\u201d iPhone\n\nBased on the facts that occurred in the real incident, it was time to remotely lock and erase the iPhone we were using to do the simulations.\n\nI could bet these procedures helped the criminal getting access to the iPhone. After the erase process, the iPhone asks you to enter the Apple ID and password that was previously associated to that device. And, as we have that information, it was easy to access and configure the \u201cnew\u201d iPhone from scratch.\n\n4. Vulnerabilities and Recommendations\n\nWell, of course we might have followed a different strategy compared to that of the criminals, but the result was the same \u2013 an iPhone unlocked without its credentials.\n\nHowever, to achieve this result, there are some assumptions that we will consider as vulnerabilities that should be avoided:\n\na)   Locked phone notifications\n\nAllowing your smartphone to show notifications while locked is a great convenience. But at the same time, allowing them may represent a great risk to your privacy and security.\n\nAs shown in our experiment, this feature allowed us to read SMS and WhatsApp messages and, worst, answer it without unlocking the device.\n\nWe strongly recommend disabling \u201cshow notifications on your locked smartphone\u201d (advice for users). Depending on your platform (Android or IOS) or App, there are different ways to configure this.\n\nb)   The \u2018Sin\u2019 Card\n\nThis episode remembered us how important it is to protect the SIM card. We all take care of locking our smartphones with strong passwords and fingerprint auth, strong encryption and so on (don`t we?), but we have to remember the importance of properly securing the SIM card.\n\nAs we could see on the experiments we did on this research, the SMS is an important peace nowadays in terms of transaction validation and authentication services. We used it to receive the Google unlock code, but it could be used to authenticate other kinds of transactions.\n\nSo, we recommend to set a password protection (PIN) to your SIM card. That way, you considerably reduce the risk of impersonation if you lose or you have your cell phone stolen.\n\nDepending on your smartphone, there are different ways to configure it. Remember that, after you set your SIM card PIN, you have to insert it every time you reboot your smartphone (which is not very usable).\n\n\n\nc)    Two-factor authentication\n\nLast but not least, please, enable two-factor authentication on your accounts right now! Two-factor authentication means that you have to provide a combination of at least two methods to prove your identity to the system you are dealing with. The possible factors you can pick from are these three: something that you know, like a password; something that you have, like a hard or soft token and something that you are, like your fingerprint.\n\nNowadays, almost all of the Internet services offers you the option to configure two-factor authentication \u2013 usually a password and token. There is an option for the second factor to be sending you an SMS, but we know that it may be fragile. Preferably, choose to use an App, like Google Authenticator, to generate the token.\n\nThis strategy will strongly reduce the risks of unauthorized access to your account. If the victim of this incident was using two-factor authentication, it would be impossible to change their password by using the SMS strategy.\n\n5. Final words\n\nGiven the short period of time between the theft and the accounts hacking process, we believe that this strategy is widely used to unlock lost and stolen devices.\n\nAside from the financial loss directly involved with having an iPhone lost/stolen, this case brings us an important reflection. Are we protecting our SIM cards and SMS messages as we should? The potential impact, like improper information access or disclosure in scenarios like the one from this article, could be even more devastating. It would be an overkill to compare an unlocked SIM card to an important password that you carry every day, in clear text, attached to your smartphone?\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nRenato Marinho\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 hacking, iPhone)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iphone", "topic_name": "iPhone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/two-factor-authentication", "topic_name": "two-factor authentication"}]}, {"news_name": "Android Acecard banking trojan asks users for selfie with an ID card", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52291/malware/acecard-banking-trojan-selfie.html", "title": "Android Acecard banking trojan asks users for selfie with an ID card\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 15, 2016", "body": "The inventiveness of the criminals is a never ending pit. Recently, a number of organizations announced a new authentication method based on the selfies. For example, HSBC customers can open new bank accounts using a selfie, such as the Bank of Scotland and many other financial organizations and Mastercard.\n\nCrooks have already started taking advantage of this new method of biometric authentication, experts at McAfee discovered a new Android banking Trojan, dubbed Acecard, that pretends to be an adult video app or a codec/plug-in necessary to see a specific video.\n\n\u201cRecently the McAfee Labs Mobile Research Team found a new variant of the well-known Android banking Trojan Acecard (aka Torec, due to the use of Tor to communicate with the control server) that goes far beyond just asking for financial information.\u201d reads a blog post published by McAfee. \u201cIn addition to requesting credit card information and second-factor authentication, the malicious application asks for a selfie with your identity document\u2014very useful for a cybercriminal to confirm a victim\u2019s identity and access not only to banking accounts, but probably also even social networks.\u201d \n\nThe fake video plugin appears like an Adobe Flash Player, a pornographic app, or video codec.\n\nWhen it is running in the background, the Acecard banking Trojan monitors the opening of specific apps usually associated with payment transactions.

The most worrisome issue is related to the message authentication code (MAC) used for the verification of the attachments.\n\nEvery time a Signal user sends a file, the attachment is first encrypted and then the application assigns it a MAC that is used by the recipient to verify the sender\u2019s identity and the integrity of the file sent.\n\nThe file attached to the message is stored on Amazon\u2019s S3 storage servers and it is available for the download via HTTPS to the recipient\u2019s device.\n\nThe security duo discovered that it is possible to run a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to access the Amazon S3 storage or any of the CA certificates trusted by Android can serve the targeted user an modified attachment.\n\nThe experts discovered that it is possible to bypass the MAC verification function by padding the attachment with 4 Gb plus 1 byte of data.\n\nThe researchers noted that in practice the attacker does not need to send 4 Gb of data to the victim, by using HTTP stream compression it is possible to reduce the attachment to just 4.5 Mb.\n\n \n\n\u201cAs seen above remainingData is of type int and calculated from the length of the file subtracted by the MAC length. Since file.length() will return a value of type long and files may be larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE, remainingData will wrap around.\u201d reads the analysis published by the researchers.\n\n\u201cUnlike C(++), Java is \u201cmemory safe\u201d and therefore this will not lead to any classical memory corruption condition. Instead, we can use this overflow to subvert the program logic. Now if the file is of size 4GB + 1 byte + X, the value will wrap around and remainingDatawill be set to X.\u201d\n\nThe security experts also disclosed another flaw related to the application\u2019s CallAudioManager class and how it handles Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets. A remote attacker could exploit it to crash the messaging app.\n\nThe flaws were already reported to Signal on September 13, the company committed the fixes on the GitHub repository on the same day. Searching for Signal in the Google Play it is possible to note that it was released on September 16, which means that the official store offered the flawed application at in the last 3 three days.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 messaging app, Signal)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption-security", "topic_name": "encryption security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/messaging-app", "topic_name": "messaging app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/signal", "topic_name": "Signal"}]}, {"news_name": "A backdoor on Xiaomi device allows silent and remote deliver of any app", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51296/mobile-2/xiaomi-backdoor.html", "title": "A backdoor on Xiaomi device allows silent and remote deliver of any app\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 15, 2016", "body": "In March 2015, the security firm Bluebox discovered pre-installed malware and other security issues with a Xiaomi Mi 4 mobile device.The mobile devices analyzed by the security firm seems to have been tampered with by an unidentified third party.\n\n\n\nIn August 2014, experts at F-Secure security firm analyzing the new Xiaomi RedMi 1S discovered that it was sending out to a server located in China a lot of user\u2019s data.\n\nBack to the present days, the Dutch student noticed a mysterious pre-installed app, dubbed AnalyticsCore.apk, that runs 24\u00d77 in the background and it is impossible to remove.\n\nThe student decided to ask about the presence of the AnalyticsCore app on the company\u2019s support forum without success. At this point, Broenink decided to do a reverse engineering of the code and discovered that found that the app checks for a new update from the Xiaomi server every 24 hours.\n\nThe app sends out mobile device identification data including Model, IMEI, MAC address, Nonce, Package name as well as signature.\n\nIf the app finds on the server more recent apk with the filename \u201cAnalytics.apk,\u201d it will automatically download and install it in the background without user interaction.\n\nHow does the AnalyticsCore.apk chack the authenticity of an update file? What happens if an attacker substitute the app with a trojanized version?\n\n\u201cThe question is then: does it verify the correctness of the APK, and does it make sure that it is in fact an Analytics app? If it does not, that means Xiaomi can install any app on your device it wants, as long as it\u2019s named Analytics.apk.\u201d Broenink wrote in a blog post.\n\nBroenink discovered that the update process implemented by Xiaomi lack of validation, this means that hackers can exploit it to deliver a malicious software on the smartphone.\n\nThis also means that the Xiaomi firm can silently install any application on its devices by renaming it to \u201cAnalytics.apk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it looks like Xiaomi can replace any (signed?) package they want silently on your device within 24 hours. And I\u2019m not sure when this App Installer gets called, but I wonder if it\u2019s possible to place your own Analytics.apk inside the correct dir, and wait for it to get installed,\u201d Broenink said.\n\nThe student hasn\u2019t discovered the real purpose of the AnalyticsCore app, it sounds like a sort of backdoor that opens million Xiaomi devices to cyber attack.\n\nSuch kind of mechanism could be exploited by intelligence agencies to deliver surveillance software onto millions of Xiaomi devices.\n\n\u201cThis sounds like a vulnerability to me anyhow, since they have your IMEI and Device Model, they can install any APK for your device specifically,\u201d Broenink added.\n\nReading the discussion thread on the company forum, it is possible to verify that several users expressed their concerns about the presence of the mysterious app.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know what purpose does it serve. Even after deleting the file it reappears after some time,\u201d wrote one of the users of the forum.\n\nWaiting for a reply from Xiaomi, users can block all connections to Xiaomi related domains using a firewall app.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Xiaomi, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/xiaomi", "topic_name": "Xiaomi"}]}, {"news_name": "CVE-2016-3862 flaw \u2013 Silently hack millions Androids devices with a photo", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51043/mobile-2/android-cve-2016-3862-flaw.html", "title": "CVE-2016-3862 flaw \u2013 Silently hack millions Androids devices with a photo\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 7, 2016", "body": "Are you an Android user? I have a bad news for you, an apparently harmless image on social media or messaging app could compromise your mobile device.\nThe last security updates issued by Google have fixed the Quadrooter vulnerabilities, that were threatening more than 900 Million devices, and a critical zero-day that could let attackers deliver their hack hidden inside an image.\n\nThe flaw, coded as CVE-2016-3862, is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Mediaserver. It affects the way images used by certain Android applications parsed the Exif data included in the images.\n\n\u201cExchangeable image file format (officially Exif, according to JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA specifications) is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (includingsmartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. \u201d reads Wikipedia.\n\nThe flaw was first discovered by the security researcher Tim Strazzere from the SentinelOne firm, who explained that it could be exploited by hackers to take complete control of the device without the victim knowing or crash it.\n\n\u201cStrazzere told me that as long as an attacker can get a user to open the image file within an affected app \u2013 such as Gchat and Gmail \u2013 they could either cause a crash or get \u201cremote code execution\u201d; ergo they could effectively place malware on the device and take control of it without the user knowing.\u201d explained Forbes.\n\nThe victim doesn\u2019t need to click on the malicious image, neither on a link, because as soon as it\u2019s data was parsed by the device it would trigger the CVE-2016-3862 vulnerability.\n\n\u201cThe problem was made even more severe as a malicious hacker wouldn\u2019t even need the victim to do anything. \u201cSince the bug is triggered without much user interaction \u2013 an application only needs to load an image a specific way \u2013 triggering the bug is as simple as receiving a message or email from someone. Once that application attempts to parse the image (which was done automatically), the crash is triggered,\u201d Strazzere explained. \n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nJust one photo containing a generic exploit can silently hack millions of Android devices, is a way similar to the Stagefright exploits that allowed the attackers to hack a smartphone with just a simple text message.\n\n\u201cTheoretically, someone could create a generic exploit inside an image to exploits lots of devices. However, due to my skill level, I had to specifically craft each one for the devices. Though once this is done, Gchat, Gmail, most other messengers or social media apps would likely allow this to trigger.\u201d \n\nStrazzere developed the exploits for the affected devices and tested them on Gchat, Gmail and many other messenger and social media apps.\n\nStrazzere did not reveal the names of the other apps that are also affected by the CVE-2016-3862 vulnerability, it also added that the list of vulnerable software includes \u201cprivacy-sensitive\u201d tools. Any mobile app implementing the Android Java object ExifInterface code is likely vulnerable to the vulnerability.\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability is similar to last year\u2019s Stagefright bug (exploit code) that allowed hackers to hijack Android devices with just a simple text message without the owners being aware of it.\n\nGoogle Android version from 4.4.4 to 6.0.1 are affected by the CVE-2016-3862 vulnerability, of course, the devices that installed the last update.\n\nGoogle has already delivered a patch to fix the vulnerability, as usual, this doesn\u2019t mean that your mobile has already applied it because the patch management depends on handset manufacturers and carriers.\n\nSo, if you are not running an updated version of the Android OS, you probably are vulnerable to the image-based attack.\n\nGoogle rewarded  Strazzere $4,000 as part of its Android bug bounty and added another $4,000, as the researcher had pledged to give all $8,000 to Girls Garage, a program of the nonprofit Project H Design for girls aged 9-13.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 CVE-2016-3862 vulnerability, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2016-3862-vulnerability", "topic_name": "CVE-2016-3862 vulnerability"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/exif-data", "topic_name": "Exif data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/quadrooter-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "Quadrooter vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "NSO Group, the surveillance firm that could spy on every smartphone", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/50949/hacking/nso-group-firm.html", "title": "NSO Group, the surveillance firm that could spy on every smartphone\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 5, 2016", "body": "It is quite easy for any Government to spy on mobile users, recently we have discussed the Trident vulnerabilities that were exploited by a surveillance software developed by the NSO Group to deliver the Pegasus malware.\n\nBut it could be very expensive if you decide to use the NSO Group\u2019s software, according to The New York Times spy on 10 iPhones will cost $650,000, plus a $500,000 setup fee.\n\n\u201cTo spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650,000; $650,000 for 10 Android users; $500,000 for five BlackBerry users; or $300,000 for five Symbian users \u2014 on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal.\u201d reported The New York Times. \u201cYou can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800,000, 50 extra targets cost $500,000, 20 extra will cost $250,000 and 10 extra costs $150,000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter.\u201d\n\nThere are several companies that develop surveillance platforms for targeting mobile devices, the NSO Group operated in the dark for several years, until the researchers from the Citizenlab organization and the Lookout firm spotted its software in targeted attacks against UAE human rights defender, Ahmed Mansoor.\n\nThe researchers also spotted other attacks against a Mexican journalist who reported to the public a story of the corruption in the Mexican government.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and multimillion-dollar contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013.\u201d added The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur intelligence systems are subject to Mexico\u2019s relevant legislation and have legal authorization,\u201d Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThey are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times has conducted further investigations on the NSO Group, the company that specializes its offer in surveillance applications for governments and law enforcement agencies around the world.\n\nPeople familiar with the NSO Group confirmed that the company has an internal ethics committee that monitors the sales and potential customers verifying that the software will not be abused to violate human rights.\n\nOfficially the sale of surveillance software is limited to authorized governments to support investigation of agencies on criminal organization and terrorist groups.\n\nUnfortunately, its software is known to have been abused to spy on journalists and human rights activists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no check on this,\u201d said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cOnce NSO\u2019s systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they\u2019re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place.\u201d\n\nCompanies like the NSO Group operate in the dark, in a sort of \u201clegal gray area,\u201d despite the Israeli government exercises strict control of the export of such kind of software, surveillance applications could be abused by threat actors and authoritarian regimes worldwide.\n\nThe principal product of the NSO Group is a surveillance software called Pegasus, it allows to spy on the most common mobile devices, including iPhones, Androids,

with commercial spyware.\nResearchers say it\u2019s belonging to an exploit infrastructure connected to the NSO group.\n\nImage from lookout.com\n\nThanks to the great work made by the researchers from the Citizenlab organization and the Lookout firm that responsibly disclosed the exploits and their related vulnerabilities to Apple.\nGiven the severity of the Trident, Apple worked extremely quickly to patch these vulnerabilities and it has released iOS 9.3.5 to address them.\n\nIn this post, we want to give you a description and some technical information about the inner logic of the Trident exploit instead of the attack received by Ahmed Mansoor.\nWith the episode of Ahmed Mansoor we can quickly understand the infection vector of that exploit: SMS, email, social media, or any other message.\n\nThe most scaring part of that attack is that the single action the user have to do to trigger this dangerous attack is just a click on an external link.\nThe exploit seems to contain the logic to remote jailbreak an iPhone to install arbitrary applications and then deliver a commercial spyware called Pegasus as an espionage software to track the victim.\n\nWhat is Pegasus and who is behind it?\n\nPegasus  is a spy software installable on iOS devices that allow reading messages, emails, passwords and address lists as well as eavesdropping on phone calls, making and transmitting audio recordings and tracking the location on a compromised device (but we will look better in the following section).\nIt seems that this spyware is attributed to NSO Group, an Israeli firm based in Herzliya in the country\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d.\n\nThis spyware was attributed to the NSO Group because in the Mansoor\u2019s attack the domain used for the phishing message (webdav.co) belongs to a network of domains that is a part of an exploit infrastructure provided by the company NSO Group.\n\nNSO Group, now owned by US private equity firm Francisco Partners Management, has flown far under the radar, without even a website.\n\nThe Citizenlab reported that just opening the link included in the message sent to the victims with an iPhone version 9.3.3 it is possible to observe an active unknown software that was remotely implanted into the system through the delivery of unknown exploits from that link.\nThe complex exploit takes the name as Trident.\n\nATTACK SCENARIO\nAfter the user get baited the exploit start his work to infect the phone, following the 3 main stages of that attack, better detailed here:\n\nThis stage comes down over the initial URL in the form of an HTML file that exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2016-4655) in WebKit (used in Safari and other browsers).\nCVE-2016-4655: Memory Corruption in Safari WebKit\nA memory corruption vulnerability exists in Safari WebKit that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Pegasus exploits this vulnerability to obtain initial code execution privileges within the context of the Safari web browser.\n\nThis stage is downloaded from the first stage code based on the device type (32-bit vs 64- bit). Stage 2 is downloaded as an obfuscated and encrypted package. Each package is encrypted with unique keys at each download, making traditional network-based controls ineffective. It contains the code that is needed to exploit the iOS Kernel (CVE-2016-4656 and CVE-2016-4657) and a loader that downloads and decrypts a package for stage 3.\n\nCVE-2016-4656: Kernel Information Leak Circumvents KASLR\nBefore Pegasus can execute its jailbreak, it must determine where the kernel is located in memory. Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) makes this task difficult by mapping the kernel into different and unpredictable locations in memory. In short, before attacking the kernel, Pegasus has to find it. The attacker has found a way to locate the kernel by using a function call that leaks a non-obfuscated kernel memory address in the return value, allowing the kernel\u2019s actual memory location to be mapped.\nCVE-2016-4657: Memory Corruption in Kernel leads to Jailbreak\nThe third vulnerability in Pegasus\u2019 Trident is the one that is used to jailbreak the phone. A memory corruption vulnerability in the kernel is used to corrupt memory in both the 32- and 64-bit versions. The exploits are performed differently on each version.\n\nJailbreak Persistence\n\nOnce the kernel has been exploited, both exploits perform similar tasks to prepare the system to be jailbroken:\n\u2022 Disable kernel security protections including code signing\n\u2022 Remount the system partition\n\u2022 Clear the Safari caches (to help cover their tracks)\n\u2022 Write the jailbreak files (including the main loader as /sbin/mount_nfs)\nAs a final step of stage 2, the exploit removes /etc/nfs.conf which triggers the file to load /sbin/mount_nfs (which is the stage 3 jailbreakloader). Because /sbin/mount_nfs is run as root, the code is run with full privileges. After stage 3 will be unpacked, Pegasus need to gain persistence on device reboot. So exploit replaces the system daemon rtbuddyd with a copy of the jsc binary and creates a link to a script that is similar to the exploit for CVE-2016-4655 .\n\n \n\nTHE ESPIONAGE SOFTWARE\n\n\u201cPegasus is one of the most sophisticated pieces of surveillance and espionage software\u201d stated Lookout company. It has a novel mechanism to install and hide itself and obtain persistence on the system. Once it is resident, it uses a number of ways to hide its communications and protect itself from discovery, and it hooks into a large number of the phone\u2019s functions in order to gather data and intercept messages and calls.\n\nFollowing we will list all the features Pegasus have to spy on the victim a fully detailed list with references of source code):\n\nFollowing an image of an infected phone by Pegasus compared to a normal one:\n\n\nImage from lookup.com\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNSO Group reportedly has hundreds of employees and makes millions of dollars in annual revenue, effectively as a cyber arms dealer, from the sale of its sophisticated mobile attack software.\n\nWe strongly recommend to all iPhone owners to update to the latest version of iOS (9.3.5) immediately.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n\n\nWritten by the IT Security Expert Antonio Cocomazzi\n\nAntonio Cocomazzi is an IT Security Expert specialized in the malware analysis field.

Yes, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis is the reason why many security researchers are worried that it will soon be a big problem as many less proficient cybercriminals [*cough *cough script kiddies] will be using it extensively.\n\nAlso, people with ill intents may also install the Trojan manually for spying purposes.\n\nSpyNote does not require root access to a device but it prompt users for a long list of permissions on installation.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet how authors plan to distribute the RAT to the victims, though attacks have not been seen yet, but researchers believe that since the SpyNote builder is available for free customized versions of its APK will soon be distributed via third party websites near you.\n\nBut Android users should be worried as newer versions of our loveable Android have features like Verify Apps and SafetyNet  which may block such malware packages from getting installed.\n\nMoral of the story, don\u2019t install applications from third-party stores as even Google Play sometimes is unable to keep malicious applications at bay itself.\n\nAbout the Author: Joshua Bahirvani\n\nCyber Security Enthusiast and believer of Privacy in this Digital Age.\n\nLinkedIn : https://in.linkedin.com/in/jbahirvani15\n\nPeerlyst: https://www.peerlyst.com/users/joshua-bahirvani\n\nTwitter : @B15joshua\n\nMedium : @jbahirvani15\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android RAT, SpyNote)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Snowden and Bunnies devised the Introspection Engine to avoid surveillance", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49615/mobile-2/snowden-introspection-engine.html", "title": "Snowden and Bunnies devised the Introspection Engine to avoid surveillance\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 22, 2016", "body": "While the number of mobile devices is outclassing the number of desktop ones, the concern about the surveillance activities conducted by governments is growing as never before also thanks the Snowden revelations.\n\nMobile devices, often unprotected, manage a trove of data on the end users and are a powerful tool through which spy on us.\n\nNews of the day is that the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has designed an anti-surveillance device, called Introspection Engine, for iPhone devices with the support of the popular hacker Andrew \u201cBunnie\u201d Huang.\n\nThe Introspection Engine, that is now planned for iPhone 6 models, would monitor radio components inside the smartphone to alert the user in case they are exploited to exfiltrate data when a user has put the device into airplane mode. The hardware is designed to be independent of a specific smartphone.\n\nIn the post published by the duo are described the risks related to the user even when the mobile device is in plane mode.\n\n\u201cTurning off radios by entering airplane mode is no defense; for example, on iPhones since iOS 8.2, GPS is active in airplane mode. Furthermore, airplane mode is a \u201csoft switch\u201d\u2013the graphics on the screen have no essential correlation with the hardware state.\u201d states the blog post. \u201cMalware packages, peddled by hackers at a price accessible by private individuals, can activate radios without any indication from the user interface; trusting a phone that has been hacked to go into airplane mode is like trusting a drunk person to judge if they are sober enough to drive.This work aims to give journalists the tools to know when their smart phones are tracking or disclosing their location when the devices are supposed to be in airplane mode.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe Introspection Engine is a mini-computer composed of open source modules, giving a look the images posted by Snowden and Bunnie, it is equipped with its own battery and a screen allows the user to see real-time the status of the mobile device.\n\nThe device will warn when a malicious code or technical glitch is causing the leakage of information like the user\u2019s location. The Introspection Engine monitors the status of the radios for cellular, Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi functions.\n\nThe experts started the design of the Introspection Engine by the analysis of the repair manuals of the iPhone that includes blueprints for the phone\u2019s layout.\n\nThe duo downplayed the risk of an attack based on the NFC due to the difficulty of the attack and the way to prevent it by separating the antenna from the main logic board.\n\n\u201cFor NFC, we decided that the risk/reward of selectively enabling and monitoring Apple Pay is not worth it. In other words, we do not expect journalists operating in conflict zones to be relying on Apple Pay to get their work done. Therefore, to simplify the effort, we opt to fully disable Apple Pay by disconnecting the RF front end from its antenna.\u201d added the duo.\u201dFortunately, the NFC\u2019s antenna is connected to the main logic board via a single screw. By removing this screw and separating the antenna from the main logic board, we hope to substantially and selectively reduce the sensitivity of the NFC radio. Further testing is required to determine if this is sufficient to guard against attacks by adversaries using high-power amplifiers to query the Apple Pay NFC feature.\u201d\n\nThe design was presented at the MIT Media Lab\u2019s Forbidden Research event. Let\u2019s hope the support by the Freedom of the Press Foundation will allow a large-scale production of the  Introspection Engine as soon as possible.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Introspection Engine, Snowden)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/introspection-engine", "topic_name": "Introspection Engine"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/snowden", "topic_name": "Snowden"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "3D printing of a dead man\u2019s fingers allows unlocking his phone", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49599/hacking/3d-printing-fingers.html", "title": "3D printing of a dead man\u2019s fingers allows unlocking his phone\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 22, 2016", "body": "Do you remember the battle Apple vs FBI conducted to force the IT giant on unlocking the San Bernardino Shooter\u2019s iPhone, well it has become a story of the past.\n\nThe Police in Michigan is evaluating the possibility to reproduce a dead man\u2019s fingerprint from a prerecorded scan. with 3D printing and use it to unlock any mobile device.\n\nAccording to Rose Eveleth, the Police asked a 3D printing lab at the University of Michigan to recreate a dead man\u2019s fingers to unlock his phone.\n\nIn this specific case, the man was killed and investigators believed that his mobile device contains useful information to solve the case.\n\n\n\nContrary to what you think, it isn\u2019t so easy to reproduce such kind of  fingers because modern biometric sensors rely on electrical currents that most 3D-printed objects are not able to conduct.\n\nFor this reason, the federal authorities requested the help of the professor Anil Jain at the University of Michigan. The professor \u201ccoated the 3D printed fingers in a thin layer of metallic particles\u201d in order to overwhelm the limitation related to the electric conduction of that most 3D-printed objects.\n\n\u201cThe police already have a scan of the victim\u2019s fingerprints taken while he was alive (apparently he had been arrested previously). They gave those scans to the lab, and using them Arora has created 3D printed replicas of all ten digits.\u201d stated the report published by Eveleth. \u201cA 3D printed finger alone often can\u2019t unlock a phone these days. Most fingerprint readers used on phones are capacitive, which means they rely on the closing of tiny electrical circuits to work. The ridges of your fingers cause some of these circuits to come in contact with each other, generating an image of the fingerprint. Skin is conductive enough to close these circuits, but the normal 3D printing plastic isn\u2019t, so Arora coated the 3D printed fingers in a thin layer of metallic particles so that the fingerprint scanner can read them.\u201d\n\nArora and his team haven\u2019t yet tested the fingers on the mobile device of the dead man, but the professor is confident that in a few weeks he will be able to unlock the device .\n\nOn the other hand, this technique potentially represents a threat to the users\u2019 privacy, there is the concrete risk that someone could abuse it, for example by stealing a fingerprint using a high-resolution photo and recreating it with a 3D-printing process.\n\nAt the time I was writing the investigation is still ongoing and there are no details on the research.\n\nIf the experiment will be successful, the unique defense for the users will be to disable the biometric sensor on the mobile smartphone. Fortunately many modern smartphones require a passcode if the owner hasn\u2019t used the fingerprint unlock in over 48 hours.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 3D printing, fingers)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/3d-printing", "topic_name": "3D printing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/biometrics", "topic_name": "biometrics"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fingers", "topic_name": "fingers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-device", "topic_name": "mobile device"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/passcode", "topic_name": "Passcode"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}]}, {"news_name": "Android.Fakebank.B inhibits outgoing calls to bank customer services", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49443/malware/fakebank-android-malware.html", "title": "Android.Fakebank.B inhibits outgoing calls to bank customer services\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 18, 2016", "body": "Security experts from Symantec have spotted a new strain of mobile Trojan dubbed Android.Fakebank.B that prevents users from making outgoing calls to banks from their mobile devices.\n\nAndroid.Fakebank.B was first spotted in October 2013, it was able to intercept incoming calls to intercept SMS used by the banks for two-factor authentication.\n\nEarlier 2014, experts from Symantec discovered a variant of the Trojan.Droidpak that was used to install the Android.Fakebank.B banking trojan on mobile devices.\n\nThe variant of Android.Fakebank.B used in those attacks was already implementing common features of mobile banking threats, including SMS interception and \u201cMITM capabilities\u201d.\n\nIn March 2016, the Android.Fakebank.B was observed targeting mainly customers of Russian and South Korean banks.\n\nThe analysis of the latest variant of the Fakebank.B Android Trojan revealed that the threat would register a BroadcastReceiver component that is used to monitor outgoing calls in order to block certain calls to customer service call centers of the target banks.\n\nThe Android.Fakebank.B also cancels every evidence of the call he has intercepted.\n\n\u201cOnce installed, the new Android.Fakebank.B variants register a BroadcastReceiver component that gets triggered every time the user tries to make an outgoing call.

It affects versions prior to MIUI Global Stable 7.2 which leverages on Android 6.0, it is important to clarify that Xiaomi has already fixed it.\n\nThe MIUI is \u201cthe flavor of Android\u201d developed by Xiaomi primary for its use, but MIUI builds are freely available for other vendors.\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker with privileged network access that shares the same network (i.e. A Wi-Fi connection in a public place), to remotely install a malware on the affected devices.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability we discovered allows for a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to execute arbitrary code as the highly privileged Android system user. It has been remediated by Xiaomi from MIUI Global Stable version 7.2, and IBM strongly recommended that users update their firmware as soon as possible to ensure they are not vulnerable.\u201d reported a blog post published on IBM X-Force.\n\nThe experts from IBM noticed the presence of various applications in the analytics package of the MIUI that are vulnerable to RCE. The attacker can exploit an MITM attack to inject a JSON response that was specially crafted to force a malicious update that is executed at a system level. Basically, the attacker replaces the link and MD5 hash to of the legitimate Android app with a malicious one.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability resides in the analytics package, which is present in various applications that come with MIUI.

We evaluate these attacks under two different threat models.\u201d states the introduction of the project. \u201cIn the black-box model, an attacker uses the speech recognition system as an opaque oracle. We show that the adversary can produce difficult to understand commands that are effective against existing systems in the black-box model. Under the white-box model, the attacker has full knowledge of the internals of the speech recognition system and uses it to create attack commands that we demonstrate through user testing are not understandable by humans.

The second stage initiates a connection to a Command and Control (C2) Server and downloads additional malicious content, some containing dropper capabilities and others for rooting.\n\nCompromised devices are then manipulated to display some of the organisation\u2019s 20 million ads, which attract a combined total of around 2.5 million clicks.\n\nThe company has been accused in the past of producing mobile malware for both iOS and Android devices.\n\nThey are attributed with creating what was recognised as the first iOS malware, Yispecter, a malicious suite which affected unpatched iPhones, both jailbroken and non-jailbroken, with the ability to hijack most of the phones operation including replacing existing apps with malicious versions, mining the user\u2019s personal data as well as reconfiguring browser settings in Safari.\n\nAccess to Yingmob\u2019s control panel reveals that of the company\u2019s 200 applications around 50 of these are deemed as malicious.\n\nCheckPoint have reported the spread of this current infection to include some 1.6 million Chinese devices, 1.4 million in India and over 285,000 in the US.

KeyMaster is also a QSEE app.\n\nThe KeyMaster also runs in the QSEE environment.\n\nBeniamini demonstrated that an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in the kernel of the mobile device to load its version of QSEE app inside this secure environment, then by exploiting privilege escalation flaw it could compromise the QSEE environment and all the apps running in it, including the keys generated for the Android full-disk encryption.\n\nOnce accessed the key, the attacker could run a brute-force attack to access user password, PIN or lock, cracking Android\u2019s full disk encryption.\n\nThe expert reported the following implications of this finding:\n\nBeniamini is working with both Qualcomm and Google to solve the issue, but the problem might require significant hardware modification to be solved.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to the Beniamini analysis, it very interesting.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android full-disk encryption (FDE), Mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-full-disk-encryption", "topic_name": "Android full-disk encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fde", "topic_name": "FDE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Hummer Android malware already infected millions of devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48901/mobile-2/hummer-android-malware.html", "title": "Hummer Android malware already infected millions of devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 1, 2016", "body": "Security experts from the Cheetah Mobile firm are monitoring an Android malware dubbed Hummer since August 2014.

The authorities are still searching for three suspects in connection with the shooting.\n\nLocation services could very useful to find lost devices, but do not do anything silly if someone who found it does not want to return it.\n\n\n\nThe Police warn against tracking stolen and lost devices, urging people to avoid confronting thieves themselves.\n\n\u201cThe end result of this whole scenario is definitely tragic. It\u2019s very unfortunate, we never suggest anyone grabbing onto a moving vehicle, as that in-and-of-itself is very dangerous, but if there\u2019s any concern whether it be of criminal nature, such as a stolen item or any concern for your safety we certainly encourage people to contact police,\u201d said Const.

At this point, when asked for a phone number or email address belonging to the target account, the hacker needs to provide the legitimate phone number.\n\nAt this point, the attacker can exploit the flaw in the SS7 to hijack the SMS containing a one-time passcode (OTP) that is used to log in the target\u2019s Facebook account.\n\nGive a look to the Proof-of-concept video published by the researchers:\n\n\n\nHacking Facebook accounts is possible only if users have registered a phone number and have authorized Facebook Texts.\n\nTo protect your facebook account do not link your phone number to social media sites, instead use emails for the recovery process. Always enable two-factor authentication that uses email instead SMS texts for receiving passcodes.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SS7, Hacking Facebook Accounts)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking-facebook", "topic_name": "Hacking Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sms", "topic_name": "SMS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ss7", "topic_name": "SS7"}]}, {"news_name": "Charging Mobile Devices could be very risky according to Kaspersky", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48044/hacking/charging-mobile-devices-risks.html", "title": "Charging Mobile Devices could be very risky according to Kaspersky\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 6, 2016", "body": "A simple operation like charging mobile Smartphone could expose users at serious risks. It is not a novelty, mobile devices could be hacked while owners are charging them by using a standard USB connection hooked up to a computer.\n\nIt is easy to find freely available charging points at public places, such as airports, cafes, and public transport, but often users ignore the risks.\n\nSecurity experts from Kaspersky Lab have demonstrated it in a proof-of-concept experiment conducted to explain the exposure to such kind of attacks.\n\nThe experts analyzed a number of smartphones running various versions of Android and iOS operating systems in order to understand which kind of data it is possible to exfiltrate from such devices while connected to a computer for charging.\n\nThe results of the tests are very interesting, mobile devices share a lot of data to the computer while they are connected, in particular during the \u2018handshake\u2019 phase. The researchers discovered that it is possible to collect a large number of data while charging mobile devices, including:\n\nDN \u2013 Device Name\nDM \u2013 Device Manufacturer\nDT \u2013 Device Type\nSN \u2013 Serial Number\nFW \u2013 Firmware info\nOS \u2013 Operating System info\nFS \u2013 File system info/file list\nECID \u2013 Electronic Chip ID\n\nbelow the table shared by Kaspersky:\n\nIn 2014, during the Black Hat conference, the researcher Andre Pereira demonstrated that it is possible to infect a smartphone by simply plugging it into a fake charging station.\n\nThe researcher used AT commands, commonly used to talk with the modem in mobile devices, to compromise the smartphone.\n\nThe experts from Kaspersky used the same technique to compromise the smartphone by using a PC and a standard micro USB cable. The experts used a set of AT-commands to re-flash a smartphone and silently installs a root application to gain full control of the smartphone.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe researchers noticed that incidents involving bogus charging stations have not been yet reported in the wild, meanwhile security firms have already spotted cyber attacks relying on this attack scenario.\n\nThe technique was used by the Hacking Team for its attacks and also by the Red October APT.\n\nThe experts explained that retrieving information on the specific mobile connected to a PC would allow hackers to choose a specific exploit to compromise the mobile devices.\n\n\u201cIt is strange to see that nearly two years after the publication of a proof-of-concept demonstrating how a smartphone can be infected though the USB, the concept still works. The security risks here are obvious: if you\u2019re a regular user you can be tracked through your device IDs; your phone could be silently packed with anything from adware to ransomware; and, if you\u2019re a decision-maker in a big company, you could easily become the target of professional hackers,\u201d \u2013 explained Alexey Komarov, researcher at Kaspersky Lab. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even have to be highly-skilled in order to perform such attacks, all the information you need can easily be found on the Internet,\u201d he concludes.\n\nIn summary, infect your smartphone while charging may be too simple, for this reason, follow the advises provided by Kaspersky.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Charging Mobile Devices, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/at-commands", "topic_name": "AT commands"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/charging", "topic_name": "charging"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-device", "topic_name": "mobile device"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/modem", "topic_name": "modem"}]}, {"news_name": "Unlimited surveillance capabilities, but it\u2019s going to cost you", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/47974/mobile-2/surveillance-unlimited-spying.html", "title": "Unlimited surveillance capabilities, but it\u2019s going to cost you\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 3, 2016", "body": "Israeli-based company Ability is planning a big marketing push aimed at law enforcement in the United States.  Ability Unlimited Interception System (ULIN) promises unlimited surveillance capabilities of revealing the location, calls, and texts of any cell phone on the planet.  The price tag, US$20 million, but with the necessity of responding to the more and more criminal activity being facilitated over mobile networks, the price could be well worth it to keep citizens safe.\n\n\u201cLaunched in November last year, it can cost as much as $20 million, depending on how many targets the customer wants to surveil.\u201d reported Forbes. \u201cAll a ULIN customer requires is the target\u2019s phone number or the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity), the unique identifier for an individual mobile device. Got those? Then boom \u2013 you can spy on a target\u2019s location, calls and texts.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbility was founded in 1993 by experts with military intelligence and communications backgrounds.  Specializing in off-air interception of cellular and even satellite communications, Ability\u2019s ULIN technology is a leap forward in espionage capabilities. ULIN\u2019s strength is its ability to capture GSM, MTS, and LTE phone traffic without the need of having to be within close proximity of the device, or with the consent of the mobile carrier, which the phone may belong too.\n\nAt the core of ULIN, is its ability to exploit a vulnerability in Signaling System No. 7 (SS7), an international telecommunications standard that defines how public switched telephone networks (PSTN) exchange information over digital networks for mobile phones.  The SS7 nodes are called \u201csignaling points\u201d that use out-of-band signaling providing network efficiency and other services such as call forwarding.\n\nAbility licenses this vulnerability from an unknown third party and claims to solely granted access to, or knowledge of, the SS7 vulnerability. All that is required by law enforcement to tap into a phone is the mobile phone number of the target.\n\nHacking of SS7 is nothing new.  In 2015, the FCC launched a probe into the problem after \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired a report showing German computer scientist Karsten Nohl tapping into U.S. Representative Ted Lieu\u2019s mobile phone.  In a counter argument, John Marinho, vice president of the mobile industry group CTIA, claimed Nohl was giving \u201cextraordinary access\u201d for his demonstration for 60 minutes.  Ability\u2019s UNIL system appears to overcome that challenge, exploiting the bridge between end-of-life technology SS7, and fully digital networks.\n\nIt is likely that civil liberties groups will take exception to Ability\u2019s push into\n\n\u201cThis system means that law enforcement will have the ability to conduct wiretaps and location tracking without anybody scrutinizing what they\u2019re doing, and nobody may have the opportunity to push back and demand appropriate legal process.\u201d \n\nAdditionally, it has yet to be determined how ULIN runs afoul of U.S. laws on wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping \u2013 a federal crime that carries stiff penalties in fines and even imprisonment.\n\nIn the end, the opportunities for U.S. law enforcement may be too great an offer to refuse.  Even at a $20 million price tag, the capability of conducting criminal investigations bypassing the need of the consent of mobile carriers may reduce time and cost significantly enough to justify the expenditure.  The reality is, domestic surveillance is likely here to stay. The efficiency at which information flows between the federal government down to the hands of municipal law enforcement has been questionable in recent years, including the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, which the real-time sharing of information prior to the bombing was called into question.\n\nThe argument will ultimately boil down to safety versus privacy.  Which side Ability and its ULIN technology lands is yet to be seen.\n\n\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

The model  will let users grant permissions only when it is required by the app, rather be accepting all on installation. Threats such as Android.Bankosy and Android.Cepsohord has already adopted this method in order to gain the permissions required by them to carry out malicious activities.\n\nPrompting for permissions at runtime\n\nIn Mobile phones running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, apps request permissions that could pose a privacy risk at runtime, as and when they\u2019re are required, instead of prompting the user for all of them at installation time.\n\nIf the app malware author forcefully sets the \u201ctarget_sdk\u201d attribute of an app to 22 in place of 23 to avoid requesting permissions at runtime, a user then can grant all requested permission at the time of app\u2019s installation, but the users can also manually revoke permissions from any app, irrespective of the \u201ctarget_sdk\u201d values on devices running Marshmallow.\n\nSince Marshmallow\u2019s market share is increasing and users are now learning to manually revoke permission. Authors of malware families such as Android.Bankosy and Android.Cepsohord has now started porting their code to handle the current Android runtime permission model.\n\nHandling of Marshmallow\u2019s new permission model by Bankosy and Cepsohord Malware.\n\nAndroid.Bankosy is a well known Financial Trojan which partially works with the new model by checking whether a permission\n\nis in a non-revoked state before execution of the malicious code. On the other hand, the Bankosy malware calls a special service\n\ncode (*21*[DESTINATION NUMBER]#) in order to enable unconditional call forwarding on the compromised device. This feature is needed by the attacker to help it conduct fraudulent transactions using the target\u2019s information,\n\nBy using Marshmallow\u2019s checkSelfPermission API the Bankosy\u2019s authors updated the malware code to check whether the permission to call this number has been granted or not.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Click-fraud malware Cepsohord takes a step ahead and fully handles the new permission model. It not only checks the permission\u2019s authorization state but also prompts the user to authorize the permission in case it is in a revoked state.\n\n\n\nFuture of Android Malware.\n\nPreviously seen android Threats has the capability to update themselves so that they can survive new security measure on Google\u2019s mobile operation system.

This kind of apps has limited abilities compared to apps that pass the Apple\u2019s application review, for example they are not allowed to access Apple Pay, application domains, iCloud, in-app purchase features, the passbook/wallet, and they cannot use push notifications.\n\nUnfortunately, it is important to highlight that the operations allowed to mobile apps developed with the above process are the same conducted by mobile malware. For example, these apps can access users\u2019 data, access the address book, access the calendar and track users through their GPS positions.\n\nThe researcher Tamir released a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool called \u201cSu-A-Cyder\u201d that can be exploited by attackers to replace a legitimate app installed on an iOS device with a malicious version that the tool creates.\n\nTamir described the Su-A-Cyder as a new threat vector that can create a malicious version of legitimate apps just by connecting the victim\u2019s device to a computer.\n\n\u201cSu-A-Cyder can be described as a recipe that takes one part malicious code (choose your flavor), one part legitimate app (choose your victim), one part Apple ID (anonymous), and mix together to create a new evil client app that easily installs on a non-jailbroken device.\u201d explained Tamir. \u201cSu-A-Cyder is not malware and it is not a vulnerability; it\u2019s a threat vector! It is a compilation of open source technologies (e.g. Theos and Fastlane) scripted together to take advantage of Apple\u2019s home brewed certification application program to demonstrate that anonymous evil app creation is not a myth anymore. And any legitimate application can be resigned with an anonymous Apple ID account and side loaded to a device.\u201d\n\nBefore the release of iOS 8.3, it was easy for attackers to replace a legitimate application with a malicious version by simply assigning the malicious app a similar bundle ID and overwriting the original application.\n\nThings changed with security measures implemented with iOS 8.3.\n\nTamir devised the SandJacking attack method that allowed it to bypass security countermeasures implemented starting with the iOS 8.3 and allowed him to rely on the Su-A-Cyder threat vector.\n\n\n\nTamir explained that the effectiveness of the SandJacking methods relies on the lack of control on the restore process. An attacker creates a backup, remove the legitimate app, install the rogue version, and then restore the backup, in this scenario the malicious app will not be removed and attacker can obtain the access only to the sandbox of the app it replaces.\n\nTamir presented the SandJacking attack at the Hack In The Box (HITB), during his presentation he targeted the Skype app.  Tamir announced that will release a SandJacker tool that automates the SandJacking attack after Apple will fix the issue.\n\nThe only way to spot the attack is to check the app\u2019s certificate and the device\u2019s provisioning settings to verify the developer\u2019s identity.\n\nDespite the flaw was reported to Apple in January, the company still hasn\u2019t issued a patch.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

Wait, but WhatsApp implements end-to-end encryption.

The information passed from a network to another are needed for routing calls and text messages between several networks.\n\nThe SS7 performs out-of-band signaling in support of the call establishment, billing, routing, and information exchange functions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n\nExperts from Positive Technologies discovered that hackers can exploit a flaw in the SS7 protocol to steal the victim\u2019s identity on the messaging services with just basic skills.\n\nThe principal instant messaging services, including WhatsApp and Telegram, rely on the SMS authentication as the primary security verification mechanism, which is routed through SS7 signalling. This means that hackers exploit the SS7 to compromise the verification mechanism and take over the victim\u2019s account and impersonate him.\n\nAs explained by the experts, the most worrisome aspect of the story is that hacker does not need high-skills or a sophisticated equipment for such attack.\n\n\n\nThe hackers from the Positive Technologies used a common Linux distro and a publicly available SDK for their tests.\n\n\u201cAn intruder doesn\u2019t need sophisticated equipment. Positive Technologies used a popular Linux based computer and a publicly available SDK for generating SS7 packets. + After performing an initial attack using SS7 commands, the intruder is able to execute additional attacks using the same methods.\u201d states the paper from Positive Technologies. \u201cFor instance, if an intruder manages to determine a subscriber\u2019s location, only one further step is required to intercept SMS messages, commit fraud, etc. + Attacks are based on legitimate SS7 messages. Therefore, you cannot simply filter messages as it may have a negative impact on the overall quality of service\u201d\n\nAttacks relying on SS7 vulnerabilities could have serious consequences, many threat actors could exploit flaws in the signalling protocol to determining subscriber location, tapping calls, intercepting SMS, disrupt communication services \u2026 and takeover instant messaging accounts.\n\n\u201cIf telecom and network operators protect their core telecom networks, it will improve the security of customers, but that\u2019s not going to happen over night. Service providers such as WhatsApp need to consider introducing additional mechanisms to verify the identity of users to stay secure,\u201d said Alex Mathews, technical manager EMEA of Positive Technologies.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SS7, instant messaging Hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/instant-messaging-hacking", "topic_name": "instant messaging Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ss7", "topic_name": "SS7"}]}, {"news_name": "Three-quarters of Android devices affected by the Qualcomm software flaw", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/47022/mobile-2/qualcomm-software-flaw.html", "title": "Three-quarters of Android devices affected by the Qualcomm software flaw\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 6, 2016", "body": "Security researchers from the Mandiant firm have discovered a \u201chigh severity\u201d vulnerability in the Qualcomm tethering controller (CVE-2016-2060) that could be exploited by a malicious application to access user information.\n\nRecently Google released an Android update that addresses tens of vulnerabilities, including the Qualcomm one.\n\nFireEye reported the issue to Qualcomm in January and the vendor issued a fix by early March and sent the update to various device manufacturers that will have to distribute the patch to the end-users.\n\nThe flaw affects the Android network daemon \u2018netd\u2019 and was introduced by Qualcomm when it provided new APIs for the \u2018network_manager\u2019 system service.\n\n\u201cCVE-2016-2060 is a lack of input sanitization of the \u201cinterface\u201d parameter of the \u201cnetd\u201d daemon, a daemon that is part of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). \u201d states FireEye in a blog post. \u201cThe vulnerability was introduced when Qualcomm provided new APIs as part of the \u201cnetwork_manager\u201d system service, and subsequently the \u201cnetd\u201d daemon, that allow additional tethering capabilities, possibly among other things. Qualcomm had modified the \u201cnetd\u201d daemon.\u201d\n\nThe issue in the Qualcomm software affects devices running Android 5.0 Lollipop and earlier, a significant impact if we consider that more or less 73 percent of Android devices are affected by the vulnerability.  Fortunately, the vulnerability has limited impact on mobile devices running Android 4.4 and later due to significant security enhancements.\n\n\n\nThe experts also highlighted that the Qualcomm software is used in several projects, including the popular CyanogenMod. The flaw can be exploited by attackers to escalate privileges to the built-in \u201cradio\u201d user, its permissions higher than the ones normally assigned to third-party apps.\n\nAn attacker can use a malicious application that is granted the \u201cACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\u201d permission that is so allowed to invoke the vulnerable API.\n\n\u201cThe most feasible way of exploiting CVE-2016-2060 is by creating a malicious application. A malicious application needs only to request access to the \u201cACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\u201d permission, a widely requested permission. Figure 16 shows how the \u201caddUpstreamV6Interface(..)\u201d method can be used to inject the command \u2018id\u2019.\u201d continues the post.\n\n\n\nWhat could an attacker do if they successfully exploit this vulnerability?\n\nOn vulnerable older devices, the attackers can use a malicious application to extract the SMS database and phone call database, access the Internet, and perform any operation allowed by the \u201cradio\u201d user.\n\nOn vulnerable new devices, the attackers have fewer options to violate the device, for example, they can modify additional system properties. In both cases, the victims have no indication of the ongoing attack.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that once the vulnerability is exploited, there is no indication to the user that something has happened. For example, there is no performance impact or risk of crashing the device.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Qualcomm software flaw, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/qualcomm", "topic_name": "Qualcomm"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/qualcomm-software", "topic_name": "Qualcomm software"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Google fixes 40 Critical and High Severity flaws in Android", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/46969/mobile-2/android-security-vulnerabilities.html", "title": "Google fixes 40 Critical and High Severity flaws in Android\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 4, 2016", "body": "Patches for 40 vulnerabilities have been included in Google\u2019s May 2016 security update for the Android operating system.

The malicious code hijacks mobile advertisements to scam gift cards, it locks the device in a state that allows only victims to make payment.\n\nThe malicious code demands the payment of a $200 fee in iTunes gift cards. The experts at Blue Coat Labs first spotted the threat after a tablet running CyanogenMod 10 / Android 4.2.2 viewed an advertisement that silently served malicious payloads without any user interaction.\n\n\n\nThe Exploit Kit used by crooks in this campaign relies on a previously leaked Hacking Team exploit (lbxslt) to serve the Android exploit known as Towelroot. The tool was released by the popular hacker George Hotz in 2014, it is able to root Android devices exploiting a known Linux flaw (CVE-2014-3153).\n\nThe attack is very sophisticated and represents an evolution of the classic malvertising attack, as explained by Andrew Brandt from Blue Coat.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time, to my knowledge; an exploit kit has been able to successfully install malicious apps on a mobile device without any user interaction on the part of the victim. During the attack, the device did not display the normal \u201capplication permissions\u201d dialog box that typically precedes installation of an Android application.\u201d wrote Brandt. \u201cAfter consulting with analyst Joshua Drake of Zimperium, he was able to confirm that the Javascript used to initiate the attack contains an exploit against libxslt that was leaked during the Hacking Team breach.\u201d\n\nThe operators behind the malware campaign used the Hacking Team exploit in conjunction with the Towelroot tool realizing a very stealth attack that is able to compromise almost every old device that has not been updated with the last release of the Google OS. Be careful, it does not matter if the mobile device is rooted or not to be compromised by the Dogspectus ransomware, bacause the Towelroot allows an attacker to escalate rivileged on the infected devices.\n\n\u201cThe commoditized implementation of the Hacking Team and Towelroot exploits to install malware onto Android mobile devices using an automated exploit kit has some serious consequences. The most important of these is that older devices, which have not been updated (nor are likely to be updated) with the latest version of Android, may remain susceptible to this type of attack in perpetuity.\u201d continues the post.\n\nThe experts determined that at least 224 unique device models running a range of Android versions between 4.0.3 and 4.4.4 (5.x or 6.x are not impacted) contected the command and control servers since February 22.\n\nThe problem is serious if we consider that 59.6 percent of the Android devices are currently running version 4.4 or lower.\n\n\n\nThe samples analyzed by the researchers allow the connection of the infected device to a computer and copy all the files still unlocked from both the internal memory and any additional storage card. The experts also noticed that flashing over the operating system with a newer build of Android doesn\u2019t eliminate the Dogspectus ransomware, meanwhile, a factory reset will eradicate it.\n\nIn order to limit the effects of a ransomware infection, it is important to maintain an updated backup of any important data present on the device.\n\n\u201cAs with other ransomware, the best way to defeat the criminals is to keep a backup of those precious photos, videos, and other data files somewhere other than on your phone or tablet\u2019s internal memory or memory card. That way, you can just perform a factory reset and not worry about losing anything other than the time it takes to reconfigure and reinstall your mobile device\u2019s apps,\u201d concludes Brandt.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dogspectus ransomware, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2014-3153", "topic_name": "CVE-2014-3153"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/geohot", "topic_name": "GeoHot"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/george-hotz", "topic_name": "George Hotz"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking-team", "topic_name": "Hacking Team"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malvertising", "topic_name": "malvertising"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/root", "topic_name": "root"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/towelroot", "topic_name": "Towelroot"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI paid more than $1.3 million to hack into San Bernardino shooter iPhone", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/46571/hacking/fbi-san-bernardino-shooter.html", "title": "FBI paid more than $1.3 million to hack into San Bernardino shooter iPhone\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 22, 2016", "body": "FBI Director Comey explained at the Aspen Security Forum in London that the Agency paid more than $1.3 million to break into San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone\n\nThe FBI vs Apple saga continues to be in the headlines, now media are sharing the news that the Federal Bureau of Investigation paid more than $1.3 million to break into San Bernardino shooter\u2018s iPhone.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey revealed the news on Thursday, the sum paid is very important as confirmed by the Reuters.\n\n\u201cFederal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Thursday the agency paid more to get into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters than he will make in the remaining seven years and four months he has in his job.\u201d states the Reuters.\n\n\u201cAccording to figures from the FBI and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Comey\u2019s annual salary as of January 2015 was $183,300.

An attacker who gains physical access to a (possibly locked) device can thus use this interface to send arbitrary AT commands to the modem. This permits to perform several actions that should be forbidden by the lock mechanism, including placing phone calls or sending SMS messages.\u201d\n\nOlder mobile devices expose the USB serial modem by default, meanwhile, newer phones need to be forced, in this last scenario it is not necessary that the phone is unlocked.\n\nIn the case of old Samsung mobile and firmware versions (i.e. the GT-I9192 (Samsung S4 Mini with build I9192XXUBNB1)), is is sufficient to plug the smartphone into a Linux host to expose a usb serial modem which is then accessible by using the corresponding Linux device (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0). Once established the connection to the modem it is possible to send certain AT commands. The attacker can perform a number of operations exploiting this connection, using the AT command AT+USBDEBUG command he enables USB debugging, and AT+WIFIVALUE enables the device\u2019s Wi-Fi.\n\nThe security duo developed a proof-of-concept to analyze the attack scenario.\n\n\u201cFor our PoC we developed a very rough C tool, usbswitcher, that switches any attached Samsung device to USB configuration #2 (this is fine for the devices we tested, but your mileage might vary). The tool uses libusb to do the job, but the same task can probably be accomplished using the /sys/bus/usb pseudo-filesystem.\n\nThe trick we used to force the phone to switch the configuration is to first reset the USB device (via usb_reset()), and then switching the configuration (via usb_set_configuration()). Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work at the first try, so just run usbswitchertwice to ensure the configuration is switched properly :-)\u201d\n\n\n\nOn newer mobile and firmware versions the situation is more complex as explained by the researchers.\n\n\u201cExploitation of this vulnerability on more recent firmware versions (e.g., latest versions of the Samsung S4 and Samsung S6 software) is not so straightforward: in the default configuration, when the device is connected it exposes to the host only a MTP interface, used for file transfer.\n\nHowever, we discovered that an attacker can still access the modem by switching to secondary USB configuration. As an example, consider our test Galaxy S6 device. When USB debugging is off, the device exposes two USB configurations, with the CDC ACM modem accessible via configuration number 2.\u201d\n\nSamsung lock bypass(vanilla fw,no other apps).Simple trick,no ninja exploit.Not sure if bug or feature /cc @joystick pic.twitter.com/xsQ3NkghVS\n\n\u2014 Roberto Paleari (@rpaleari) 10 dicembre 2015\n\n\n\nThe possible consequences of the attack are obvious, the access to the modem allows the attacker to make phone calls and send SMS messages. The command ATD+123456 allow to starts a phone call to +123456, even when the device is locked.\n\nBelow the list of devices tested by the duo:\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Samsung Galaxy, serial modem)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "The FBI director confirmed the purchase of a tool to hack the shooter\u2019s iPhone, but \u2026", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/46092/laws-and-regulations/fbi-director-iphone-crack.html", "title": "The FBI director confirmed the purchase of a tool to hack the shooter\u2019s iPhone, but \u2026\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 8, 2016", "body": "The FBI has found a way to unlock any Apple iPhone, this is the opinion of the majority of security experts.

They used only new phones that they would then discard, including several activated minutes before the attacks, or phones seized from their victims.\u201d reported The New York Times.\n\nThe NYT cites a 55-page report compiled by the French antiterrorism police for France\u2019s Interior Ministry and explains how the terrorists have used phones activated less than an hour before the attacks.\n\n\u201cEverywhere they went, the attackers left behind their throwaway phones,\u201d states the post. \u201cNew phones linked to the assailants at the stadium and the restaurant also showed calls to Belgium in the hours and minutes before the attacks, suggesting a rear base manned by a web of still unidentified accomplices.\u201d \u201cSecurity camera footage showed Bilal Hadfi, the youngest of the assailants, as he paced outside the stadium, talking on a cellphone. The phone was activated less than an hour before he detonated his vest.\u201d \n\nOutside the Bataclan theater venue, the investigators found a Samsung smartphone in a dustbin with a Belgian SIM card used exclusively for the operation.\n\n\u201cIt had a Belgian SIM card that had been in use only since the day before the attack.

Prepaid phones are very cheap, using different mobile devices and different mobile phone numbers each time it is possible to evade monitoring activities operated by the intelligence agencies.\n\nSoon something can change, at least in the US where lawmakers in California have proposed a new bill that would force retailers to verify and record the identity of the buyers of prepaid burner phones or similar mobile devices, as well as SIM cards.\n\n\n\nAn authorized reseller making a sale to a buyer not in person shall verify the purchaser information provided under section 2 by requiring the purchaser to submit the following information:\n\nThe congresswomen explained that the bill will not eliminate the existence of burner phones, it is a necessary measure to prevent terror plots and many other illegal activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis bill would close one of the most significant gaps in our ability to track and prevent acts of terror, drug trafficking, and modern-day slavery,\u201d Speier said in a Wednesday blog post. The \u2018burner phone\u2019 loophole is [a glaring gap] in our legal framework that allows actors like 9/11 hijackers and the Times Square bomber to evade law enforcement while they plot to take innocent lives.

In this second scenario, the device verifies the legitimate origin of the app with the Apple\u2019s FairPlay DRM technology.\n\nIn 2014, a team of researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology presented at the USENIX conference, a method through which an iOS device could be tricked to install any app, previously acquired by a different Apple ID, through the iTunes.\n\nAt this point the attack scenario is clear, hackers can remotely install apps on iOS device connected to an already compromised PC.\n\nWithout this premise, now researchers at Palo Alto Networks confirmed that hackers in the wild are still using this trick to serve a malicious app named AceDeceiver on non-jailbroken devices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered a new family of iOS malware that successfully infected non-jailbroken devices we\u2019ve named \u201cAceDeceiver\u201d. states a blog post published by Palo Alto Networks.\n\n\u201cWhat makes AceDeceiver different from previous iOS malware is that instead of abusing enterprise certificates as some iOS malware has over the past two years, AceDeceiver manages to install itself without any enterprise certificate at all. It does so by exploiting design flaws in Apple\u2019s DRM mechanism, and even as Apple has removed AceDeceiver from App Store, it may still spread thanks to a novel attack vector.\u201d \n\nThe threat actors first uploaded their apps to the App Store, managing to pass Apple\u2019s review process by submitting them as wallpapers. Once the apps are deployed on the official store they purchased the apps through the iTunes in order to capture the DRM FairPlay authorization code.\n\nThe crooks developed a client software that simulates the iTunes and distributed it in China masquerading it as a helper program for iOS devices that can perform system reinstallation, jailbreaking, system backup, device management, and system cleaning.\n\n\u201cTo carry out the attack, the author created a Windows client called \u201d\u7231\u601d\u52a9\u624b (Aisi Helper)\u201d to perform the FairPlay MITM attack. Aisi Helper purports to be software that provides services for iOS devices such as system re-installation, jailbreaking, system backup, device management and system cleaning.\u201d continues the post.\n\nWhen users connected their iOS devices to a computer running this software, it silently installed AceDeceiver by using the authorization code captured when the app was first deployed on the official store.\n\n\u201cBy deploying authorized computer in the C2 server, and using a client software as agent in the middle, the attacker can distribute that purchased iOS app to unlimited iOS devices.\u201d reads the post.\n\n\n\nWhat happen if Apple removes the AceDeceiver apps from the official store?\n\nNothing, the technique presented by the researchers at USENIX in 2014 works even if the app has been removed from the App Store because attackers already have the authorization code they need to complete the installation.\n\n\u201cEven if an app has been removed from the App Store, attackers can still distribute their own copies to iOS users.\u201d the team of experts explained at the USENIX conference.\n\nThe technique used to serve the AceDeceiver malware is very dangerous, in the future other criminal gangs could start using it.\n\n\u201cOur analysis of AceDeceiver leads us to believe FairPlay MITM attack will become another popular attack vector for non-jailbroken iOS devices \u2013 and thus a threat to Apple device users worldwide.

The spoof fingerprint is generated automatically, below the steps of the method developed by the researchers:\n\n\n\nThe MSU researchers demonstrated that the attack on fingerprint readers works on various Samsung mobile devices, and less well on some Huawei phones.\n\n\u201cIn summary, we have proposed a simple, fast and effective method to generate 2D fingerprint spoofs that can successfully hack built-in fingerprint authentication in mobile phones. Furthermore, hackers can easily generate a large number of spoofs using fingerprint reconstruction [3] or synthesis [4] techniques which is easier than 2.5D fingerprint spoofs.\u201d states the researchers.\n\n\u201cThis experiment further confirms the urgent need for antispoofing techniques for fingerprint recognition systems [5], especially for mobile devices which are being increasingly used for unlocking the phone and for payment. It should be noted that not all the mobile phones can be hacked using proposed method. As the phone manufactures develop better anti-spoofing techniques, the proposed method may not work for the new models of mobile phones. However, it is only a matter of time before hackers develop improved hacking strategies not just for fingerprints, but other biometric traits as well that are being adopted for mobile phones (e.g., face, iris and voice).\u201d\n\nThe duo confirmed that this is a preliminary study, they will go deep into the analysis of fingerprint sensor.\n\nBelow a video PoC of the method developed by the researchers\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 fingerprint sensor, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fingerprint-sensor", "topic_name": "fingerprint sensor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iphone", "topic_name": "iPhone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "Triada Trojan the most sophisticated mobile malware seen to date", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45187/malware/triada-trojan-android-trojan.html", "title": "Triada Trojan the most sophisticated mobile malware seen to date\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 10, 2016", "body": "Malware researchers at Kaspersky Lab have discovered a new strain of malware, dubbed Triada (Backdoor.AndroidOS.Triada), targeting Android devices, which they consider the most advanced mobile threat seen to date.

Android users need to be very careful of installing any mobile apps from untrusted sources.\n\nBelow the description provided by TrendMicro for the CVE-2016-0819 and CVE-2016-0805 flaws discovered by its experts:\n\nCVE-2016-0819\n\nWe discovered this particular vulnerability, which is described as a logic bug when an object within the kernel is freed. A node is deleted twice before it is freed. This causes an information leakage and a Use After Free issue in Android. (UAF issues are well-known for being at the heart of exploits, particularly in Internet Explorer.)\n\nCVE-2016-0805\n\nThis particular vulnerability lies in the function get_krait_evtinfo. (Krait refers to the processor core used by several Snapdragon processors). The function returns an index for an array; however, the validation of the inputs of this function are not sufficient. As a result, when the array krait_functionsis accessed by the functions krait_clearpmu and krait_evt_setup, an out-of-bounds access results. This can be useful as part of a multiple exploit attack.\n\n\n\nThe problem affects the Qualcomm Snapdragon systems on a chip,  more than a billion devices is at risk. The root access to a mobile device allows an attacker to conduct a number of malicious activities, from surveillance to financial frauds.\n\nThe vulnerability could be exploited by simply running a malicious app on snapdragon-powered Android devices. Experts at TrendMicro privately reported the security holes to Google that fixed them.\n\nAs usually happen in these cases, the high fragmentation of the Android market complicates the patch management process. Many users are still vulnerable to the attack waiting for a security patch.\n\n\u201cAs the number of embedded SoCs in devices explode with the IoT growth, we anticipate that these kinds of vulnerabilities will become a bigger problem that will challenge the overall security posture of Internet of Things.\u201d continues the post published by TrendMicro.\n\nGoing into technical details, the flaws could be exploited in every mobile and IoT devices that could allow the invocation of the system call perf_event_open. Fortunately, many vendors can have customized the kernel and SELinux policies in order to avoid the call.\n\nAccording to the Nexus Security Bulletin \u2013 February 2016, the CVE-2016-0805 vulnerability affects versions earlier than 4.4.4 to 6.0.1, this means that Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Samsung Galaxy Note Edge are vulnerable to the attack.\n\n\u201cWe believe that any Snapdragon-powered Android device with a 3.10-version kernel is potentially at risk of this attack. As mentioned earlier, given that many of these devices are either no longer being patched or never received any patches in the first place, they would essentially be left in an insecure state without any patch forthcoming.\u201d conclude TrendMicro.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android devices, Qualcomm Snapdragon)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-devices", "topic_name": "Android devices"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/qualcomm-snapdragon", "topic_name": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}]}, {"news_name": "South Korea accused North Korea of hacking key officials\u2019 mobile", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45139/cyber-warfare-2/north-korea-hacked-south-mobile.html", "title": "South Korea accused North Korea of hacking key officials\u2019 mobile\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 8, 2016", "body": "The South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) revealed that North Korea had hacked into smartphones belonging to a number of key government officials.\n\nThe announcement was made on Tuesday, according to the NIS cyber spies from  North Korea have stolen sensitive data and texts from messages from smartphones used by dozens of key South Korean officials between late February and early March, after the North completed its fourth nuclear test.\n\nThe North Korea has launched numerous cyber attacks against the South The hackers also targeted the server of a major software firm specializing in providing security software for Internet banking and launched a spear-phishing campaign against employees of two provincial railway operators.\n\nThe hackers also used text messages containing links to malicious domains used to serve mobile RAT on the victim\u2019s devices.\n\nSecurity experts believe that North Korean hackers are preparing a new wave of cyber attacks on South\u2019s critical infrastructure, including railway traffic control systems.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea has been mounting a series of attacks against our cyberspace\u201d following its nuclear test on January 6, revealed the NIS, adding that \u201cthey appeared to have been preparation for a major cyber assault on South Korea\u2019s banking network.\u201d \u201cIf left unchecked, it would have resulted in major financial chaos, such as paralysis of Internet banking systems and unwanted transfers of deposits.\u201d\n\nThe North Korea is considered one of the most dangerous forces in the cyber space, In May 2015, the BBC published an article based on the revelations of a North Korean defector, an alleged member of the dreaded elite cyber army established by the Government in Pyongyang.\n\n\n\nNorth Korea holds an impressive army of cyber warriors, with over 6,000 sophisticated professionals. According to the claims of people who have escaped to South Korea, their main target is none other than Western infrastructure of critical value.

The security vulnerability allows local attackers to bypass pass code lock protection of the apple iphone via an application update loop issue. The issue affects the device security when processing to request a local update by an installed mobile ios web-application.\u201d states the technical description published by the vulnerability-lab.com.\n\nThe attacker can bring the  iOS devices into an unlimited loop resulting in a temporarily deactivate of the pass code lock screen.\n\nThe real problem is that they are underestimated by manufacturers because the attack request the physical presence of the attackers which have to be in possession of the device, in the specific case the flaw is still present after it was reported three months ago (2016-01-03: Researcher Notification & Coordination (Benjamin Kunz Mejri \u2013 Evolution Security GmbH))\n\n\u201cThe issue is not fixed after a three-month duration. We have the newest versions of iPad and iPhone and are still able to reproduce it after the updates with default configuration,\u201d Mejri told Threatpost Monday.\n\nThis time Mejri described a number of attack vectors relying on an internal browser link request to skip the passcode screen.\n\nIn a first scenario, an attacker could request Siri to open an app that doesn\u2019t exist, at this point Siri  will open a restricted browser window to the App Store, but from there the attacker could switch back to the home screen, either via the home button, or via Siri.\n\n\n\nIn the second scenario the attacker is using the control panel to gain access to the non restricted clock app. The attacker opens the app via siri or via panel and opens then the timer to the end timer or Radar module. The app allows users to buy more sounds for alerts and implemented a link, but if the attacker pushes the link a restricted app store browser window opens. At that point we are in the same situation of the first attack vector.\n\nIn the third scenario, the attacker opens via panel or by a Siri request the clock app. The internal world clock module includes in the bottom right is a link to the weather channel that redirects users to the store as far as its deactivated. By pushing the link also in this case a restricted appstore browser window opens.\n\n\u201cAt that point it is possible to unauthorized switch back to the internal home screen by interaction with the home button or with siri again. The link to bypass the controls becomes visible in the World Clock (Weather Channel) and is an image as link. Thus special case is limited to the iPad because only in that models use to display the web world map. In the iPhone version the bug does not exist because the map is not displayed because of using a limited template. The vulnerability is exploitable in the Apple iPad2 with iOS v9.0, v9.1 & v9.2.1.\u201d wrote Mejri.\n\nIn the fourth scenario the attacker opens via Siri the \u2018App & Event Calender\u2019 panel, then he opens under the Tomorrow task the \u2018Information of Weather\u2019 (Informationen zum Wetter \u2013 Weather Channel LLC) link on the left bottom. The weather app is deactivated on the Apple iOS device, a new browser window opens to the AppStore, at that point we are in the same scenario seen in the other point.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Apple will fix the issues. it is possible that the flaws will be solved with the iOS 9.3.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 iOS, Siri)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ipad", "topic_name": "iPad"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iphone", "topic_name": "iPhone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/passcode", "topic_name": "Passcode"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/siri", "topic_name": "Siri"}]}, {"news_name": "Coping a 3D Model by recording the sounds of a 3D Printer with a smartphone", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45114/hacking/coping-3d-models-3d-printer-smartphone.html", "title": "Coping a 3D Model by recording the sounds of a 3D Printer with a smartphone\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 7, 2016", "body": "It isn\u2019t a sci-fi movie but a true experiment conducted by the researchers at the University of California Irvine, led by Mohammad Al Faruque, that demonstrated how to steal 3D-Printed models by copying sounds of printer nozzles.\n\nThe researchers have proven that they can copy a complete 3D model with great accuracy by simply recording the sounds while the 3D printer is working. The experts were able to link the noise produced by pumps, servos and extruders while printing an object with the blueprint used to produce it.\n\nThe 3D printer produces a symphony of mechanical sounds specific to each project, the sound can give an attacker indication of the operation conducted to implement a specific design. The sound gives a detailed indication of the machine\u2019s printing head movements and on the quantity of plastic filament is being extruded from the nozzle on every pass.\n\n\u201cThe team, led by Mohammad Al Faruque, director of UCI\u2019s Advanced Integrated Cyber-Physical Systems Lab, showed that a device as ordinary and ubiquitous as a smartphone can be placed next to a machine and capture acoustic signals that carry information about the precise movements of the printer\u2019s nozzle. The recording can then be used to reverse engineer the object being printed and re-create it elsewhere. Detailed processes may be deciphered through this new kind of cyberattack, presenting significant security risks.\u201d states a blog post published on UCI News.\n\n\n\nOne of the antipiracy measures consists in the encryption of 3D models, in other cases, the intellectual property protection is protected by developing DRM schemes for physical things to print.\n\nThe protection measures for 3D models implemented in various industries can protect them from unauthorized downloads and visualizations.\n\nThe researchers explained that everyone carrying smartphones can bypass these security measures recording the sounds of a 3D printer at work.\n\nIn 3D printing processes, the systems convert digital information embedded in source code to build layer upon layer of material giving the object the designed shape. That source file (aka G-code) is usually protected by encryption mechanisms that anyway are not effective once the printing is started.\n\n\u201cMy group basically stumbled upon this finding last summer as we were doing work to try to understand the relationship between information and energy flows,\u201d explained Al Faruque\u201cAccording to the fundamental laws of physics, energy is not consumed; it\u2019s converted from one form to another \u2013 electromagnetic to kinetic, for example. Some forms of energy are translated in meaningful and useful ways; others become emissions, which may unintentionally disclose secret information.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe unique problem is that attackers need to record the entire printing process while the 3D printer is at work, an operation that for complex can take days for objects with complex shapes.\n\nThe result of the experiment was incredible, the researchers at UCI\u2019s Advanced Integrated Cyber-Physical Systems Lab were able to clone a 3D-printed key-shaped object with 90 per cent accuracy. Now imagine the possible consequences of the application of the technique for espionage in a manufacturing plant.\n\n\u201cIn many manufacturing plants, people who work on a shift basis don\u2019t get monitored for their smartphones, for example,\u201d Al Faruque said. \u201cIf process and product information is stolen during the prototyping phases, companies stand to incur large financial losses. There\u2019s no way to protect these systems from such an attack today, but possibly there will be in the future.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 3D Printer, piracy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/3d-models", "topic_name": "3D models"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/3d-printer", "topic_name": "3D Printer"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intellectual-property", "topic_name": "intellectual property"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/piracy", "topic_name": "piracy"}]}, {"news_name": "$17 smartwatch includes a backdoor in the pairing app", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44987/mobile-2/smartwatch-with-backdoor.html", "title": "$17 smartwatch includes a backdoor in the pairing app\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 3, 2016", "body": "Be careful of cheap smartwatch offered on the web, security researchers at Mobile Iron have found that the U8 Smartwatch available on eBay for sale is offered with an Android or iOS app that contains a backdoor that is linked to a Chinese IP address.\n\nThe discovery was presented at the BSides San Francisco conference and of course, the wearable device represents a serious threat to the users\u2019 privacy.\n\nThe U8 smartwatch is offered on eBay for 15,99 Euro (just US$17), the buyers download the pairing app from an IP address reported on a piece of paper that comes with the device.\n\nThe smartwatch has 1.48\u2033 touch screen and Bluetooth connectivity to mobile devices to control calls by using an Android app that can access the user\u2019s contacts, call and SMS histories.\n\nMobile Iron research director Michael Raggo told the BSides San Francisco conference the watch is a threat to individual and enterprise security.\n\n\n\nThe U8 Smartwatch is only one of the list of devices analyzed by Raggo and his colleagues, including the Apple Watch running the WatchOS, the Samsung Gear 2 running Samsung Tizen, and the Moto 360.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe ran dynamic and behavioural analysis (on the pairing app) and discovered that when it was paired, it started communicating outbound over a random IP address to China,\u201d explained the Mobile Iron research director Michael Raggo (@datahiding)\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the IP address is. \u201cIn terms of corporate espionage, in terms of risk, there\u2019s definitely a lot of suspicious behaviours there.\u201d\n\n\n\nRaggo has developed a Python tool called SWATtack tool that could be used for forensics analysis and vulnerability assessment on the smartwatches.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the FBI decided to request the judgment of the court to obtain an order requiring Apple to unlock the device.\n\nThe law enforcement agencies invoked the \u201cthe authority of the All Writs Act of 1789,\u201d an old law that states US authorities could bypass the iPhone\u2019s security measures.\n\nOrenstein rejected the request and argued that the government can not misuse the All Writs Act to force private companies to help access data stored in a locked device.\n\n\u201cAs set forth below, I conclude that in the circumstances of this case, the government\u2019s application does not fully satisfy the statute\u2019s threshold requirements: although the government easily satisfies the statute\u2019s first two elements, the extraordinary relief it seeks cannot be considered \u201cagreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d In arguing to the contrary, the government posits a reading of the latter phrase so expansive \u2013 and in particular, in such tension with the doctrine of separation of powers \u2013 as to cast doubt on the AWA\u2019s constitutionality if adopted.\u201d wrote Orenstein.\n\n\u201cMoreover, I further conclude that even if the statute does apply, all three discretionary factors weigh against issuance of the requested writ, and that the Application should therefore be denied as a matter of discretion even if it is available as a matter of law\u201d\n\nThe All Writs Act isn\u2019t the unique law invoked in this case, another important law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) forbids any interference by government.\n\nWaiting for a final rule for the San Bernardino, Apple is going on in its personal fight in defense of the users\u2019 privacy.

FBI demand to hack the phone so the agency obtains full access to the Farook\u2019s iPhone data with Apple\u2019s assistance; however Apple rejects the demand backing it up by the idea of protection of the privacy of all iPhone users. Moreover, Apple publicly announced  its dismiss of the court order since the provision of such access would generate a backdoor into Apple products which in turns would provide unrestricted access to experts and criminals to Apple customer data, thus open opportunity of spying on Apple users in terms of intercepting phone calls, text messages and tracking their location through GPS.\n\nThe current debate has merged into an argument regarding the Apple digital rights and protection of privacy of its clients against the FBI argument concerning Farook\u2019s possible links to terrorist networks as well as future prevention of terrorist plots declaring that security and justice are more significant concerns in comparison to privacy (Ghosh, 2016).\n\nIn accordance with FBI statements the access to the San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone 5c data is only possible through the Apple assistance in terms of creating a backdoor due to the fact that FBI had already tried other methods such as returning the iPhone to its home Wi-Fi network aiming at backing up automatically San Bernardino perpetrator\u2019s data to the iCloud but unsuccessfully because Farook seemed to have disabled the automatic update function. Another FBI\u2019s unsuccessful technique is associated with the attempt to access Farook\u2019s iCloud account through resetting his Apple ID; however the resetting provoked Apple Security Measure which averted the backup of the iPhone data.\n\nBut Edward Snowden, former NSA whistleblower thinks otherwise. According to him FBI is not limited only to this way to access Farook\u2019s iPhone 5c content, but instead, FBI can rely on the use of acid and lasers to access the iPhone data with no need of Apple to hack the iPhone.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, the FBI has other means\u2026 They told the courts they didn\u2019t, but they do. The FBI does not want to do this,\u201d said Snowden\u201c\n\nThe mechanism proposed by Snowden is well-known as \u201echip decapping\u201d (Ghosh, 2016).\n\nProcess of chip decapping \n\nChip decapping is a method during which the main processor chip is physically processed to extract its contents. The first step is the use of acid to get rid of the chip\u2019s encapsulation followed by a laser drill down into the chip with the purpose of displaying the share of the memory which comprises the iPhone\u2019s distinctive ID so-called UDID data.\n\nThe next step involves the placement of tiny probes on the spot where the data is, in order to display gradually the UDID and the algorithm utilized to resolve it. After the extraction of the information, the FBI is enabled to transfer it to a super computer so the missing passcodes can be recovered through trying all probable combinations whereas one unlocks the phone data. Furthermore, due to the fact that the mechanism is implemented outside the iOS the danger that the data will be wiped out or self-destruct is limited. Of course, this method also has weaknesses, and the most significant one is the occurrence of a minor mistake during the implementation of the method can lead to chip destruction which in turns means that all access to the phone\u2019s data will be permanently lost (Goodin, 2016).\n\n\n\nInfrared laser glitching\n\nDuring an interview with an independent researcher conducted by the media (ABC News), the decapping technique was discussed so the interviewee shared his/her opinion that this method will have doubtful success against an iPhone and it\u2019s likely to result in permanent loss of the content.\n\nIn addition, the interviewee suggested that the use of infrared laser glitching would be a better option because the chance to lose the data is slightly reduced. The method is associated with the slight piercing of the chip followed by getting access to UID data through an infrared laser (Goodin, 2016).\n\nFurthermore, this particular method proved to be effective in the past by the hardware hacker Chris Tarnovsky who conducted an attack which led to damage on the microcontroller disabling the lockdown of Xbox 360 game console. To perform his attack, Tarnovsky used an electron microscope, well-known as ion beam workstation which enabled him to examine the chip in terms of nanometer scale. As a result, he had the ability to manipulate and control its individual wires utilizing microscopic needles. Therefore, such methods are technically doable against an iPhone but these methods lack the practicality due to the fact that the degree of destroying forever the hardware is significantly high and the use of these mechanisms is immensely high (Goodin, 2016).\n\nThe federal magistrate judge has ordered Apple to produce software which will be able to work against all older iPhones which lack modifications. This new software will provide the possibility of updating even when an iPhone has used \u201csecure enclave\u201d protections, in other words the software will have functions to bypass secure enclave protections. The only thing that Apple is required to do is to change the digital signature on very little cost thus the software will be able to run on different devices (Goodin, 2016).\n\nReferences\n\nGhosh, A.

Once the code is leaked online, cyber criminal organizations can work on it to create new variants that could be offered for sale or rent.\n\nThe original creator of the Android malware has sold the rights to distribute GM Bot v1 (aka MazarBot) to other cyber criminal organizations that is offering it for $500.\n\n\u201cAccording to X-Force threat intelligence, the code\u2019s author moved on to working on a new version dubbed GM Bot v2.0, which is sold in financial fraud-themed underground boards.\u201d states a blog post published by the X-Force threat intelligence.\n\nGM Bot appeared in the wild in 2014, it was offered in the Russian underground as a powerful instrument for mobile phishing.\n\n\u201cThis Android malware\u2019s differentiating capability is its deployment of overlay screens on top of running banking applications, with the goal of tricking users into entering their access credentials into a fake window that will grab and forward them to a remote attacker.\u201d continues the post. \n\nThe malware implements a number of features to target Android users, including intercepting SMS messages. The malware allows attackers to gain control of the targeted device, including the customization of fake screens.\n\nIn short, mobile banking Trojans such as GM Bot are a one-stop fraud shop for criminals:\n\nThe experts at the IBM have analyzed only the control panel because many other organizations and security firms already produced a detailed analysis of malware.\n\nThe most interesting feature discovered by the experts in the GM Bot\u2019s botnet administration panel is the possibility to create and deploy new injections to infected user devices.\n\n\n\nAnother interesting component of the Botnet is the \u201cSearch and Stats\u201d section that allows operators to analyze their database that includes stolen information, credit card details, lists of apps installed on infected devices, bank accounts the victims and other info.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to the interesting analysis published by IBM that also includes the indicators of compromise.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Botnet, GM Bot)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "San Bernardino shooter\u2019s Apple ID passcode changed in government custody", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44634/hacking/san-bernardino-shooter-iphone.html", "title": "San Bernardino shooter\u2019s Apple ID passcode changed in government custody\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 20, 2016", "body": "The discussion about the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone has monopolized media in this week, a US magistrate ordered Apple to help unlock the mobile device, but the company refused to do so.\n\nA new shocking news is circulating on the Internet, according to unnamed Apple executives, the shooter\u2019s Apple ID password changed while it was under government custody causing the block of the access.\n\nThe password associated with the Apple ID linked to the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was changed less than 24 hours after the feds took possession of the mobile device.\n\nThis circumstance made impossible to access a backup of the information the government was seeking.\n\nAccording to Buzzfeed, the company executives revealed that Apple had been helping federal officials with the investigation when the password change was discovered.\n\n\n\nAccording to Apple, it had been helping the FBI with the investigation since early January 2016, but it seems that the law enforcement contacted the company after attempting to access the iPhone.\n\n\u201cThe executives said the company had been in regular discussions with the government since early January, and that it proposed four different ways to recover the information the government is interested in without building a backdoor. One of those methods would have involved connecting the iPhone to a known Wi-Fi network and triggering an iCloud backup that might provide the FBI with information stored to  the device between the October 19th and the date of the incident.\u201d states Buzzfeed.\n\n\u201cApple sent trusted engineers to try that method, the executives said, but they were unable to do it. It was then that they discovered that the Apple ID password associated with the iPhone had been changed. (The FBI claimed earlier Friday that this was done by someone at the San Bernardino Health Department.)\u201d\n\nJust after the dramatic event, an unnamed San Bernardino police official has executed a procedure to reset the Apple ID Passcode associated with Farook\u2019s iPhone.\n\nBy default, resetting the Apple ID passcode creates a new device ID linked to the iCloud account that will not automatically sync device data online. The synchronization must be manually configured by the user after he generated the new Apple ID password.\n\nIn the case of the terrorist\u2019s iPhone the change of the settings was not possible because already locked and feds were not able to force the sync with Cloud even if they take the device to the known Wi-Fi range.\n\nNow the unique possibility to access the iPhone data consists in pushing an iOS software update that forces the auto-backup of the iPhone to a third party server.\n\nThe executives explained that creating a backdoor access to Apple iOS devices represents a serious risk for the privacy of millions of users.

A new strain of malware dubbed Android.Bankosy has been improved by its authors to capture one-time passcodes and elude the 2FA mechanisms implemented by online banking systems.\n\nExperts at Symantec detected Bankosy in July 2014, the malware is designed to steal financial information from the victim\u2019s machine.\n\nIn a classic two-factor authentication scheme, the one-time passcodes are sent to the bank users\u2019 mobile via SMS or automated phone calls.\n\nMany banking trojan in the wild are able to snoop on or intercept the incoming SMS containing the OTP, for this reason, many banks started delivering OTP through voice calls.\n\nBut, cyber thieves are smart guys and have found a way to devise this mechanism, implementing a call-forward mechanism.\n\nThe authors of the Bankosy trojan implemented a service code that allows to forward a call.  Many mobile operators in the Asia-Pacific use a service code in the format *21*[destination number]# to forward calls, dialing *21*1555215554# on a mobile device will set up unconditional call forwarding to the number 15555215554. To disable the call forwarding is necessary to use the service code #21#.\n\nThe Bankosy malware is able to forward calls delivering One-time passcodes to a number obtained from the C&C server, it also able to perform a number of actions that allows the malicious code to hide its presence, including disabling and enabling the silent mode during an incoming call.\n\n\u201cThe malware starts a call intent with the destination number obtained from the C&C server to enable unconditional call forwarding on the target device. Figure 2 illustrates the cleaned up code responsible for accomplishing this functionality.\u201d states a blog post published by Symantec.\n\n\u201cThe back door also has support for disabling and enabling silent mode, in addition to locking the device, so that the victim is not alerted during an incoming call.\n\nOnce the unconditional call forwarding is set on the victim\u2019s device, the attacker\u2014who has already stolen the victim\u2019s credentials (the first factor in two-factor authentication and authorization)\u2014can then initiate a transaction. As part of the design, when the system demands the victim to enter the second factor (i.e., the authorization token sent through a voice call), the attacker will get the call through call forwarding and enter the second factor as well to complete the transaction.\u201d\n\nOnce obtained the OTP the crooks can use it with the victim\u2019s login credentials to take over the victim\u2019s bank account.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Bankosy ,One-time passcodes)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/2fa", "topic_name": "2FA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bankosy", "topic_name": "Bankosy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/one-time-passcodes", "topic_name": "One-time passcodes"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/online-banking", "topic_name": "online-banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opt", "topic_name": "OPT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/two-factor-authenticaton", "topic_name": "two-factor authenticaton"}]}, {"news_name": "Silent Circle promptly patched a critical flaw in the Blackphone I", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43354/digital-id/critical-flaw-blackphone-i.html", "title": "Silent Circle promptly patched a critical flaw in the Blackphone I\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 7, 2016", "body": "Silent Circle has released an update for its Blackphone device that fixes several security vulnerabilities, including a flaw in its modem (CVE-2015-6841) that could have been exploited by threat actors to gain full control of the mobile device.\n\nThe Blackphone is one of the most secure mobile devices, it uses mobile apps specifically designed to protect the user\u2019s privacy by encrypting voice and text communications to prevent eavesdropping and snooping.\n\nA group of researchers from the SentinelOne security firm were reverse engineering the code of the Blackphone when discovered an open and accessible socket associated with NVIDIA\u2019s Icera modems.\n\n\u201cAs part of reverse engineering exercise to prepare for a Red Naga training session we discovered this socket was left open and accessible on the Blackphone (BP1)\u201d states a blog post published by SentinelOne.\n\nThe problem is the open socket could be used by apps without proper permissions to access its nVidia modem.\n\n\n\nThe experts explained that an attacker with access to the modem could exploit other vulnerabilities to remotely execute code on the Blackphone.

Sanchez evaluated the security level for 40 iOS banking apps and discovered a number of security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. The expert limited his analysis on client-side, avoiding to investigate the security offered on server-side.\n\nFor obvious reason, Sanchez hasn\u2019t revealed the name of the apps or the banks who developed the mobile apps it tested.\n\nWhat is changed?\n\nRevisiting its research, Sanchez discovered that many of the problems emerged two years ago still remain despite the overall level of security is increased. Sanchez executed the following tests on each app:\n\nHe discovered that five apps (12,5 per cent) failed to validate the authenticity of the SSL certificates presented, a circumstance that opens mobile users to Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks.\n\n35 per cent of the mobile apps contained non-SSL links throughout the application, traffic to these links could be easily intercepted by attackers that could also inject arbitrary JavaScript/HTML code in an attempt to create a fake login prompt.\n\n30 per cent of the iOS apps failed to validate incoming data, a circumstance that allows an attacker to potentially inject JavaScript. The expert noticed that this percentage is reduced respect the previous tests conducted in 2013.\n\n40% of the apps leak information about user activity or client-server interactions.\n\n\u201c35% of the apps contained non-SSL links throughout the application. This allows an attacker to intercept traffic and inject arbitrary JavaScript/HTML code in an attempt to create a fake login prompts or similar scams. \u201d states the post published by Sanchez.\n\nThe expert also analyzed binary and file system revealing that 15 per cent of the iOS banking apps store unencrypted data and sensitive information.

The trojanized versions of the mobile apps are fully functional, for this reason, they don\u2019t raise suspicion. It is important to note that threat actors behind the campaign avoided compromising antivirus apps, a circumstance that suggests a high level of planning when creating these malware campaigns.\n\n\u201cLookout has detected over 20,000 samples of this type of trojanized adware masquerading as legitimate top applications, including Candy Crush, Facebook, GoogleNow, NYTimes, Okta, Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, and many others.\u201d Lookout\u2019s Michael Bentley wrote in a blog post. \u201cMalicious actors behind these families repackage and inject malicious code into thousands of popular applications found in Google Play, and then later publish them to third-party app stores.\u201d\n\nThe expert observed the majority of the Shuanet adware infections in the United States, Germany, Iran, Russia, India, Jamaica, Sudan, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia.\n\nLookout researchers believe that threat actors behind the adware campaigns Kemoge, Shedun and Shuanet are different groups, anyway the adware families appear to be linked.

Now a group of researchers has found a way to track devices using the latest LTE standard for mobile networks, but with a very cheap process and a hardware expense of just $1,400.\n\nThey equipment designed by the researchers runs freely available open-source software to cause all LTE-compliant phones to leak their location to within a 32- to 64-foot (about 10 to 20 meters) radius and in some cases their GPS coordinates.\n\nThe researchers have elaborated a number of attacks that causes phones to lose connections to LTE networks, then the device downgrade to the less secure 2G and 3G mobile specifications.\n\nThe 2G, or GSM, protocols are notoriously vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, IMSI catcher act as a bogus station in the classic attack scenario.  The 2G networks are also vulnerable to attacks that could allow to discover the location of a mobile device within about 0.6 square miles.\n\n3G networks are not immune, and now users are aware of a similar problem for LTE networks. The experts explained that the LTE protocol attempts to conceal the user location by assigning it a dynamic TMSI rather than any other permanent identifier.\n\n\u201cThe LTE access network security protocols promise several layers of protection techniques to prevent tracking of subscribers and ensure availability of network services at all times. We have shown that the vulnerabilities we discovered in LTE access network security protocols lead to new privacy and availability threats to LTE subscribers.\u201d wrote the researchers in the paper titled \u2018Practical attacks against privacy and availability in 4G/LTE mobile communication systems.\u2019 \u201cWe demonstrated that our attacks can be mounted using open source LTE software stack and readily available hardware at low cost. We tested several handsets with LTE support of major baseband vendors and demonstrated that all of them are vulnerable to our attacks\u201d.\n\nThe attacks against the 2G networks rely on invisible text messages or imperceptibly brief calls that allow the attackers to discover the location of the mobile phone.\n\n\n\nThe experts also discovered that paging requests could also be triggered by social messaging apps (i.e. Facebook and WhatsApp), in this way the attacker can link the receiver\u2019s Facebook profile to the TMSI and in this way locate the phone.\n\n\u201cBut messages from people who are not in the friend list may be directed to the \u2018Other\u2019 folder. Further, the user is not notified upon the reception of the message into the \u2018Other\u2019 folder.

It has been estimated that it has been used in the development of advertising channels in over 63,000 Android apps.\n\nThere is more, the experts at Palo Alto Networks noticed that the mobile apps were making copies of all messages sent to infected devices since  August 1st.\n\nThe infected apps are being distributed through third-party stores in China, they include the malicious zdtpay\u201d SDK library. The SMS Stealing Library is a component of Taomike\u2019s in-app purchases (IAPs) system that has been designed to capture incoming messages from the mobile device.\n\n\u201c,we recently identified that the Chinese Taomike SDK has begun capturing copies of all messages received by the phone and sending them to a Taomike controlled server. Since August 1, Palo Alto Networks WildFire has captured over 18,000 Android apps that contain this library. These apps are not hosted inside the Google Play store, but are distributed via third party distribution mechanisms in China.\u201d states Palo Alto Networks.\n\nThe experts discovered that only a newer version of the Taomike SDK includes the library, earlier SDK releases are not infected.\n\nIn particular, only the applications containing the embedded URL hxxp://112.126.69.51/2c.php include the malicious library, it is important to note that the address belongs the Taomike API server.\n\nThe SMS Stealing Library requests network and SMS access permissions to the users, it also registers a receiver named com.zdtpay.Rf2b for both the SMS_RECEIVED and BOOT_COMPLETED actions with the highest priority of 2147483647.\n\nThe receiver Rf2b is used to access all the incoming messages and collects both the message body and the sender.\n\n\n\nThe researchers at Palo Alto Networks highlighted that users with mobile devices running Android 4.4 KitKat are safe because it prevents applications from capturing SMS messages if they are not the default SMS application.\n\nA great number of app developers try to monetize their efforts including advertising libraries in their code, however third-party advertising platforms could be exploited to serve malicious codes over a large number of devices.\n\nEarlier this month, the experts at FireEye discovered another malicious code, the Kemoge adware that targeted once again Android users in dozens of countries.\n\nThe Kemoge malware is packaged with various popular Android mobile apps such as games, calculators and device lockers, which are deployed to third-party app stores.

It is probably one of the most common requests US law enforcement makes to Apple, but it seems that the IT giant is trying to explain that it is technically not possible.\n\nLast case occurred in a court filing on Monday, when, according to Apple, the company provided a negative response to the U.S. Federal magistrate judge. The Justice Department tried to force the company to provide the necessary support to allow investigators extract data from a seized Apple iPhone.\n\nApple confirmed to be able to unlock only iPhone running older iOS versions, nearly 90 percent of iOS devices are running newer versions that make impossible the operation.\n\n\u201cIn most cases now and in the future, the government\u2019s requested order would be substantially burdensome, as it would be impossible to perform. For devices running iOS 8 or higher, [the company] wouldn\u2019t have the technical ability to do what the government requests \u2013 take possession of a password protected device from the government and extract unencrypted user data from that device for the government. Among the security features in iOS 8 is a feature that prevents anyone without the device\u2019s passcode from accessing the device\u2019s encrypted data. This includes Apple.\u201d Apple has said.\n\nNext Friday there will be a hearing regarding this specific case, it will be established is Apple is obligated by law to provide the required support to access the data on the locked iPhone on a search warrant.\n\nLast year, the security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski published a blog post showing how data on Apple devices could be accessed by the Government.\n\nThe Zdziarski conducted different studies on the architecture of iOS discovering that different services are unnecessary for users and could be used to bypass security defenses.  The expert has designed many of the initial methods for acquiring forensic data from Apple iOS mobile devices.\n\nOnce year ago Zdziarski presented his discoveries in a speech at the HOPE X conference, the scientist highlighted the presence of the mobile file_relay (com.apple.mobile.file_relay) services on iOS that can be accessed remotely or via USB to bypass the backup encryption, exploiting the feature an attacker can access all of the data encrypted via the data protection if the device has not been rebooted since the last time the user entered the PIN.\n\n\n\nThe file_relay tool can be used to steal user\u2019s information from iOS device, including email, location, social media accounts, the address book and the user cache folder, all the necessary to conduct an investigation.\n\n\u201cBetween this tool and other services, you can get almost the same information you could get from a complete backup,\u201d \u201cWhat concerns me the most is that this all bypasses the consumer backup encryption. When you click that button to encrypt the backup, Apple has made a promise that the data that comes off the device will be encrypted.\u201d Zdziarski said in an interview. \n\nZdziarski explained that different hidden services running on the iPhone bypass the encrypted backup protection and don\u2019t require the use of developer mode, he also confirmed the presence on the mobile iOS of a packet capture tool which could be used to dump all of the inbound and outbound HTTP data and runs in stealthy mode.\n\nThe fact that some versions of Apple iOS included such functionalities is not surprising, in one of the document leaked by Edward Snowden it is described  DROPOUTJEEP as a spyware developed by ANT (Advanced or Access Network Technology) division of the NSA that is used to gain backdoor access to the mobile.\n\nZdziarski has always high\u00f2ighted that his study hasn\u2019t the purpose to demonstrate that the above features were designed for surveillance purposes, but he believes that Intelligence agencies are exploiting them.\n\nApple has always denied any support to the US surveillance program, as explained by the CEO Tim Cook, the company respect and protect the privacy of its users\n\n\u201cWe have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services.

Some Android vendors are only fixing vulnerabilities once a year, this is the shocking revelation of a new study made by Daniel R Thomas, Alastair R Beresford, and Andrew Rice from the Cambridge University.\n\n\n\nThe trio proved 20400 devices and found out that 87.7% if the devices contain at least one big vulnerability, ready to be exploited.\n\nIn the Security Metrics for the Android Ecosystem paper, the experts explained the vulnerabilities (11) (i.e. dynamic link loading and injection) could let malware hijacking traffic, bricking mobile devices, replacing apps, and stealing user credentials.\n\n\u201cThe security of Android depends on the timely delivery of updates to x critical vulnerabilities. Unfortunately few devices receive prompt updates, with an overall average of 1.26 updates per year, leaving devices un-patched for long periods. We showed that the bottleneck for the delivery of updates in the Android ecosystem rests with the manufacturers, who fail to provide updates to x critical vulnerabilities. This arises in part because the market for Android security today is like the market for lemons: there is information asymmetry between the manufacturer, who knows whether the device is currently secure and will receive updates, and the consumer, who does not. Consequently there is little incentive for manufacturers to provide updates.\u201d states the experts.\n\nOne good think that they proposed, is the creation metric that can be used by users and regulators to check the security risk related with the Android vendors. Below the metric used in the study:\n\n\n\nThe study also highlights that Nexus is the vendor that most of all constantly update its products.\n\nSince the study was made in UK, they were only able to evaluate mobile carriers in that country, showing that O2 US is the best in pushing over-the-air security fixes, coming after T-mobile and Orange.\n\n\n\nThe patching architecture includes network operator, device manufactures, hardware developers, Google, and open source projects.\n\n\n\nThe criticality of the patch management is known for years, and it\u2019s not getting better, there are too many organizations in the middle before the patches arrive the end user, one solution could be that every patch is applied by Google to every device, and not being controlled by the mobile provider like it happens nowadays.

Everything you can do through the voice interface you can do remotely and discreetly through electromagnetic waves.\u201d Vincent Strubel, the director of the research group at ANSSI explained to Wired. \u201cYou could imagine a bar or an airport where there are lots of people,\u201d \u201cSending out some electromagnetic waves could cause many smartphones to call a paid number and generate cash.\u201d\n\nFor the success of the attack hack it is necessary that the headphone is connected to the mobile device and the voice assistant Siri have to be enabled from the lockscreen, that is the Apple\u2019s Default setting.\n\nThe French duo used as a generator of electromagnetic waves their laptop running the open-source software GNU Radio, a USRP software-defined radio, an amplifier, and an antenna. The researchers explained that their basic equipment could fit inside a backpack and can reach a range of around six and a half feet. In a more powerful configuration composed of larger batteries that could fit inside a van, the researchers say they could extend the attack\u2019s range to more than 16 feet.\n\nThe two experts also published a Video Proof of Concept for the attack, they demonstrated how send a command to Google Now via radio on an Android smartphone instructing the mobile device to launch the browser to visit the ANSSI official website.\n\n\n\nWhat about old devices?\n\nThe latest versions of iOS implement the hands-free feature that allows iPhone owners to send voice commands by saying \u201cHey Siri.\u201d\n\nThe researchers Kasmi and Esteves explained that their attack works also on older iOS versions. The iPhone headphones have long had a button on their cord that allows the user to enable Siri with a long press. The experts explained that by reverse engineering and spoofing the electrical signal of that button press, they were able to emulate the user interaction and trigger Siri from the lockscreen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mandatory to have an always-on voice interface,\u201d says Kasmi. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make the phone more vulnerable, it just makes the attack less complex.\u201d they explained\n\nThe French researchers already reported the attack to both Apple and Google.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 mobile phone, hacking)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Pangu cracking team has released the iOS 9 jailbreak", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41063/hacking/pangu-ios-9-jailbreak.html", "title": "Pangu cracking team has released the iOS 9 jailbreak\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 14, 2015", "body": "Every time a new release of the popular Apple iOS is presented, hackers and experts start the competition to jailbreak it.

Some of the exploits seem to be compiled from open source projects (e.g. [2] [3]), but some come from the commercial tool \u201cRoot Dashi\u201d (or \u201cRoot Master\u201d), mentioned in our previous blog.\u201d continues FireEye.\n\nOnce the device is rooted by the exploit, the malicious agent injects an APK (AndroidRTService.apk) into the system partition disguised as a legitimate system service.\n\nThe service tries to connect the aps.kemoge.net on the first launch and then every 24 hours from the previous command in order to avoid detection.\n\n\n\nFireEye discovered one of the malicious apps on Google Play that was downloaded between 100,000 and 500,000 times. This version did not contain the root exploits or the C&C behavior, its code was signed with the same digital certificate used to sign the version uploaded on non official stores.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013Kemoge , adware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adware", "topic_name": "adware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/exploit-kit", "topic_name": "exploit kit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kemoge", "topic_name": "Kemoge"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "YiSpecter iOS Malware can infect any Apple iOS device", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40749/malware/apple-ios-malware-yispecter.html", "title": "YiSpecter iOS Malware can infect any Apple iOS device\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 5, 2015", "body": "The recent XCodeGhost attack suffered by Apple demonstrated that nobody is completely secure from malware-based attacks.

YiSpecter was first spread by disguising as an app that lets users watch free adult content. The app has been proposed as a private version of the famous media player \u201cQVOD,\u201d which is a popular video streaming app developed by Kuaibo to share porn videos.\n\n\n\n\u201cYiSpecter began to spread in the wild in November 2014, if not earlier. The main iOS apps of this malware have user interface and functionality that enable the watching of free porn videos online, and were advertised as \u201cprivate version\u201d or \u201cversion 5.0\u201d of a famous media player \u201cQVOD\u201d.

In July 2015,  security experts from Zimperium discovered the Stagefright flaw in the popular Google Android OS which allows hackers to gain control of the system without raising suspicion.\n\nAt the time of the discovered it has been estimated that the Stagefright flaw was potentially affecting 95% of Android devices running version 2.2 to 5.1 of the Google OS (roughly 950 million smartphones).  Experts at security firm Zimperium announced the Stagefright vulnerability as the worst Android flaw in the mobile OS history.\n\nThe Stagefright flaw affects a media library app that is used for by Android to process Stagefright media files. According to the experts at Zimperium the media library is affected by several vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, Zimperium experts have publicly released the Stagefright Exploit, demonstrating how to trigger the Remote Code Execution (RCE). The researchers implemented the Stagefright Exploit in python by creating an MP4 exploiting the \u2018stsc\u2019 vulnerability, aka Stagefright vulnerability.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to finally make this code available to the general public so that security teams, administrators, and penetration testers alike may test whether or not systems remain vulnerable. What follows is a python script that generates an MP4 exploiting the \u2018stsc\u2019 vulnerability otherwise known as CVE-2015-1538 (#1).\u201d states Zimperium.\n\nNow, it seems that a billion Android phones are vulnerable to new Stagefright vulnerabilities, dubbed Stagefright 2.0,  that also in this case could allow attackers to execute malicious code on the targeted device.\n\nStagefright 2.0 vulnerabilities have been discovered by Zimperium, in particular, the experts discovered two bugs that are triggered when processing specially crafted MP3 audio or MP4 video files.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability lies in the processing of metadata within the files, so merely previewing the song or video would trigger the issue. Since the primary attack vector of MMS has been removed in newer versions of Google\u2019s Hangouts and Messenger apps, the likely attack vector would be via the Web browser.\u201d states the blog post published by Zimperium.\u201d\n\nA first vulnerability affects the libutils library (CVE-2015-6602) in every Android version since 1.0. The vulnerability can be exploited even on the latest Android releases by triggering a second vulnerability in libstagefright, a library used in the Google mobile OS to process media files.\n\nAn attacker can use booby-trapped audio or video files to execute malicious code on the victim\u2019s device, even if the Android device is running Android 5.0 or later. Devices running 5.0 or earlier can be similarly in a similar way when they use the flawed function implemented in the libutils.\n\nThe post published by Zimperium includes the description of attack scenarios:\n\nGoogle representatives have declared that the Stagefright 2.0 vulnerabilities will be fixed in the next update scheduled for release next week, but you have to consider that it may take time before your system is up to date Android.\n\nOnce Google issue the update, it could take days for it to become available to users of Google devices depending on the vendors.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Stagefright 2.0, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stagefright", "topic_name": "Stagefright"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stagefright-2-0", "topic_name": "Stagefright 2.0"}]}, {"news_name": "The Dridex Banking Malware is risen, British attention", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40641/cyber-crime/dridex-banking-malware-new.html", "title": "The Dridex Banking Malware is risen, British attention\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 2, 2015", "body": "Once against the Dridex banking Trojan is in the headlines, this week security experts at Palo Alto intelligence discovered a still ongoing large phishing campaign.\n\nThe phishing campaign is targeting victims mainly in the UK, the malicious messages include a Microsoft Word document that entices users to enable macros. The macros are used to enable the downloading of the Dridex banking malware from domains controlled by the attackers.\n\n\n\nThe phishing messages refer business or retail order and ask for payment, the malicious attachments pretend to be an invoice, but the victim is presented with a dialog box that asks them to enable macros in order to correctly view the document.\n\nEarly 2015 the Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) issued an alert about a surge in the infections of malware using macros to spread their malicious code. The researchers at Microsoft have seen a major increase in enable-macros based malware, the most active codes included Adnel and Tarbir.\n\nIn April 2015 security experts across the world detected sample of the \u201cDridex\u201d banking Trojan and \u201cTorrentLocker\u201d ransomware, which is being spread through macros.\n\nThe security researchers confirmed that the overall volume of Dridex emails peaked nearly 100,000 per day, this new campaign already reached 20,000 emails, mostly targeting emails accounts in the UK.\n\n\u201cAfter Brian Krebs reported the September arrests of alleged key figures in the cyber crime gang that developed and operated Dridex, Unit 42 observed a marked decrease in activity related to this banking Trojan \u2013 at least until today.  Dridex re-entered the threat landscape with a major e-mail phishing campaign. Leveraging the Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus platform, we identified samples associated with this resurgence.\u201d states Palo Alto in a blog post.\n\nDridex malware had been quiet for a short period, likely due to law enforcement activities, but recent events demonstrate a resurgence of the Dridex threat. Early September law enforcement identified and arrested in Cyprus a 30-year-old Moldovan man allegedly behind the Dridex campaigns.\n\n\u201cBetween the end of August and now, we had seen no Dridex activity at all,\u201d Palo Alto intelligence director Ryan Olson said. \u201cWe attribute that to the arrest.

Some send a child\u2019s location data to parents and issue an alert when a child searches keywords such as \u2018suicide\u2019, \u2018pregnancy\u2019 and \u2018bully\u2019 or receives messages with those words\u201d, reports AP\n\nThe researchers discovered that attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to take over the users\u2019 accounts and access other sensitive information.\n\n\n\nMore than half a million South Koreans use the Smart Sheriff child monitoring app to monitor their children.\n\nCitizen Lab reported the security issued to the company that develops the child monitoring app,  the Korean Mobile Internet Business Association (MOIBA), in early August. The company fixed some of the problems reported, but it is not clear which ones have been fixed to date.\n\nThe Citizen Lab agreed a timeline with the MOIBA, but it isn\u2019t providing any update on its bug fixing activity.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Smart Sheriff app was written without any security in mind.

Smart Sheriff sends information to its own servers in plain text, violating also the Korean law.\n\nThe app doesn\u2019t authenticate requests it receives, an attacker could impersonate the Safe Sheriff servers, and inject malicious code into smartphone using the child monitoring app.\n\n\u201cTheir servers fail to meet common security standards,\u201d Citizen Lab writes, \u201cThe deployment is based on obsolete and insecure protocols that are vulnerable to attacks that could lead to the interception and impersonation of MOIBA\u2019s servers.\u201d\n\n\u201cCombinations of the identified vulnerabilities could lead to mass compromise of accounts or service disruption.

The malicious app dubbed Adult Player appeared offers pornographic content to its users, but in reality it takes pictures of them by exploiting the phone\u2019s front-facing camera.\n\nThe application acts as a common mobile ransomware, in fact, the malicious Android App lock the mobile device and request the victims a payment of  $500 (\u00a3330) fee to unlock the smartphone.\n\nMobile ransomware are becoming a privileged instrument in the criminal ecosystem to rapidly monetize the effort, a report recently published by McAfee, the Threats Report, reported that the total number of ransomware samples grew 127% in the past year.\n\nAdult Player is an example of pornography-focused ransomware, it is an Android app not available on the official Google Play, once installed by the victims it asks for admin rights.\n\n\n\nThe app was not available from vetted storefronts such as Google Play, but could be installed directly from a web page.\n\nThe ransomware checks whether front camera is available or not, if available, it takes a photo of the victim while he is using the Android app and used the acquired image to personalize the ransom page.\n\n\u201cThe ransom screen is designed to stay persistent even at reboot. It does not allow the user to operate the device and keeps the screen active with ransom message.\u201d states the blog post published by Zscaler.\n\nRansomware like this relies on the embarrassment factor threatening the victim\u2019s reputation. The researchers have already discovered other mobile apps belonging to the same ransomware family that has many similarities with Adult Player.\n\nUsers that are targeted by this kind of threats don\u2019t have to pay the ransom and have to wipe their system restoring a clear image of their mobile.

It uses a common instant messaging protocol called XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) to send information from the infected device and to receive commands such as encrypt user files with a given key encryption, send an SMS, call a phone number, etc.\u201d states a report published Check Point. \u201cUsing XMPP makes it much more difficult for security devices to trace the malware C&C traffic as well as distinguish it from other legitimate XMPP traffic. It is also makes it impossible to block traffic by monitoring for suspicious URLs. Furthermore, as this technique uses external library functions to handle the communication, the malware does not require any additional application to be installed on the device. As XMPP supports TLS, the communication between the client and the server is also natively encrypted.\u201d\n\nThe infection starts when victims download a supposed Flash Player app, then when they approve the installation and agree the requested permissions, the ransomware encrypts all the data on the mobile device.\n\nThe Android ransom displays victims a message purporting to be from the National Security Agency, the text warns users about copyright violations and threats of fines being tripled if victims don\u2019t pay the ransom within 48 hours. It is not the first time that crooks abuse of the NSA message in their social engineering tactic, the mobile ransomware Koler and Simplocker.\n\n\n\nThe researchers have already identified dozens of XMPP accounts used to control the Android ransomware that were already suspended.\n\n\u201cDuring our campaign research, we discovered dozens of XMPP C&C accounts related to this infection. Over the past few weeks we\u2019ve informed the relevant XMPP server operators, and those accounts have been suspended. This action will effectively disrupt the communications of any currently infected clients and prevent the malware authors from controlling these devices. In addition, the files on any machines newly infected with these samples should be safe, as the malware won\u2019t be able to effectively encrypt the files without the C&C commands. Unfortunately, new samples from this campaign are still appearing almost every day.\u201d states the report\n\nThe majority of infection is in the United States, followed by Asia, tens of thousands of devices could be infected and to date and according Check Point nearly 10 percent of the victims have paid the fee requested by cyber criminals. The ransom range from between $200 and $500.\n\n\n\nThe experts noticed that crooks crafted ransom messages based on the victim\u2019s geographic location, making more credible the NSA message.\n\nGive a look to the report, it is full of detailed information on the singular Android ransomware, including indicators of compromise.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android Ransomware, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-ransomware", "topic_name": "Android Ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/xmpp", "topic_name": "XMPP"}]}, {"news_name": "MassVet finds unknown malicious apps in app stores in 10 Sec", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39762/malware/massvet-android-scan.html", "title": "MassVet finds unknown malicious apps in app stores in 10 Sec\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 1, 2015", "body": "A group of University researchers has created a new method for detecting malicious apps running on an Android devices called MassVet. MassVet doesn\u2019t use the old method of signatures scanning, instead it compares legitimate Android frameworks to establish those that are malicious.\n\nThe architecture behind MassVet can be seen below:\n\n\n\nThe authors argue that MassVet is able to identify a malicious app in less than 10 seconds and with a low probability of false positives:\n\n \u201d Unlike existing detection mechanisms, which often utilize heavyweight program analysis techniques, our approach simply compares a submitted app with all those already on a market, focusing on the difference between those sharing a similar UI structure (indicating a possible repackaging relation), and the commonality among those seemingly unrelated. Once public libraries and other legitimate code reuse are removed, such diff/common program components become highly suspicious. This analysis is made scalable by its simple, static nature and the feature projection techniques that enable a cloud-based, fast search for view/code differences and similarities.\u201d wrote the researchers in the paper they published.\n\nThe researchers argue that this new method can help do find a Zero-day malware, but criticized Google for only ban a player that releases malicious payload, and not blocking a malicious payload, what leads to other people reusing the malicious payload:\n\n\u201cAnother interesting finding is that we saw that some of these developers uploaded the same or similar malicious apps again after they were removed. Actually, among the 2125 reappeared apps, 604 confirmed malware (28.4 percent) showed up in the Play Store unchanged, with the same MD5 and same names. Further, those developers also published 829 apps with the same malicious code (as that of the malware) but under different names. The fact that the apps with known malicious payloads still got slipped in suggests that Google might not pay adequate attention to even known malware.\u201d\n\nThe MassVet implements a comparison algorithm, but on top of that uses a difference and similarities comparison mechanism, which allows it to be more efficient and \u201csmart.\u201d\n\n\n\nMassVet analyzed around 1.2 million apps deployed in 33 Android apps stores discovering 127.429 malicious apps, 30.552 are hosted in Google Play.\n\nThe disconcerting aspect of the story is that many of these apps weren\u2019t recognized by common antivirus solutions available in the market.\n\n\u201cWe observed that most scanners react slowly to the emergence of new malware. For all 91,648 malicious apps confirmed by VirusTotal, only 4.1% were alarmed by at least 25 out of 54 scanners it hosts. The results are present in Figure 7. This finding also demonstrates the capability of MassVet to capture new malicious content missed by most commercial scanners. \u201c\n\n\n\nProjects like this one, are important and help the security community in discovering quickly the malicious apps that are deployed in app stores.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to paper published by the researchers.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 MassVet, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mass-vetting", "topic_name": "Mass Vetting"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/massvet", "topic_name": "MassVet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "KeyRaider: iOS Malware targets over 225,000 Apple accounts", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39743/cyber-crime/keyraider-ios-malware.html", "title": "KeyRaider: iOS Malware targets over 225,000 Apple accounts\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 31, 2015", "body": "Palo Alto networks announced recently that a new iOS malware called KeyRaider allowed crooks to take over more than 225.000 apple accounts on jailbroken iOS devices.\n\nKeyRaider allows the attackers to download applications from the Apple\u2019s Store by using the victim\u2019s credentials, which means that they download a paid software for free.\n\n\u201cWe believe this to be the largest known Apple account theft caused by malware.\u201d wrote Claud Xiao of Palo Alto Networks in a blog post, \n\nPablo Alto notified Apple with their discovery, but they could not reach Apple\u2019s officials in Sydney.\n\nJailbroken devices are exposed because lack of the Apple\u2019s protections that limit what apps can be installed on a mobile device.\n\nXiu told that KeyRaider was been investigated with the help of an amateur technical group in China called WeipTech, and one of the members, a student at Yangzhou University was the person who discovered the attack.\n\nThe method used to spread KeyRaider, is to incorporate it into jailbreak tweaks, and in fact, jailbreak tweaks published on the forum Weiphone included KeyRaider.\n\nA user under the pseudonymous of \u201cmischa07\u201d may be the responsible for including KeyRaider to his personal repository of apps.\n\nThe same username was found hardcoded into KeyRaider, in the encryption and decryption key of the malicious app.\n\nKeyRaider is capable of steeling Apple accounts, including username and password, intercept the iTunes traffic, and it can be used to fraudulently download the paid apps.\n\nKeyRaider as other features as collecting certificates, private keys and purchase receipts.\n\nResearchers have also discovered that KeyRaider was used for a ransomware attempt, since the malware can \u201clocally disable any kind of unlocking operations, whether the correct passcode or password has been entered,\u201d.\n\nIt has been reported that one person had his phone locked and showed a message to contact someone over a QQ instant messaging service:\n\n\n\nWeipTech has found the stolen account data on a C&C server used by crooks, the experts breached the server due to some vulnerabilities affecting it, in this way they were able to get the stolen data.\n\n\n\nThe creators of KeyRaider suspecting that something wrong was happening quickly patched the vulnerability leaving WeipTech with only half of the accounts recovered.\n\n\u201cWeipTech has provided a query service in their website http://www.weiptech.org/ for potential victims to query whether their Apple accounts was stolen.

The flaw affects all apps that use the managed app configuration settings, meaning that Apple is storing enterprise credentials in a directory that can be read by everyone.\n\n\u201cIT will commonly send the credential and authentication information along with the managed app binary for installation on corporate mobile devices [which] often included access to the corporate data security jewels, including server URLs, and credentials with plaintext passwords,\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe underlying issue with our critical sandbox violation discovery is that \u2026 anyone can also see the credential information on the mobile device as it is stored world readable.\u201d said Watkins.\n\n\u201cAn attacker could target as many enterprises it can get into (using the iTunes store to spread an app designed to read and share the configuration files), or a specific target (traditional spear-phishing attack, through targeted e-mail, etc). In either case, they would develop an app that has a high chance of being installed in the enterprise, such as a productivity app. Once the app gets downloaded and installed on the devices, it would continuously monitor the directory for configuration settings being written to the world readable directory, harvesting and sending them to the attacker. Because all apps have access to the directory, it could hide in plain sight and operate as one of the many legitimate apps that have access to the directory in question.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn attacker (or a malicious app) with access to an MDM managed device can read all managed configuration settings for an unpatched device. Managed configuration is used to make the provisioning of apps easier and enterprise apps may use this mechanism to provision credentials or details about internal infrastructure this way. Those can be used by the attacker to gain access to those services.\u201d\n\nCorporate app data are more exposed, the expert highlighted the risk of a cyber attack that can allow hackers to steal information stored in an open directory (including mobile device management).\n\n\n\nThe tests conducted by Watkins revealed that medical apps used by doctors were leaking patient data, user names, passwords, authentication tokens.\n\n\u201cWe also found apps used in the healthcare industry, giving doctors access to patient data and records (a likely HIPAA violation).\u201d continues Watkins.\n\nThe analysis of the managed settings used by these apps revealed:\n\nThe good news is that Apple patched the CVE-2015-3269 sandbox vulnerability with the release iOS 8.4.1, but yet many people are running older iOS versions. It has been estimated that around 70% of users still have older iOS versions and still taking some months until iOS 8.4.1 is fully spread.\n\nPlease keep in mind the following recommendations to avoid these type of problems:\n\nElsio Pinto (@high54security) is at the moment the Lead Mcafee Security Engineer at Swiss Re, but he also as knowledge in the areas of malware research, forensics, ethical hacking.

The new vulnerability could be exploited remotely to install malicious code on the target device just by sending a specially crafted multimedia message.\n\nThe CVE-2015-3842 vulnerability affects all the versions of Android devices including the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, hundreds of Millions of Android mobile devices are exposed to cyber attacks.\n\nGoogle has already patched this new issue affecting the media server component called AudioEffect. The attack exploits an unchecked variable that comes from the client, usually a mobile app.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability involves AudioEffect, a component of the mediaserver program. It uses an unchecked variable which comes from the client, which is usually an app. For an attack to begin, attackers convince the victim to install an app that doesn\u2019t require any required permissions, giving them a false sense of security.\u201d states the blog post published by TrendMicro.\n\nThe experts at Trend Micro explained that in order to exploit the Android CVE-2015-3842 vulnerability the attacker have to convince the victim to install a malicious app that does not ask for \u201cany required permissions, giving them a false sense of security.\u201d\n\nThe attacker can trigger a buffer heap overflow due to the lack of checks for the buffer pReplyData and pCmdData.\n\n\u201cThe checking of the buffer sizes of pReplyData and pCmdData is not correct. The buffer sizes of both pReplyDataand pCmdData and the buffer pCmdData itself all come from client-supplied parameters. As the mediaserver component uses these buffers, it reads a size coming from the buffer pCmdData; the mediaserver component assumes the buffer sizes of pReplyData and pCmdData are bigger than this size. We can make the buffer size ofpReplyData, which is client-supplied, smaller than the size read from the buffer pCmdData.

An attacker can use a mobile application on the mobile device to send the Admin application a specific kind of URL to bypass the Same Origin Policy and access data from the Admin sandbox.\n\n\u201cAn issue was found when the Google Admin application received a URL via an IPC call from any other application on the same device. The Admin application would load this URL in a webview within its own activity.

Hackers have demonstrated that it is not difficult to trigger vulnerabilities inside systems that manage fingerprints in order to bypass authentication mechanisms, in April 2015 a group of security researchers at FireEye have discovered a vulnerability in the Samsung Galaxy S5 that allows hackers to clone fingerprints.\n\nNow security experts from FireEye have discovered four new methods to hack Android devices and extract user fingerprints remotely.\n\nThe researchers Tao Wei and Yulong Zhang presented the findings of their hack in a talk titled, Fingerprints on Mobile Devices: Abusing and Leaking, at the Black Hat conference last week.\n\nThe techniques are very insidious because the victim will never notice the disconcerting theft of its fingerprints.\n\n\n\nThe researchers dubbed the attack \u201cFingerprint Sensor Spying attack\u201d and it could allow attackers to \u201cremotely harvest fingerprints in a large scale from the handset of the major manufacturers including HTC, Samsung and Huawei.\n\nThe experts avoided to release  any \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d for obvious reason.\nThe targets of the attack are Android devices equipped with Fingerprint Sensors that allow users to authenticate themselves by simply touching the display of their smartphone.\n\nLet\u2019s note that Google doesn\u2019t yet officially support the authentication mechanism based on fingerprints based on its mobile operating system, but the company will soon implement the support in the next release Android M.\n\nThe researchers tested their attack on the HTC One Max and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S5, the succeeded to steal a fingerprint image from the device due to the lack of a proper implementation of a locking mechanism for the fingerprint sensor.\n\nI have explained several times the risks related to a wrong implementation of biometric authentication, the theft of a biometric data like fingerprints would be more dangerous compared the theft of a stolen password.\n\nUsers can reset their compromised password, but cannot change fingerprints neither the iris in the case of data breach.\n\n\u201cIn this attack, victims\u2019 fingerprint data directly fall into attacker\u2019s hand. For the rest of the victim\u2019s life, the attacker can keep using the fingerprint data to do other malicious things,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nFortunately, the security issue is quite easy to fix, for example by encrypting fingerprint data on Android devices, and a number of vendors are already working to a security update.\n\nThe measure is already adopted by Apple iOS that encrypts data acquired by the Touch ID sensor. The experts explained that Apple iOS is \u201cquite secure\u201d because it encrypts fingerprint data from the scanner with a crypto key, making it unreadable even if hackers gain access.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android, fingerprints)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-hat-2015", "topic_name": "Black Hat 2015"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fingerprints", "topic_name": "fingerprints"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "Hacking Team compromised non-jailbroken iOS devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39185/hacking/hacking-team-ios-devices.html", "title": "Hacking Team compromised non-jailbroken iOS devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 7, 2015", "body": "Another news related with the leak of the Hacking Team\u2018s hack, this time it was discovered that Hacking Team was capable of compromising IOS devices, even if they weren\u2019t jailbroken.\n\nTo accomplish this, Hacking Team was using a changed version of last year\u2019s Masque Attack, and the devices were infected by text messages or email.\n\nEven if this article is about the IOS devices, it is important to remember that Hacking Team could compromise every major Mobile platform, such iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Symbian.\n\nAt the Black Hat 2015 conference, experts from FireEye explained how the Hacking Team was targeting mainly Android and IOS devices.\n\nFireEye explained that normally only jailbroken devices could be exploited by the Remote Control System (RCS) agent, but the experts discovered that even non-jailbroken devices could be exploited using the Mask Attack.\n\nThe Masque Attack, was already known and was implemented by the WireLurker malware, where the malware was taking advantage of a flaw that was patched last year.\n\nBasically, an attacker can exploit the flaw by developing a malicious app with the same name of the legitimate one that he intends to replace.\n\nThe malicious app has to be signed using a bogus enterprise digital certificate, digitally signed code could allow an attacker to deploy the software across organizations without having to go through the official App Store. In this way, victims have no idea of the ongoing infection because they don\u2019t receive any specific warning.\u00f9\n\n\n\nComing back to the main subject here, the Masque Attack performed by the Hacking Team relies on a remote server to download the malicious copies of legitimate applications. The bogus apps are managed through a control panel by the attackers. Hacking Team was re-packaging popular mobile apps such as Skype, Twitter, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Google Chrome, WeChat, Viber, Blackberry Messenger, VK, and Telegram, and more.\n\nDuring the re-packaging, an extra binary is added, the malicious code allows attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data, and communicate with Hacking Team\u2019s remote server. Since the bundle identifiers were the same as the original apps, it meant that they could replace the original apps on IOS devices ( all IOS versions before IOS 8.1.3).\n\nWhen installed the fake applications would execute commands and extract data from the devices.\n\nApple fixed the problem with Masque Attacks in IOS 8.1.3, and from that point on Hacking Team\u2019s efforts to perform the attack were unsuccessful, but FireEye told that new types of Masque attack vulnerabilities were found and current IOS version 8.4 it is still vulnerable to them.\n\n\u201cThis is the first truly advanced attack infrastructure using Masque Attack ever seen, and it is a proof point that advanced attackers are finally putting some real rigour behind smartphones, tablets, and Apple products,\u201d \u201cThe threat landscape of the global mobile security is evolving to a new era, where attackers start to exhaust every possible vulnerability to obtain capabilities and privilege, and they are also trying to evade detections and stealthily control the victim devices persistently.\u201d  FireEye said.\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Hacking Team, iOS)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-hat-2015", "topic_name": "Black Hat 2015"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking-team", "topic_name": "Hacking Team"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios-devices", "topic_name": "iOS devices"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/jailbroken", "topic_name": "jailbroken"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/masque-attack", "topic_name": "Masque Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "CVE-2015-3823 Android bug phones in endless reboots", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39131/hacking/cve-2015-3823-android-bug.html", "title": "CVE-2015-3823 Android bug phones in endless reboots\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 5, 2015", "body": "Still problems for Android users!

The flaw potentially affects half of the Android devices that are running the flawed versions.\n\n\n\nAn attacker can trigger the Android vulnerability by sending a malformed video file using the Matroska container. The attacker can exploit the flaw to make the targeted smartphone inoperable and silent, the attack completely mute the device making the user interface unresponsive.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when the mediaserver service parses an MKV file. It reads memory out of buffer or writes data to NULL address when parsing audio data,\u201d states a blog post published by Trend Micro.\n\n\n\nAn attacker can remotely exploit the denial-of-service (DoS) flaw to force the victim to install a malicious app or visit a website used to serve a malware. Another option for the attacker is to use a malicious app containing an embedded MKV file that makes the smartphone unresponsive.\n\n\u201cThis vulnerability can be exploited in two ways: either via a malicious app installed on the device, or through a specially-crafted web site. The first technique can cause long-term effects to the device: an app with an embedded MKV file that registers itself to auto-start whenever the device boots would case the OS to crash every time it is turned on.\u201d continues the post.\n\nIn a video proof-of-concept the experts demonstrated how to run a local Denial of Service Attack exploiting the flaw to cause the mediaserver service to continuously restart once the Android vulnerability is triggered.\n\n\u201cWhatever means is used to lure in users, the likely payload is the same.

Experts at security firm Zimperium announced the Stagefright vulnerability as the worst Android flaw in the mobile OS history, and confirmed that they will reveal more details at the next BlackHat or DEFCON in Las Vegas this year.\n\nThe Stagefright flaw affects a media library app that is used for by Android to process Stagefright media files. According to the experts at Zimperium the media library is affected by several vulnerabilities.\n\nJoshua Drake from Zimperium discovered seven critical vulnerabilities in the native media playback engine called Stagefright, the expert defined the Stagefright flaw the \u201cMother of all Android Vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nThe attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a single multimedia text message to an unpatched Android device, according to the security firm Google has already issued a patch and has sent out to it to the company\u2019s partners. However, most manufacturers haven\u2019t already distributed the patch to their customers exposing them to cyber attack\n\n\n\nOnce the attackers have successfully exploited the vulnerability, they would be able to write code to the mobile device and steal user data, including audio or media files or photographs stored in the SD cards. The attackers can remotely control the device, accessing audio from microphone, reading emails, and exfiltrating sensitive data.\n\nThe experts at Zimperium explain that, unlike spear-phishing attacks, where victims need to open a malicious file or click on a like to a domain used to serve a malware, the Stagefright vulnerability can be triggered even if victims are not using the smartphone.\n\nOnce the exploit has been delivered, the attacker can delete the message before the user will notice it, making attacks very insidious and impossible to detect.\n\n\u201cAll devices should be assumed to be vulnerable,\u201d Drake told Forbes. Drake says that only Android phones below version 2.2 are not affected by this particular vulnerability. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of testing on an Ice Cream Sandwich Galaxy Nexus\u2026 where the default MMS is the messaging application Messenger.

This scheme is effective mainly because it simulates the human interaction.\n\nMike Andrews, Antoni Kolev, David Sendroff, and Matt Vella, researchers from New York outfit Forensiq explained that the \u201crogue mobile apps\u201d are generating 20 ads per minute (700 per hour), a legitimate app that serves some ads generates one ad every 1 minute.\n\nSo many ads are generating much traffic per day in mobile devices, and it\u2019s affecting around 15% of the apps in the market.\n\n \u201cFraudulent apps were observed selling traffic through most major ad exchanges and networks. These apps would establish on average 1100 connections per minute and communicate with 320 ad networks, ad servers, exchanges and data providers in the course of an hour,\u201d states the report published by the researchers.\n\n \u201cBased on the traffic we observed, we estimate that mobile device hijacking will cost advertisers more than $857 million in 2015 \u2026 we project that the annual impact of in-app fraud will surpass the $1 billion mark globally in 2015.\u201d\n\nThe financial impact to advertisers is huge, instead of advertising their product the rogue applications, they are hijacking the mobile devices causing losses in the business. The experts estimate that advertisers in iOS will lose $363 million, for Android losses are $480 million, and for Windows Mobile $14 million.\n\n\n\nThe study revealed that antivirus solutions are unable to detect this advertising hijacking technique.\n\n\u201cForensiq analyzed ad traffic from thousands of apps available on Google Play, Apple\u2019s App Store as well as third party app marketplaces.

Esser decided to take the full disclosure the vulnerability without previously notifying it to Apple, but it seems that the company was already aware of the flaw in the Mac OS X system because it was reported months ago by the a South Korean researcher known as \u201cbeist.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe flaw resides in a feature introduced by Apple to the dynamic linker \u201cdyld\u201d with the release of OS X 10.10, the vulnerability is related to the environment variable DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE, which enables error logging to arbitrary files.\n\n\u201cWhen this variable was added the usual safeguards that are required when adding support for new environment variables to the dynamic linker have not been used. Therefore it is possible to use this new feature even with SUID root binaries. This is dangerous, because it allows to open or create arbitrary files owned by the root user anywhere in the file system. Furthermore the opened log file is never closed and therefore its file descriptor is leaked into processes spawned by SUID binaries. This means child processes of SUID root processes can write to arbitrary files owned by the root user anywhere in the filesystem. This allows for easy privilege escalation in OS X 10.10.x.\u201d Esser reported in a blog post.\n\nEsser has published technical details of the security flaw describing the way to exploit it to gain full privileges on the target system. The researcher also provided a full Proof of Concept Exploit that gives the executing user a local root shell.\n\nThe problem for Mac OS X users is that Apple only fixed the vulnerability in the beta versions of OS X El Capitan 10.11, the fix for another version, including the current OS X 10.10.4 or the beta version of OS X 10.10.5. OS X 10.11, is expected to be released by October.\n\nEsser has revealed that the local privilege escalation flaw also affects jailbroken iPhones running iOS 8.x.\n\n\n\nApple users can wait for the fix or install SUIDGuard, a kernel extension that adds mitigations to protect SUID/SGID binaries.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Bartalex, macro)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/local-privilege-escalation", "topic_name": "local privilege escalation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lpe", "topic_name": "LPE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mac-os-x", "topic_name": "Mac OS X"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 18 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38690/cyber-crime/security-affairs-newsletter-18.html", "title": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 18 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 19, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again thank you!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Newsletter, SecurityAffairs)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/newsletter", "topic_name": "Newsletter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "iOS crash warnings scam targeted iPhone and iPad users in US and UK", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38673/cyber-crime/ios-crash-warnings-scam.html", "title": "iOS crash warnings scam targeted iPhone and iPad users in US and UK\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 18, 2015", "body": "Scammers are targeting iPhone and iPad users with a new-old elaborate scheme that relies on iOS crash warnings.\n\nScammers are using JavaScript generated dialogs to display IOS Crash warnings, as explained by the experts at F-Secure,  the IOS Crash Report scam is a variation of the technical support scam.\n\n\u201ccases of which have been documented as early as 2008.

The two exploits were dubbed by the experts Manifest Masque and Extension Masque and can be used to demolish mobile apps.\n\n\n\nThe experts explained that this vulnerability affects all iOS 7.x and iOS 8.x versions prior to iOS 8.4.\n\n\u201cIn the recent release of iOS 8.4, Apple fixed several vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities that allow attackers to deploy two new kinds of Masque Attack (CVE-2015-3722/3725, and CVE-2015-3725). We call these exploits Manifest Masque and Extension Masque, which can be used to demolish apps, including system apps (e.g., Apple Watch, Health, Pay and so on), and to break the app data container. In this blog, we also disclose the details of a previously fixed, but undisclosed, masque vulnerability: Plugin Masque, which bypasses iOS entitlement enforcement and hijacks VPN traffic.\u201d wrote the blog post published by FireEye.\n\nThe experts also highlighted that around one-third of iOS devices still have not updated to versions 8.1.3 or above, leaving the devices open to the Masque Attacks.\n\nResearchers Zhaofeng Chen, Tao Wei, Hui Xue, and Yulong Zhang provided the details a number of \u2018app-demolishing\u2019 Masque attacks, these malicious apps could be downloaded from the official App Store or can be part of a system app such as the Apple Pay or the Safary Browser.\n\n* Prevent device from rebooting\n\n* Exploit more kernel vulnerabilities\n\n\u201cThe Manifest Mmasque attack leverages the vulnerability (CVE-2015-3722, CVE-2015-3725) to demolish an existing app on iOS when a victim installs an in-house iOS app wirelessly using enterprise provisioning from a website,\u201d states the post. \u201cThe demolished app can be either a regular app downloaded from official App Store or even an important system app, such as Apple Watch, Apple Pay, App Store, Safari, and Settings.\n\n \n\nOne of the attack scenarios detailed by the experts, the Plugin Masque allows executing Untrusted Code with Privilege including VPN-hijacking by replacing the VPN Plugin in affected devices.\n\n\u201c\u2026 this exploit is even more severe than the original Masque Attack,\u201d states the experts. \u201cThe malicious code can be injected to the neagent process and can perform privileged operations, such as monitoring all VPN traffic, without the user\u2019s awareness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur investigation also shows that around one third of iOS devices still have not updated to versions 8.1.3 or above, even five months after the release of 8.1.3, and these devices are still vulnerable to all the Masque attacks.\u201d\n\nApple users should update their devices urgently.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013Masque attacks, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/masque-attacks", "topic_name": "Masque attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "More than 600 million Samsung S devices open to hack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37871/hacking/samsung-s-devices-hack.html", "title": "More than 600 million Samsung S devices open to hack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 17, 2015", "body": "More than 600 million Samsung smartphones could be opened to cyber attack due to the presence of a security flaw in the validation of the  Swiftkey language pack updates. The security flaw, coded as CVE-2015-2865, affects to the mechanism used for adding new languages and upgrading existing ones in the mobile devices of the popular vendor.\n\nThe security issue affects several models of Samsung S mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini, S4, S5, and S6. According to the researchers at NowSecure, the update is sent to the smartphone via HTTP, but the transfer lack of any authentication mechanism allowing an attacker to run a man-in-the-middle (MitM) in order to replace the legitimate update with a malicious code. The attackers can inject their malicious payload whenever SwiftKey checks for a language pack update, a circumstance that occurs every few hours or on the device reboot.\n\n\u201cSamsung Galaxy S phones, including the S4 Mini, S4, S5, and S6, are pre-installed with a version of Swiftkey keyboard that is signed by Samsung to operate with system privileges. By design, Swiftkey periodically checks for language pack updates over HTTP. By intercepting such requests and modifying the necessary fields, an attacker can write arbitrary data to vulnerable devices.\u201d states the US CERT.\n\nThe experts demonstrated that is possible to exploit the flaw to run an arbitrary on the target device without user interaction.\n\n\n\nAnother worrying consideration is related to the fact that updates are handled by the mobile OS with system privileges, this means that an attacker can exploit the flaw to acquire rights of a privileged user and install any kind of malicious apps without the user\u2019s knowledge. The attackers can do much more, including eavesdropping on communications, access GPS data, steal sensitive information, access sensors data and of course control the camera and the microphone.\n\nThe experts reported the flaw to Samsung in December 2014 and started providing a patch to mobile carriers in early 2015. As usually happens in these cases, the different mobile carriers have different patch management processes and we have no information on the number of them that have already delivered the update to their customers.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the giants Verizon and Sprint still haven\u2019t pushed out the fix for the Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile phones, meanwhile AT&T hasn\u2019t patched the Galaxy S4 Mini and T-Mobile hasn\u2019t patched the Galaxy S5 devices.\n\nThe experts depicted several attack scenarios in order to exploit the flaw in the Samsung mobile devices, they can set up a rogue Wi-Fi access points or gain access to the victim\u2019s local network. The attacker could be very easy for persistent attackers that are able to run DNS hijacking attackers, or that can have the access level of an ISP.\n\nActually the only way to mitigate the risk of exposure is to install a patch provided by the mobile carrier because the Swift keyboard is present in the mobile OS and cannot be disabled or uninstalled. Meantime, avoid using untrusted Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\u201cThe Swift keyboard comes pre-installed on Samsung devices and cannot be disabled or uninstalled.

Content Blocking gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content.\u201d States Apple.\n\nThe content blocking doesn\u2019t came natively, users will need to install a blocking software that interacts with Safari (via JSON),\n\n\u201cYour app extension is responsible for supplying a JSON file to Safari. The JSON consists of an array of rules (triggers and actions) for blocking specified content. Safari converts the JSON to bytecode, which it applies efficiently to all resource loads without leaking information about the user\u2019s browsing back to the app extension. Xcode includes a Content Blocker App Extension template that contains code to send your JSON file to Safari. Just edit the JSON file in the template to provide your own triggers and actions. The sample JSON file below contains triggers and actions that block images on webkit.org\u201d\n\nBut why such feature can kill applications like AdBlock?\n\n\u201cIn short, either this new API will improve Adblock Plus performance on Safari or it will force us to rely upon an inferior blocking format that would essentially kill adblocking on Safari.\u201d States Sebastian Noack from AdBlock.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo far very little is known about Content Blocking Extensions, available in Safari 9 and iOS 9. However, according to the announcements there are so called \u201cblock lists\u201d, which are JSON files, that can be registered by the extension.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis mechanism is entirely different from the one used by Adblock Plus on any other platform (including current versions of Safari), where we can run arbitrary code on request, blocking requests depending on their URL and context.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this new mechanism, we\u2019d need to convert Adblock Plus filter lists to a block list like the one above. However, most of our filters aren\u2019t as simple as the example above. So, we are nervously awaiting how powerful their block lists will be, most importantly when it comes to matching the document domain and request type, as well as regular expression matching of URLs and recursive exception rules.\u201d\n\nIn this phase developers can only wait for Apple information on iOS 9 and its content-blocker working mode, either will help them to improve their adblocking software.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 AdBlock,  iOS 9)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adblock-apple", "topic_name": "adblock apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-blocking", "topic_name": "Content Blocking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios-9", "topic_name": "iOS 9"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "Apple iOS flaw exploitable to steal user password with a phishing email", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37720/hacking/apple-ios-flaw-phishing.html", "title": "Apple iOS flaw exploitable to steal user password with a phishing email\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 11, 2015", "body": "A new vulnerability that affects Apple\u2019s iOS could be exploited by hackers to collect user passwords by using a single email.\n\nJan Soucek (@jansoucek) , a forensic expert at Ernst and Young has developed a tool, the iOS 8.3 Mail.app inject kit, that could be used to create malicious iCloud password phishing emails.

This kind of attack is very dangerous due to the large audience of the official Google Play, in the specific case Stefanenko confirmed that nearly 2.8 million users have already downloaded malicious Minecraft Android apps.

If you purchase mSpy for a jailbroken iOS phone or tablet, you will need 5-15 minutes of physical access to the device for successful installation.\u201d\n\nI am interested to see how the law will act upon companies like these, in Europe and U.S since it\u2019s not clear how legal these activities are, because they create privacy issues, but one thing is certain, more software like this will keep appearing since people like to spy on their loved ones.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  spyware, mSpy)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Hackers drain money from Starbucks accounts linked to users\u2019 credit cards", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36793/cyber-crime/hackers-starbucks-mobile-app.html", "title": "Hackers drain money from Starbucks accounts linked to users\u2019 credit cards\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 14, 2015", "body": "Starbucks is the last victim of scammers, cyber criminals are syphoning money from the credit or debit card linked to the customers\u2019 Starbucks accounts.\n\nThe attack is quite simple for fraudsters, the criminal just need user credentials for Starbucks account, that could be easily stolen with a phishing campaign, to operate with the victim\u2019s credit card.\n\nCriminals could also steal credentials by keylogging, by attempting to use credentials leaked after other data breaches, or by password bruteforcing.\n\nAccording to the journalist Bob Sullivan the hackers syphoned Starbucks customers through the Starbucks app and exploiting the auto-load function.\n\nVictims usually received an email that pretends to come from Starbucks informing them that their username and password had been changed.\n\nOnce the fraudsters gain the access to the victim\u2019s Starbucks account, they can transfer the money present on the gift card on the victims\u2019 Starbucks app to another gift card they control in order to resell them later. Another cash out schema for scammers is to buy gift cards and send them to accounts they control.\n\nThe worst scenario for the victim occurs when he has enabled the auto-load feature on the Starbuck account, because in this case additional amounts of money are automatically loaded into the Starbucks card every time the credit is reduced.\n\n\n\nAccording to a source inside the company, the frauds have gone at least since January, the Starbucks company explained that it is already working to protect its customers and urged users to report any suspicious activity on their accounts.\n\n\u201chave safeguards in place to constantly monitor for fraudulent activity,\u201d but they are \u201cunable to discuss specific security measures\u201d publicly for obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cIf a customer believes their account may be subject to fraudulent activity, we encourage them to contact us and their financial institution immediately,\u201d she stated, adding that \u201ccustomers are not responsible for charges or transfers they didn\u2019t make.\u201d states the company.\n\nOf course, I recommend all Starbucks consumers immediately disable auto-reload feature on the Starbucks mobile payments and gift cards.\n\nThe attack on Starbucks demonstrates the importance of the adoption of multi factor authentication process, for cyber criminals it is too easy to guess or stole a user password and when the accounts are linked to payment process the effect could be serious. This type of small amount theft can be automated reusing already exposed credentials.\u201d\n\nAs usual also a proper security posture could help to mitigate account take over, I always recommend you avoid using the same credentials across multiple service to prevent a domino effect in case one of them is breached.\n\nUnfortunately, cyber attacks similar to the one occurred to Starbucks are quite common.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Starbucks, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/credit-card", "topic_name": "credit card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breaches", "topic_name": "Data-breaches"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacker", "topic_name": "hacker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/password-bruteforcing", "topic_name": "password bruteforcing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/starbucks", "topic_name": "Starbucks"}]}, {"news_name": "Canadian users infected by a Mobile ransomware by visiting adult content websites", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36571/malware/mobile-ransomware-adult-content-websites.html", "title": "Canadian users infected by a Mobile ransomware by visiting adult content websites\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 6, 2015", "body": "Once again, visitors of websites proposing adult content are targeted by cyber criminals.

The situation is easier for Samsung Galaxy S5 on which a malware would only require system-level access.\n\n\u201cIf the attacker can break the kernel [the core of the Android operating system], although he cannot access the fingerprint data stored in the trusted zone, he can directly read the fingerprint sensor at any time.

An attacker can use a P2P SSID names that exceed the valid 32 octets of data to memory allocated and writes information beyond this memory space. The attack allows hackers to write data in memory causing wpa_supplicant and Wi-Fi service to crash resulting in a DoS attack on affected devices. The attacker just has to send responses to Wi-Fi probe requests or P2P network Public Action messages. The attacker could exploit the flaw also to expose memory contents during the three-way handshake of a peer-to-peer network negotiation or potentially run arbitrary code on the target system.\n\nSSID information \u201cis transmitted in an element that has a 8-bit length field and potential maximum payload length of 255 octets,\u201d Malinen wrote, and the code \u201cwas not sufficiently verifying the payload length on one of the code paths using the SSID received from a peer device. This can result in copying arbitrary data from an attacker to a fixed length buffer of 32 bytes (i.e., a possible overflow of up to 223 bytes). The overflow can override a couple of variables in the struct, including a pointer that gets freed. In addition, about 150 bytes (the exact length depending on architecture) can be written beyond the end of the heap allocation.\u201d\n\nWhile the attack is very difficult to run if the target device isn\u2019t actively using P2P Wi-Fi connections, it is possible use a malicious SSIS,  \u201cevil SSID\u201d, to cause denial of service without a P2P network. The good new is the availability of a patch for the vulnerability, Google will include it for its Android system in one of the next security updates.\n\nIt is important to remark that the vulnerability in the Wi-Fi security could leave also Windows and Linux devices open to DoS attack.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  P2P, SSID)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dos", "topic_name": "DOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/p2p-ssid", "topic_name": "P2P SSID"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssis", "topic_name": "SSIS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wi-fi", "topic_name": "Wi-Fi"}]}, {"news_name": "DARPA is developing a tool do detect Android Malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35816/security/darpa-tool-android-malware-detection.html", "title": "DARPA is developing a tool do detect Android Malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 9, 2015", "body": "The blue team of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) backed up by Iowa State University researchers are developing a tool that will help with Android malware analysis.\n\nThe features used by the blue team include \u201csmells\u201d which uses stronger heuristics to understand if exits any trace of malware.

This affords greater opportunity to detect malware that is not on the radar of an automated analyzer; the what-if experimentation capability provided by the machine enables the user to posit attacker\u2019s intentions, hypothesis about the attacker\u2019s modus operandi and tailor queries to detect sophisticated malware. Thus, our approach increases automation, reduces human effort and error, and provides valuable machine assistance to detect novel and sophisticated malware.\u201d\n\nIn their tests, the team accurately detected 66 Android malicious apps (created by DARPA\u2019s red team), scoring an amazing 85.7% of detection, beating the top tools used in the market nowadays.\n\nAnother goal with the creation of this tool, was to reduce the human effort in malware detection. For me, especially this is great news, since I work in the field, and sometimes these tasks are time consuming and difficult to detect.

Attackers are then able to contact the victims\u2019 families and friends directly\u2014making for a more intimidating threat.\u201d continues TrendMicro. \n\nThe Android data stealer allows attackers to be very aggressive against their victims by accessing their personal data, intercepting and logging the incoming SMS, preventing them from receiving calls.\n\n\u201cOur investigation revealed the use of four Android data stealer families for sextortion,\u201d blogged Flores. \u201cThe malware were classified according to package name. Differences in code and functionality were seen from variant to variant, which suggests ongoing malware development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sextortion schemes we uncovered are complex operations that involve people across cultures and nations working together to effectively run a very lucrative business,\u201d\n\nThe sextortion phenomenon is rapidly expanding all over the world, even if the TrendMicro\u2019s report focuses on crimes occurred in East Asia, there are many other cases of sextortion in Canada and US.\n\n\u201cThese once again prove that cybercriminals are not just becoming more technologically advanced\u2014 creating stealthier mobile data stealers, using complex stolen data drop zone infrastructures, and outsmarting banks to better evade detection\u2014they are also improving their social engineering tactics, specifically targeting those who would be most vulnerable because of their culture.\u201d\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  sextortion,   TrendMicro)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Instagram API could be exploited to serve malicious links", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35281/hacking/instagram-api-rfd-flaw.html", "title": "Instagram API could be exploited to serve malicious links\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 25, 2015", "body": "The security researcher David Sopas from WebSegura has discovered a serious vulnerability in the Instagram API that could be exploited by hackers to post a link to a web resource they manage. By exploiting a reflected filename download bug, the attacker can post a link that points to a malicious file that once downloaded by the user appears to come from a legitimate Instagram domain without raising suspicion.\n\nThe reflected filename download bug resides in the public API for the Instagram service, Sopas demonstrated that manipulating the access token from any user\u2019s account and using some other tricks, he could create a malicious file download link that seems to refer a legitimate resource hosted on the Instagram domain.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis time I found a RFD on Instagram API. No need to add any command on the URL because we will use a persistent reflected field to do that. Like \u201cBio\u201d field on the user account. What we need? A token. No worries we just need to register a new user to get one,\u201d explained Sopas in post. \u201cNext step: Insert the batch command we want to use in the user account Bio field [and maybe others]. I\u2019ll try to open a Chrome new window with a malicious page disabling most the protections from this browser.\u201d\n\nIn order to build the \u201cReflected part\u201d, Sopas inserted a batch command in the user account Bio field, explaining that probably other fields could be exploited for the same purpose.

Once decrypted the traffic a threat actor can steal sensitive information or launch an attack by injecting malicious code.\n\nYesterday OpenSSL Team announced the presence of another critical vulnerability in the library that will be fixed with by a new update anticipated with an official advisory.

The principal problems discovered were the exposure of sensitive data, suspicious security actions and anomalous application management (installing/unistalling mobile apps), device monitoring.\n\nExperts at Veracode discovered the following problems related to the 14,000 unsafe applications discovered:\n\n\u201cThe findings demonstrate that enterprises typically have lots of unsafe applications installed on their employees\u2019 devices. For example, an application is deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d if it has access to SIM card data such as geo-location, call history, SMS message logs and device IDs, or if it sends sensitive information to suspicious overseas locations for no apparent reason.\u201d said Phil Neray, VP of Enterprise Security Strategy at Veracode.\n\nAs correctly Neray highlight, the presence of unsafe applications on mobile devices exposes company data to serious risk of data breach. Attacker could take advantage of such applications to run targeted attacks against enterprises.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many ways in which cyberattackers can leverage risky apps. For example, they can be used to spy on employees with access to confidential information \u2014 by tracking the employee\u2019s location, recording their phone calls and developing a profile of their social connections \u2014 in order to steal corporate intellectual property or profit from trading on insider information. They can also be used to steal banking credentials or insert aggressive adware. And nation-states can use them to track high-profile individuals,\u201d Neray added.\n\nThe problem of security for mobile devices is serious, the number of attacks targeting these infrastructures is constantly increasing, cyber criminals and state-sponsored hackers represents a serious menace for mobile users. Insecure applications represent an entry point for attackers and the presence of so large number of vulnerable apps in enterprises enlarges in significant way the surface of attack of the organizations.\n\n\u201cThrough 2015, more than 75 percent of mobile applications will fail basic security tests.\u201d reported Gartner.\n\nThe data collected by Veracode give a disconcerting picture of actual security mobile security landscape.

According to top-secret documents disclosed by The Intercept a team of researchers working with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has conducted a multi-year espionage campaign to break overwhelm the security mechanisms implemented by Apple for its mobile devices, iPhones and iPads. The effort is aligned with the secret U.S. government program to analyze \u201csecure communications products, both foreign and domestic\u201d in order to \u201cdevelop exploitation capabilities against the authentication and encryption schemes,\u201d according to the 2013 Congressional Budget Justification \u201cBlack Budget.\u201d\n\nThe Intercept revealed the \u201cAnalysis of Target Systems Project\u201d that was conducted to produce \u201cprototype capabilities\u201d for the intelligence community, enabled \u201cthe defeat of strong commercial data security systems\u201d and developed ways \u201cto exploit emerging information systems and technologies\u201d. The project received $35 million in funding in 2012, among the project\u2019s missions:\n\n \n\n\n\nThe documents reveal that the experts presented the results of their effort at a secret annual gathering, called the \u201cJamboree,\u201d where attendees discussed methods for exploiting security vulnerabilities in household and commercial electronics.\n\n\u201cTHE DOCUMENTS do not address how successful the targeting of Apple\u2019s encryption mechanisms have been, nor do they provide any detail about the specific use of such exploits by U.S. intelligence. But they do shed light on an ongoing campaign aimed at defeating the tech giant\u2019s efforts to secure its products, and in turn, its customers\u2019 private data.\u201d states The Intercept.\n\nThe Jamboree was held at a Lockheed Martin facility in northern Virginia, the choice of the site is not surprising if we consider the strict relationship of the company with the US Government, more than 80 percent of its total revenue comes from the government of Washington.\n\nOf course the CIA declined to comment the information disclosed by the news agency.\n\nJamboree conference is an annual appointment for the US Intelligence where the researchers presented the hacking techniques they developed to compromise security of a wide range of devices, including Apple systems.\n\n\u201cBy targeting essential security keys used to encrypt data stored on Apple\u2019s devices, the researchers have sought to thwart the company\u2019s attempts to provide mobile security to hundreds of millions of Apple customers across the globe. Studying both \u201cphysical\u201d and \u201cnon-invasive\u201d techniques, U.S. government-sponsored research has been aimed at discovering ways to decrypt and ultimately penetrate Apple\u2019s encrypted firmware. This could enable spies to plant malicious code on Apple devices and seek out potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the iPhone and iPad currently masked by encryption.\u201d continues The Intercept.\n\nAmong the several methods presented by the researchers there is a modified version of Apple software development tool, Xcode, which could be used to insert \u201csurveillance backdoor\u201d into any apps developed with it.\n\n\u201cThe modified version of Xcode, the researchers claimed, could enable spies to steal passwords and grab messages on infected devices. Researchers also claimed the modified Xcode could \u201cforce all iOS applications to send embedded data to a listening post.\u201d It remains unclear how intelligence agencies would get developers to use the poisoned version of Xcode.\u201d\n\nAgain, the experts succeeded in the modification of the OS X updater to deliver \u201ckeylogger\u201d software. The experts working for the CIA have targeted also other platforms and application, for example the Microsoft\u2019s BitLocker encryption system.\n\nThe US law enforcement recently confirmed their concerns related to the encryption introduced by Google and Apple on their devices, in September 2014 FBI Director James Comey declared that he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the decision of the IT giants to implement data encryption by default on their Smartphones.\n\nUS and British intelligence agencies worked closely to break encryption and other defense mechanisms implemented by Apple to protect its devices. In 2010, hackers from the sgencied developed surveillance software targeting iPhones, Android devices and Nokia\u2019s Symbian phones, documents leaked by Snowden revealed the existence of an implantable malware on iPhones as part of WARRIOR PRIDE, a GCHQ framework for secretly accessing private communications on mobile devices.\n\n\u201cA WARRIOR PRIDE plugin called NOSEY SMURF allowed spies to remotely and secretly activate a phone\u2019s microphone. Another plugin, DREAMY SMURF, allowed intelligence agents to manage the power system on a phone and thus avoid detection. PARANOID SMURF was designed to conceal the malware in other ways. TRACKER SMURF allowed ultra-precise geolocating of an individual phone. \u201c[If] its [sic] on the phone, we can get it,\u201d the spies boasted in a secret GCHQ document describing the targeting of the iPhone.\u201d continues The Intercept.\n\nEarly 2014, the Der Spiegel magazine published a post describing how the US National Security Agency is able to control every data managed by iPhone through a spyware codenamed DROPOUTJEEP developed by ANT (Advanced or Access Network Technology).\n\nI\u2019m not surprised by the effort spent by Intelligence agencies in order to break security of major IT vendors, however, we must consider that this kind of activities could advantage foreign governments and cyber espionage operation. By inserting a backdoor is a commercial product means to expose its final users to a series of attacks, also operated by foreign hackers \u2026 are we ready to defeat them?\n\nEnjoy the report!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Apple, iphone, NSA)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gchq", "topic_name": "GCHQ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ipad", "topic_name": "iPad"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iphone", "topic_name": "iPhone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tao", "topic_name": "TAO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-intercept", "topic_name": "The Intercept"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warrior-pride", "topic_name": "WARRIOR PRIDE"}]}, {"news_name": "Xiaomi Mi 4 smartphone with preinstalled malware and much more", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/34583/hacking/xiaomi-mi-4-preinstalled-malware.html", "title": "Xiaomi Mi 4 smartphone with preinstalled malware and much more\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 8, 2015", "body": "After the episode of Lenovo pre-installed malware, another case is worrying the IT community.

According to McAfee Labs Threat Report: February 2015, the experts verified that 18 of the 25 most popular vulnerable apps fail to protect the transmission of users\u2019 credentials.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we dynamically tested the top 25 downloaded mobile apps that had been identified as vulnerable by CERT in September to ensure that usernames and passwords are no longer visible as a result of improper verification of SSL certificates,\u201d read a report issued by McAfee. \u201cTo our surprise, even though CERT notified the developers months ago, 18 of the 25 most downloaded vulnerable apps that send credentials via insecure connections are still vulnerable to MITM attacks.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report cites as an example a mobile photo editor, with a number of downloads between 100 million and 500 million, that is still vulnerable to MITM attacks despite the CERT reported the security issues to its development team.\n\n\u201cThe most downloaded vulnerable app in this group is a mobile photo editor with between 100 million and 500 million downloads,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThe app allows users to share photos on several social networks and cloud services. In late January, McAfee Labs tested the most current version of the app downloaded from Google Play using CERT Tapioca; we were able to intercept the app\u2019s username and password credentials entered to log into the cloud service to share and publish photos.\u201d\n\nMcAfee highlights that mobile devices are wide adopted also in the workplace so their security is an important component of the security policy of any enterprise.\n\n\u201cMobile devices have become essential tools for home to enterprises users as we increasing live our lives through these devices and the applications created to run on them,\u201d explained Vincent Weafer, senior vice president of McAfee Labs. \u201cDigital trust is an imperative for us to truly engage with and benefit from the functionality they can provide. Mobile app developers must take greater responsibility for ensuring that their applications follow the secure programming practices and vulnerability responses developed over the past decade, and by doing so provide the level of protection required for us to trust our digital lives with them.\u201d\n\nThe McAfee Labs Threat Report also confirmed a significant increase in the number of mobile malware samples, which increased 14 percent during the fourth quarter of 2014. Another element of interest is the geographic distribution of infections, the highest rates were observed in Asia and Africa. The experts at McAfee revealed that at least eight percent of all McAfee-monitored mobile systems reported an infection in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nThe Threat Report also identified in the Angler exploit kit, the primary vector used by criminal ecosystem to deliver malicious payloads. After the arrest of the Blacole exploit kit\u2019s author in 2013, criminal crews started to use the Angler exploit kit.\n\n\n\n\u201cAn exploit kit is an off-the-shelf software package containing easy-to-use attacks against known and unknown vulnerabilities. Very quickly after the arrest of the Blacole exploit kit\u2019s creator in 2013, cybercriminals migrated to the Angler exploit kit to deliver their payloads. Because Angler is simple to use and widely available through online dark markets, it has become a preferred method to transport malware\u201d states the report.\n\nLet\u2019s close this rapid reading of the McAfee Labs Threat Report with a mention to Potentially Unwanted Programs(PUPs), which are applications that could be used for both legitimate and malicious uses.\n\n\u201cPotentially unwanted programs (PUPs) live in the world between nuisance and malicious malware but are becoming more and more aggressive.\u201d\n\nEnjoy the reading of this interesting report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Mobile, McAfee Labs Threat Report: February 2015)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/angler", "topic_name": "Angler"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/exploit-kit", "topic_name": "exploit kit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mcafee", "topic_name": "McAfee"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mcafee-labs-threat-report", "topic_name": "McAfee Labs Threat Report"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-apps", "topic_name": "mobile apps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pup", "topic_name": "PUP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/underground", "topic_name": "underground"}]}, {"news_name": "PowerSpy \u2013 How to spy on mobile users by monitoring the power supply", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33934/hacking/powerspy-spy-on-mobile.html", "title": "PowerSpy \u2013 How to spy on mobile users by monitoring the power supply\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 22, 2015", "body": "A group of researchers at Stanford University and the Israeli defense company Rafael has discovered a way to track mobile devices by analyzing the power supply. The experts have proposed a technique dubbed PowerSpy to track mobile users by the analysis of power consumption, the method seems to have up to 90 percent accuracy.\n\nAn important element to consider is that data related to the power supply, unlike GPS or Wi-Fi location tracking, is freely available to any mobile app that users install on the smartphone and doesn\u2019t need the user\u2019s permission to access it.\n\nThe PowerSpy technique could allow to gather information related to the location of Android phones by simply tracking how much power has been used over a certain time.\n\nThe power consumption depends on a several factors, including the environment that surround the device. For example, the presence of physical objects such as mountains or buildings has a significant impact on the amount of battery needed for signal transmissions and reception.\n\nThe presence of obstacles interferes with signals and cause temporary \u2018power drains\u2019 on the devices.\n\n\u201cA sufficiently long power measurement (several minutes) enables the learning algorithm to \u2018see\u2019 through the noise,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cWe show that measuring the phone\u2019s aggregate power consumption over time completely reveals the phone\u2019s location and movement.\u201d\n\nIn their test sessions, the researchers collected data from mobile devices as they drove around the Bay Area in California and the Israeli city of Haifa. The experts have recorded the power consumption of an LG Nexus 4 handset as it repeatedly traveled through specific routes choses for the experiment. By adopting the PowerSpy technique, the researchers were able to identify the target path with 90 percent accuracy.\n\n\u201cIf you take the same ride a couple of times, you\u2019ll see a very clear signal profile and power profile,\u201d says Yan Michalevsky, one of the researchers from Stanford. \u201cWe show that those similarities are enough to recognize among several possible routes that you\u2019re taking this route or that one, that you drove from Uptown to Downtown, for instance, and not from Uptown to Queens.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow to implement PowerSpy technique in a real scenario?\n\nThreat actors may use a specific app to implements the PowerSpy technique as explained by Yan Michalevski.\n\n\u201cYou could install an application like Angry Birds that communicates over the network but doesn\u2019t ask for any location permissions,\u201d says Michalevski.  \u201cIt gathers information and sends it back to me to track you in real time, to understand what routes you\u2019ve taken when you drove your car or to know exactly where you are on the route. And it does it all just by reading power consumption.\u201d\n\nAccording to the researchers, the PowerSpy technique is very effective to spy on mobile devices that have installed only a few number of apps because their interference with the power used by smartphone is limited respect mobile devices with a greated number of apps because they would use power unpredictably.\n\nWhat can users do to stop it? Basically, nothing aside from not using the phone. With certain apps, such as Instagram or Facebook, the user is asked whether they want to provide their current geo-location. However, the data from the power supply on a phone is freely available. Michalevsky says this is a problem that Google needs to address.\n\nEnjoy the study\n\nPowerSpy: Location Tracking using Mobile Device Power Analysis\n\n\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  mobile phone tracking, PowerSpy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-app", "topic_name": "mobile app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-phone", "topic_name": "mobile phone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/powerspy", "topic_name": "PowerSpy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "\u201cTNT\u201d gang has released a new hardware TDoS tool in the criminal underground", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33867/cyber-crime/tnt-gang-released-tdos-tool.html", "title": "\u201cTNT\u201d gang has released a new hardware TDoS tool in the criminal underground\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 20, 2015", "body": "The IntelCrawler cyber threat intelligence company has discovered a new advanced tool, dubbed \u2018TNT Instant Up\u2019, for Telephone Denial of Service attacks (TDoS). TDoS is a common practice in the criminal underground, it consists in flooding of unwanted, malicious inbound calls on a targeted system.\n\nThe calls are usually into a contact center or other part of an enterprise, which depends heavily on voice service. Examples are financial contact centers, Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and emergency rooms in hospitals, and public services such as 911. The intent of the attacker is disruption or financial gain through extortion.\n\nThe bad actors use these tools for online-banking frauds or targeted cyber attacks against banking customer services, the intent is to prevent their systems from receiving legitimate calls.\n\nLast summer, the FBI reported that hackers run several TDoS attacks against companies operating in the Healthcare and Public Health Sector. At least one instance has been reported where the 9-1-1 Public Safety Access Point (PSAP) was disabled.\n\nIn 2013, the law enforcement issued a warning to emergency services call centers to be wary of telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) attacks. Unfortunately, bad actors interested in the TDoS tools are different, such kind of tools could be used as part of attacks and scams, organized by criminal groups, hacktivists and state-sponsored hackers.\n\nThe news TDoS tool is designed by a criminal crew from Eastern Europe called \u201cTNT\u201d, the tool was presented several days ago (February 18th 2015) in underground communities.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cTNT Instant Up\u201d tool is a dedicated hardware that could be used by crooks to run TDoS attack, it consists of up to 12 connected Wireless USB 3G/4G modems. The TDoS tool runs a special software that allows attackers to hammer victims with continuous calls from inserted unlocked SIM-cards (GSM flood).\n\n\u201cThe tool, called \u201cTNT Instant Up\u201d, is designed as a special hardware platform, consisting of several connected Wireless USB 3G/4G modems (up to 12 devices). Special software allows the tool to perform continuous calls from inserted unlocked SIM-cards (GSM flood) and leverages various SIP providers (SIP flood), loyal to such kind of harmful activity. \u201d states the blog post published by IntelCrawler.\n\nTNT Instant Up tool supports Caller ID spoofing and includes a special \u201cService 500 Error\u201d bypass, using multiple call forwarding. In a video POC that is circulationg among the underground communities, the TNT group shows TDoS attack against several demo victims, the TNT Instant Up allows them to conduct a high volume of calls from spoofed or anonymous numbers.circulationg among the underground communities, the TNT group shows TDoS attack against several demo victims, the TNT Instant Up allows them to conduct a high volume of calls from spoofed or anonymous numbers.\n\n\n\nThe pricing range for the TNT Instant Up tool is between $560 USD and $1200 USD, it depends on the options and software provided by the hackers.\n\nI have contacted experts at IntelCrawler to have more info on TDoS tools and their evolution:\n\nQ: How this tool can be used for online-banking fraud?A: This new tool compromises the text messaging systems to our smart phones\u201d, states Andrew Komarov, President and Chief Intelligence Officer of IntelCrawler. \u201cBanking texts of alerts or authorizations may not get through, allowing cyber criminals more time and opportunity to commit fraud. Q:  What is new in this tool?A: The tool developed by \u201cTNT\u201d allows to perform TDoS  against multiple targets simultaneously, supporting up to 50 victims and more from 12 connected devices.  Combination of GSM and SIP flood from multiple sources may significantly increase the level of attack. Traditionally, the bad actors used Skype-based flooders, but it absolutely depends on the number of Skype accounts with credits.\n\nAs expected, the group also offers a professional TDoS services for hire implementing the sales model known as attack-as-a-service.\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  TDoS , cybercrime) , cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tnt-instant-up", "topic_name": "TNT Instant Up"}]}, {"news_name": "Great SIM Heist \u2013 docs reveal mass cell phone hack by Five Eyes intelligence", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33852/hacking/great-sim-heist-gchq.html", "title": "Great SIM Heist \u2013 docs reveal mass cell phone hack by Five Eyes intelligence\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 20, 2015", "body": "A new report published by The Intercept reveals that the National Security Agency and the British counterpart GCHQ obtained encryption keys of the global SIM manufacturer Gemalto, but the company was totally oblivious about the operation.\n\nOnce again a document leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden reveal the invasive operation of the Intelligence, a 2010 doc confirms that by obtaining the encryption keys of the SIM card maker, the intelligence services are able to monitor a large portion of global communications over mobile devices.\n\nOnce again, the problem is that the intelligence can spy on mobile users without using a warrant or wiretap.\n\n\u201cThe breach, detailed in a secret 2010 GCHQ document, gave the surveillance agencies the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world\u2019s cellular communications, including both voice and data.\u201d reads the report published by The Intercept.\n\n\n\nThe Intelligence Agencies targeted Gemalto because it makes the chips used in mobile phones and next-generation credit cards in 85 countries and has more than 40 manufacturing facilities worldwide.

This is possible by combining the exploitation of an X-Frame-Options (XFO) vulnerability with Android WebView (Jelly Bean) flaw.\n\nThe flaw affects mobile devices running Android version 4.3 Jelly Bean and earlier versions, also devices running third party browsers are vulnerable.\n\n\n\nThe researcher reported that the web browser in Android 4.3 and prior versions are vulnerable to a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) attack, meanwhile the Google Play Store is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw.\n\nIn the UXSS attack scenario, hackers exploit client-side vulnerabilities affecting a web browser or browser extensions to run a XSS attack, which allows the execution of malicious code bypassing security protection mechanisms in the web browser.\n\n\u201cUsers of these platforms may also have installed vulnerable aftermarket browsers,\u201d Beardsley wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.\u201dOf the vulnerable population, it is expected that many users are habitually signed into Google services, such as Gmail or YouTube. These mobile platforms are the the ones most at risk. Other browsers may also be affected.\u201d \u201cUntil the Google Play store XFO [X-Frame-Options] gap is mitigated, users of these web applications who habitually sign in to their Google Account will remain vulnerable.\u201d\n\nThe expert provided the JavaScript and Ruby code that could be used get a response from the play.google.com domain without an appropriate XFO header:\n\n\u201cThis module combines two vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution on affected Android devices. First, the module exploits CVE-2014-6041, a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability present in versions of Android\u2019s open source stock browser (the AOSP Browser) prior to 4.4. Second, the Google Play store\u2019s web interface fails to enforce a X-Frame-Options: DENY header (XFO) on some error pages, and therefore, can be targeted for script injection. As a result, this leads to remote code execution through Google Play\u2019s remote installation feature, as any application available on the Google Play store can be installed and launched on the user\u2019s device.

It has been reported that the official NFL app is vulnerable to hacking, simple hacking at that.\n\nWhile no app is completely secure, app developers take time to make sure that their creations are at least hard to crack by employing relatively complex encryption. This is especially so when the app is required to communicate with an external server, as indeed all apps at some point have to.\n\nWhen communicating with an external server, an app should ideally send encrypted data which the server decrypts and executes the instruction before sending back information in encrypted form. The app then decrypts that information, making it legible for the user. According to the report, \u201d\n\n\u201cWandera\u2018s scanning technologies have discovered that after the user securely signs into the app with their NFL.com account, the app leaks their username and password in a secondary, insecure (unencrypted) API call.\u201d The report further said, \u201cThe app also leaks the user\u2019s username and e-mail address in an unencrypted cookie immediately following login and on subsequent calls by the app to nfl.com domains.\u201d\n\n\n\nEncryption is important because it allows users keep their usernames, passwords and other log-in details secure, even if their traffic is being monitored.\n\nNow, it turns out that the official NFL app does NOT send the user information to servers in encrypted form. This means that if a person is able to intercept a user\u2019s traffic, he or she can read the log-in details in plain form.\n\nThe danger with such an event is that the log-in details for the app are the same for the NFL website. The NFL website contains a lot of personal information like sex, age, postal address, TV provider, phone number, workplace, date of birth, team supported, best NFL memory, and links to social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Therefore, if a hacker was to pass on the log-in details to a phisher, the person gets exposed to a wide variety of online risks. These include identity theft, financial fraud and phishing attack on loved ones.\n\nThe more worrying aspect of this kind of security lapse and that\u2019s a massive understatement is that the log-in details that many people use on multiple websites and apps are the same. Many people use their main email as the username and one password on multiple sites. This means that should a hacker get access to their log-in details on the NFL app, they could potentially be exposed to attacks on multiple attacks. Now, if a person\u2019s primary email is hacked into, a lot of damages could be visited on him or her.\n\nSecurity experts advice NFL fans to desist from using the app until a proper solution is found. The NFL said that it had taken necessary measures by securing  the servers but the danger is still present, at least until the app is properly updated to send encrypted information.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

It has been estimated that almost five million user accounts of Verizon FiOS application at risk.\n\nThe FiOS API vulnerability  was discovered by the XDA senior software developer Randy Westergren on January 14, 2015, the expert has discovered that he was able to gain complete control of the account to access its data, including inboxes, and also acting on the owner behalf.\n\nWestergren analyzed the traffic generated by the Android version of My FiOS, which gives customers the whole lot of control their account and email, in this way he demonstrated a possible hack on the account and reported the flaw to Verizon.\n\nThe FiOS API vulnerability allows an attacker to access any account by simple manipulating user identification numbers in the web requests, the attack could give attackers the ability to read customers\u2019 messages from a their Verizon inbox.\n\n\n\nThe expert noticed two direct references to his username, particularly this parameter:  getEmail?format=json&uid=RWESTERGREN05\n\n\u201cAltering the uid parameter and specifying another username shouldn\u2019t have an effect, since I\u2019m logged in and my session is maintained through my cookies,\u201d Westergren wrote in an advisory. \u201cAmazingly, this was not the case.

My last test was sending an outgoing message as another user [which was] also successful,\u201d Westergren added.\n\nWestergren has also written a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the vulnerability to the Verizon team.

It was replaced in Android KitKat (4.4) with a more recent Chromium-based version of WebView, used by the popular Chrome browser.\u201d explain Bearsley in the post.\n\nSecurity community is aware that WebView in older versions of the Android mobile operating system is vulnerable, exactly one year ago Rapid 7 released the \u201cexploit/android/browser/webview_addjavascriptinterface\u201d module which allows attackers to remotely access on most Android devices.\n\nUnfortunately, about 60 percent of the mobile devices currently in use still relies on the flawed WebView and worst news is that Google is not going to fix it. Google will not develop fixes for WebView issues affecting Android prior to version 4.4 (KitKat), anyway the company will accept patches provided by the research community and will notify any new vulnerability to OEM partners.\n\n\u201cHowever, after receiving a report of a new vulnerability in pre-4.4 WebView, the incident handlers at security@android.com responded with this:\n\nIf the affected version [of WebView] is before 4.4, we generally do not develop the patches ourselves, but welcome patches with the report for consideration. Other than notifying OEMs, we will not be able to take action on any report that is affecting versions before 4.4 that are not accompanied with a patch.\u201d added Beardsley\n\nEven if Google notify a new but to the OEM, 60 percent of end users will still remain vulnerable until a patch will be distributed \u2026 and the patch management on a large scale can take a long time.\n\nIt must be also considered that different manufacturers distribute their customization of the Android OS, often they include supplementary features and third-party apps for their customers. According to data published by Google on its dashboard, despite Android 4.4 KitKat is on the market since October of 2013, 60 percent of mobile users is still exposed to risk of attack.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn terms of solid numbers, it would appear that over 930 million Android phones are now out of official Google security patch support, given the published Gartner and WSJ numbers on smartphone distribution).\u201d\n\nWe must also consider that the vendors and network providers would prefer that customers upgrade to newer devices, but rarely spend a significant effort to develop, test and deploy fixes for older mobile.\n\nI personally consider the situation concerning because Google is not able to control the entire supply chain for the updates to its Android OS exposing hundreds of millions users to security risks. Another factor that aggravates the situation, is the increasing number of cyber threat to the mobile industry and their level of sophistication.\n\nOther companies like Apple and Microsoft, in contrast, have a direct control on the distribution of the updates for their mobile operating systems.\n\nBearsley has also provided an interesting reflection on the \u201cEconomics of Upgrading\u201d, actually we have several mobile handset on the market with substantial differences in their prices. Unfortunately, the large portion of users is not able to spend much more of $100 so it has no other choice but to buy \u201clegacy\u201d Android devices.\n\n\u201cBeside the installed bases, I posit that the people who are currently exposed to pre-KitKat, pre-Chromium WebView vulnerabilities are exactly those users who are most likely to not be able to \u201cupdate to the latest version of Android\u201d to get security patches. The latest Google Nexus retails for about USD$660, while the first hit for an \u201cAndroid Phone\u201d on Amazon retails for under $70. This is a nearly ten-fold price difference, which implies two very different user bases; one market that doesn\u2019t mind dropping a few hundred dollars on a phone, and one which will not or cannot spend much more than $100. \n\nTaken together \u2014 the two-thirds majority install base of now-unsupported devices and the practical inability of that base to upgrade by replacing hardware \u2014 means that any new bug discovered in \u201clegacy\u201d Android is going to last as a mass-market exploit vector for a long, long time.\u201d said Bearsley.\n\nSecurity researchers have noticed a growing number of attacks on mobile platform and the availability online of tools and platform that are able to exploit the flaws already disclosed for Android devices.\n\nLet\u2019s hope Google will reconsider its approach for \u201clegacy\u201d Android OS \u2026 their security is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Google, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-kitkat", "topic_name": "Android KitKat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/patch-management", "topic_name": "patch management"}]}, {"news_name": "British Prime Minister wants to ban Online Messaging Apps including WhatsApp", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/32146/intelligence/uk-wants-ban-messaging-apps.html", "title": "British Prime Minister wants to ban Online Messaging Apps including WhatsApp\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 13, 2015", "body": "At this historical moment, governments are facing increasingly dangerous cyber threats, but their activities are hampered by the large diffusion of encryption mechanisms.\n\nFollowing the Snowden\u2018s revelations, several IT firms like Google and Apple are adopting encryption by design to avoid government surveillance, the same trend is observed for the principal applications, this evolution is complicating the investigations of law enforcement.\n\nThe British Government is evaluating to ban some Online Messaging Apps that could not allow law enforcement investigation, including the popular Snapchat and WhatsApp.\n\nEarly this week the Prime Minister David Cameron explained that the UK Government would pursue banning encrypted messaging services if national intelligence services were not given access to the communications.\n\nThe recent terroristic acts are increasing the fear of European Governments about the exploitation of the web for propaganda or for attack vectors, hacktivists and jihadists.

Analyzing over 10,000 user accounts, the researchers have discovered that:\n\nFacebook undergoes the most hacking attempts\n\nAmong the several online accounts monitored by the LogDog application, including Facebook, Gmail, Yahoo, Evernote, Dropbox and more, Facebook profiles received almost twice (61%) the number of hacking attempts as Gmail accounts (38%). It is interesting to note that the most common accounts users choose to monitor are Facebook and Gmail.\n\nMost severe alerts come out of the United States\n\nThe LogDog mobile app includes tracking of \u201canomaly indicators\u201d, abnormal activities related to account access. For example, if the user is located in one country and the account undergoes an entry attempt from a different location, this could generate a security alert.\n\n\u201cOur November findings indicate that 63% of the most severe alerts occurred within the United States, a much greater amount than the second highest severe alerts geography, which was India with 21% of the most severe alerts.\u201d states the report.\n\nMost hacking attempts happen on Tuesday\n\nThe average number of hacking attempts varies widely among different days of the week. In November, the majority of hacking alerts occurred on Tuesdays, summing up to 17% of the total weekly alerts. Meanwhile, Fridays enjoyed the fewest alerts, totaling only 12% of the total weekly alerts.\n\n2 Factor Authentication is rarely used\n\nThis is a bad news, only a fraction of the accounts (4.3%) adopted a two-factor authentication mechanism to protect the account.\n\nThe report includes a suggestion for the user that will be present also in the next issues. This month the suggestion is related to the Third-party apps.\n\nInsight of the month: Third-party apps can access your accounts!\n\nThird-party applications are often used by threat actors to access to their Gmail and other accounts. A large number of access alerts come in from Ashburn, Virginia, which is home to one of Amazon\u2019s larger server farms. This is also where many of the most popular apps are hosted.\n\nTip: Make sure you review app permissions carefully to understand what information and accounts your apps have access to.

The GCHQ has developed the mobile app to introduce young people to subjects like computer science, cryptography and maths.\n\n \u201cIf we\u2019re going to get the next generation of security experts, we need to be encouraging them to take up these subjects,\u201d said a spokesperson from GCHQ at the conference. \u201cBuilding maths and cyber skills in the younger generation is essential for maintaining the cyber security of the UK and growing a vibrant digital economy,\u201d Robert Hannigan, Director GCHQ, said. \u201cThat is why I am keen for GCHQ to give something back through its work with school and universities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn particular, the Cryptoy app is a colourful, interactive way for students and their teachers to explore the fascinating world of cryptography. The app was developed by GCHQ\u2019s industrial placement students and trialled at a number of science fairs. I hope it will inspire further study of this key topic, which has played such an important part in our past and is an invaluable part of our future.\u201d\n\nOf course, many skeptics have thought that the app is a surveillance tool, but the GCHQ replied that the Cryptoy app only asks for very limited permissions and is not at all a spy tool.\n\nThe Cryptoy app is available for free download on Google Play store, the iOS version is announced for release in 2015.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  GCHQ, Cryptoy mobile app)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptoy", "topic_name": "Cryptoy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/enigma", "topic_name": "Enigma"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gchq", "topic_name": "GCHQ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-app", "topic_name": "mobile app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Android malware used to spread pirated Assassin Creed App", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/31087/cyber-crime/android-malware-assassin-creed.html", "title": "Android malware used to spread pirated Assassin Creed App\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 14, 2014", "body": "Security experts at Zscaler discovered a trojanized and pirated version of the popular Assassin Creed application for Android platform.\n\nAssassin Creed is one of the most popular paid video games, available for almost every gaming platform, including Sony Playstation, Xbox, PC and mobile OSs like Android.\n\nThe Android malware disguising itself as the Assassins Creed app will install a pirated version of the game that apparently works normally, but that is able to perform malicious activities in background.\n\nOnce downloaded, the trojanized copy of the Assassin Creed application has the ability to send multipart text messages, harvest information (i.e. mobile number and Subscriber ID information) from victim devices and send stolen data to a remote command and control server, exactly as any other data stealer malware.

The vulnerability was fixed in the latest version of the Google mobile OS, the Lollipop version released earlier this week.\n\nThe vulnerability resides in java.io.ObjectInputStream that fails to check that the class of an object being deserialized is still conformed the requirements for serializations.\n\n\n\nThe flaw was discovered by the security researcher Jann Horn that reported it to Google earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis means that when ObjectInputStream is used on untrusted inputs, an attacker can cause an instance of any class with a non-private parameterless constructor to be created. All fields of that instance can be set to arbitrary values. The malicious object will then typically either be ignored or cast to a type to which it doesn\u2019t fit, implying that no methods will be called on it and no data from it will be used. However, when it is collected by the GC, the GC will call the object\u2019s finalize method,\u201d states the security advisory from Horn says.\n\n\u201cThe class android.os.BinderProxy contains a finalize method that calls into native code. This native code will then use the values of two fields of type int/long (depends on the Android version), cast them to pointers and follow them. On Android 4.4.3, this is where one of those pointers ends up. r0 contains the attacker-supplied pointer, and if the attacker can insert data into the process at a known address, he ends up gaining arbitrary code execution in system_server.\u201d\n\nAccording to the security experts is very difficult to rate the exploitability of the flaw in the Android OS.\n\nThe number of cyber attacks against Android OS based mobile devices is rapidly increasing and the presence of such vulnerabilities represents an element of concern for security experts.

Practically the exploitation of the Masque flaw allows bad actors to replace enterprise-signed apps, overwriting them with trojanized apps.\n\nThe Masque  vulnerability allows an attacker to swap out a legitimate iOS app with a malicious one, the attack scheme is effective against jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices.\n\nMasque affects iOS 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 8.1.1 beta, its attack schema is quite different from WireLurker that infects Apple mobile devices once connected via USB, but it can also be run remotely via an SMS or email message pointing a victim toward a malicious app.\n\nAlso in this case the problem seems to be caused by a poor implementation of an authentication process, the expert Tao Wei, a senior staff research scientist at FireEye, explained that Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning feature does not analyze digital certificates for apps given identical bundle identifiers.\n\nThe Enterprise provisioning service implemented by Apple allows enterprise iOS developers to develop and distribute iOS apps without having to upload the app to Apple.\n\n\u201cFireEye mobile security researchers have discovered that an iOS app installed using enterprise/ad-hoc provisioning could replace another genuine app installed through the App Store, as long as both apps used the same bundle identifier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis vulnerability exists because iOS doesn\u2019t enforce matching certificates for apps with the same bundle identifier,\u201d Tao Wei said on the company\u2019s blog post. \u201cAn attacker can leverage this vulnerability both through wireless networks and USB.\u201d \u201ciOS doesn\u2019t check certificates during updating,\u201d \u201cAttackers can replace the old app with a fake app.\u201d \u201cCurrently there is not MDM API to get the certificate information for each app,\u201d Wei said. \u201cThus, it is difficult for the MDM to detect such attacks.\u201d\n\nWei speaking about the WireLurker, explained that it is the unique case of attack up until now observed that is exploiting the Masque vulnerability. Let\u2019s remind that the WireLurker malware in a first stage infects a host (desktop or laptop), which downloaded the malicious software from the web, then it waits for an Apple device (i.e. iPhone or iPad) to be connected via USB.\n\nOnce the Apple device is connected to the infected PC, WireLurker scans it analyzing the installed applications, then if a target app is present, it copies the app from the mobile device to the host, infects it and then install it again on the mobile unit.\n\n\n\nThe blog post published by FireEye also includes a demonstration of an attack, the experts have exploited the Masque replacing a valid Gmail app downloaded from the Apple App Store with a malicious version of the same app that is able to syphon the user\u2019 messages. The attack starts with an SMS sent to the victims that invite it to download a new version of a legitimate app New Flappy Bird.\n\n\u201cIn one of our experiments, we used an in-house app with a bundle identifier \u201ccom.google.Gmail\u201d with a title \u201cNew Flappy Bird\u201d. We signed this app using an enterprise certificate. When we installed this app from a website, it replaced the original Gmail app on the phone.\u201d states the post. \u201cBy using the Masque attack, attackers can get all your existing sensitive data on your iPhone,\u201d Wei added.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe attack is very dangerous, a bad actor would be able to mimic the original app to steal user\u2019s credentials, the risk is serious if we think the possibility to compromise also signed banking apps. Experts at FireEye also explained that user\u2019s data stored in the legitimate app\u2019s directory, including local data caches, could be accessed by the malware.\n\n\u201cMasque Attacks can replace authentic apps,such as banking and email apps, using attacker\u2019s malware through the Internet. That means the attacker can steal user\u2019s banking credentials by replacing an authentic banking app with an malware that has identical UI. Surprisingly, the malware can even access the original app\u2019s local data, which wasn\u2019t removed when the original app was replaced. These data may contain cached emails, or even login-tokens which the malware can use to log into the user\u2019s account directly.\u201d\n\nThe principal problem for the security community is related to the simplicity in the exploitation of the Masque vulnerability.\n\n \u201cIt is a very powerful [vulnerability], but at the same time, it is very easy to exploit,\u201d Wei said. \u201cIt can make the enterprise provisioning attack more powerful and more coverage over the victim. It\u2019s easy to exploit and that\u2019s why we are so concerned and why we think users should be warned.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Masque, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fire-eye", "topic_name": "Fire Eye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/masque", "topic_name": "Masque"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-apps", "topic_name": "mobile apps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wirelurker", "topic_name": "WireLurker"}]}, {"news_name": "WireLurker malware is threatening Apple mobile devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30007/cyber-crime/wirelurker-malware-apple-devices.html", "title": "WireLurker malware is threatening Apple mobile devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 9, 2014", "body": "A new strain of malware dubbed WireLurker  is threatening Apple users, the malicious code is able to infect Apple iPhone and iPad syphoning user\u2019data.\n\nThe malware was discovered for the first time by experts at Palo Alto Networks that revealed it exhibited behavior that had never been seen before malware targeting Apple mobile devices.

A Research team from Ruhr University Bochum has conducted an audit on TextSecure app discovering that the mobile app is open to an Unknown Key-Share attack.\n\nTextSecure is considered one of most efficient text messaging application for mobile devices and its popularity increased after the Facebook bought WhatsApp, due to the fear of users that Intelligence agencies could have imposed to the company to give them the access to the servers.\n\n\u201cSince Facebook bought WhatsApp, instant messaging apps with security guarantees became more and more popular,\u201d \u201cWe are the first to completely and precisely document and analyze TEXTSECURE\u2019s secure push messaging protocol\u201d states the author of the audit in a paper titled, \u201cHow Secure is TextSecure?\u201c.\n\nThe research team explained a complete and precise document and analyze of TextSecure\u2019s secure push messaging protocol.\n\nAccording to the research team, TextSecure works on a the cryptographic protocol that is implemented in the CYANOGENMOD firmware, and the researchers discovered a way compromise it with a an Unknown Key-Share Attack (UKS) against the protocol.\n\n\u201cWe found an Unknown Key-Share attack against the protocol. We have documented the attack and show how it can be mitigated. The attack has been communicated with and acknowledged by the developers of TEXTSECURE.

This can be justified, for instance, by claiming to have a new device and having simply re-registered, as that requires less effort than restoring an encrypted backup of the existing key material. Now, as explained in more detail below, if Milhouse invites Bart to his birthday party, then Bart may just forward this message to Nelson who will believe that this message was actually sent from Milhouse. Thus, Milhouse (Pa) believes that he invited Bart (Pb) to his birthday party, where in fact, he invited Nelson (Pe)\u201d\n\n\n\nThe experts in the paper also recommended a mitigation strategy, that could avoid Unknown Key-Share attack against the TextSecure\u2019s users.

The malware displays fake notifications from law enforcement agencies that accuse victims of viewing and storing child pornography.\n\nSecurity experts from mobile security firm AdaptiveMobile have discovered a new variant of the mobile malware Worm.Koler that allows the malicious code to spread via SMS, sending shortened bit.ly URL.\n\n\n\nThe security firm has already observed thousands of messages from hundreds of infected phones, mainly located in the US.\n\n\u201cthe Android malware Koler, which now spreads by text message and holds infected users\u2019 phones hostage until a \u201cransom\u201d is paid.

The attack is occurring worldwide, but the majority of the infected phones are in the United States.\u201d states the blog post published by the company.\n\n\n\nThe attack scenario is very interesting, the Koler worm sends an SMS message with a bitly link stating that an account with the user\u2019s photos has been created. To spread itself, the koler worm first sends an SMS message to all contacts in the mobile\u2019s address book with a text stating:\n\n\u201cSomeone made a profile named -[the contact\u2019s name]- and he uploaded some of your photos! is that you?\u201d followed by a Bitly link.\n\nThe victim is re-directed to a DropBox folder containing a \u201cPhotoViewer\u201d app trojanized with the malware. Once installed, the maclious app locks the victim\u2019s devices requesting the payment of a fee to unlock it.\n\n\u201cOnce installed, the malware blocks the user\u2019s screen with a fake FBI page, which says the device has been locked due to pornographic or other inappropriate content. The user can \u201cwave the accusations\u201d by paying a fine using a Money Pak Voucher. This a new approach for Koler, which used to hide on pornography sites, and is now using SMS and the wording of a well-known Facebook scam to entice users to install it. \u201d states the post \u201cThe device appears to be completely locked down with the screen on the phone blocked, so the user won\u2019t be able to close the window, or deactivate the malware through the app manager,\u201d reads the blog post. \u201cThe victim is forced to buy a voucher as instructed on the blocking page, and send the voucher code to a malware author.\u201d\n\nThe experts noticed that the code of Worm.Koler is internationalized, it is able to display localized messages to victims.\n\nAs usual I strongly suggest to infected users to not pay any ransom because there is no guarantee to free the mobile from the threat. Another risky behaviour for mobile users is the enable the \u201cUnknown Sources\u201d option in Android device security settings menu. Enabling the option users can install applications from unknown sources, a behaviour that could allow malicous code download from unofficial stores to infect the device.\n\nKoler does not encrypt users\u2019s files, for this reason it is easy for users to eliminate it from infected devices.

A new technique recently disclosed, allows attackers to hide encrypted malicious Android applications inside images, the method allows threat actors to evade detection by antivirus products and according the experts potentially also the checks run by Google Play\u2019.\n\nThe new attack technique was developed by Axelle Apvrille, a security researcher at Fortinet, in collaboration with reverse engineer Ange Albertini. The researchers presented their proof-of-concept last week during the last Black Hat Europe security conference.\n\nThe methods exploit a technique designed by Albertini dubbed AngeCryption, which allow to encrypt anything into whatever we want (apart a few restrictions on input and output formats) using a Python script written by the researcher. The script receives in input the content user wishes to encrypt , the output user wishes to receive and it will calculate a specified key using AES in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode that produces the expected output file..\n\nThe script elaborates the input, \u201cwithout altering the information it contains, so that the input encrypted with the provided key and a generated initialization vector (IV) turns into the output.\u201d\n\nThe two researchers at Fortinet applied the concept to Android application packages (APKs) files, they created a proof-of-concept wrapping application that displays a PNG image of Anakin Skywalker, one of the characters of Star Wars saga. The app they developed is able to decrypt the image with a particular key in order to obtain a second Android APK file that it will install.\n\nDuring their presentation at the BlackHat, the researcher used an encrypted APK that once extracted by the principal app displays a picture of Darth Vader, in a real attack scenario the hackers could run a malicious application to control the Smartphone or to steal user\u2019s, including SMS messages, photos and contacts.\n\n\n\nDuring the presentation the Android device displayed a permission request when the wrapper application tried to install the decrypted APK file, but as explained by Apvrille this behavior is easy to avoid invoking a method called DexClassLoader.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that the malicious APK could be also downloaded from a remote server without triggering any alert due the to the encryption applied.\n\nAs explained the researchers there is anyway a condition to satisfy in order to successfully run the attack, some data needs to be appended at the end of the original application, but the APK format does not allow to append any data after a marker called the End of Central Directory (EOCD), which is a sort of end of the file.\n\nThe researcher bypassed the limitation, adding a second EOCD after the appended data, this procedure tricks Android into accepting the file as valid. It\u2019s clear that APK parser fails to correctly parse the code provided on input.\n\nThe researchers have already reported the security issue to the Android security team that is currently working on a fix. The attack works on the latest version of Android, Android 4.4.2.\n\nBecause of fragmentation in the Android ecosystem, especially when it comes to firmware updates, many devices will likely remain vulnerable to this attack for a long time, giving Android malware authors ample time to take advantage of it.\n\nThe researchers speculated that the vulnerability will probably remain active for a long time on many devices because the fragmentation in the Android ecosystem and different patch management of various vendors.\n\nThe proof-of-concept code used during the presentation is available on Github.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APK, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/aes-dalvik-pdf", "topic_name": "AES Dalvik PDF"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/albertini", "topic_name": "Albertini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apk", "topic_name": "APK"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackhat", "topic_name": "Blackhat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cbc", "topic_name": "CBC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/insomnihack-ange", "topic_name": "Insomni'Hack Ange"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "Millions Android Cyanogenmod users exposed to MitM attacks due to Code re-use", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29248/mobile-2/android-cyanogenmod-zero-day.html", "title": "Millions Android Cyanogenmod users exposed to MitM attacks due to Code re-use\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 15, 2014", "body": "Security experts always discourage jailbreaking and rooting of mobile devices due to the risk related to the installation of not authorized applications that could hide malware and serious bugs.\n\nAt the Ruxcon Security Conference in Australia, an unnamed security researcher revealed that CyanogenMod developers \u201ccopy-pasted\u201d Oracle\u2019s \u201csample code for Java 1.5\u201d could exposed Android devices with CyanogenMod at risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

Unfortunately, also the last version CM 11.0 M11 that was released October 8th hasn\u2019t fixed the flaw and CyanogenMod hasn\u2019t provided a reply on the  yet to respond to the zero-day allegation.\n\nThe experts consider this vulnerability critical due to the large number of CyanogenMod installations worldwide, which according the official statistics are more than 10 million as of December 2013.\n\n\n\nCode re-use is a very common practice within development community, but in many cases it could act as vector for old vulnerability due to not accurate repackaging of source code.\n\n\u201cI was looking at HTTP component code and I was thinking I had seen this code before,\u201d the researcher said. \u201cThey just copy-pasted the sample code and that\u2019s what was vulnerable. \u201cI checked on GitHub and found out a tonne of others were using it.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s wait for the reply of CyanogenMod.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  CyanogenMod, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certificate-pinning", "topic_name": "Certificate Pinning"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyanogenmod", "topic_name": "CyanogenMod"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-middle", "topic_name": "man-in-the-middle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl", "topic_name": "SSL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "The Snappening, hundreds of thousands pictures leaked", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29120/cyber-crime/snappening-pictures-leaked.html", "title": "The Snappening, hundreds of thousands pictures leaked\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 11, 2014", "body": "The Fappening is considered my mass media one of most interesting case of privacy violation, four archives containing a numerous celebrities nude photos have been released in the last weeks \u2026 and many experts sustain that the disclosure is still non ended.\n\nA new privacy scandal is crowding the page of many websites, tens of thousands of private photographs and videos of common people are circulating over the Internet.\n\nThis time the pictures seems to have a different origin, experts believe that the personal photos were stolen from Snapchat application, for this reason the new case is dubbed The Snappening.\n\nThe popular messaging service that allows users to send pictures that should disappear after a few seconds, under the name The Snappening someone has leaked on the 4chan service the images of common people.\n\nThe data breach was caused by an alleged violation in an unofficial third-party app for Snapchat.

The student at Stanford, Andrew Aude discovered a still unreleased feature of Facebook Messenger by using the iOS and Mac OS X hacking tool Cycript.\n\nIn reality the presence of payments feature in Facebook Messenger code was first discovered by another security researcher, Jonathan Zdziarski a few weeks ago.\n\nThe youngster disclosed its discovery on Twitter last Saturday, he posted screenshots of the payment functionalities implemented by the IT giant for its Facebook Messenger. Aude explained that Facebook Messenger users will be able to pay in the same users of Square\u2019s Cash app allows users to send money with their debit card via their mobile phone.\n\n\u201cThe messenger\u2019s payment option lets users send money in a message similar to how they can send a photo. Users can add a debit card in Messenger, or use one they already have on file with Facebook. An in-app pincode also exists for added security around payments. It\u2019s unclear whether Facebook will monetize Messenger by charging a small fee for money transfers, or offer the functionality for free to drive usage of its standalone chat app.\u201d states a blog post from Techcrunch.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of payments capabilities into Facebook\u2019s messaging app has been anticipated many times, but no one has never demonstrated their existence. IT experts sustain that a Facebook has boosted the design of the new feature  hiring the former PayPal president David Marcus back in June.\n\nAude conducted various tests on the feature uncovered, he confirmed that was only able to get debit cards to work with the system, in time he made the tests banks accounts and credit cards were not accepted for the payments.\n\n \u201cBased on my understanding of the debit interchange rates, each transaction will cost Facebook roughly $0.40 to $0.50 (Durbin swipe fee + ACH fee),\u201d Aude told the site. \u201d The app didn\u2019t mention a fee to send, so it\u2019s probably free, at least initially. Over time they might add a $1 fee.\u201d\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Facebook will provide the service free of charges to stimulate the use of its Facebook Messenger app instead its competitors like Apple iMessage, Tencent\u2019s WeChat and Google Hangouts.\n\nAude also discovered a note in the code that indicates the functionality will initially only allow one-to-one transactions.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, we will only support single payment attachment,\u201d reads the note in the code discovered by Aude. \u201cMultiple payment attachments will be supported in the future\u201d\n\nAude, who says he believes the feature might be rolled out in the next few months, also found another note in the code that indicates the feature will initially only allow one-to-one transactions.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, we will only support single payment attachment,\u201d reads the note in the code discovered by Aude. \u201cMultiple payment attachments will be supported in the future.\u201d\n\nAude highlighted the simplicity of the payment process developed by Facebook engineer, users can authorize a payment simply pushing on a button, then enter the amount to transfer, and send it.

Apple was criticized for the way its security experts managed the flaw in iCloud file storage service that, according to multiple sources, was exploited by hackers to steal nude photos of celebrities. The company has announced and implemented a series of security improvements to protect the users\u2019 privacy with the new version of mobile operating system, iOS 8.0.1, including data encryption by default and two-factor authentication for the iCloud service.\n\nBut it would seem that the problems for Apple have not even finished with the launch of the new iOS 8 system, because experts discovered a new critical bug in the new mobile OS. The new critical vulnerability discovered in iOS 8.0.1 seems to be deleting data stored in the cloud without the user\u2019s permission. The bug was first disclosed by MacRumors in a post titled \u201cBug in iOS 8\u2019s \u2018Reset All Settings\u2019 Option Also Erases iCloud Drive Documents\u201c, which reported the alert issued by many members of the popular forum.\n\n\u201cIt appears that there may be a serious bug with the \u201cReset All Settings\u201d option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums, using the \u201cReset All Settings\u201d option under General \u2013> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive. \u201d states the post.\n\nThe \u201cReset All Settings,\u201d option is typically used to reset user\u2019s network settings, but it seems that the functionality also deleting all user\u2019s files from iCloud Drive. The effect is not intentional as reported under the General category in Settings for iOS 8, the Reset All Settings option is supposed to reset iOS device settings while retaining user\u2019s data and media, as the option explicitly states that \u201cNo data or media will be deleted.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany users experienced the inconvenience, their documents were wiped out after users press the Reset All Settings button. According to the forum members, the problem is related to documents from iWork apps, such as Pages, Numbers and Keynote.\n\n\u201cIn our own testing, using \u201cReset All Settings\u201d deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.\u201d reported MacRumors as result of its test in the flaw.\n\nWaiting for the fix from Apple, iOS 8 users are advised to avoid the use of the \u201cReset All Settings\u201d option  feature.\n\n\u201cUsers who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the \u201cReset All Settings\u201d option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive.\u201d closes the post on MacRumors.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 iCloud , Reset All Settings)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios-8", "topic_name": "iOS 8"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/macrumors", "topic_name": "MacRumors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy-icloud", "topic_name": "privacy. iCloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/two-factor-authentication", "topic_name": "two-factor authentication"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI concerned about encryption by default for Smartphones", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28654/mobile-2/fbi-concerned-data-encrypion.html", "title": "FBI concerned about encryption by default for Smartphones\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 27, 2014", "body": "The FBI is concerned about the improvements made by Apple and Google for their solutions to defend the security and privacy of the users. The companies have implemented encryption by default on smartphones, the choice is pushed by the need of privacy manifested by the market to protect users from surveillance activities operated by governments on a global scale.\n\nA few days ago Google announced it would adopt data encryption by default in the next version of the Android OS L. Apple, similarly, allows data encryption for iOS based devices starting from the iOS 8 version.\n\nAccording to the FBI\u2019s director James Comey, law enforcement will face many more problems to access smartphone for investigation with serious repercussions on the results of investigations.\n\n\n\nComey expressed his concern on the choice of mobile device vendors in designing \u201csomething expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will come a day \u2013 well it comes every day in this business \u2013 when it will matter a great, great deal to the lives of people of all kinds that we be able to with judicial authorization gain access to a kidnapper\u2019s or a terrorist or a criminal\u2019s device,\u201d Comey told reporters.\n\n\u201cI just want to make sure we have a good conversation in this country before that day comes.

Encrypting a phone doesn\u2019t make it any harder to tap, or \u201clawfully intercept\u201d calls. But it does limit law enforcement\u2019s access to a data, contacts, photos and email stored on the phone itself.\n\nThat kind information can help law enforcement officials solve big cases quickly. For example, criminals sometimes avoid phone interception by communicating plans via Snapchat or video. Their phones contain contacts, texts, and geo-tagged data that can help police track down accomplices. These new rules will make it impossible for us to access that information. They will create needless delays that could cost victims their lives.*\u201d states Hosko in the blog post.\u201c\n\nThe analysis of mobile devices is a crucial activity in the investigation ordinarily conducted by law enforcement, Apple and Android enabling the data encryption by default will advantage criminals.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s and Android\u2019s new protections will protect many thousands of criminals who seek to do us great harm, physically or financially. They will protect those who desperately need to be stopped from lawful, authorized, and entirely necessary safety and security efforts. And they will make it impossible for police to access crucial information, even with a warrant.\u201d\n\nBoth Apple and Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comments on Comey\u2019s concerns, but it is sure that companies will maintain their position, ignoring law enforcement requests.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 FBI, Google, Apple)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "The iPhone 6 Touch ID fingerprint reader is still vulnerable to hack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28593/hacking/iphone-6-touch-id-hack.html", "title": "The iPhone 6 Touch ID fingerprint reader is still vulnerable to hack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 24, 2014", "body": "A few days ago we discussed about the availability on the Internet of the exploit for iOS 7.x based devices, due to the diffusion of Apple Smartphones and tablets the security issued attracted the attention of the media as already occurred in the past for other flaws. One of the most debated security issue is related to the Touch ID fingerprint reader that appeared flawed for the iPhone 5S. My readers remember that exactly one year ago the Chaos Computer Club claimed to have bypassed the biometric security technology designed by Apple simply by making a copy of a fingerprint photographed on a glass surface.\n\n\n\nNow Apple has released the new iPhone 6, a jewel rich of improvements, especially under the security perspective, but experts have discovered that Apple Touch ID still vulnerable to hack.\n\nMarc Rogers, chief security researcher at Lookout Mobile Security, discovered that the Touch ID fingerprint reader on the new iPhone 6 can be fooled by the same trick that was working with iPhone 5S.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people need to worry just yet, but there are distinct flaws that could lead to problems down the line,\u201d \u201cSadly there has been little in the way of measurable improvement in the sensor between these two devices,\u201d Rogers wrote in a blog post. \u201cFake fingerprints created using my previous technique were able to readily fool both devices.\u201d\n\nIn time I\u2019m writing Apple still hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment to the researcher. Technically Rogers used fingers coated in a gummy substance like Elmer\u2019s glue to lift and replicate fingerprints.\n\n\u201cI used a technique demonstrated by Tsutomu Matsumoto in his 2002 paper \u201cThe Impact of Artificial \u201cGummy\u201d Fingers on Fingerprint Systems\u201d. In this technique, you take the cleaned print image and without inverting it, print it to transparency film. Next, you take the transparency film and use it to expose some thick copper clad photosensitive PCB board that\u2019s commonly used in amateur electrical projects. After developing the image on the PCB using special chemicals, you put the PCB through a process called \u201cetching\u201d which washes away all of the exposed copper leaving behind a fingerprint mold. Smear glue over this and when it dries, you have a fake fingerprint.\u201d explained in a previous post describing the hack on iPhone 5s.\n\nThe impact of the flaw could be serious considering that Touch ID is the authentication system adopted by Apple for Apple Pay, a system implemented starting from the latest iPhone 6 and based on new near-field communication chip and credit card management software with Touch ID to allow people carry out mobile payments by tapping their device with an NFC reader and confirming the purchase with their fingerprint. Touch ID is a key component for the overall payment architecture, it was used with the purpose to make attractive to consumers the new payment method\n\nRogers explained that the sensor has been improved since its previous version but that anyway if fails the fingerprint validation.\n\n\u201cAnother sign that the sensor may have improved is the fact that slightly \u201cdodgy\u201d fake fingerprints that fooled the iPhone 5S did not fool the iPhone 6. To fool the iPhone 6 you need to make sure your fingerprint clone is clear, correctly proportioned, correctly positioned, and thick enough to prevent your real fingerprint coming through to confuse it.\u201d said Rogers.\n\nRogers hasn\u2019t demonized the Touch ID, he considers it an effective security control that is anyway that is underused with unique usage for unlock of the phone.\n\nAnyway Rogers remarks that since the system involves credit cards it would be better protected by Touch ID and a second authentication factor.\n\nLet\u2019s wait for Apple reply.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 iOS6, Touch ID)\n\n \n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "iOS 7_1 exploit for CVE-2014-4377 critical flaw publicly available", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28561/hacking/ios-7_1-exploit-cve-2014-4377.html", "title": "iOS 7_1 exploit for CVE-2014-4377 critical flaw publicly available\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 23, 2014", "body": "Security experts at Binamuse firm have discovered the availability online of the exploit kit which targets the vulnerability coded CVE-2014-4377, a memory corruption issue in iOS\u2019s core graphics library. The exploitation of CVE-2014-4377 could allow a threat actor to deliver a malformed PDF through the Safari Browser and get victim to execute an arbitrary code which allow the attacker to gain complete control of the victim\u2019s device.\n\nThe list of devices potentially affected by the CVE-2014-4377 flaw is long, iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch that are still running iOS 7.1.x or its jail broken are affected by the vulnerability. The vulnerability also affects Apple TV version below 7.\n\nUnfortunately the exploit for the CVE-2014-4377 vulnerability was publicly disclosed on Github by a user called Feliam recently.  This exploit makes the devices running on iOS 7.1.x vulnerable to potential hackers. Safari browser accepts PDF files as native image format for the < image > html tag, this means that visiting an html page in Safari can load multiple pdf files without the user being aware of it.\n\n\n\nThe problem resides in the CoreGraphics framework  which fails to correctly parse the PDF files.\n\nThe Apple Core Graphics framework doesn\u2019t validate correctly the input when parsing the colorspace specification of a PDF XObject. Providing a specifically crafted input, it is possible to cause the overflow of a small heap memory and an attacker could exploit it to run an arbitrary code in the context of Mobile Safari.\n\n\u201cApple CoreGraphics library fails to validate the input when parsing the colorspace specification of a PDF XObject resulting in a heap overflow condition. A small heap memory allocation can be overflowed with controlled data from the input in any application linked with the affected framework. Using a crafted PDF file as an HTML image and combined with a information leakage vulnerability this issue leads to arbitrary code execution. \u201d reports a blog post published by Binamuse firm.\n\nExperts at Binamuse have published a complete PoC on their website confirming that a demo will be soon available.\n\nThe author of the post claims that the exploit is \u201ccompletely reliable and portable on iOS 7.1.x\u201d, but other experts have a different opinion.  A poster, Larry Selter said that,\n\n\u201cFrom the exploit page: \u201cThis exploit needs a companion information leakage vulnerability to bypass ASLR, DEP and Code signing iOS exploit mitigations.\u201d Sounds like it\u2019s not functional out of the box.\u201d is the comment of a user on the InfoSec Community Forums.\n\nApple has immediately confirmed the presence of the flaw and the efficiency of the exploit only for the Apple TV. The company published on the support page of Apple TV 7 a post on the security issued and urged users to upgrade to latest version of the operating system as soon as possible.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 iOS, CVE-2014-4377)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/appletv", "topic_name": "AppleTV"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2014-4377", "topic_name": "CVE-2014-4377"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios8", "topic_name": "iOS8"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ipad", "topic_name": "iPad"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ipod", "topic_name": "iPod"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierlugi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierlugi Paganini"}]}, {"news_name": "Windseeker spyware app implements advanced injection and hooking techniques", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28534/malware/windseeker-spyware-app.html", "title": "Windseeker spyware app implements advanced injection and hooking techniques\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 22, 2014", "body": "Windseeker is a malicious Android app which attracted experts at Lacoon Mobile Security, the principal characteristics of the app are its injection and hooking techniques used to spy on mobile users.\n\nThe techniques are rare in the mobile ecosystem, Windseeker runs on rooted Android devices and allows attackers to spy on popular instant messaging apps in China, WeChat and QQ.\n\nThe discovery is anyway, worrying as remarked by Avi Bashan, CISO at Lacoon Mobile Security, who explained that these kind of threat could be used to spy data of any other application.\n\n\u201cWhile this tool is intended for use in China due to the intended targets as Chinese instant messaging apps (WeChat and QQ) and monitored chats being in Chinese, it\u2019s important to understand that this type of threat could be implemented anywhere.\u201d wrote Bashan in a blog post.\n\nAs usual happen, such kind of malicious apps is distributed through third-party app marketplaces, the installation of Windseeker needs attacker has physical access to the Smartphone.\n\n\n\nDifferently from other mobile apps used to spy on users, Windseeker implements injection and hooking techniques instead steal data from device memory neither from its file system.\n\nThe injection mechanism has two different phases, in a first step the app deploys a native file that uses the ptrace process, and that is also used to inject a second file  into the targeted instant messaging app. In the second stage the injected native file loads a java file that allows to monitor messaging app activity through the API hooking.\n\n\u201cHooking over an API code means that every time the app calls to the API, instead of going directly to the system, [data] is intercepted by [the attacker]. When it\u2019s on the device itself, it\u2019s called \u2018hooking;\u2019 when it\u2019s over the network, it\u2019s called a man-in-the-middle attack. PC malware has done this for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of hooking technique is not common in the mobile area. Up until now, commercial mobile surveillance apps usually obtained an app\u2019s data through the file system or through a memory dump.\n\nThis hooking technique marks a new step in the evolution of malicious activity in mobile, which resembles the way PC-based malware has also evolved over the years. It\u2019s only a matter of time until we see these adopted techniques become widespread and move into general mass-targeting mobile malware.\u201d  states the post.\n\nProtect yourself:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Windseeker, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-middle", "topic_name": "man-in-the-middle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/messaging-apps", "topic_name": "messaging apps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spyware", "topic_name": "spyware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/windseeker", "topic_name": "Windseeker"}]}, {"news_name": "Critical infrastructures \u2013 Main threats for 2G and 3G mobile networks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1603/security/gsm-mobile-networks.html", "title": "Critical infrastructures \u2013 Main threats for 2G and 3G mobile networks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 13, 2012", "body": "Which is the critical infrastructure of a country that is most exposed to cyber threat?  The question is difficult to answer, without doubts. Communication infrastructure is a vital component of every country and we add that unlike other infrastructure it could be targeted in an attack also with the only destructive purpose with the intent to steal sensitive information, in civil as military.\nThe industry is constantly evolving, and parallel security mechanisms should be improved. But is it really so? Are really secure our communication? What are the possible attacks leading to them? These days we read nearly all the vulnerabilities that can be exploited to undermine the communications, backdoors imposed by governments in the surveillance of mobile devices, flaws in authentication protocols that allow you to very easily pierce our wifi networks, and malware hacking used to control the VOIP communications from our PC.\n\n\n\nAs we have repeatedly reaffirmed, governments and hackers are extremely attentive to the possibility of infiltrating the communication systems. The motivations historically hackers to try their communications systems are different from being able to operate in anonymity so they can avoid being traced, the desire to test their skills with systems that were safe from the masses.\n\nParticularly critical mobile communications due to the nature of the medium. It is my intention to dissolve any doubt about the main mobile communication systems that we encounter in our daily lives.\nLet\u2019s start with what we call 2G communication, is short for second-generation wireless telephone technology. Is has been launched commercially on the GSM standard in 1991. Main benefits of 2G networks over phone conversations are that the communication are digitally encrypted more efficient respect predecessors, and it has been introduced 2G data services for mobile (e.g. SMS text messages) .\n\nWhich are main security issues for 2G?\n\nGSM only authenticates the user to the network and not vice versa. The security model, therefore, offers confidentiality and authentication, but limited authorization capabilities, and no non-repudiation. GSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security. The A5/1 and A5/2 stream ciphers are used for ensuring over-the-air voice privacy. Both algorithms have been exploited:\n\nFrom a purely technological perspective 3G networks use the KASUMI block crypto instead of the older A5/1 stream cipher, but also KASUMI cipher has been identified several serious weaknesses. Consider also that the increasing of connectivity means a sensible grow of the security exposure harder to manage.  Main security problems related to 3G networks\n\nAccording to ETSI TS 121 133 specification 3G threats could be classified as\n\nUnauthorized access to sensitive data (violation of confidentiality)\n\nUnauthorized manipulation of sensitive data (Violation of integrity)\n\nDisturbing or misusing network services (leading to denial of service or reduced availability)\n\nRepudiation: A user or a network denies actions that have taken place.\n\nUnauthorized access to services\n\nWe could spend months on the subject of networks communication and their protection, but I haven\u2019t deliberately depth issues related to other types of networks such as wireless and WiMax, IP communications, and satellite networks. Communication infrastructures representing the nerve-center for a country and that must be preserved from external and internal attacks ensuring the security to end-user.\nUnfortunately, the speech is very complex, and the implementation of security mechanisms clashes with security issues of government surveillance on one hand and with issues related to the technologies used on the other hand.\nAs always, to mediate the situation is necessary a compromise that must have an acceptable cost for the community and that must provide an high level of safe. The need is to bring that level up and up just to deal with cyber threats.\n\n\u2026 to be continued\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 GSM A5, mobile hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/2g", "topic_name": "2G"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/3g", "topic_name": "3G"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gsm", "topic_name": "GSM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-networks", "topic_name": "Mobile networks"}]}]}]
