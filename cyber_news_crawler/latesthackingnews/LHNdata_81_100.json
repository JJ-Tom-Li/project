[{"body": "A critical security issue has been found in PayPal that allows hackers to steal OAuth tokens that are being used in payment apps created by third-party developers. Security researcher and Adobe software engineer -Antonio Sanso found the problem after testing his own OAuth client.\u201cWhile testing my own OAuth client I have noticed something a bit fishy. The easier way to describe it is using an OAuth application from Paypal itself (remember the vulnerability I found is universal aka worked with every client!)\u201d, according to the security expert.He also explains that the issue might exist in some other websites too,including Google and Facebook as they are also using the secure authentication standard that exposed PayPal tokens. However according to this issue, it all comes down to how PayPal handles the redirect_uri parameter to grant authentication tokens to applications. The payment service makes it possible for developers to register their apps with PayPal though a dedicated dashboard that can generate token requests which are then submitted to a central authorization server.The only safe validation method for the authorization server to adopt was exact matching. \u201cAlthough other methods offer client developers desirable flexibility in managing their application\u2019s deployment, they are exploitable\u201d. he added.Sanso added a specific domain name system entry for his website (localhost.intothesymmetry.com) and managed to deceive PayPal\u2019s validation systems into disclosing OAuth authentication tokens that would otherwise remain hidden from view.\u201cSo it really looks like that even if PayPal did actually perform exact matching validation, localhost was a magic word and it overrides the validation completely\u201d, Sanso said in a blog post.Sanso reported the vulnerability to PayPal in September, but the team replied that \u201cthis is not a vulnerability\u201d. After pressing them to look into the problem, PayPal analyzed the report and eventually released a fix in November.

Mozilla and Tor Browser developers are expected to quickly release updates that address the security hole.The existence of the exploit, which is said to consist of one HTML and one CSS file, was first reported on the Tor Project mailing list. Tor Project co-founder and president Roger Dingledine said Mozilla is aware of the issue and is working on a patch. The Tor Browser, which is based on Firefox, will also be updated as soon as Mozilla releases the fix.Enterprise security firm Trail of Bits has analyzed the exploit and determined that it leverages a use-after-free vulnerability affecting the SVG parser in Firefox. Others suggested it was a heap buffer overflow, but Trail of Bits said it was \u201cfairly confident\u201d in its analysis.Trail of Bits CEO Dan Guido explained on Twitter that these types of flaws were discovered in WebKit years ago, but they still haven\u2019t been addressed in Firefox. The vulnerability is not easy to exploit in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge due to memory partitioning, a mitigation that is not present in Firefox, Guido said.The vulnerability apparently also affects Mac OS, but the exploit seen in the wild is designed to target only Windows machines. It is unclear who created the exploit, but Trail of Bits believes it was written from scratch.As far as exploit techniques, this is a routine UAF that heap sprays a controlled object to kick off a ROP chain.

Earlier this year, Mozilla asked a court in the Western District of Washington to require the government to disclose a flaw exploited by law enforcement in 2015 in an operation aimed at child pornography suspects.While some experts believe that Tor users should disable JavaScript in their browser to avoid falling victim to such attacks, others pointed out that disabling JavaScript will prevent many websites from working properly.

This is absolutely mandatory and it\u2019s a confirmation that if you care about your security and don\u2019t download suspicious files, it\u2019s pretty hard to get hacked.In order to trick Tesla owners into downloading the app, hackers used a simple incentive such as a free burger. They created a free and open Wi-Fi hotspot in the proximity of a Tesla charging station and advertised the app on connected phones, claiming that owners can receive a free burger if they install it.Supposing the Tesla owner install this malicious app, hackers can then connect to the phone and prepare the hijack. Promon says that the Tesla companion app is granted an OAuth token when connecting the Tesla server with a username and password.\u201cThe first time the user logs into the Tesla app, the token is obtained and then stored in cleartext in a file in the app\u2019s sandbox folder. When the app is restarted, the token is read and used for subsequent requests,\u201d the security researchers explain.The next step is to reset this token, which in turn would prompt users to input the username and password for the app once again. To do this, attackers only have to remove the token completely, so when Tesla owners provide the username and password, hackers can intercept the data and use it to authenticate in the app.What comes next is not hard to imagine. With hackers getting full access to the Tesla companion app, they can locate the car and even enable the keyless driving functionality that makes it possible to drive it without a key.What\u2019s also important to note is that this isn\u2019t a vulnerability in Tesla cars themselves, but a glitch in mobile apps that could be used by attackers to steal the vehicles.

The malware, designed to harness the power of insecure IoT devices to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, had been previously used in massive incidents targeting Brian Krebs\u2019 blog and hosting provider OVH.With the primary purpose of IoT botnets being DDoS attacks, it\u2019s no wonder that Akamai said that Mirai wasn\u2019t alone in the 665 gigabits per second (Gbps) attempt to take down Krebs. However, security researchers reported that Mirai was increasingly used in DDoS incidents following the source code leak.One such Mirai attack targeted DNS provider Dyn and disrupted popular websites such as Twitter, Etsy, GitHub, Soundcloud, PagerDuty, Spotify, Shopify, Airbnb, Intercom and Heroku. With infected devices in 164 countries and the use of Internet protocols that aren\u2019t usually associated with DDoS attacks, such as STOMP floods, Mirai continues to wreak havoc.Because Mirai\u2019s success is fueled by the existence of IoT devices that aren\u2019t properly secured, it could be easily countered by simply changing the default credentials on vulnerable devices and by closing the Telnet port the botnet uses for infection. That, however, is an operation that users and network admins need to perform, but they might not always be aware of such an issue impacting them.To help users determine whether their network is exposed to Mirai or not, IoT Defense Inc., a startup company based in the Washington DC Metro area, launched a web scanner that does exactly that: it searches for opened TCP ports and informs users whether they are safe or not.The IoT Defense scanner was written using a combination of Python, Node JS and Jade frameworks and scans for nearly a dozen ports that botnets can exploit. Accessing and using the scanner is free and little instructions are needed, as it does all with a simple click of a button.The tool was designed to scan for ports such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet (both 23 and the alternative 2323), HTTP, HTTPS, Microsoft-SQL-Server, EtherNet/IP, Telnet (alternative), Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Web Proxy, and Apache Tomcat SSL (HTTPS).While not all of these ports are targeted by Mirai, a couple is, with the 2323 Telnet port being specifically attacked. The IoT botnet scans the Internet for exposed IoT devices such as routers, IP cameras, and DVRs, and, when it finds vulnerable devices, it attempts to log into them using a list of default login credentials.This, however, is a behaviour employed by other botnets as well. What\u2019s more, while disinfecting a device compromised by Mirai is very easy, because a simple reboot would suffice, keeping the malware away from that device is more complicated. Because of constant scans, vulnerable IoT products are re-infected within minutes.Device vendors are those who need to take action because users rarely do so T. Roy, CEO, IoT Defense, told SecurityWeek via email. They should add in-field auto-updates to their devices, should use per-device unique passwords (something that router manufacturers have already started implementing), and should not open up unnecessary ports.Because their incentives are not aligned with device vendors, it\u2019s clear that users might not be the ones to fix this issue. Users might not care \u2013 provided that they are aware of an issue \u2013 that their routers, IP cameras, or DVRs are used to DDoS websites and DNS providers. As long as the bandwidth usage doesn\u2019t affect them, they are not disadvantaged, and T. Roy believes that one solution would be for ISPs to impose bandwidth caps.A set of rules to impose stricter security of IoT devices would also be of help, and steps in this direction are already being taken, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publishing its Strategic Principles for Securing the Internet of Things. The document includes six non-binding principles designed to provide security across the design, manufacturing and deployment of connected devices.IoT Defense\u2019s CEO also notes that IoT vendors need to have a servicing model in place, to resolve vulnerabilities in their devices when they are discovered. Just as it happens with many other products, vendors would be given a window to resolve the found issues or face consequences. However, he isn\u2019t very optimistic about vendors actually taking the stance.\u201cAs of today, IoT device manufacturers have very little to show for security which always gets trumped by new features and time or market concerns. It is wishful thinking to expect device vendors to step up their game and make security and privacy key differentiators for their products,\u201d T. Roy said.Last year, Gartner said that the number of connected devices will grow above the 20 billion mark by 2020. Now, Juniper Research estimates that there will be 38.5 billion connected IoT devices by that year and that 70% of these units are expected to be non-consumer devices. Should the level of insecurity within these devices remain the same, the consequences will be dire for consumers, enterprises, and vendors alike.

What the researchers did  here is a little different, they managed to do what we said before and also using the output channel of the audio card for input signal and then recording sound.For this they used a malware called Speak(a)r, the security researchers turned headphones into microphones by converting vibrations in the air emitted by the sound (just like your voice) into electromagnetic signals. This makes it possible for the headphone to act as a regular microphone and detect pretty much any sound from across the room.The next step was to trick the output channel of the audio chip to become an input channel and thus allow the recording of sound. According to Wired, this was possible thanks to a feature that\u2019s available in the Realtek audio codec chip, making it possible for the malware to record audio.Realtek chips are being used on the majority of Windows and Mac systems these days, and security researchers claim that this leaves most of our computers vulnerable to such attacks.\u201cThis is the real vulnerability,\u201d says Mordechai Guri, the research lead of Ben Gurion\u2019s Cyber Security Research Labs. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes almost every computer today vulnerable to this type of attack.\u201d\u201cPeople don\u2019t think about this privacy vulnerability.

The attacker only needed to know the router\u2019s external IP address and could gain access to it through the UDP port 53413, after which they could access the backdoor by entering a password hardcoded in the firmware.With full control over the affected devices, an attacker could modify settings to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks and could perform other nefarious activities as well, security researchers warned. What\u2019s more, the documentation attached to the routers didn\u2019t mention anything about the backdoor and how it could be used, researchers said at the time.Now, Trend Micro says that the backdoor continues to be used, based on data gathered by one of its TippingPoint Digital Vaccine (DV) filters. DV filter 32391, designed to check for any attempt to scan for this specific backdoor, shows a massive amount of backdoor communication attempts.The security firm\u2019s reporting dashboard known as ThreatLinQ has detected around 2.9 million hits since the filter was released in August of 2016, Trend Micro\u2019s Steve Povolny explains. He also underlines that these statistics are based on approximately 5% of customer filter hits, meaning that over 57 million events have been registered in the timeframe.The security researchers decided to analyse the pcaps from the TippingPoint devices and discovered that all of them are true positives. Thus, they decided to deepen their search and discovered a number of public exploit or scanning tools designed to leverage this backdoor functionality specifically.Povolny also notes that they detected nearly 50,000 events on a single IPS in the last week, and that most of them originated from the UK (40,000 hits). Most of the remainder hits came from China and North Korea, and the security researcher says that this data can be retrieved directly from the SMS dashboard.\u201cWhat this highlights is an active campaign of worldwide scanning across the IPv4 space, looking for Internet-accessible routers that respond to the backdoor probe. Given the length of this campaign and the sheer volume, not to mention the ease of exploitation, it\u2019s very likely that a large number of these routers are being compromised and used for nefarious purposes such as man-in-the-middle attacks,\u201d Povolny explains.Netis released a patch for the backdoor a while back, but flaws in implementation and the fact that the backdoor code itself has not been removed render impacted devices vulnerable still.Source: security week", "title": "Researchers Found 57 Million Scans for Netis Router Backdoor", "date": "November 22, 2016", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"body": "Hackers managed to break into a Michigan State University server, gaining access to a database that contained no less than 400,000 records and information concerning current and former students and employees.The University confirmed that the hack took place on November 13, and revealed that the database included names, social security numbers, and MSU identification numbers of faculty, staff, and students who were employed between 1970 and November 13, 2016.On the other hand, the University says that no passwords or financial, academic, contact, or health information was stored in the database that got hacked.Out of the total 400,000 records, 449 were accessed by the hackers, and the University administrators managed to take down the database \u201cwith 24 hours\u201d after detecting the breach.\u201cMSU\u2019s Information Technology team rapidly determined the cause and nature of the breach, and the MSU Police Department is working diligently with federal law enforcement partners to investigate the crime,\u201d the University says.\u201cThere is no evidence unauthorised individuals retrieved the other records; however, as a precaution, MSU is reaching out directly to all individuals who may be affected by this criminal act to offer free credit monitoring.\u201dFurthermore, the University warns that following the breach, some of the students or employees whose data was included in the hacked database might become the target of fraud and identity theft, and suspicious activity should be reported to police immediately.A previous Michigan State University hack was recorded on October 28, when Security Affairs reported that a young hacker managed to break into a database containing names, logins, phone numbers, emails published and encrypted passwords.

This latest version is said to provide an increased level of privacy when browsing the Internet from their smartphones and tablets.While they are browsing the web on their computers or on their mobile phones, users are normally exposed to a lot  of threats, which have many privacy risks. With Firefox Focus, Mozilla attempts to tackle these privacy threats by helping users easily erase traces of their browsing sessions from their iOS devices or block online trackers.The new application is expected to provide a fast, free, and easy-to-use browsing experience that will put users in control of how their online activities are tracked on their devices. By default, Firefox Focus will block ad, analytics, social and various other trackers that follow users on the web, all without having to change their privacy or cookie settings.On top of that, the new browser allows users to easily erase their browsing sessions, all with a tap of a button. When searching for information that could prove sensitive in certain situations, regardless of whether it involves engagement rings, flights, or specific merchandise, while also looking to leave no trace on the device, users will be able to erase the session by taping a prominent \u201cErase\u201d button conveniently placed directly on the screen, in the upper right-hand corner.\u201cBy putting the \u201cErase\u201d button front and centre, we offer users a simple path to healthy online behaviours \u2014 protecting their online freedom and taking greater control of their personal data.

After investigating the leak, PageGroup and Capgemini determined that the data was posted to a development server used for testing PageGroup websites. The recruitment firm notified customers that names, email addresses, encrypted passwords, phone numbers and job-related information was exposed in the incident.Hunt said a single one of the database files contained 780,000 unique email addresses and other job details. The expert learned about the leak in late October, but waited until now to make it public to give the affected companies enough time to address the issue. PageGroup believes the data is unlikely to be misused since it appears that only Hunt and the individual who tipped him off accessed it, and they both claim to have destroyed all the copies they had.

Symbolic links, also known as symlinks, are shortcuts that point to other files, folders, or directories.It took some hunting around, but Abma found that because of the problems he could get the contents of a file to be decoded in an error message.From there, an attacker could leverage the bug to read secrets from a GitLab Rails project, shell tokens used to authenticate GitLab users, or even trigger a remote code execution, according to a back-and-forth between Abma and GitLab around the vulnerability on HackerOne.\u201cWith this issue, the secrets of the GitLab rails project can be read, too.

This means that every infected bot connects to an IRC channel, and reads commands posted in the main chatroom.The concept is not new by any stretch of the imagination, with many IoT, Linux, and Windows malware operating in the same way.MalwareMustDie says IRCTelnet takes a lot of inspiration from other IoT malware. The concept of using IRC for managing the bots is obviously borrowed from Kaiten, the malware that had the most success with it.Similarly, the Telnet scanner and brute-forcing system is borrowed from GafGyt (also known as Torlus, Lizkebab, Bashlite, or Bashdoor), while the list of default Telnet credentials is taken from the more recent Mirai malware.MalwareMustDie says this malware is capable of infecting any device running a Linux Kernel version 2.6.32 or above.Support is included for launching DDoS attacks with spoofed IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but the Telnet scanner can only find and brute-force IPs via IPv4.MalwareMustDie says that there are multiple places in the malware\u2019s source code where its author had used the Italian language, more to be than just a random copy-paste.

This was in Linux since Linux  kernel version 3.6.The nick name of this flaw is Dirty COW and it is originally tracked as CVE-2016-5195, this flaw is one of the most influential when it comes to kernel operations which allowed the attackers to elevate privileges and then execute code as another user (an EoP \u2013 Escalation of Privilege vulnerability). Simply to say, Dirty COW allowed attackers to gain root privileges on the affected Linux machines.Dirty COW can affect all versions of AndroidAt the time, it was unclear if the Android operating system, which is based on the Linux kernel, was vulnerable to the issue.Phil Oester, the man who discovered Dirty COW didn\u2019t test for the vulnerability\u2019s presence in Android devices. Fortunately, Manouchehri did and published proof-of-concept code on GitHub on Sunday.In a Twitter post, the researcher said he was able to use a variation of Dirty COW and get root privileges on a device running Android 6.0.1.In an interview with Dan Goodin of ArsTechnica, Manouchehri says that all Android versions since version 1.0 seem to be vulnerable to Dirty COW.While initially the infosec community has mocked Oester for overhyping Dirty COW by creating a dedicated website, logo, and Twitter feed, the vulnerability packed a bigger punch than even Oester had expected.Exploitation is still a little bit tricky, since multiple conditions have to be met before triggering a kernel race condition, but the danger is still there.Since Dirty COW\u2019s discovery, multiple Linux OS projects have patched their distros for the security flaw.", "title": "This Exploit Can Root Your Android Device", "date": "October 24, 2016", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"body": "One of the most recent support call scams involves Microsoft\u2019s Security Essentials, the free antivirus solution that the company is offering to users of Windows 7 or older Windows versions.The company published a warning today to explain that this fake Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus is actually a scam detected as SupportScam:MSIL/Hicurdismos.A and whose only goal is to convince you that there\u2019s something wrong with your PC, only to pay for fake repairs.The first fishy thing about this fake antivirus is that it\u2019s aimed at Windows 8 and Windows 10 computers, but the genuine package can only be installed on Windows 7 and earlier \u2013 Microsoft Security Essentials was replaced by Windows Defender in Windows 8 and 10, and this is pre-installed on all systems.\nAfter installing, the fake package generates a Blue Screen of Death, which once again contains elements proving it\u2019s all just a malicious attempt to steal your money.

The company\u2019s malware analysts say the trojan is spread in the form of an archived PDF, Microsoft Office, or OpenOffice file.The infection starts when users open the file. The trojan springs into action by copying itself to \u201c< HOME >/.gconf/apps/gnome-common/gnome-common\u201d and then opens a decoy document, hence his name of \u201cFakeFile.\u201dThe trojan also adds a shortcut to itself in the user\u2019s .profile and .bash_profile files, which allows it to gain boot persistence between PC reboots.Curiously, the trojan has a specific rule in its source code which prevents the infection routine from executing if the Linux distro is openSUSE. A reason for this might by that the malware author uses an openSUSE distro, but this is just speculation, since this theory is impossible to verify.Once all these first-run operations are out of the way, the real \u201cfun\u201d begins, with FakeFile contacting its command and control server and requesting further instructions.According to clues found in the trojan\u2019s source, the trojan can perform a series of actions, such as rename or delete files, send a file or a folder\u2019s entire content to the C&C server, send a list of files found in a folder to the C&C server, or create new files and folders.Additionally, the trojan can also run files, run shell commands, get or set permissions for desired files and folders, terminate its process, or remove itself from an infected host.\nThe most worrisome part is that FakeFile doesn\u2019t need root access for all these operations, and can work just fine with the current user\u2019s permissions.The number of trojans targeting the Linux platform has grown tremendously in the past year, but in most cases, these targeted Linux servers or IoT devices running Linux-derived operating systems.Security firms rarely encounter trojans targeting Linux desktop environments.

Besides obfuscation, the script also uses tricks like encoded characters, regex search, regex replace, unusual base conversions (script works with base33), and conditional statements.Once the researchers managed to fight their way through all the entangled source code, they discovered that the script goes through the following steps:1) Creates a new folder in the AppDataRoaming directory and hides it using a new registry key1) Copies the legitimate Windows wscript.exe application inside this folder and gives it a random name3) Copies itself inside this folder and creates a shortcut to itself, which it names \u201cStart\u201d and places in the \u201cStartup\u201d folder, also accessible via the Windows Start Menu4) Assigns a fake folder icon to the Start shortcut in order to trick users into thinking it\u2019s a folder and not a file5) The rest of the script\u2019s code checks for an Internet connection by trying to access Microsoft, Google, or Bing.6) Sends telemetry data to urchintelemetry[.]com and downloads and runs an encrypted file from 95.153.31[.]227) The encrypted file is another JS script that sets the homepage of Chrome, Firefox and IE to login.hhtxnet[.]com, which at the time of writing redirects users to another site: portalne[.]ws8) This last script uses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to check for security-related software9) If the script finds security-related software, it terminates execution with a fake error message10) If users spot the wscript.exe process in their task manager and try to stop this process, the script executes a CLI command that immediately shuts down their computer11) When the user restarts his PC, because of the \u201cStart\u201d script in the Startup menu, the malicious JS malware starts operating all over again\u201cIf you end up with this script on your computer, you can easily get rid of it by restarting in Safe Mode (or logging into another account) then removing the startup link and roaming folder,\u201d Darryl, Kahu Security expert writes. \u201cIf you wish to analyze the script while it\u2019s running then simply rename your security tool to something benign.\u201d", "title": "Latest JavaScript Malware Shuts Down Your PC If You Terminate Its Process", "date": "October 10, 2016", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "topics": ["Hacking News", "Vulnerabilities"]}, {"body": "This past week, Spotify-thwarted a malvertising campaign that affected customers of its free tier, bombarding some users with annoying popups that tried to push malware.First signs that something was off appeared on Tuesday, October 4, when users complained on the Spotify forums.

Wi-Fi signals were also previously used to read hand gestures and lip movements, so the accuracy of Wi-Fi signals is well established in scientific circles.By training a special computer algorithm, our program would be able to detect which key presses are for what keys, and eventually manage to recover text entered on the laptop, according to the team.In an environment with little movement and a slow-typing user, the system\u2019s accuracy was 97.5%.

Emails are routed to the seller via this encrypted alias\u201d.Here is a list of emails found in the leaked data :Other than those encrypted emails the data also includes personal information like phone numbers, postal codes, first and last names, country, state, address, buyer emails addresses, product purchased and buyer notes.

These extensions were distributed via Facebook posts for all sorts of viral content. Users who clicked on the links were asked to install one of many Chrome extensions which were capable of many more malicious actions apart from hacking your Facebook account.All of these extensions had a similar name like involving the words \u201cviral\u201c, \u201cage\u201c, and \u201cverify\u201c, and were hosted on the Google Chrome Web Store, which helped users dispel any doubts they had about the extension\u2019s legitimacy. Researchers reported the IP addresses used to download the malicious script payload and the C&C servers to Digital Ocean, the company that was hosting the servers.Kjaer Explanation On These Extensions Kjaer explained that all these extensions requested intrusive permissions, such as the ability to \u201cRead and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d, which gives complete control of a user\u2019s visited sites. He added that the extensions contained only three files which executes in persistent mode, that is they couldn\u2019t be paused and executed from when the browser started until the user shut it off.There was no \u201cless than 18\u201d verification process and that the source code found inside this file only started a random timer after the user filled in their date of birth, and then showed \u201cLoading\u2026\u201d during the timer and \u201cDone!\u201d at the end, according to Kjaer.All the malicious activity could be found only in the third file. Because of Google\u2019s automated scans when submitting extensions to the Chrome Store it is not possible to include malicious code inside the extension so this third script would connect to a server and download another script, which it would later execute. By this method the hackers manage to bypass the Google\u2019s scan and upload their extensions.Basically the downloaded script would be able to make requests and receive instructions from a command and control (C&C) server. During Kjaer\u2019s experiment, the C&C server told his browser to access a Facebook URL that exposed his access token, a programmatic key to his Facebook account. Because of the \u201cRead and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d permissions the user has granted the extension at installation, the crook was able to recover this access token.  As soon as their access token was stolen, the C&C server instructed the user\u2019s browser to give a Like to a Facebook Page Kjaer had never seen before.According to his calculation over 132,265 infected computers had installed the malicious Chrome extensions. He also informed Google, who removed the extensions from the Chrome Web Store and then blacklisted them, which means they were automatically uninstalled from all infected browsers.
