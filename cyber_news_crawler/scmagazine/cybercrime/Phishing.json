But in 2017, the adversary \u2013 also known as Group123 \u2013 reached beyond the Korean peninsula, reports FireEye. Among its targets were a Middle Eastern financial company that provides telecommunications services, a Vietnamese trading and transport company, and also possibly individuals who help Olympics organizations procure resources for athletes.\n\nOne possible reason the Middle Eastern financial firm was chosen as the target of an APT37 spear phishing campaign was because a business relationship it had formed with an unnamed North Korean company had publicly soured, FireEye suggests. \u00a0Reportedly, Reaper actors sent one of the company's board members a fake bank liquidation letter, in the form an attachment that exploited the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 to deliver \u201cSHUTTERSPEED\u201d backdoor malware, capable of harvesting system information, grabbing screenshots and downloading other malicious files.\n\nOther recent targets, according to FireEye, include individuals tied to North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations, an unnamed entity in Japan linked to United Nations sanctioning and human rights missions, and South Korean academic and strategic institutions.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional redlines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity,\u201d FireEye states in its report. \u201cWe anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\u201d \n\nJust last month, Cisco Systems' Talos research team similarly profiled APT37's 2017 activities in its own research blog post. Additional reports linking the Adobe Flash attack to Reaper then broke in early February.\n\nFireEye has also observed Reaper grow in sophistication, noting a \u201chigh operational tempo and specialized expertise,\u201d with a particular affinity for quickly utilizing exploits \u2013 especially Flash ones \u2013 shortly after they are publicized. The group is also known to use a combination of spear phishing emails, website compromises, and torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware.\n\nInterestingly, one of the strongest clues that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government was reportedly uncovered after the presumed developer of several Reaper malware payloads mistakenly disclosed his own personal data, revealing he was operating from an IP address and access point linked to the dictatorial nation. FireEye also has noted that the compilation times of APT37 malware programs are consistent with North Korea's typical workday hours, and that Reaper's targets are consistent with North Korean objectives.\n\nFireEye reports that APT37 generally favors malware that exfiltrates information from victims \u2013 although one of its payloads, RUHAPPY, can also serve as a destructive disk wiper.\n\nWary of Pyongyang's cyber aggression and threats of nuclear strikes, the U.S. may be developing plans to strike North Korean targets with a \u201cbloody nose\u201d attack that relies primarily on cyberwarfare tactics, as opposed to conventional weapons, according a report in Foreign Policy magazine that cites two former intelligence officials. The article further states that the U.S. government has spent the last six months installing fiber cables, remote bases, and listening posts in Japan and South Korea, as a means for hackers to attempt to access North Korea's Internet.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/zero-day/topic/49474/", "topic_name": "Zero Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Edward Snowden returns to U.S.!

People were also likely to fall for phishing attacks appealing to their appetite offering free food or drinks, emails that evoked the fear of missing out on non-monetary opportunities and attacks that appealed to basic curiosity such as new contact requests or photo tags.\n\nResearchers also saw an increased click rate with certain email subjects as well with missed deliveries and false security notifications gaining the most clicks.

But in a rather unique twist, this time the campaign takes advantage of the Windows Installer program msiexec.exe.\n\nIn a Feb. 8\u00a0blog post, Trend Micro researchers Martin Co and Gilbert Sison report that the phishing emails associated with this attack use a lure that asks the recipient to confirm receipt of a payment. While much of the content is written in English, there is also a warning, in Korean, that advises recipients to check if their PCs are infected with a virus or malicious code. For this reason, Trend Micro believes Korean-speakers are the intended target.\n\nThe attached document, saved under the name Payment copy.Doc, purports to be a payment confirmation document, but opening it actually delivers the exploit, which is used to download a Windows Installer package\u00a0labeled\u00a0zus.msivia. This package then drops either an obfuscated MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or Delphi binary. In turn, the binary uses a hallowed out instance of itself to produce the final payload, Loki, which is known for stealing passwords and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nTrend Micro researchers believe that the unusual tactic of using Windows Installer may be a way to evade detection by security software that looks for more traditional installation methods.\n\n\u201cSecurity software has become proficient at monitoring possible downloader processes such as Wscript, Powershell, Mshta.exe, Winword.exe, and other similar executables that have become increasingly popular methods of installing malicious payload,\u201d report\u00a0Co and Sison. \u201cDue to their widespread use, it became easy to stop the arrival of threats via these software. However, the use of msiexec.exe to download a malicious MSI package is not something we typically see in most malware.\u201d\n\nWith that said, however, \u201cwe cannot definitively say if these samples are being delivered via the method described,\u201d the researchers add.\n\nOther malware families, including\u00a0Andromeda, have previous abused Windows Installer, the researchers note, but they modify the program or its processes in some capacity. But in this instance, Installer is left untouched and is used exactly as it's programmed to \u2013 only for a malicious purpose.\n\nThis latest attack is also an outlier because Microsoft Installer packages more typically are \u201cabused for malicious purposes to install Potentially Unwanted Applications... This is a new direction for malware creators,\u201d the report states.\n\nAside from taking the usual email security precautions, users can protect themselves from this particular threat by disabling or restricting Windows Installer.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Olympic torch lights the way for cybercrimminals", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/olympic-torch-lights-the-way-for-cybercrimminals/article/743173/", "title": "Olympic torch lights the way for cybercrimminals", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "February 09, 2018", "body": "With the torch lighting for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang taking place today it will be off to the races for skiers, bobsledders and cybercriminals all of whom are looking to make their mark at the games.\n\nThe potential for cyberattacks being launched against those attending the games, and even those watching from afar, is so strong that U.S. CERT has issued cybersecuirty guidelines for those visiting, tips that can be used well after the Olympics ends in any public environment.\n\n\u201cWith the 2018 Winter Olympics commencing soon, we can expect that the events will generate cyber threat activity. Both targeting of specific organizations that are involved in sponsoring, promoting and participating in the game, as well as using the attention it generates as lure content for delivery of malware. Based on historical activity surrounding the Olympics, these threats will likely include cyber espionage groups, hacktivists and cybercriminals,\u201d said Jens Monrad, FireEye's principal threat analyst.\n\nConsidering the on-the-go nature of attending the Olympics all of the recommendations center on mobile security hygiene and are very similar to what attendees of Black Hat and Def Con are told.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Switch off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections when not in use.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use a credit card to pay for online goods and services.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When using a public or unsecured wireless connection, avoid using sites and applications that require personal information like log-ins.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Update mobile software.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use strong PINs and passwords.\n\nOther suggestions include have two-factor authentication for your accounts, keep a screen lock active on your device and most importantly take a minute and think before you click on a link.\n\nThere have already been several hacking attempts centered on the Olympics with documents and emails stolen from the International Luge Federation being leaked and McAfee reported in early January campaign targeting organizations involved with the Pyeongchang Olympics that used the games as part of a social engineering plan to trick folks into opening phishing emails.\n\nWhile nation-state backed cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, most experts believe that with North Korea now attending the games and attack from that direction is unlikely, but it does not mean the games are safe.\n\n\u201cThe largest cyber threat to the Winter Games comes from non-state actors. Hacktivists, cyberterrorists, and fame seekers all see the Olympics as a great venue for their personal cause, whether it's personal fame, the propaganda of a political message or harm for a political purpose,\u201d Ross Rustici, senior director for intelligence services for Cybereason.\n\nPossibly making the attackers job easier, and the defenders more difficult, is the reliance the games IT infrastructure will have on third-party vendors. As a group third-party vendors have not performed well when it comes to protecting data and Rustici believes this could again prove to be a weak spot at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe sprawling networks needed to successfully run the Olympics requires giving access to subcontractors, international journalists and TV networks, international delegations and, in some cases, throngs of tourists. The network security teams will manage millions of network events a day over disperse networks with unique protocols and traffic patterns over systems that include: broadcast networks; industrial control systems; tickets, merchandise and other payment related systems and operational networks related to the running and scoring of the games themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it's not just the systems and devices directly associated with managing the games that are in danger. The relative ease many hackers have infiltrating IoT devices means even the medical devices on site to care for the athletes are a danger point, said Jonathan Langer, co-founder and CEO of Medigate, a medical device security platform.\n\n\u201cAs the technology used in the Olympics evolves, so do the cybercriminals who now target the many connected medical devices that the athletes use. The Olympics exemplify the emerging cybersecurity threats in healthcare, specifically medical device cybersecurity, which is a part of the wave of IoT devices connecting to networks. Hospitals all over the globe are struggling to face off with this new cybersecurity challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nMcAfee has already noted a few campaigns using the games as part of the social engineering aspect scheme in their attacks. \n\nThe first incident took place on December 22 with the last known coming in on December 28.

In September through November 2017, links from Hancitor malspam occasionally resolved to these domain names without any additional text in the URL,\" states the blog post, written by researchers Vicky Ray and Brad Duncan.\n\nMoreover, \"In recent weeks, links from this malspam have been using a custom encoding to disguise the recipient's email address in the URL.\" Having the email address in the URL is a way to track victims, the blog post explains.\n\nThe researchers further noted that most of the malicious webservers registered with hosting providers are located in the U.S., while the majority of compromised domains are based in Asia, and often owned by small and medium businesses.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Cybercriminals exploiting traditional trust measures for compromises, study", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/sites-once-thought-safe-may-be-exposing-you-to-third-party-vulnerabilities/article/742461/", "title": "Cybercriminals exploiting traditional trust measures for compromises, study", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "February 06, 2018", "body": "Cybercriminals are exploiting traditional measures of trust to gain a foothold on users systems by compromising trusted sites via background initiated requests, using phishing sites, and typosquatting.\n\nWhile many companies have used categories such as \u00a0Business and Economy, Shopping, News and Media, and Malware, to help set security policy researchers are warning it's no longer advisable to consider any category as inherently safe, according to the Menlo Security State of the Web 2017 report released Feb. 5, 2018. \n\n\u201cMany companies have used these categories to help set security policy,\u201d researchers said in the report. \u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, it's no longer advisable to consider any category as inherently \u201csafe.

The document was served up by a malicious SFX file (distributed via a phishing campaign) that executes the malware infection when opened.\n\nUpon further investigation, the researchers soon found additional Vermin samples, revealing a larger command-and-control infrastructure that since late 2015 has been infecting individuals with Vermin or, alternatively, Quasar RAT, an open-source malware family used in criminal and espionage attacks. Many of these additional samples didn't even use a decoy document; instead, they consisted of only the payload and a dropper disguised as an icon for a document viewing app such as Microsoft Word.\n\nIn an unusual development, Unit 42 researchers learned that Vermin leverages the HTTP encapsulated Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messaging protocol to establish a secure command-and-control communication -- a behavior that is \"something not often seen in malware samples,\" according to Unit 42 blog post authors and researchers Tom Lancaster and Juan Cortes.\u00a0\n\nResearchers also found that Vermin is composed of mostly original code, written using the Microsoft .NET Framework and often packed with the .NET obfuscation tool\u00a0ConfuserEx.\u00a0\n\nFollowing execution, the malware checks if the victim's system is configured with Russian as the installed input language (often a telltale clue that the attackers are Russian and don't want to attack their fellow countrymen). If the machine is not set to Russian, the malware performs an API call and decrypts an embedded resource that contains the main code for communications and RAT functionality.\n\nAt this point, the malware begins collecting information, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address and the presence of anti-virus software.

The report said the GDGS is known to gather cyber intelligence to bolster its offensive cyber capabilities.\n\nThe group is believed to be currently running six distinct and concurrently operating campaigns some of which have been in operation since 2012.\n\nDark Caracal has ties to a previous operation uncovered by the EFF during its Operation Manul campaign which targeted journalists, lawyers, and dissidents critical of the Kazakhstan government.\n\nThe malicious group usual modus operandi is to use trojanized Android apps to install an APT normally utilizing social media, phishing and sometimes physical access to compromise a targeted system. The malware employed by Dark Caracal ranges from a custom-developed mobile spy tool called Pallas along with the more commonly used found FinFisher, Bandook RAT and other tools that are bought or rented off the Dark Web.\n\nA standard Dark Caracal attack starts with a lure placed on a Facebook group and WhatsApp messages. These normally included political messages or links to Facebook groups that Dark Caracal believes would interest the victim. Successful WhatsApp phishing attacks then lead the victim to a watering hole server, while those hooked via Facebook were sent to a specially constructed malicious website using a fake Google, Facebook or Twitter domain. In some cases the Facebook targets would go to the watering hole server.\n\nNo matter which server the victims landed on the target would be served a series of trojanized Android Apps, which after installation would begin communicating with a command and control server found at adobeair[.] net. \n\nThe EFF and Lookout's investigation was able to identify four \u201cpersonas\u201d, two phone numbers and two domains associated with Dark Caracal, all of which are somehow connected to the email address op13@mail[.]com. \n\n\u201cAliases associated with op13@mail[.]com include Nancy Razzouk, Hadi Mazeh, and Rami Jabbour.

A fourth email targeted college students belonging to the organization Friends of MOFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), using content taken from a blog operated by the actual organization.\n\nThe emails contained malicious attachments created in the format for Korean word processor Hangul documents. Embedded PostScripts in these opened documents would trigger an exploit for CVE-2017-8291, an Artifex Ghostscript vulnerability that ultimately allowed attackers to infect user machines with a malicious DLL payload designed to collect device information and exfiltrate files. Further analysis revealed that this malware shares significant chunks of code with Destover, a Lazarus-linked information stealer that was used in an early WannaCry ransomware attack that took place prior to the global May 2017 attack.\n\nBlog post authors and Recorded Future researchers\u00a0Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade and Priscilla Moriuchi also noted that code in the malicious PostScripts contained some transliterated Chinese words, one of which was misused -- leading analysts to theorize these additions may have been intended as false flags to cast suspicions on China.\n\n\"This late 2017 campaign is a continuation of North Korea's interest in cryptocurrency, which we now know encompasses a broad range of activities including mining, ransomware, and outright theft,\" the blog post states. \"Outside of the May WannaCry attack, the majority of North Korean cryptocurrency operations have targeted South Korean users and exchanges, but we expect this trend to change in 2018. We assess that as South Korea responds to these attempted thefts by increasing security (and\u00a0possibly banning cryptocurrency trading) they will become harder targets, forcing North Korean actors to look to exchanges and users in other countries as well.\"\n\nRecorded Future's report serves as further proof that cryptocurrency platforms, exchanges and users remain alluring targets for cybercriminals and adversarial nation-states. (Of course, this trend certainly bears watching, following a rough two days for Bitcoin, which lost more than 50 percent of its peak market value over Jan. 16 and 17, dipping below the $10,000 mark.)\n\nEarlier this month, for example, Morphus Labs'\u00a0Chief Research Officer Renato Marinho, and\u00a0Johannes B. Ullrich, dean of Research at the\u00a0SANS Technology Institute, reported on a January 2018 campaign that was secretly deploying XMRig, a legitimate Monero cryptominer, in victims' machines via Oracle's\u00a0WebLogic application servers.\n\nThe unattributed attackers accomplished this feat by exploiting\u00a0CVE 2017-10271,\u00a0a remote code execution vulnerability found in the servers' WLS Security component. (Oracle issued a patch for the bug late last year, but server owners who failed to implement it remain vulnerable.)\n\nUllrich reported that the exploit appears to be a script released last December by a Chinese security researcher, while Marinho remarked that it's \"pretty simple to execute and comes with a Bash script to make it easy to scan for potential victims.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Oracle's PeopleSoft HR software, which can use WebLogic as a web server, was also found to be vulnerable and, in some cases, was exploited. \"As you can probably imagine, a compromise of a PeopleSoft system is pretty much a worst-case compromise for an organization,\" Ullrich summarized in his write-up.\n\nFurthermore, Onapsis\u00a0reported\u00a0on Jan. 17 that its researchers confirmed that the Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS), which typically stores\u00a0business, sales, and financial data,\u00a0can also be compromised by the exploit.\n\nBased on additional research, Ullrich stated that the attacker successfully mined 611 Monero coins, which as of Jan. 17 equates to roughly $188,000 (it was $226,070 at the time of Ullrich's writing).\n\nAs for the victims, \"Based on a quick reverse DNS lookup and an ASN lookup, I found a high concentration of affected IPs at cloud providers,\" Ullrich reported. \"This isn't a surprise, since many organizations are moving their most critical data to the cloud to make it easier for the bad guys to get to it. Also, not a big surprise is the relatively high percentage of IPs in Oracle's cloud.\"\n\nIn related news, Radware\u00a0has asserted in its just released 2017-18 Global Application & Network Security Report\u00a0that the soaring value of cryptocoins (this most recent downtrend notwithstanding) is inviting increased malicious activity, including ransomware and stolen-content-for-ransom attacks against organizations, as well as distributed denial of service attacks against cryptocurrency platforms.\n\n\u201cThe rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies and their subsequent rise in price has presented hackers with a clear upside that goes beyond cryptocurrencies' anonymity,\u201d said Carl Herberger, VP of security solutions at Radware, in a press release.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apparent-korean-actor-group123-linked-to-six-phishing-campaigns-including-evil-new-year-scam/article/737293/", "title": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 16, 2018", "body": "Researchers have attributed six separate phishing campaigns targeting South Koreans in either 2017 or 2018 to a single threat actor called \"Group123,\" including multiple operations designed to infect victims with the remote administration tool ROKRAT.\n\nThe six campaigns -- Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are You Happy?, FreeMilk, North Korea Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018 -- have been linked through shared code and tactics, according to researchers with Cisco Systems' Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group.\n\nCommonalities include not just ROKRAT, but also the use of Korean Hangul Word Processor (HWP) documents, similar Program DataBase patterns and reconnaissance codes, and the presence of a browser stealer in certain payloads. Also, many of the campaigns have used email lures that reference the longstanding North Korea-South Korea reunification movement.\n\nDue to the phishing emails' use of Hangul -- a product of\u00a0South Korean\u00a0company\u00a0Hancom Inc. -- and their strong command of the Korean language, Talos believes it is likely that \"the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula\" and that\u00a0\"we are dealing with a new Korean actor.\" However, while state-sponsored North Korea hackers have a history of launching attacks on South Korea, Talos does not outright state if the threat specifically comes from the north.\n\nThe most recent campaign, Evil New Year 2018, is essentially a reboot of the threat actor's original Evil New Year operation that ran from November 2016 through January 2017, explains Talos in a Jan. 16 blog post authored by researchers Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres (with contributions from Jungsoo An).\n\nThe newer campaign, which launched on Jan. 2, 2018, lures victims in with a malicious HWP decoy document, supposedly written by South Korea's Ministry of Reunification. The doc\u00a0claims to offer an analysis of a New Year's speech made by the leader of North Korea (presumably Kim Jong-un, although Talos doesn't specifically name him in its analysis).\n\nThe document exploits a vulnerability in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format in order to download and execute shellcode hidden in a fake image on a previously compromised website. In this case, the shellcode downloads and decodes a fileless variant of ROKRAT from memory as the final payload. Much like the ROKRAT samples distributed in previous Group123 campaigns, this variant leverages cloud providers, including Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox, and Box, to exfiltrate documents and communicate with the attackers.\n\nAccording to Talos, the 2017 Evil New Year campaign similarly involved spear phishing emails that appeared to come from the\u00a0Korean Ministry of Unification and used malicious\u00a0Hangul attachments to drop ROKRAT. \"The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in. This would have been particularly true for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target of choice,\" the Talos blog post states.\n\nThe malicious documents in the earlier campaign featured two links that opened up additional decoy documents containing malicious OLE objects used to drop binaries, which\u00a0 in turn injected shellcode that unpacked and executed reconnaissance malware designed to communicate with the C&C server.\n\nThe Talos report detailed four additional phishing campaigns from Group123:\n\nGolden Time, August 2016 - March 2017: This campaign infected targets with ROKRAT via spear phishing emails that lauded recipients for joining a panel at a phony Korean reunification conference. Other phishing emails purported to be a help request from a resident of the South Korean city Munchon.\n\nAre You Happy?, March 2017: This campaign dropped a ROKRAT module called named ERSP.enc that acts as a disk wiper, capable of\u00a0opening an infected system's drive and writing data to the Master Boot Record. After the malware reboots the affected machine, the MBR displays a string that reads \"Are you Happy?\"\n\nFreeMilk, May 2017: Because this campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, the attackers used Microsoft Office documents instead of HWP docs. \"The attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 [a flaw in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface]\u00a0in order to download and execute a malicious HTA document inside of Microsoft Office,\" Talos explains. This scheme resulted in two payloads: The first, PoohMilk, creates persistence and checks specific files on an infected machines, paving the way for the second malware, Freenki, which collects information on the infected system and can download a third executable.\n\nNorth Korean Human Rights, November 2017: This campaign served another version of ROKRAT, via a malicious HWP document authored by a representative from the Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reunification Of Korean Peninsula. Purportedly, \"the main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items related to \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and \"Enactment of a Law,\" which was passed in 2016 in South Korea. Of course, the document's true purpose was to infect unwitting victims.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "North Carolina introduces data breach legislation, after ", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/north-carolina-introduces-data-breach-legislation-after-incidents-rise-in-2017/article/735761/", "title": "North Carolina introduces data breach legislation, after incidents rise in 2017", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 09, 2018", "body": "More than 5.3 million residents of North Carolina were victims of data breaches in 2017 \u2013 an escalating trend that has prompted state Attorney General Josh Stein (D) and state Rep.

It also requires that affected companies report any such incident to\u00a0the public and the AG's office within 15 days.\n\nAdditionally, the bill also requires businesses that own or license consumers' personal information to execute reasonable security procedures and practices to protect said data, including medical records and insurance account numbers.\n\nIf a company fails to uphold its responsibilities, it will be considered a violation of the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. According to a fact sheet detailing the proposed legislation, \u201ceach person affected by the breach represents a separate and distinct violation of the law.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the proposed act allows consumers to easily freeze their credit, access free credit reports, and view information collected on them by consumer reporting agencies.

Instead of selling the phishing kits for a price as a crimeware service, developers are now offering the kits for free to patrons of underground websites. Yet they still profit by surreptitiously employing exfiltration mechanisms that leverage the data phished by users of their product.\n\nThis allows more experienced cybercriminals who develop the phishing kits to \u201cdecrease their effort and risk, and increase their ROI, by harvesting the work of inexperienced criminals who deploy their kits,\u201d explains Lazar in a Jan. 4 Imperva blog post.\n\nThis strategy has become viable in part because the shelf lives of some phishing pages and servers are growing longer, due to the advent of techniques to used evade security measures. For instance, 17 percent of the 1,019 phishing kits observed by Imperva included a mechanism for blocking unwanted website visitors such as cyber researchers \u2013 making it appear like the website has already been taken down.\n\nAnd 13 percent featured blacklist evasion techniques that can \u201credirect each new victim to a newly generated random location,\u201d Lazar reports. \u201cThis approach allows phishers to hide the real link to the phishing kit from being blacklisted, and thus extend the lifespan of phishing pages and servers.\u201d\n\nThe phishing kits were uncovered and obtained for analysis using URLs listed via two sources: TechHelpList.com and OpenPhish. In a disclaimer of sorts, Imperva notes that the samples they collected may be skewed toward phishing kits typically used by amateur attackers, some of whom never remove their purchased kits from compromised servers, thus leaving them vulnerable to directory\u00a0traversal attacks and allowing researchers to download and analyze them.\n\nA clustering analysis also suggested that around half of the studied kits were created by a small community of experienced actors,\u00a0 with one third appearing to come from one of just three large families of kits. Further corroborating this theory: 51 percent of 271 author signatures extracted from the phishing kits were determined to be non-unique, meaning they were observed more than once.

Since all email headers must contain only ASCII characters, \u201cthe trick resides in using RFC-1342 (from 1992!), a recommendation that provides a way to encode non-ASCII chars inside email headers in such a way that it won't confuse the MTAs [Mail Transfer Agents] processing the email,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, most email clients and web interfaces don't properly sanitize the string after decoding, which leads to this email spoofing attack.\u201d\n\nBecause iOS is vulnerable to null-byte injection and macOS is vulnerable to \u201cemail(name)\u201d injection, Haddouche said, referring to a demo, the domain part of an original email can be hidden or removed, then replaced, by employing \u201ca combinations of control characters such as new lines or null-byte.\u201d\n\nThe exploits take advantage of the how the email sender name is displayed to bypass DMARC. \u201cThe server still validates properly the DKIM signature of the original domain and not the spoofed one,\u201d the researcher wrote. \u201cWhile MTAs not only don't detect and block these spoofed email addresses, they will happily relay those emails as long as the original email seems trustworthy enough (the attacker can therefore ironically profit from setting up DMARC on that email address).\u201d\n\nAs a result, Haddouche said, the spoofed emails are \u201cvirtually unstoppable.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhishing attacks are one of the most effective ways for bad actors to infiltrate and infect organizations,\u201d\u00a0said Bob Noel, director of strategic relationships and marketing at Plixer.\u00a0MailSploit\u00a0is the latest example of how users can be tricked into opening emails with malicious payloads and links. End users must be trained to no longer implicitly trust emails they receive from either known or unknown senders. Given the continued high rate of phishing success, IT departments should implement Network Traffic Analytics platforms to monitor all network traffic and have access to forensic data when users fall victim to phishing attacks. This visibility enables organizations to understand what happened, return to normal, and protect themselves against the spread of malware like ransomware.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect example of how phishing campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted,\u201d said Eyal Benishti, CEO and founder of IRONSCALES. \u201cAs is the case here, fraudsters are frequently adopting spoofing and impersonation techniques in a quick, easy, and incredibly successful way to lure their potential victims into a false sense of security. As a result, it is becoming virtually impossible for end users to identify these phishing emails as they land in inboxes across the workforce.\u201d\n\nBenishiti recommended that users detect and deflect phishing messages by:\n\n1. \u201cChecking for \u2018spoofing' through sender policy framework (SPF) records, display name,\u00a0email address and\u00a0domain similarity.\n\n2.\u00a0 Augmenting the representation\u00a0of senders inside the email client by learning true sender indicators and score sender reputation through visual cues and metadata associated with every email.\n\n3.\u00a0 Integrating automatic smart real-time email scanning into multi anti-virus, and sandbox solutions so forensics can be performed on any suspicious emails either detected, or reported.\n\n4.\u00a0 Allowing quick\u00a0reporting via an augmented email experience, thus helping the user make better decisions.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Clarksons' breach again shows need to eliminate passwords", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/clarksons-breach-again-shows-need-to-eliminate-passwords/article/710717/", "title": "Clarksons' breach again shows need to eliminate passwords ", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 30, 2017", "body": "The global shipping firm Clarksons reported that it has suffered a cybersecurity breach which it, and outside security firms, believe was caused when a lone user account was hacked, again bringing to the forefront the need to move past the legacy username and password for logging in to a critical system.\n\nWith basic login credentials again being the reason for a major breach, cybersecurity firms are reiterating the need to move beyond passwords to a more secure technology.\n\nThe UK-based company, which had $413.7 million in revenue in 2016, said the account in question has been disabled and additional security measures have been put in place. In a public statement the company said there is a chance the person or group that perpetrated the incident will release some confidential data in the near future. This has led to the belief that the company has refused to pay a ransom in order to hush up the breach.\n\n\u201cThe description of the means by which a hacker or group of hackers gained access to Clarksons' systems makes me think that the attack may not have exploited a software vulnerability, but rather that a legitimate account holder had their login credentials compromised,\u201d Graham Cluley wrote for ESET.\n\nThe massive breach Uber suffered earlier this month was also traced back to a pilfered set of login credentials used by Uber software engineers that were then used to access an infrastructure account that handled computing tasks for the company.\n\n\u201cIf I were getting a startup off the ground, I would go passwordless without a second thought.

In the case of password cracking, someone didn't just type in the correct password out of the blue. They were scanning and trying different combinations. That is unless it was an inside job or they had inside help. If they do get past that there should be other behavioral activity that would show up and thus caught.

If the victim complies, he or she is then asked to log in with their email address and phone number. These phishing pages generally resolve to domains that incorporate the bank's name, in order to further exude credibility.\n\nOnce users enter their information into the phishing page, thereby giving away their information to the cybercriminals, the Marcher phase of the attack begins. The victims are falsely informed via the malicious mobile web page that they do not have their bank's security app installed on their phones, and must download it in order to comply with\u00a0new European Union money laundering guidelines as well as to encrypt sensitive data such as mTan SMS and online banking connections.\n\nIn the case of a fake BankAustria security app used in a Nov. 2 campaign, Proofpoint found that 7 percent of visitors were socially engineered into downloading this so-called \"application,\" which is actually the Marcher banking trojan.\n\nProofpoint further warns that the faux security application asks for a wide range of suspicious permissions that would elevate Marcher's privileges and give it increased control over the infected device. Chief among these is the request to act as\u00a0device administrator.\n\nLater, when the victim opens up a specific banking app, Marcher attacks in its usual manner, by overriding the app's true screen with a fake overlay that imitates the bank and steals the user's credentials information as it's being entered.\n\nIt might seem redundant for the cybercriminals to employ Marcher in this manner if the initial phishing attack already captured the victim's credentials in phase one of the attack. But not so -- because unlike with phishing attacks, Marcher can repeatedly harvest victims' credentials even after they are changed, explained\u00a0Patrick Wheeler, director of threat intelligence at Proofpoint, in an email interview. Moreover, banking trojans like Marcher often target \"multiple banks and financial services, so even if victims turned over credentials for one bank, the trojan may be able to harvest credentials for others as they use their phones,\u201d Wheeler added.\n\nIn what constitutes a third method of attack, the Marcher trojan in this particular case also presented credit card phishing screens when users opened non-banking apps such as the Google Play Store.\n\n\"...As we use mobile devices to access the web and phishing templates extend to mobile environments, we should expect to see a greater variety of integrated threats like the scheme we detail here,\" Proofpoint reports in the blog post. \"As on the desktop, mobile users need to be wary of installing applications from outside of legitimate app stores and sources and be on the lookout for bogus banking sites that ask for more information than users would normally provide on legitimate sites. Unusual domains, the use of URL shorteners, and solicitations that do not come from verifiable sources are also red flags for potential phishing and malware.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Russian hackers altered Clinton campaign email, part of broader initiative", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/russian-hackers-altered-clinton-campaign-email-part-of-broader-initiative/article/705489/", "title": "Russian hackers altered Clinton campaign email, part of broader initiative  ", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 06, 2017", "body": "", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "QtBot downloader discovered in geo-based Locky-Trickbot campaign", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/qtbot-downloader-discovered-in-geo-based-locky-trickbot-campaign/article/705032/", "title": "QtBot downloader discovered in geo-based Locky-Trickbot campaign", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "November 02, 2017", "body": "Researchers from Palo Alto Networks have uncovered a new piece of the puzzle in the case of an ongoing series of malspam campaigns that distribute either\u00a0Locky ransomware or the Trickbot banking trojan, depending on the victim's geographical location.\n\nThis latest discovery comes in the form of QtBot, an intermediate-stage downloader that helps to deliver the final payload, according to a Wednesday blog post from Palo Alto's Unit 42 threat intelligence team. Since Oct. 19, the researchers\u00a0observed more than 4 million \"unique sessions\" with QtBot activity, the report states.\n\nMalspam recipients unknowingly download QtBot upon opening malicious Microsoft Office email attachments that are designed to abuse\u00a0Microsoft Windows' Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. This same DDE technique was also observed in a recent spear phishing campaign impersonating the\u00a0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in order to infect victims with\u00a0DNSMessenger\u00a0malware.\n\nQtBot in this instance is being used as a replacement for malicious VBScripts that had been used in previous Locky-Trickbot distribution campaigns to query websites that provide geo-IP services in order to pinpoint the geographic region of a particular target, thereby determining the final payload.\n\nPalo Alto has likened QtBot to the\u00a0Andromeda\u00a0loader and bot, identifying it as a likely offshoot. Researchers note that both downloader threats exhibit similar\u00a0anti-analysis behaviors; analyze potential hosts' keyboard language identifiers to avoid infecting machines in former Soviet countries; and use Microsoft's Windows Installer program msiexec.exe for code execution.\n\nBlog post authors Brandon Levene,\u00a0Brandon Young\u00a0and\u00a0Dominik Reichel further describe QtBot as \"a Windows executable file that decrypts an importless stub into memory. This payload is later injected into msiexec.exe using common techniques. The payload then decrypts the second stage shellcode and injects it into a newly spawned svchost.exe process. This svchost.exe acts as the handler for the final payload.\"\n\nThe phishing emails serving up QtBot are spawned by the Necurs botnet, and generally trick recipients with generic subject-line lures that suggest the delivery of a financial document or file transfer. After opening a malicious document, users are prompted to click through three dialogue boxes, triggering an HTTP GET request to the command-and-control server, which Unit 42 researchers believe is likely a compromised webhost running a vulnerable version of [the commercial\u00a0web hosting\u00a0platform] PLESK.\" This C&C server then downloads QtBot, which is executed via a PowerShell directive.\n\n\"While geographic location specific malware delivery is not a new phenomenon, the combination of two previously disparate malware family affiliates utilizing unified malspam campaigns and droppers is an interesting shift in tactics,\" concludes the Unit 42 blog post. \"QtBot protects itself and the decision tree by which targeting is established and offers a significantly more robust anti-analysis package to stymie analysts.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Land of the rising trojan: Ursnif banking malware surges in Japan", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/land-of-the-rising-trojan-ursnif-banking-malware-surges-in-japan/article/703312/", "title": "Land of the rising trojan: Ursnif banking malware surges in Japan", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "October 27, 2017", "body": "Malspam campaigns designed to spread the Ursnif banking trojan have been heavily targeting Japanese banks and payment card providers in 2017, especially since September, according to IBM's X-Force research team.\n\nThis attacks has been leveraging Ursnif, also known as\u00a0Gozi, to steal data from secure sessions, perform web injections and execute page redirections, reports Limor Kessem, IBM cybersecurity expert, in a company blog post on Thursday.

Phases of the model include reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on the objective, CERT stated.\n\nAn examination of the tactics, techniques and procedures uncovered so far see the malicious actors using a myriad of attack vectors spear-phishing emails based on data gleaned from previously compromised accounts, watering hole domains, host-based exploitation, industrial control system infrastructure targeting and gathering additional credentials.\n\nAnother early move is to first target third-party vendors that work with their intended targets as these tend to have lower levels of security and once penetrated can give them direct access to the higher profile organization.\n\nIn the early reconnaissance phase the threat actors scan the internet for all the freely available information on their target, some of which then will be used in upcoming spearphishing attacks. The emails with the subject line \n\"AGREEMENT & Confidential\" generally use a phony contract as the bait to entice someone to open and click on the attached PDF. The PDF itself is not malicious, but there is a note prompting the recipient to click on a link if the file does not start to download which can lead to a malicious site.\n\nWhile the domains being used as watering holes by the attackers were not listed, the report said more than half of those found belong to trade publications and informational websites related to process control, ICS, or critical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe compromised sites include both custom developed web applications and template-based frameworks. The threat actors injected a line of code into header.php, a legitimate PHP file that carried out the redirected traffic. There is no indication that threat actors used zero-day exploits to manipulate the sites; the threat actors more likely used legitimate credentials to access the website content directly,\u201d DHS said.\n\nThe government included a long list of detection and preventative measures that they recommended be taking, including:\n\nHowever, not everyone believes these suggestions are enough.\n\n\u201cWhile the DHS warnings are warranted, their specific security recommendations are inadequate.

Systems accounts are prized as they generally have elevated privileges giving the criminals access to a wide variety of inside information and system accounts are not always as well protected.\n\n\u201cNot only do these accounts have higher privileges, but they may not always work well with step-up authentication systems like Single-Sign-On (SSO) or other multi-factor authentication, and they can suffer from lax password policies. This gives attackers the perfect vector to infiltrate into an organization's Office 365 environment,\u201d Sarukkai said.\n\nThis means systems accounts need to be treated like any other corporate account and should be equipped with the proper security and needs to be monitored.\n\nThe attack takes advantage of poorly protected accounts by using its botnet to ping a single account four or five times to try and guess the password. If the password is not discovered it moves on to another account, by doing so it keeps a low profile. Another tactic used to stay under the radar is to only hit one organization at a time. Sarukkai noted that as one attack ramps up another dissipates.\n\nOnce an account has been hacked the malware obtains data from its email inbox, creating a new rule that hides and diverts incoming messages and it then launches an organization-wide phishing attack to spread the malware across the network.\n\nSarukkai gave one example of how dangerous a successful KnockKnock could be to a company. \n\n\u201cIf a hacker gains entry into an Office 365's Exchange Online system account that's used as the username for Salesforce.com, which is in turn used as a Marketo Sync User to integrate Salesforce.com to the organization's marketing automation cloud, then an entry into the Exchange Online system account could also give the hacker access to the entire CRM and marketing automation systems of the organization, putting the enterprise's most valuable data at risk of unauthorized exposure or loss,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first KnockKnock attacks happened in May 2017 and are continuing.\n\n\u201cThe attacks originate from a small networks of 89 confirmed IPs distributed across 83 networks,\u201d he said, adding most of the IPs are registered in China, but some are from the U.S., Russia, Brazil and Argentina.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/botnet/topic/47256/", "topic_name": "Botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud-security/topic/49913/", "topic_name": "Cloud Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": " Domino's Australia warns of email campaign, third-party breach", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/spammed-in-30-minutes-or-less-dominos-australia-warns-of-email-campaign-third-party-breach/article/701015/", "title": "Spammed in 30 minutes or less: Domino's Australia warns of email campaign, third-party breach", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "October 18, 2017", "body": "If you think pineapple pizza is unappetizing, try pizza served with some spam.\n\nDomino's Pizza Australia has disclosed that a data breach at one of its former third-party suppliers may have resulted in a spam campaign aimed at customers of the restaurant and food delivery chain.\n\nIn a statement on its website, Domino's acknowledges that an unspecified number of customers have contacted the company to complain of an unauthorized email campaign.

Previous phishing campaigns delivered the malware as a final payload following a series of PowerShell commands. According to researchers\u00a0from Cisco Talos, the SEC phishing operation employed a similar infection chain, with the added twist of leveraging DDE for code execution, as opposed to more commonly used macros or OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects.\n\nDDE is a protocol used for interprocess communications, such as the transferring of data between applications. Earlier this year, researchers at SensePost determined that DDE could be essentially exploited to execute malicious code in Microsoft Word.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation reportedly chose not to act on the findings, calling this functionality an intentional feature. However, SensePost noted in a blog post that Microsoft said it\u00a0would consider reclassifying the feature as a bug in the next version of Windows. In the meantime, however, \"We are now seeing it actively being used by attackers in the wild, as demonstrated in this attack,\" Talos reported in a blog post authored by researchers Edmund Brunaghin and Colin Grady, with contributions from Dave Maynor and @Simpo13.\n\nAsked for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson offered the following statement: \u201cThis technique requires a user to disable Protected Mode and click through one or more additional\u00a0prompts. We encourage customers to use caution when opening suspicious email attachments.\u201d\n\nCraig Williams, senior threat researcher and global outreach manager at Talos, told SC Media that Cisco's threat intelligence team first observed the SEC phishing campaign on October 10. In its report, Talos does not elaborate on which companies were specifically targeted by the phishing operation, other than to note that the intended victims were similar to those targeted in prior DNSMessenger campaigns. But Williams informed SC Media that the targets included insurance, finance, and IT companies.\n\nIn this latest attack, the phishers distributed emails that were spoofed to look like they came from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, a platform that corporations use to file their financial reports. The malicious Word document attached to these emails contained logos and branding that contributed to the illusion that the SEC was the sender.\n\nOpening the attachment would trigger a notification indicating that the document contains links to external files, and asking the user for permission to import and display this content. Agreeing to do so triggered the infection, as the document would use the Windows DDE protocol to retrieve malicious code from a compromised government website owned by the state of Louisiana.\n\nThe downloaded code, executed via Powershell, would then commerce the complex infection chain, at which time key blocks of code are decoded and deobfuscated, and the malware studies the infected system to determine how best to achieve persistence, based characteristics such as the user's privilege level. The malware then sets up the DNS-based C&C infrastructure, including defining a\u00a0list of domains that will be used for communications, before presumably executing the final payload. (Talos is crediting another researcher\u00a0known as Wraith Hacker with documenting the final stage of this infection chain.)\n\n\"This attack shows the level of sophistication that is associated with threats facing organizations today,\" Talos notes in its blog post. \"The use of DNS as a conveyance for later stage code and C2 communications is also becoming more and more commonplace.\"\n\nUnrelated to this phishing campaign, the SEC's EDGAR platform was also recently breached by hackers who accessed various companies' documents and used the information gleaned to profit from insider trading.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "North Korea spearphishing campaign aimed at U.S. power grid", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/north-korea-spearphishing-campaign-aimed-at-us-power-grid/article/699599/", "title": "North Korea spearphishing campaign aimed at U.S. power grid", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "October 11, 2017", "body": "Cyberattackers linked to the North Korean government were likely behind a spearphishing email campaign against U.S. electric companies that was detected and thwarted by FireEye.\n\n\u201cThis activity was early-stage reconnaissance, and not necessarily indicative of an imminent, disruptive cyberattack that might take months to prepare if it went undetected,\u201d FireEye said in a blog post that explained the company \u201cpreviously detected groups we suspect are affiliated with the North Korean government compromising electric utilities in South Korea, but these compromises did not lead to a disruption of the power supply.\u201d\n\nBlake Darche', Co-founder & CSO, Area 1 Security, said that since \u201cenergy companies are a major target for phishing attacks...it isn't surprising to see\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u00a0preparing for a cyber war against the United States should any escalations occur on the\u00a0Korean\u00a0Peninsula.\u201d\n\nNoting that nation-states will often attempt to \u201cgather intelligence and prepare for contingencies\u201d by conducing cyberespionage operations, FireEye said that \u201cthe few examples of disruptions to energy sector operations being caused by cyber operations required additional technical and operational steps that these North Korean actors do not appear to have taken nor have shown the ability to take.\u201d\n\nResearchers have not discovered \u201csuspected North Korean actors using any tool or method specifically designed to compromise or manipulate the industrial control systems (ICS) networks that regulate the supply of power,\u201d the blog said. \u201cFurthermore, we have not uncovered evidence that North Korean linked actors have access to any such capability at this time.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Top 5 anti-phishing training programs", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/top-5-anti-phishing-training-programs/article/699119/", "title": "Top 5 anti-phishing training programs ", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 10, 2017", "body": "With phishing and business email compromise-style attacks the primary methods used by cybercriminals to gain access to an organization, it is imperative that employees be taught what to look out for when going through their email.

For the most part, these fields are publicly-facing, and serve as one of the first things validated upon receipt of a friend request or incoming message.\"\n\n\"Attackers maximize opportunities for engagement by impersonating legitimate users or by fine-tuning profile fields and interactions to lure targets,\" Tully continued. \"Once socially engineered, a target's trust can be leveraged to extract personal information or deliver malicious payloads.\"\n\nSam Curry, Chief Security Officer at\u00a0endpoint threat detection company\u00a0Cybereason, said in emailed comments that training company employees to identify and avoid phishing scams is not a panacea, and that technology must be created \"for how users really behave and not some mythical ideal user.\"\n\n\"Today, the million-dollar solution doesn't exist, but as an industry we can start building solutions that work with how people really behave instead of continually trying to change their behavior, because between now and the end of mankind people will keep clicking on stuff,\" said Curry.\n\nIn April 2017, OurMine executed what it called the largest hack in\u00a0YouTube\u00a0history, after changing the written content on hundreds of the video service's channels. Even more\u00a0recent OurMine shenanigans include defacing WikiLeaks' home page, hacking Real Madrid's Twitter accounts, and hacking HBO's Facebook and Twitter accounts.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/social-media/topic/47245/", "topic_name": "Social Media"}]}, {"news_name": "LinkedIn Premium accounts being used in phishing scam", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/linkedin-premium-accounts-being-used-in-phishing-scam/article/688591/", "title": "LinkedIn Premium accounts being used in phishing scam", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 13, 2017", "body": "LinkedIn and Wells Fargo have found themselves once again at the center of a cyber issue, but this time hackers are using the business-oriented social media site to send phishing InMails posing as a Wells Fargo document.\n\nMalwarebytes Senior Researcher Jerome Segura wrote in a blog that the current crop of phishing attacks use previously hacked LinkedIn Premium accounts as a starting point. These accounts are used because they can send InMails not only to their connections, but also to other LinkedIn members. \n\nLike most phishing scams, the initial contact appears innocuous. Segurua said the target receives an InMail stating:\n\nView shared document http://ow.ly/[]\n\nThe shortened URL, a well-known dodge used to spread a malicious link, leads to a phishing site where those using Gmail and the other common email providers are asked to login in using their credentials. This leads to their username, password and phone number being stolen, however, to keep the victim from being suspicious about this activity a fake document, purportedly from Wells Fargo wealth management, is included apparently to act as the document mentioned in the original InMail.\n\nSegura said an unknown number of Premium accounts must have been previously hacked in order for the hackers to begin their crime spree. But once inside even a few accounts the malicious actor can quickly spread out. Malwarebytes offered an example of one phishing email that was sent by a person with 500 connections plus access to everyone else on LinkedIn. \n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cThis kind of attack via social media is not new \u2013 we have seen hacked Skype or Facebook accounts send spam \u2013 but it reminds us of how much more difficult it is to block malicious activity when it comes from long standing and trusted user accounts, not to mention work acquaintances or relatives. This also makes such attacks more credible to potential victims and can lead to a snowball effect when victims become purveyors of phishing links themselves,\u201d Segura wrote.\n\nSpotting a fake InMail is no simple exercise. The criminals manage to spoof the security footer message that is tacked on to each InMail, although LinkedIn does point out that this method is not foolproof.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the delivery method is to be trusted, but the content may not. The same can be said for phishing pages that use HTTPS \u2013 which is the case here \u2013 making content delivery secure but the content itself fraudulent,\u201d Segura said. \u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/social-media/topic/47245/", "topic_name": "Social Media"}]}, {"news_name": "Return of the EMOTET Trojan, spreads via spambots", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/emotet-trojan-returns-with-new-variants-and-targets/article/687619/", "title": "Return of the EMOTET Trojan, spreads via spambots", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "September 08, 2017", "body": "The EMOTET trojan is back, this time spreading via Spam bots.\n\nTrend Micro researchers first spotted the banking malware using network sniffing to steal data back in 2014 and recently spotted an increase in activity in August 2017 coming from new variants that all had the potential to unleash different types of payloads, according to a Sept. 7 blog post.\n\nThe latest versions were spotted TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJLA, TSPY_EMOTET.SMD3, TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJKW, and TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJKV and each had the potential to drop different malicious payloads. Researchers attributed the malware's resurfacing to two main possible reasons first, the authors behind the attacks may be targeting new regions and because and second, because the new variants are using multiple ways to spread.\n\nEarlier EMOTET variants primarily targeted the banking sector while newer variants have been spotted targeted various industries including manufacturing, food and beverage, and healthcare. The newer variants are also spreading primarily through spam botnets as well as via a network propagation module that brute forces its way into an account domain using a dictionary attack. Some variants also use compromised URLs as C&C servers likely helped it spread as well.\n\nThe bulk of infections are in the U.S. which account for 58 percent of all detected infections, while Great Britain and Canada were at 12 percent and 8 percent respectively.\n\nThe new EMOTET variants often are sent via phishing emails claiming to be an invoice or payment notification with the body of the email containing a malicious URL. Clicking the link will download a document containing malicious macros designed to execute a PowerShell command line responsible for downloading the trojan. \n\n\u201cThe malware will attempt to ease its entry into the system by deleting the Zone Identifier Alternate Data Stream (ADS), which is a string of information that describes the Internet Explorer Trust Settings of the file's download source,\u201d researchers said in the post. \u201cThis is one way for the system to find out if a downloaded file is from a high-risk source, blocking the download if it is detected as such.\u201d\n\nThe trojan will then register itself as a system service and add registry entries to ensure that it is automatically executed at every system startup, the post said.\n\nIn addition to the malicious payload, the trojan's command and control server is also responsible for sending modules that will perform spamming module routines, network worm module routines mail password viewer routines, and web browser password viewer routines. \n\nTo address these issues, researchers recommend the use of multilayered and proactive approach to security as well as endpoint solutions.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Major malspam campaign pushing Locky via spoofed internal email addresses", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/major-malspam-campaign-pushing-locky-ransomware-via-spoofed-internal-email-addresses/article/685544/", "title": "Major malspam campaign pushing Locky ransomware via spoofed internal email addresses", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 31, 2017", "body": "A large malspam campaign using spoofed email addresses has attempted to infect recipients with Locky ransomware in roughly 20 million detected attacks since Tuesday, researchers from Barracuda Networks have reported.\n\nAccording to Fleming Shi, Barracuda's senior vice president of advanced technology engineering, it appears that the bot behind the campaign is able to generate fake email addresses that make it look as if the offending email is arriving internally from the recipients' own organization. \"This makes it a little more likely people will click on it,\" said Shi, speaking with SC Media.\n\nIn a\u00a0blog post published on Thursday, Barracuda states that the emails come with a 7-zip attachment that purports to be documentation related to a business payment, but actually contains a malicious JavaScript file.

In addition, a South Korean bitcoin exchange was hit, possibly by North Korean hackers. \n\nBitcoin is currently valued at about $4,500 while Ethereum is at $382, but so far this year the former's value has increased more than 380 percent and the latter's is up 4,000 percent making each a worthwhile target. The fact that these funds can be harvested digitally has always made them a target for attack, or mining, but the higher their value the more interest will be garnered.\n\n\u201cMalware has existed since at least 2011 that harvest's bitcoin wallets.\u00a0 Crypto-currency is becoming more mainstream.\u00a0 Ransomware has certainly bought it to the fore and now the public are aware of it, thus more people use it, there is more money contained within those systems and cybercriminals follow the money.\u00a0 They see it as a good ROI for them,\u201d Carl Leonard, principal security analyst at Forcepoint, told SC Media.\n\nPaul Bischoff, privacy advocate for Comparitech.com, said the scam his company found also has been going on for years, but he believes the uptick in cryptocurrency value will spur more illegal activity. \n\n\"This particular scam has been in place since 2015, so I don't think it had much to do with the rising valuations of Bitcoin and Ethereum. More broadly speaking, however, cryptocurrencies have never been more popular. That fact combined with their rising value does make them an increasingly lucrative target for cyber criminals. As long as those two trends continue, I don't see any reason for thieves to back off,\u201d he told SC Media.\n\nLeonard agreed, adding that he believes cyber bank robbers will start adapting different types of malware to go after cryptocurrencies.\n\nPart of that can be seen with what has taken place with Trickbot.\n\nTrickbot, which is used against large financial institutions to steal conventional currency, has been updated by a user to include the cryptocurrency exchange coinbase.com as a target to go along with the 130 or so bank already on its list. Adding a new institution is not unusual, in June Paypal was added, but now the trojan has the ability to place non-traditional currencies at risk, said Forcepoint analyst Roland Dela Paz.\n\nDespite the new capability, the attack scenario remains the same with the victim receiving an email purportedly from a major financial institution in which the person is told to download what turns out to be a malicious attachment containing Trickbot. Forcepoint has so far captured 8,600 emails from the UK, France and Canada using this scheme.\n\nThe scheme uncovered by Comparitech.com is much more complicated and specifically targets current bitcoin users, specifically those interested in what is termed bitcoin mixing. This is the practice of taking money from one bitcoin account and breaking it into hundreds of smaller transactions so that it can be transferred to another account anonymously. In this case the bad guys have hidden links within apparently legitimate article that pose as tutorials on how to conduct a bitcoin mixing transaction and includes links to two bitcoin mixing services, but these in fact lead to phishing sites that simply steal the person's cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat makes this operation so successful is the \u201carticles\u201d appear at the top of any Google search for bitcoin mixing so they are the most likely to be grabbed and used by a beginner cryptocurrency user.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Spambot weaponizes 711M accounts to spread Ursnif malware", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/researcher-spots-massive-spambot-made-of-711m-compromised-accounts/article/685423/", "title": "Spambot weaponizes 711M accounts to spread Ursnif malware", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "August 30, 2017", "body": "A Paris-based security researcher, by the pseudonym Benkow spotted a massive spambot, dubbed Onliner, weaponizing 711 million email and server accounts to distribute phishing emails laced with malware looking to steal user data.\n\nBenkow discovered the spambot on an open and accessible web server hosted in the Netherlands, that was being used to store dozens of text files containing the email addresses, passwords, and email servers used to send spam messages.\n\nThe spambot was collecting stolen email credentials and server login info stemming from previous data breaches, such\u00a0as the LinkedIn and Badoo hacks, as well also other unknown sources in order\u00a0to send the emails through \u201clegitimate servers\u201d in an attempt to circumvent spam filters, according to a ZDNet report.\n\nThe spambot used 80 million of the compromised email servers to send spam emails to the remaining 630 million targets emails to \u201cfingerprint\u201d potential victims to find ones that were using Windows computers to ultimately spread Ursnif malware, iPhone or Android users aren't affected by the malware.\n\nThe malware arrives as an attachment via malicious email which then drops component files onto infected systems and creates auto start registries to ensure automatic execution startup.

Never click links to their site from anywhere, especially email and social media,\u201d he said. \u201cBe very wary of anyone soliciting donations because oftentimes, these are not legitimate organizations which can lead to potential scams.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOn Friday when meterologists were predicting the worst, Todd Hinnen, a partner with Perkins Coie and the former acting assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department, warned that critical infrastructure could be at risk and vulnerable to attack. \u201cThe operators of critical infrastructures like the power grid practice defense in depth \u2013 layered security controls intended to continue to protect the infrastructure even if one or more of them is compromised \u2013 and build redundancy into their systems to support business continuity,\u201d said Hinnen.\u00a0 \u201cWhen a networked system is brought under stress, whether by a hurricane, some other natural event, or a physical attack, however, the risk of compromise is always higher, and the data security experts responsible for protecting those networks must be on high alert to detect and prevent potential compromises or attacks seeking to take advantage of that vulnerability.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Recent phishing attacks reportedly capitalize on Office 365 security holes", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/recent-phishing-attacks-reportedly-capitalize-on-office-365-security-holes/article/684453/", "title": "Recent phishing attacks reportedly capitalize on Office 365 security holes", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 25, 2017", "body": "Researchers from cloud security company Avanan have reported finding two ways that phishers are evading Microsoft Office\u00a0365\u00a0Security protections: one using \"hexidecimal escape characters\" to conceal coding and links, and the other by compromising SharePoint files.\n\nThe first method involves emails\u00a0with an HTML attachment that contain a small excerpt of JavaScript that is obscured in hexadecimal escape characters. \"Therefore, no links are visible, but when opened, it presents a locally-generated phishing page with login instructions,\" the company explains in an Aug. 24 blog post.\n\nIn one recent example, Avanan came across\u00a0a phishing email, purportedly sent by PayPal, that displayed a fraudulent login page, asking for account information such as name, address, phone number and password. By entering the information and clicking a submit button, the recipient unknowingly transmits his or her information to the cybercriminals.\n\nAvanan reports that these emails are good at evading detection because their malicious links are hidden, the fake login-page is locally produced, and sandbox technologies generally don't consider HTML files with a submit button as suspicious.\u00a0\n\nAccording to a second Avanan blog post, the attack that abuses SharePoint generally involves an email that leverages \"a genuine invoice from a commonly used online site, with a publicly open link to Office 365 SharePoint,\" which is a web-based, collaborative platform for Microsoft Office users.\u00a0Clicking the link executes a JavaScript-based file that infects the endpoint.\n\nAvanan claims that the phishing emails elude detection because Microsoft assumes SharePoint files are safe, as Microsoft originally developed the application. \"Most people would assume that files on SharePoint and OneDrive would be scanned for malware, but the fact is that the scanning tools Microsoft uses for Office 365 are not used for files within SharePoint and OneDrive files. Even if the malware is identified once, the same file in a different location in SharePoint will not be blocked,\" Avanan has reported.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with Avanan's claims,\" said a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement emailed to SC Media. \"Microsoft's filters do not rely on the specific techniques described in the vendor post, and our solutions regularly detect and flag these kinds of attacks. In addition, we always encourage customers to use caution when clicking on links and opening emails from unknown senders.\u201d\n\nAvanan suspects that Chinese cybercriminals may be behind the SharePoint operation, due to use of a malicious domain that was registered this week from China.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Locky makes a strong comeback, propelled by botnet-fuel spam campaign", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/locky-makes-a-strong-comeback-propelled-by-botnet-fuel-spam-campaign/article/682638/", "title": "Locky makes a strong comeback, propelled by botnet-fuel spam campaign", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 17, 2017", "body": "Reports have been pouring in this month about the sudden return of Locky ransomware, which had been largely dormant in 2017. In short order, researchers have discovered two new major versions of Locky being distributed via voluminous malspam campaigns.\n\nThe first variant to emerge is a version called Diablo6, named after the .diablo6 file extension that it appends to encrypted files. BleepingComputer has credited its discovery to researcher \"Racco42,\" who tweeted about his findings back on Aug. 9, when the attacks reportedly began in earnest.\n\nA newer variant with similar behavior appeared on Aug. 16, capturing the attention of Malwarebytes analysts, as well as researcher Rommel Joven, who were both early to report on their findings. This version appends the extension \".Lukitus\" to affected files.\n\nMany of the spam emails have subject lines featuring simply a date and random number, with a minimalist message body that states: \"Files attached. Thanks\". However, Fortinet\u00a0researchers found a more content-rich email sample with a subject line referencing a business document from a company, with a message claiming the attachment is an invoice for purchased goods.\n\nFortinet statistics show that most of the Diablo6 spam has been distributed to the U.S. (37 percent) and Austria (36 percent), followed by Great Britain, Denmark and India, the company reported in an Aug. 14 blog post.\n\nComodo Group\u00a0said in a separate report that from Aug. 9-11 it detected more than 62,000 Diablo6 phishing emails on endpoints that it monitors. (Comodo, however, refers to the threat as IKARUSdilapidated.) The company also found that the attackers are leveraging more than 11,600 different IP addresses from 133 countries to execute the campaign. The team checking the IP range owners noticed that most are telecom companies and ISPs.\u00a0For this reason, Comodo is also classifying this threat as a botnet as well.\n\nIndeed, according to a Malwarebytes\u00a0blog post, both the Diablo6 and Lukitus versions are being pushed via the\u00a0Necurs botnet.\n\nLocky debuted in 2016, but faded from the scene somewhat this year as attackers moved on to other ransomware families. Occasionally, however, Locky would rear its ugly head again, including during a large Necurs-fueled campaign this past April.\n\nThe Diablo6 spam sample that Racco42 found has an attached a zip file containing a VBS downloader script, which includes a URL from which the Locky ransomware executable is downloaded and subsequently executed. Malwarebytes spotted this too on Aug. 9, but then observed in the following days campaigns\u00a0using PDFs embedded with malicious .DOCM files and RAR and ZIP files embedded with .JS malware.\n\nFortinet also reported in its blog post that it found two unique hashes of Diablo6, which\u00a0means \"newly created samples are being pushed, possibly with different configurations, or simply as an attempt to evade specific file signatures.\"\n\nDiablo6's ransomwares note asks for .49 bitcoins or roughly $1,600, BleepingComputer reported. If a machine is infected with either the Diablo6 or Lukitus version of Locky, its files cannot be successfully decrypted.\n\n\"It's still too early to say if this campaign signals the start of Locky diving back into the ransomware race or if it is just testing the waters,\" the Fortinet blog post stated. \"We'll probably see in the next few weeks or months, or maybe never.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Malicious PowerPoint Slide Show files exploit Microsoft bug to deliver REMCOS RAT", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malicious-powerpoint-slide-show-files-exploit-microsoft-bug-to-deliver-remcos-rat/article/682003/", "title": "Malicious PowerPoint Slide Show files exploit Microsoft bug to deliver REMCOS RAT", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 15, 2017", "body": "In what researchers are calling a first, malware distributors are now maliciously crafting PowerPoint Open XML Slide Show (PPSX) files to take advantage of a Microsoft Office vulnerability that is more typically exploited with Rich Text File documents.\n\nThe bug in this case is\u00a0CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability\u00a0in Microsoft Office's Windows\u00a0Object linking and Embedding interface, according to Trend Micro, whose researchers uncovered the scheme. Microsoft patched this bug in April 2017.\n\nThe newly discovered attack technique is tied to a spear phishing campaign that has largely focused on companies in the electronics manufacturing industry. In this instance, the intent is to infect businesses with\u00a0a trojanized version of the REMCOS remote access tool (RAT), which comes with myriad features for attackers, including the ability to download and execute commands, a keylogger, a screen logger, and webcam and microphone recorders.\n\nIn an Aug. 14 blog post, Trend Micro threat analysts Ronnie Giagone and Rubio Wu\u00a0said that the adversaries likely swapped RTF files with PPSX files to change things up and \"evade antivirus detection.\"\n\nThe threat first arrives in the form of a spear phishing email that appears to be sent from a cable manufacturing provider looking to place a large order. The email specifically asks if the recipient can supply a list of items, requesting a price quote and estimated delivery date.\n\nHowever, upon opening up the attached file, all the recipient actually sees is a PPSX\u00a0document that displays the vulnerability identifier \"CVE-2017-8570.\" Strangely, this is not the vulnerability actually being exploited (as referenced before, the vulnerability being abused is CVE-2017-0199) \u2013\u00a0 a quirk that Trend Micro chalks up to an error on the part of the toolkit developer.\n\nThe malicious PPSX file leverages the exploit to download another file, which Trend Micro detects as JS_DLOADER.AUSYVT, from an abused VPN or hosting service. This XML file, written in JavaScript, is essentially a malicious downloader program that runs a PowerShell command in order to retrieve the main REMCOS payload, which is camouflaged using various obfuscations and protections.\n\nThe first sample of PPSX malware that Trend Micro came across was on July 28. At first, \"there was very little traffic in the days following this initial detection. It's only in the last week that we've seen a increase in this malware in the wild,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Mark Nunnikhoven, VP of cloud research for Trend Micro, in an email interview with SC Media.\n\n\"Cases like this highlight the need for users to be cautious when opening files or clicking links in their emails \u2013\u00a0 even if they come from seemingly legitimate sources,\" the blog post advises. \"Spear phishing attempts can be rather sophisticated, and as seen with this example, can trick most users into downloading malicious files.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trend Micro reported on a different\u00a0spear phishing campaign, targeting Russian-speaking businesses, that infects victims with a backdoor program, using malformed RTF files that also exploit\u00a0CVE-2017-0199.\n\nTod Beardsley, research director at Rapid7, said in emailed comments that while the attackers' use of Power Point Slide Show may be of interest to security researchers, the more significant takeaway is that these campaigns continue to work because many users fail to patch vulnerabilities and open suspicious attachments.\n\n\u201cSecurity researchers continue to be fascinated with novel attack vectors, exotic cryptography attacks, and zero-day vulnerabilities, but out in the real world, people are dealing with 120+ day vulnerabilities that depend on users failing to install patches and running malicious code emailed to them by strangers,\" said\u00a0Beardsley.\u00a0Spearphishing with malicious attachments continues to be a devastatingly effective technique for online criminals, and we in security need to be doing a better job when it comes to partnering with our friends in IT operations and software development to make this attack more expensive and less effective.\"\n\n\"The fact is, the headlines around CVE-2017-0199 could have been written any time in the last 15 years,\" Beardsley continued. \"This alone tells me that we're clearly not making enough headway against phishing campaigns.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Lazarus Group tied to new phishing campaign targeting defense industry workers", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/lazarus-group-tied-to-new-phishing-campaign-targeting-defense-industry-workers/article/681701/", "title": "Lazarus Group tied to new phishing campaign targeting defense industry workers", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 14, 2017", "body": "The suspected North Korean APT collective known as the Lazarus Group\u00a0appears to be targeting individuals associated with U.S. defense contractors, including prospective employees, with phishing emails that display fake job listings and companies' internal policies.\n\nAccording to a blog post by Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 division, this newly discovered campaign uses the same infrastructure, tools, tactics, and files that were employed in the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, as well as a recent campaign, detailed in April, that\u00a0targeted Korean-speaking individuals. Therefore, researchers contend that this latest attack is being carried out by the same group that either spearheaded or closely collaborated on these earlier campaigns, both of which were allegedly executed by Lazarus.\n\nTo infect victims, the attackers are using Microsoft Office document files \u2013 most likely hosted on compromised servers and distributed via phishing emails \u2013 that are weaponized with the same malicious VBA macros that were found in the previous campaign targeting Korean speakers.\n\nBut this time, the decoy documents are written in English. One such document describes a purported job opening for a mechanical\u00a0engineering integration manager for the THAAD interceptor, an anti-ballistic\u00a0missile defense\u00a0system, while another shows a job listing for a director of sales and business development at Sikorskys Mission Equipment.\n\nThe final malware payload is \"extremely similar\" to the one used in the campaign targeting Korean-speakers, notes the blog post, authored by Palo Alto researchers Anthony Kasza\u00a0and\u00a0Micah Yates.\n\n\"The payload is a pretty generic backdoor that gives the attacker the ability to execute commands on the infected system,\" said\u00a0Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Unit 42.\u00a0\"While this capability is rather simple, it acts as a foothold in the network which would allow the attacker to install additional tools or attempt to spread laterally to other hosts in the network.\" Clearly, such abilities are especially alarming when the infected machine belongs to an individual working within the defense sector.\n\nThe decoy documents distributed in both the latest campaign and the previous one targeting Korean-speakers both feature the same metadata author \"ISkyISea,\" and both campaigns share of the same IPv4 addresses for hosting the Word documents on command-and-control servers.\n\nPalo Alto researchers also found plenty of ties between this new operation and the Sony Pictures hack, such as the \"reuse of macro source code, XOR keys used within the macro to decode implant payloads, and the functional overlap in the payloads the macros write to disk.\" Other shared techniques include \"use of a fake TLS communications protocol, encoded strings within samples, filenames and contents of batch files embedded within implants, as well implants beaconing directly to IPv4 addresses (and not resolving domains for command and control).\"\n\nAccording to the blog post, there is little reason to believe that this threat actor will stop reaching its same bag of tricks, considering that it has continued to do so even after being publicly exposed.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name":

The hacker who goes by Mr. Smith posted five scripts for Game of Thrones and a month's worth of email from HBO Vice President for Film Programming Leslie Cohen along with some other corporate information, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe general consensus among cybersecurity insiders is the hacker was able to procure this information through a series of small attacks conducted over an extended period of time tied to poor security practices by either by HBO or perhaps a third-party vendor. Mr. Smith seemed to confirm the timeline saying the $6 million ransom amount is tied to the length of time his crew spent on the hack, about six months.\n\n\u201cThrough a persistent effort of phishing, malware attacks and plain old social engineering, the attackers likely compromised many individual identities. Once these identities are compromised, the attackers can inject malware onto systems that over time learn more passwords and allow them lateral access into other systems on the network,\u201d Corey Williams, Centrify's senior director of products and Marketing, told SC Media.\n\nAnother strong possibility is HBO is simply another victim of partnering with a third-party vendor that either made an error or did not have its cybersecurity ducks lined up in a row. If this turns out to be true HBO will join a long list of companies, to include Verizon, Trump Hotels, Hard Rock and Scottrade, which suffered a data breach due to one of these ancillary companies proving to be a weak link.\n\n\u201cThey have to treat intellectual property (IP) with the same level of protection that banks treat regulated customer information \u2013 that is it should be given the highest level of IT security controls and data privacy protection.\u00a0 Then in those instances where a studio has outsourced to a vendor (e.g. Larson Studios and the Netflix hack), they must insure that their vendors employ equally strong security,\u201d Brad Keller, director 3rd Party Strategy for Prevalent, said in an email interview with SC Media.\n\n\u00a0HBO launched an investigation into the initial attack that took place on August 1 when its CEO and Chairman Richard Plepler confirmed the cable company had been victimized. So far the company has not released any information.\n\nWhatever the company discovers during its investigation, along with its decision on whether or not is should pay the $6 million ransom will prove quite educational for other media firms who may find themselves victimized in a similar manner. \n\nAs with most ransomware situations, the consensus on whether or not the victim should pay up was split. If the data is deemed more valuable than the ransom and it cannot be replicated than breaking out the corporate check book might be in order, but otherwise, if at all possible, the bad guys should not be paid off.\n\n\u201cIt's a business decision, plain and simple. If an attacker was threatening to release the new Star Wars movie early, I'd want to understand the business impact of that. If it meant that there would be a decrease in people attending movies or buying merchandise in dollar amounts that exceeded the amount of the ransom, I'd at least consider coming to the table and negotiating,\u201d said James Carder, CISO of LogRhythm.\n\nHowever, everyone did agree that snatching IP was a smart move as it forces the company to quickly make a decision over what is essentially a product with an expiration date. And they did not rule out that despite asking for money the hacker could have an ulterior motive, one similar to the Sony hack that was focused on damaging the studio for the release of the anti-North Korea movie \u201cThe Interview.\u201d\n\n\u201c\"Intellectual property is particularly well suited to ransomware attacks because there is little way to repair the damage after it has been released.\u00a0 In the case of movies and/or episodes, there is an immediate diminution in market value,\u201d Keller said.\n\nWilliams agreed, adding the negative consequences of pre-releasing brand defining IP can be tremendous with the possibility of subscriptions being impacted in HBO's case.\n\nCarder did add that if a company manages to save a few dollars in negotiating to pay a lower ransom it would be smart to take that money and invest in boosting its cybersecurity. And he had a few suggestions on where to invest with the most important point made being the amount the company invests should be near the equivalent to the value of what it is trying to protect.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there isn't a silver bullet or one thing these studios can do. It's a combination of things that must happen. Studios must practice good IT and security hygiene (patching systems and applications, updating and modernizing systems/applications/infrastructure, controlling access to only those that need access, validating identities, encrypting or applying other safeguards to critical business systems and data). They also must implement stringent monitoring and alerting mechanisms as compensating controls for when or if an attacker breaks through their defenses,\u201d Carder said.\n\nWilliams noted that even improving some basic security protocols would be a huge help. The first change he suggested is to stop relying on passwords as a line of defense to protect intellectual property. Next is to implement multifactor authentication and utilize machine learning to halts attacks as they happen.\n\nWhile there are many things companies must do to increase security, the one thing they cannot do is underestimate their enemies, said Matthew Pascucci, Cybersecurity Practice Manager at CCSI.\n\n\"The HBO hack should be taken seriously. Anytime a malicious actor has your sensitive data and is releasing it to the public they've earned the right to be taken serious. How HBO responds to their demands and moves forward with the isolation of the incident will determine what needs to be done moving forward from a hardening and process perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the end it may be hard to discern what will be the final result of this attack. HBO may determine how it was done, but unless it publicly states that it paid, or the hacker makes such a disclosure, the world may not know. Unlike the NotPetya attack, which has negatively impacted the financials of FedEx and Maersk, HBO may pass through this incident unscathed.

So far, researchers have identified five separate waves of phishing emails between June 23 and July 27, each one using a different email lure to trick recipients into infecting themselves.\n\nDesigned to look like they originated from sales and bill departments, the\u00a0deceptive phishing emails seemingly include a DOC attachment featuring instructions for connecting clients or payment applications. However, in reality, these so-called Word documents are actually\u00a0malformed RTF files that exploit CVE-2017-0199, a well-known vulnerability\u00a0in Microsoft Office's Windows\u00a0Object linking and Embedding interface.\n\nCVE-2017-0199 is a remote code execution bug affecting the way that Windows and WordPad software programs parse specially crafted files. Microsoft fixed the bug in April 2017, six months after it was discovered.\u00a0According to a Reuters report, hackers, including the Iran government-linked\u00a0OilRig\u00a0threat,\u00a0have been regularly exploiting this flaw -- in some cases to\u00a0spy on targeted users, implant malware, and steal banking credentials.\n\nIn this latest campaign that targets Russian businesses, the initial infection catalyzes a rather complex attack chain that\u00a0abuses a combination of legitimate Windows components and features,\u00a0which helps it elude detection by bypassing restrictions\u00a0on running scripts and evading whitelist protections.\n\nSpecifically, the abused components and features\u00a0consist of: mshta.exe, an executable file responsible for opening HTA and HTML files;\u00a0odbcconf.exe,\u00a0a command-line tool that configures ODBC drivers and data source names; and\u00a0Regsvr32, the Microsoft Register\u00a0Server command-line utility, used for registering DLLs and ActiveX controls in the Windows Registry.\n\n\"What is interesting about this malware is the methods it has chained together in order to provide that backdoor. It leverages several legitimate Windows techniques in order to open up the victim's systems... These tools have legitimate uses on the system and disabling them will impact the productivity of the system,\" said Mark Nunnikhoven, VP of Cloud Research for Trend Micro, in an email interview with SC Media.\n\n\"This is a trend we're seeing more and more this year: several less critical issues being linked together like stepping stones used to reach a more important goal.\"\n\n\nThe abuse of\u00a0Regsvr32 is an attack method known as Squiblydoo. According to Trend Micro, this is the first time a malware attack chain has leveraged both Squiblydoo and odbcconf.exe.\n\nIn the early stages of infection, the CVE-2017-0199 exploit downloads a fake Excel spreadsheet file, which is embedded with malicious JavaScript, from an attacker-controlled domain. The malicious file abuses mshta.exe, which opens the fake XLS file as an HTML application, the blog post explains. This process enables two PowerShell scripts, one of which downloads a decoy document to keep up appearances, while the other downloads a DLL file.\n\nExecuted via odbcconf.exe, the DLL in turn abuses Regsvr32\u00a0in order to execute a SCT (Windows Scriptlet) file containing a malicious, obfuscated JavaScript. Finally this JS file downloads and executes the final XML payload.\u00a0\n\nTo protect oneself against this campaign, Trend Micro has recommended vigilant patching and updates, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, virtual patching, and URL categorization. \"Apart from enforcing the principle of least privilege, system administrators should also consider disabling system components that aren't necessary to the user's tasks,\" the blog post states. \"Another option is to blacklist possible command interpreters and rarely used applications, even if they are Windows components themselves,\" even though this could disable certain legitimate system functions.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Email malware, phishing and spam attempts hit new highs for 2017", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-malware-phishing-and-spam-attempts-hit-new-highs-for-2017/article/680281/", "title": "Email malware, phishing and spam attempts hit new highs for 2017", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "August 07, 2017", "body": "The number of emails carrying malware increased to a new high in July with one in every 359 emails carrying a malicious payload, according to Symantec's July Intelligence Report.\n\nJuly also saw increases in the number of phishing attempts and spam, but the increasing use by cybercriminals of email to spread malware took center stage reaching a level not seen since December 2016. The rate of infected emails in July was one in 359, up from one in 451 in June and significantly higher than the one in 784 emails that was reported in January. However, even July's rate is much lower than what was happening in late 2016 when the number of emails carrying malware ranged between one and 111 and one and 170.\n\n\u201cThis trend in malware being distributed through email seems to be catching on, with several infamous malware families recently adding functionality that allows them to spread via spam email,\u201d the report said.\n\nThese trojans being Emotet and TrickBot with the former now having the ability to steal email credentials which are then used to send out more spam in order to propagate an attack. TrickBot is now also using spam posing as an invoice from a financial institution to spread itself, but the new email feature has not been fully implemented yet so this could become a more serious threat.\n\nIn July most email malware targeted the agricultural, forestry, mining and public administration industries with companies employing between 1 and 250 and 1,001 to 1,500 people being hit most often.\n\nUnlike the email malware rate which is still below its record levels, the amount of spam spewing into inboxes globally is at its highest rate since March 2015. This is, in part, related to the fact that Emotet and TrickBot are stealing email addresses to feed their spam campaigns. The other issued driving spam is illegal activity by legitimate firms. Symantec pointed to a $104,000 fine that was levied against the UK firm Moneysupermarket.com for sending 7.1 million emails to customers who had specifically opted out of receiving marketing emails.\n\nPhishing emails are also hitting recent highs with one in every 1,968 emails falling into this category in July, up ever so slightly from the one in 1,975 emails in June, but well above the one in every 9,138 emails that was reported in March 2017.\n\nThe mining industry was the most phished and was the top spam recipient, the report stated.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Hackers will weaponize AI, survey says", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hackers-will-weaponize-ai-survey-says/article/679622/", "title": "Hackers will weaponize AI, survey says", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "August 03, 2017", "body": "The majority of information security professionals (62 percent) surveyed by Cylance at Black Hat USA 2017 think that hackers will weaponize AI, using it offensively over the next year.\n\nOf the 100 respondents, 34 percent fingered Russia as the biggest threat to cybersecurity in the U.S., followed closely by organized crime at 33 percent, according to a Cylance blog post. \n\nPhishing topped the list of top organizational risks for 37 percent of those surveyed, while 40 percent said that the top cybersecurity issue within their organizations over the past three months has been patching and updating.\n\nMost respondents said they do not have confidence that law enforcement can make a dent in dark web activity, with 80 percent saying that law enforcement initiatives aimed at marketplaces on the dark web aren't likely to stem the tide of ransomware attacks.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}]}, {"news_name": "Prankster tricks Whitehouse cybersecurity advisor into thinking they're Jared Kushner", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-prankster-tricks-whitehouse-cybersecurity-advisor/article/678813/", "title": "Prankster tricks Whitehouse cybersecurity advisor into thinking they're Jared Kushner ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "August 01, 2017", "body": "A U.K.-based hacker managed to phish and spoof the accounts of a number of White House officials tricking other officials into believing they were conversing with colleagues. \n\nIn one incident, the self-described \u201cemail prankster\u201d managed to fool Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert, who advises on cybersecurity, into believing he/she was President Donald Trump's son-in-law\u00a0Jared Kushner\u00a0and convince him into disclosing his personal email address.\n\nThe prankster shared the email exchange with CNN.\n\n\"Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soir\u00e9e towards the end of August,\" the fake Jared Kushner said on an Outlook account. \"It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq.

To that end,\u00a0Vishwanath and a team from Buffalo have developed, and are currently testing, a 40-question test that helps determine a staffer's weak points when it comes to falling for a malicious email. The test results are then used to create a personalized training curriculum that will focus on the staffer's weak points.\n\n\u201cIt's a diagnosis,\u201d he said, noting the current system in use is like going to the doctor and having him throw pills at a patient, hoping that one of them cures the illness without bothering to ask what is wrong.\n\nThe test checks to see if the person's problem lies with a basic misunderstanding of cybersecurity or if he or she is the type of person who clicks on links from a trusted source, like Google or Amazon.

Vishwanath cited several studies that showed these methods do not result in any meaningful change in behavior.\n\nOne of the studies conducted by Vishwanath's team took 400 employees from an unnamed company, trained half of them using the other methods, and left the remainder as a control group.

The new procedure is in response to a recent phishing scam\u00a0involving a bogus Google Docs link being distributed via email.\n\nIn a blog post, Naveen Agarwal, a member of Google's Identity team, and Wesley Chun, developer advocate for G\u00a0Suite, said that Google was rolling out an 'unverified app' screen for newly created web applications and Apps Scripts that require verification.\n\n\"This new screen replaces the 'error' page that developers and users of unverified web apps receive today,\u201d they said.\n\nThis new \u201cunverified app\u201d screen comes before the permissions consent screen for the app and lets potential users know that the app has yet to be verified. This will help reduce the risk of user data being phished by bad actors, Google claimed.\n\nAccording to Google, the new notice will also help developers test their apps more easily.\n\n\u201cSince users can choose to acknowledge the \u2018unverified app' alert, developers can now test their applications without having to go through the OAuth client verification process first,\u201d said Agrawal and Chun.\n\nGoogle is also extending these protections to\u00a0Apps Script. As of last week, Apps Scripts requesting OAuth access to data from consumers or from users in other domains may also see the \"unverified app\" screen.\u00a0\n\n\u201cApps Script is proactively protecting users from abusive apps in other ways as well. Users will see new cautionary language reminding them to \u2018consider whether you trust' an application before granting OAuth access, as well as a banner identifying web pages and forms created by other users,\u201d said Agrawal and Chun.\n\nGoogle said it will extend the verification process beyond newly created apps, to existing apps as well. As a part of this expansion, developers of some current apps may be required to go through the verification flow, according to the blog post.\n\nAgrawal and Chun said that it was recommended that developers verify that their contact information is up-to-date. \u201cIn the\u00a0Google Cloud Console, developers should ensure that the appropriate and monitored accounts are granted either the project owner or billing account admin IAM role,\u201d they said. \u201cIn the API manager, developers should ensure that their OAuth consent screen configuration is accurate and up-to-date.\u201d\n\nGraeme Park, senior consultant at Mason Advisory, told SC Media UK that Google has taken substantial steps since the phishing attacks last year that targeted Google Docs users \u2013 with such a huge enterprise to consider and their position at the vanguard of the new technologies, there are bound to be security issues throughout their architecture. \n\n\u201cFrom a technical viewpoint they have certainly made headway. However, the user is still one of the key issues in this form of attack. I would like to see Google using its brand, market penetration and analytics to address the human component via some form of intuitively designed and delivered training system integrated into their online offering,\u201d he said. \n\nJohn Bambenek, threat intelligence manager at Fidelis Cybersecurity, told SC that the core difficulty with outsourcing core infrastructure to G Suite, O365, AWS, etc, is the limitations for central management. \n\n\u201cGoogle creating application whitelisting is a great step to fix this issue where admins can control specifically which applications can be used. However, it is not a fundamental game changer,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cOne of the reasons that Apple's iOS is such a secure platform is that applications only have defined ways they can interact with other applications, where Google's approach has been much more open. It's chief advantage is also its largest security issue,\u201d he added. \n\n\u201cPop-up warnings about verification or when sending e-mails to external parties help mitigate this disadvantage, but as we've seen with self-signed SSL/TLS certificates, most users will ignore warnings and plunge headlong into becoming victims. Unless these features are paired with effective security awareness training on what these changes mean to users, it is unlikely they will have much of an effect.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Time is Money: How many threat$ can you fit in a cyberminute?", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/time-is-money-evil-cybercrime-minutes-report/article/676182/", "title": "Time is Money: How many threat$ can you fit in a cyberminute?", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "July 19, 2017", "body": "We all know time is money but when it comes to cybercrime even a minute of down time could cost the mightiest of firms a hefty fine resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. \n\nIn 2016, cybercrime cost $856,164 every minute or $450 billion a year in the U.S., causing businesses to spend up to $142,694 per minute to defend against external cyber threats, according to RiskIQ Intelligence report \u201cThe Evil Internet Minute.\u201d\n\nThe report was meant to shine light on the growth of cybercrime over the years and how prevalent attacks have become.

This cookie, when downloaded, is powerful and is related to the single sign on (SSO) implementations of OAM. Essentially, a Super Cookie is issued when a user attempts to gain access to a protected resource.\n\n This flaw is due to the improper configuration of an OAM server by the host corporations, something Ahmed and his partner Tom Gillis found existed in 99 of the 100 companies investigated. Oracle informed the two researchers that mitigation simply requires that IT managers define SSODomains and directed them to these two websites.  \n\n http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15586_01/doc.1111/e15478/agents.htm\u00a0(search\u00a0\n    for SSODomains)\n\n http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15586_01/doc.1111/e15478/agents.htm#BABBJHEG\n\n \"We found hundreds of hundreds of high profile organisation with the same misconfiguration, all of them exposed against session hijacking. We analyzed\u00a0100 high profile domains\u00a0and\u00a0only 1\u00a0was properly secured against this attack! Unfortunately we cannot share the domains that are affected, but if you look for it you'll be able to find them,\" he wrote.\n\nThe problem the researchers discovered is the request to obtain a Super Cookie is handled by a GET request, which has a number of weaknesses that can be exploited. This includes it being cached, remaining in the browser's memory or even bookmarked. All things one does not want when protecting sensitive data.\n\n Ahmed outlined a basic road map of how one accesses an OAM server and obtains the Super Cookie via a GET request.\n\nAn authorized user queries the OAM server, the OAM server recognizes that the request is for data that requires authentication and directs the user to a login page. Then the OAM server sets an OAMREQ cookie identifying that end point as looking for data located at a specific website. Next, the login credentials are submitted and validated by the OAM server at which point the Super Cookie is sent via a \u00a0GET request giving the user access. There is also an open redirect received by the user after submitting their credentials that also makes the system vulnerable.\n\nWith these operations completed, the users computer is now vulnerable to an attacker.\n\n \u201cSince we can control where the user has to go and since we also can read the cookie value that is coming from the user we can hijack his session. All we have to do is entice the victim to click on the link that we provide him and log in, since he's logging in on the real login portal we are not raising any suspicion. If the user is already logged-in we will get his cookie without a problem and the victim won't notice a thing,\u201d Ahmed wrote.\n\n This is accomplished through a phishing email where the victim is prodded into clicking on a link. At this point the person is redirected to the login page and asked to submit their credentials and then redirected again to the attackers malicious domain where the users cookie will be stolen. The attacker will use this cookie to log into the system.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "As security gets tough, hackers revert to living off land, report", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/attackers-increasingly-using-tools-already-installed-on-targeted-computers/article/674609/", "title": "As security gets tough, hackers revert to living off land, report", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "July 12, 2017", "body": "Symantec researchers spotted attackers increasingly making use of tools already installed on targeted computers or running simple scripts and shellcode directly in memory in what researchers are calling\u00a0\u201cliving off the land\u201d tactics.\u00a0 \n\nThe researchers divided the techniques into four main categories --\u00a0memory-only threats, fileless persistence, dual use tools, and non-PE file attack, according to the \u201cISTR Living off the land and fileless attack techniques\u201d report.\n\nThese tactics allow threat actors to create fewer new files on the hard disk meaning they have less chance of being detected by traditional security tools and minimize their likelihood of being blocked. \n\nThe typical attack chain for these techniques are the incursion, persistence and payload.
