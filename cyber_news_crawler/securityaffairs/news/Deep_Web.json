Once the files are encrypted, the malicious code will place a ransom note (\u201c!!! ##### === ReadMe === ##### !!!.htm\u201c) in each folder it will encrypt files.\n\nThe operators behind the Data Keeper RaaS request their users to generate their samples and distribute them, in turn, they offer a share of the ransom fee when victims pay the ransom.

Operators of the major black markets in the darknets buy and sell code-signing certificates, but according to an interesting research conducted by threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, the prices for them are too expensive for most hackers.\n\nCybercriminals would use the Dark Web for selling high-grade code certificates -which they have obtained from trusted certificate authorities- to anyone that is interested in purchasing them.\n\nSales of code signing certificates have increased considerably since 2015 when experts from IBM X-Force researchers provided some best practice guides on checking for trusted certificates.\n\nDigital certificates allow companies to trust the source code of a software and to check its integrity, The certificates are issued by the certificate authorities (CAs) and are granted to companies that generate code, protocols or software so they can sign their code and indicate its legitimacy and originality.\n\nUsing signing certificates is similar to the hologram seal used on software packages, assuring they are genuine and issued from a trusted publisher. Users would receive alerts in an attempt to install files that are not accompanied by a valid certificate. This is why cybercriminals aim to use certificates for legitimizing the malware code they make.\n\nAccording to Andrei Barysevich, Director of Advanced Collection at Recorded Future, most of the code-signing certificates are obtained by hackers due to fraud and not from security breaches suffered by the CAs.\n\n\u201cRecorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group investigated the criminal underground and identified vendors currently offering both code signing certificates and domain name registration with accompanying SSL certificates.\u201d states the report published by Recorded Future.\n\n\u201cContrary to a common belief that the security certificates circulating in the criminal underground are stolen from legitimate owners prior to being used in nefarious campaigns, we confirmed with a high degree of certainty that the certificates are created for a specific buyer per request only and are registered using stolen corporate identities, making traditional network security appliances less effective.\u201d\n\nCybercriminals offer the precious commodity via online shops, when buyers place an order the shop\u2019s operators used stolen identities from a legitimate company and its employees to request the certificate for a fake app or website to the CAs (i.e. Comodo, Thawte, and Symantec).  The certificates are used to encrypt HTTPS traffic or sign apps.\n\nRecorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group investigated the criminal ecosystem and identified vendors currently offering both code signing certificates and domain name registration with accompanying SSL certificates.\n\nThe researchers identified four well-known vendors operating since 2011, only two vendors are currently still active in Russian-speaking crime forums.\n\n\u201cOne of the first vendors to offer counterfeit code signing certificates was known as C@T, a member of a prolific hacking messaging board.\u201d continues the report. \u201cIn March 2015, C@T offered for sale a Microsoft Authenticode capable of signing 32/64b versions of various executable files, as well as Microsoft Office, Microsoft VBA, Netscape Object Signing, and Marimba Channel Signing documents, and supported Silverlight 4 applications. Additionally, Apple code signing certificates were also available.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrices for code-signing certificates range from $299 to $1,799, most expensive items are the fully authenticated domains with EV SSL encryption and code signing capabilities.\n\n\u201cStandard code signing certificates issued by Comodo that do not include SmartScreen reputation rating cost $295. A buyer interested in the most trusted version of an EV certificate issued by Symantec would have to pay $1,599, a 230 percent premium compared to the price of the authentic certificate.\u201d continues the report.\n\n \u201cFor those seeking to purchase in bulk, fully authenticated domains with EV SSL encryption and code signing capabilities could also be arranged for $1,799\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nAccording to recorded future, code signing certificates are not widespread among malware developers due to the high price.\n\nVxers prefer to pay less for other AV evasion tools, such as crypters (readily available at $10-$30)that represent an excellent compromise between cost and effectiveness\n\n\u201cUnlike ordinary crypting services readily available at $10-$30 per each encryption, we do not anticipate counterfeit certificates to become a mainstream staple of cybercrime due to its prohibitive cost.\u201d concluded the report. \u201cHowever, undoubtedly, more sophisticated actors and nation-state actors who are engaged in less widespread and more targeted attacks will continue using fake code signing and SSL certificates in their operations\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  code signing certificates, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/code-signing-certificates", "topic_name": "Code-Signing certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darkweb", "topic_name": "Darkweb"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/underground", "topic_name": "underground"}]}, {"news_name": "Coldroot RAT cross-platform malware targets MacOS without being detected", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69321/malware/coldroot-rat-malware.html", "title": "Coldroot RAT cross-platform malware targets MacOS without being detected\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 20, 2018", "body": "The Coldroot RAT is a cross-platform that is targeting MacOS systems and the bad news is that AV software is not able to detect it.

DoubleLocker is the first-ever ransomware to abuse the Android accessibility feature that implements alternative ways to interact with a mobile device, it was a new malware that not only encrypts the Android mobile devices but also changes PIN lock.\n\n\n\nWell, experts at Carbon Black reported a case of a cybercriminal that wanted $854 for the Locker Android ransomware kit.\n\n\u201cWe are already seeing an uptick in Android Ransomware kits in underground markets, selling for a much higher price. In our research, we discovered that the median price of ransomware targeting Windows OS is $10, whereas Android-capable ransomware has a median range of $200.\u201d reads a report published by Carbon Black.\n\nRick McElroy, a Carbon Black security strategist, explained that there is a significant difference between typical iOS users and Android ones. Apple users have a tendency to buy new devices everytime a new model is on the market and update their applications and operating systems on a regular basis.\n\nAndroid users being remiss in updating their devices, giving much more opportunities to the attackers.\n\n\u201cOne of the most surprising things was how many Android devices are out there that have not been updated for two years now, and probably never will,\u201d McElroy says. \u201cUpdates are usually simple to conduct, but many users simply don\u2019t do them.\u201d\n\nCrooks choose to target Android users because Android holds the largest OS marketshare worldwide for smartphones, roughly 86% in the first quarter of Q1.\n\nAnother factor that influences the median price higher for Android ransomware kits is the level of coding sophistication that is needed to create these tools compared to the efforts necessary to develop similar kits for Windows.\n\n\u201cThis speaks a bit to how easy it is to get ransomware onto a Windows system versus other operation systems,\u201d McElroy says. \u201cThe longer a developer has to spend to get his ransomware to work effectively at scale the higher the price will be.\u201d\n\nThe last catalyst that is driving the median price higher for Android ransomware kits is the spike in the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the currency used for payments of the ransom, \u201cwith Bitcoin value increasing so quickly, the expansion of this space will likely be connected closely to the value of BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, as those attacks become tougher, and crypto-currency, such as Bitcoin, gains popularity; we believe ransom-based attacks such as screen-lock and file-encryption will gain popularity going forward.\u201d concludes the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android ransomware kits, Dark Web)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-ransomware-kits", "topic_name": "Android ransomware kits"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Hacked password service Leakbase shuts down, someone suspects it was associated to the Hansa seizure", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66361/data-breach/leakbase-shutdown.html", "title": "Hacked password service Leakbase shuts down, someone suspects it was associated to the Hansa seizure\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 5, 2017", "body": "LeakBase, an online service that provided paid access to leaked credentials, was shut down over the weekend and started redirecting to the data breach notification website HaveIBeenPwned.\n\nWe understand many of you may have lost some time, so in an effort to offer compensation please email, refund@leakbase.pwSend your LeakBase username and how much time you had left.We will have a high influx of emails so be patient, this could take a while\n\n\u2014 LeakBase (@LeakbasePW) December 3, 2017\n\n\n\nThe service started selling membership access in September 2016, claiming to provide access to two billion credentials resulting from major data leaks.\n\n\n\nIn January 2017, after launching the paid breach notification service, the LeakedSource went dark, apparently because it was raided by feds.\n\n\n\nThe popular investigator Brian Krebs associated the shutdown of the LeakBase service with the seizure of the Hansa black marketplace occurred in July, Krebs cited a source close to the matter.\n\n\u201cA source close to the matter says the service was taken down in a law enforcement sting that may be tied to the Dutch police raid of the Hansa dark web market earlier this year.\u201d wrote Krebs.\n\nLeakbase reportedly came under new ownership in April 2017, after it was hacked.

In some cases, an additional 5-10 percent commission might be required to launder the funds and deliver it to the main operator via preferred payment method, such as bitcoin, Web Money, or the Western Union.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Andrei Barysevich, director of advanced collection at Recorded Future, the costs can add up and the paybacks are enormous.\n\n\u201cWe estimate the average ROI of a botnet operation to be between 400% to 600%,\u201d Barysevich explained.\n\nWhich kind of return has the illegal activity?\n\nThe returns are both direct and indirect, of course, the main income is related to the funds stolen from the bank accounts, but crooks can also earn selling the login credentials at $100 to $200 a pop, or offering a service of per-demand malware installation on the compromised devices.\n\nThe dark web is an excellent aggregator for the crooks, this is the right places where it is possible to find the above services.\n\nEconomics like this are driving enormous interest in malware goods and services on the Dark Web. Researchers are observing that the cybercrime underground is evolving to highly specialized products and services.\n\nA malware for launching a distributed denial-of-service attack can cost $700 and the overall infrastructure for a spam or phishing campaign can run into the thousands.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cybercriminal underground is quite verticalized, with threat actors specializing in particular areas of expertise. It is this distribution of expertise that contributes to the underground market\u2019s resiliency. Similar to drug cartels, once you remove one threat actor or forum, rivals will immediately take its place.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe underground market is capable to satisfy any need of newbies and script kiddies just as efficiently as it can help the most sophisticated criminal groups and nation-state actors, this is very scaring.\n\nCyber attacks are rarely conducted by a single individual operating in isolation, any campaign requires expertise across multiple disciplines to maximize the profit \u2026 and any expertise has its price in the criminal underground.\n\nThe experts did not observe significant price fluctuations in the offer of illegal products and services in the cybercriminal underground.\n\n\u201cbased on experience, we can say a majority of the services and data types have not seen significant price fluctuations,\u201d Barysevich added.\n\nEnjoy the report!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cybercrime, criminal underground)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercriminal-underground", "topic_name": "cybercriminal underground"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Hack the hackers.

Back to the present, the recent attack against the supply chain of the CCleaner software also leveraged a signed tainted version of the popular application to avoid the detection.\n\nThe security researchers Doowon Kim, BumJun Kwon and Tudor Dumitras from the University of Maryland, College Park have investigated the phenomena. The research team has found a total of 325 signed malware samples, of which 189 (58.2%) carried valid digital signatures while 136 carry malformed digital signatures.\n\nThe team published a research paper titled \u201cCertified Malware: Measuring Breaches of Trust in the Windows Code-Signing PKI.\u201d\n\n\u201cDigitally signed malware can bypass system protection mechanisms that install or launch only programs with valid signatures.\u201d reads the paper.\n\n\u201cIt can also evade anti-virus programs, which often forego scanning signed binaries. Known from advanced threats such as Stuxnet and Flame, this type of abuse has not been measured systematically in the\nbroader malware landscape\u201d\n\nThe researchers reported that 189 malware samples signed correctly were generated using 111 compromised unique certificates issued by trusted CAs and used to sign legitimate software.\n\nThe experts have published the list of certificates abused by attackers at signedmalware.org.\n\n\u201cWe identify 325 signed malware samples in our data set. Of these, 189 (58.2%) samples are properly signed while 136 carry malformed digital signatures, which do not match the binary\u2019s digest\u201d states the paper.\n\n\u201cSuch malformed signatures are useful for an adversary: we find that simply copying an Authenticode signature from a legitimate sample to an unsigned malware sample may help the malware bypass AV detection,\u201d explained the researchers.\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, 27 of these compromised certificates had been revoked, the experts highlighted that executable files signed with one of the 84 certificates that were not revoked may still be valid.\n\n\u201cAt the time of writing, 27 of these certificates had been revoked. While all the abusive certificates in our data set had expired, executable files signed with one of the 84 certificates that were not revoked may still be valid, as long as they carry a trusted timestamp obtained during the validity of the certificate\u201d continues the paper\n\n\u201cA large fraction (88.8%) of malware families rely on a single certificate, which suggests that the abusive certificates are mostly controlled by the malware authors rather than by third parties,\u201d \n\nThe experts explained that even after a stolen certificate is revoked it will not stop crooks from abusing them immediately.\n\nThe researchers found that at least 34 antivirus software failed to check the validity of digital certificates, allowing malicious code to run on the infected system.\n\nAccording to the experts, many anti-virus software failed to detect the malware.\n\n\u201cHowever, the impact of this attack varies with the AV products. The top three AVs affected are nProtect, Tencent, and Paloalto. They detected unsigned ransomware samples as malware, but considered eight of out our ten crafted samples as benign. Even well-known AV engines, e.g. Kaspersky, Microsoft, Symantec, and Commodo,\nallow some of these samples to bypass detection.\u201d explained the researchers.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this [inability in detecting malware samples] is due to the fact that AVs take digital signatures into account when filter and prioritize the list of files to scan, in order to reduce the overhead imposed on the user\u2019s host,\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, the incorrect implementation of Authenticode signature checks in many AVs gives malware authors the opportunity to evade detection with a simple and inexpensive method.\u201d\n\nThe researchers reported this issue to the affected antivirus companies, in one case the company confirmed that their product fails to check the signatures correctly.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Digital code-signing certificates, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-code-signing-certificates", "topic_name": "Digital code-signing certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Basetools underground hacking forum breached, hacker demands $50K ransom", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64890/data-breach/basetools-underground-forum-hacked.html", "title": "Basetools underground hacking forum breached, hacker demands $50K ransom\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 28, 2017", "body": "A hacker that goes online with the Twitter handle mat (@0xScripts) has breached a popular underground hacking forum and he is threatening to share the stolen archive to the law enforcement if the administrators will not pay $50,000.\n\nThe forum is Basetools.ws, its members trade any kind of illegal product and service, including stolen payment card data, hacking tools, and stolen account data.\n\nThe hacking forum accounts for over 150,000 users, and its listing includes more than 20,000 tools.

When the user tries to log in he is greeted with an error page. The credentials themselves are then sent to the C2 server. To determine when to show the overlay and which overlay to show, the topmost application is requested periodically.\u201d continues the post.\n\nThe stolen credentials are used by the attackers to operate on behalf of the victims and initiate fraudulent transactions.\n\nRed Alert 2.0 can also intercept SMS text messages an ability that would allow it to bypass two-factor authentication mechanisms implemented by the banks.\n\nTo Protect yourself against this threat don\u2019t download apps via third-party app stores, never click on suspicious links provided in SMS messages or emails, and keep your system and apps up-to-date.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Red Alert 2.0, Banking Trojan)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking-trojan", "topic_name": "banking trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-alert", "topic_name": "Red Alert"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-alert-2-0-darknet", "topic_name": "Red Alert 2.0 darknet"}]}, {"news_name": "Hackers are offering Equifax data for sale, but they are scammers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63047/cyber-crime/equifax-scammers.html", "title": "Hackers are offering Equifax data for sale, but they are scammers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 16, 2017", "body": "Equifax discovered the intrusion on July 29, but only 3 months the agency notified customers the incident (on September 7) that occurred between mid-May and late July.

It has already outlived its rivals Silk Road, Agora, and AlphaBay.\n\nIt is not clear how RAMP survived so long, there are some speculations regarding its longevity, someone believes that the main reason is that it is a Russian focused market.\n\nThere are four main categories of vendors on RAMP:\n\nThe Audited Dealers group includes the more reliable group of vendors.\n\nLike black marketplace, RAMP lists several prohibited posts and discussions about illegal goods and activities, including drugs, pornography and child pornography, weapons, fake documents. and banknotes.\n\n\u201cBased on the statistics presented on the forum at the time we did this review, RAMP had 186,304 users; 13,224 created topics, 931,494 posts (all time), and 88 posts for the week. These numbers show that RAMP is indeed a significant darknet community.\u201d states the analysis published on the website Darknetmarkets.co.\u201dThe longevity and popularity of Russian Anonymous Marketplace appear surprising to some especially as the site claims to make around a quarter of a million every year but RAMPs\u2019 owners believe that this is because it is in Russian and serves predominantly Russian users.

AlphaBay was considered the \u201cthe new Silk Road,\u201d it emerged in 2014 and became of the most prominent dark web marketplaces.\n\n\u201cNarcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB) Pol Maj Gen Sunthon Chalermkiat told Thai media yesterday that an initial examination of the body of Canadian Alexander Cazes, points to suicide.\u201d reports the Chiangraitimes.\n\n\u201cA duty officer noticed a towel hanging from the toilet door in his cell about 7am, but could not see him, police said. The officer unlocked and entered the cell and found Cazes dead in the toilet.\u201d\n\nThe case anyway has not been resolved, law enforcement has to discover if there were other operators behind the AlphaBay Market and which were their roles.\n\nDon\u2019t forget also that there is a lot of money still stored inside its wallets and probably someone could access them.\n\n\u201cIt is also unclear as to what Cazes may have told the authorities in regards to AlphaBay, its users, or other people working on the platform.\u201d continues the Chiangrai Times.\n\n\u201cOn Reddit, there is some wild speculation as to whether or not these claims are true. It is hard to determine if Cazes is the real AlphaBay admin, but all of the information seems to hint at that outcome. His arrest coincides with the platform going down, and it would also explain why AlphaBay has not resurfaced. On the platform, the admin is known as \u201cdeSnakes\u201d, which very well could indeed by Cazes.\u201d\n\nWe can consider the case closed, the AlphaBay Market was shut down by the law enforcement, exactly like its predecessor Silk Road.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 AlphaBay Market, Dark Web)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/alphabay-market", "topic_name": "AlphaBay Market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-marketplace", "topic_name": "Black marketplace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drug", "topic_name": "drug"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shut-down", "topic_name": "shut down"}]}, {"news_name": "Katyusha Scanner, a new SQLi Vulnerability Scanner Available for $500 in the underground", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60913/deep-web/katyusha-scanner-sqli-vul-scanner.html", "title": "Katyusha Scanner, a new SQLi Vulnerability Scanner Available for $500 in the underground\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 12, 2017", "body": "Recorded Future security researchers have discovered a fully automated SQLi vulnerability scanner, dubbed Katyusha Scanner, on a hacking forum. The tool is offered for sale for just $500, it allows mass scans, simply managed from a smartphone through the Telegram messenger. The company, of course, reported the discovered to law enforcement.\n\nThe Katyusha Scanner appeared in the hacking underground in early April. It was developed starting from the Anarchi Scanner open source penetration testing tool and according to the researchers, it has already been updated seven times since its introduction\n\nActually, the Katyusha Scanner is offered under a Pro and a Lite version that go for between $250 and $500.\n\nThe Pro version leverages known exploits to hack into the system, once a SQL injection bug is found the tool notify it to the attacker via a text message that includes the site name, Alexa rating, and the number of available databases.\n\n\u201cOn April 8, 2017, a Russian-speaking member of a top-tier hacking forum introduced \u201cKatyusha Scanner,\u201d the powerful and fully automated SQLi vulnerability scanner that utilizes the functionality of Telegram messenger and Anarchi Scanner, an open-source penetration testing tool.\u201d states the blog post published by RecorderFuture.\n\nThe released product, coupled with outstanding support and frequent updates, immediately gained popularity and accolades of grateful clients for an intuitive and straightforward interface, as well as incredible performance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at Recorded Future reported that the seller is Russian speaking and is known in the hacking underground for selling data stolen from e-commerce websites. According to the experts, the forum where the tool is commercialized is frequented by top-tier Russian hackers.\n\nAn innovative feature implemented in the Katyusha Scanner allows crooks to upload a list of target websites and launch the concurrent attack against them simultaneously, seamlessly controlling the attack via Telegram.\n\nThe scanner is easy to use, the attackers only need set up a standard web server with the version of the Arachni scanner that has been modified to allow the control of the operation through a linked Telegram account.\n\nThe attackers can control the attack using almost every mobile OS.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the name Katyusha was not chosen by chance \u2014 it represents an iconic multiple rocket launcher, developed by the Soviet Union during World War II known for inflicting panic in Nazi forces with its stealthy and devastating attacks. Similar to the very lethal weapon conceived 70 years ago, Katyusha Scanner allows criminals to initiate large-scale penetration attacks against a massive number of targeted websites with several clicks using their smartphones.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe seller suggests starting with at least 500 target sites, attackers can issue commands to scan them for any known vulnerabilities. The Pro version also implements the capability of downloading any exfiltrated data available.\n\nAccording to Recorded Future, at least 12/15 user have already purchased the tool, they were satisfied for the efficiency of the tool.\n\nThe potential scale of the attacks that the tool is able to power is worrisome.\n\n\u201cWhen dozens buy it and initiate attacks every day, the potential fallout will be significant,\u201d Recorded Future director of advanced collection Andrei Barysevich said. \u201cThe scale of attacks which is available to criminals is quite unprecedented now.

We have analyzed many times the popular black market where it was possible to buy any kind of illegal goods, including drugs, malicious code and fake documents.\n\nThe AlphaBay Market went down Tuesday night without any explanation, many users that have purchased products in the last day are waiting for news. At the time there is no indication that the marketplace went down due to an operation conducted by law enforcement.\n\nAlphaBay is considered the largest marketplace on the dark web, competing against the likes of Abraxas, Dream, and Hansa. Operators at the marketplace have continued improving the site by adding new features, including Monero.\n\nOn the Internet is circulating the news that administrators of the black market have pulled a classic exit scam to steal users\u2019 Bitcoin.\n\nUsers at Reddit and Twitter are claiming that administrators have shut down the black market to withdraw a huge amount of Bitcoins from The AphaBay market accounts.\n\nAnalyzing the total withdrawal it is possible to verify that admins have transferred 1,479.03904709 Bitcoin (roughly $3.8 Million), which led to suspicion from some users that the site\u2019s admins may have pulled an exit scam to steal user funds.\n\n\n\nOf course, at the time I was writing this is only a hypothesis, The AlphaBay Market already went down in the past, last year the black market was not accessible for about four days. Also, the blockchain transactions of about $3.8 Million are not enough for AlphaBay moderators to go offline.\n\nThere is also a portion of users that seem to be not worried, one of them published the following message on Reddit believe that roughly $4 Million is not enough for AlphaBay operators to disappear:\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know for sure what\u2019s going on, and I am a bit nervous myself because if this is the end then I\u2019ve lost a couple hundred dollars myself But think about it Last year alphabay went down for about 4 days.\u201d states the message. \u201cEveryone was saying for sure that this was it, but it wasnt.

Idk about you but that doesn\u2019t sound like nearly enough money. \u201c\n\nA Reddit user associated with the AlphaBay Market who goes by moniker Big_Muscles has called users to calm down, he explained that the site is down due to server maintenance and it will be \u201cback online soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill be back online soon. Servers under update\u201d said Big_Muscles.\n\nI reached Rick Holland, VP Strategy at Digital Shadows for a comment.\n\n\u201cDark web exit scams are nothing new and are quite common. The Evolution market famously ended with the loss of 40,000 bitcoins. These exit scams are one of the risks when conducting business in criminal marketplaces. The increasing value of BTC (>$2,500 as of today) makes exit scams appealing. These exit scams are often the first assumption when a marketplace goes offline, however there are alternatives including intrusions from other criminals, DDoS attacks from competitors, law enforcement interdictions, and even unannounced site maintenance.\u201d state Holland.\n\n\u201cMultiple vendors of compromised data, payment card details, malware and other services would have to seek other online services. The Dream and Hansa markets are likely to benefit from any potential Alphabay demise. Digital Shadows is tracking this development and will provide updated analysis as it becomes available.\u201d\n\nThe AphaBay marketplace made the headlines early last year when unknowns hacked the website and stole over 200,000 private unencrypted messages from several users.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 AlphaBay, Dark Web)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/aphabay", "topic_name": "AphaBay"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-market", "topic_name": "black market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drug", "topic_name": "drug"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI hacked a US Darknet shopper who tried to purchase Mail Bomb", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60613/cyber-crime/mail-bomb-dark-web.html", "title": "FBI hacked a US Darknet shopper who tried to purchase Mail Bomb\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 2, 2017", "body": "According to a plea agreement, filed on April 28, 2017, Clinton Scott Bass of Georgia (US) tried in a first time to purchase a car bomb. The man, who was using two different pseudo names, contacted an undercover FBI agent on a darknet marketplace.\n\n\n\nLater on, the man decided to acquire a mail bomb from the undercover officer. The agent agreed to sell the explosive to the suspect who paid $550 in digital currency, likely Bitcoin or Monero.\n\n\u201cHe was keen, at first, to buy a car bomb that would explode as soon as the vehicle\u2019s door was opened or closed. But he then decided he wanted a mail bomb, which would go off on being opened.\u201d reported Thomas Fox-Brewster from Forbes.\n\n\u201cThe undercover agent agreed to sell him a bomb, which was in fact inert and delivered to an address provided by one of Bass\u2019 monikers, who paid $550 in virtual currency for the service. Hidden in the fake explosive, however, was a location tracker.\u201d\n\nThe police sent an inert device to the address provided by the suspect, they have also hidden a location tracker in the pack.\n\nThe location tracker allowed the agents to discover the real Bass\u2019s target, they tracked the pack discovering that is was sent to someone in Hahira, Georgia on the morning of April 27, then Feds arrested the man.\n\nBass used an email address at the temporary mail provider Guerilla Mail while communicating with the undercover agent. The defendant used the email address to receive instructions from the vendor on how to use the mail bomb.\n\nThe FBI sent a phishing message to the Guerilla Mail address used by Bass in an attempt to locate him (i.e. tracking his IP address). The message included a weaponized attached document, which, once opened, would send target information to the FBI\u2019s server. The FBI used the Network Investigative Technique (NIT), a method used by Feds in many other cases and that was questioned by privacy advocates that consider it a tool for dragnet surveillance.\n\n\u201cThe message included a document, which, once opened, would send that identifying data to an FBI server, somehow overcoming the IP-masking provided by Tor. A separate document indicated the government also installed what\u2019s known as a pen-trap tool to record all the information coming from the hack.\u201d continues Fox Brewster.\n\nAn executed warrant document reported that the FBI retrieved 19 different IP addresses in the investigation by using the NIT, likely because the suspect was using a VPN service and the Tor network to mask his IP address. It is not clear is the NIT was useful to track the man.\n\nExperts and privacy advocated consider legitimate the NIT usage in the specific case, it was a targeted attack that not impacted other individuals, such as the case of a watering hole attack.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it is, the FBI has to do something to catch criminals, and at least in this case they didn\u2019t resort to draconian methods such as mass surveillance without a warrant,\u201d Flashmob, the administrator of Guerilla Mail, told the media. \u201cInstead, they used a simple procedure with a warrant that doesn\u2019t need much technical ability,\u201d \n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) security researcher Cooper Quintin also confirmed that the FBI\u2019s phishing in the current case was legitimate.\n\nBut what makes this hack unique is that it appears to be the first public example of the FBI legally using a controversial update to the Rule 41 , that allows searches on users of anonymizing services, including the Tor network.\n\nAnyway, there is an element of concern about the Bass case, authorities used \u201cStingray\u201d technology to spy on the suspect and track his movements,\n\nBass pleaded guilty in April to charges of attempting to receive and transport explosive materials with the intent to kill, injure or intimidate.

Thru their efforts the researchers for AlienVault were able to obtain a copy of the new \u201cMacSpy\u201d program, described as the most sophisticated malware for Mac OS-x operating system to date.\n\nThe hackers offering MacSpy on the dark net are not selling it but in fact \u2013 giving it away at no cost. The software combines with a provided TOR portal to enable users to hack into and obtain surveillance information from targeted MAC computers.\n\nThe authors of the malware claim that they created it because Apple products have grown so popular. It is this popularity of Apple products that appears to have driven their desire to create the remote access Trojan (RAT) program. The free version of the MacSpy malware is designed to monitor Apple users, record data on the Mac system and then covertly spin it back to the controller who launched the attacks. MacSpy is can capture screen image and has an embedded keylogger. In addition, MacSpy can also capture ICloud synced data such as photos, provide voice recording surveillance, extract clipboard contents and download browser information.\n\nMuch like contemporary software providers; the MacSpy developers offers a \u201cpaid\u201d version with enhanced features for customers. The paid version of MacSpy has many similar features seen inside programs developed by the CIA as shown in the Wikileaks Vault 7 releases. The remote controller can update the Trojan silently, extract any file, encrypt whole user directories, deliver scheduled dumps of an entire infected system, and extract social media and email data for surveillance.\n\n\n\nAccording to the AlienVault, the MacSpy program is currently \u201ccompletely undetected by various AV companies and products\u201d. The program also includes a feature to disable the ability of users to analyze, debug and understand its operation. The anti-analysis designs include a series of hardware checks against the CPU chips to ensure the program is not being executed in a virtual mode or on a minimal \u201csand-box\u201d system to be examined. It also calls the Apple \u201cptrace\u201d function with the proper options to prevent debuggers from attaching to the process itself.\n\nOnce the system has passed the anti-analysis features it installs itself, deletes the installation files for stealth and links up to a TOR proxy in order to begin the process of data surveillance. MacSpy does attach itself to start up files so the system will re-establish a link to the TOR proxy at the beginning of each reboot.\n\nMacSpy transmits the data it collects by sending a POST request through the TOR proxy, and then repeatedly sends POST commands for the selected data that the malware has stolen from the infected target system. Once it has completed its download the malware deletes the temporary files containing the data it sent.\n\nThere are some bright sides to the MacSpy story. The developers appear to have copied much of their code from the Stack Overflow website for programmers. In addition, the MacSpy payload is not digitally signed and may trigger an alert on properly configured Mac OS systems.\n\nHowever, according to AlienVault, the MacSpy malware is a sign that there is a dark future for Apple users.\n\n\u201cPeople generally assume when they are using Macs they are relatively safe from malware,\u201d notes AlienVault in its dissection of the MacSpy Trojan.\n\n\u201cThis has been a generally true statement, but this belief is becoming less and less true by the day, as evidenced by the increasing diversity in mac malware along with this name family.\u201d\n\nAbout the author: Charles R.

Experts believe this is the first time a Mac ransomware is offered as RaaS.\n\n\u201cJust recently, we here at FortiGuard Labs discovered a Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that uses a web portal hosted in a TOR network which has become a trend nowadays. However, in this case it was rather interesting to see cybercriminals attack an operating system other than Windows. And this could be the first time to see RaaS that targets Mac OS.\u201d states the analysis published by Fortinet.\n\nDespite the threat is not sophisticated like other similar threats it could cause serious problems to the victims because it encrypts victim\u2019s files. The availability of  MacRansom as RaaS makes it easy to arranges ransomware campaign to crooks that have no specific skills.\n\nMacRansom variant is not readily available through the Tor portal, would-be crooks can contact the author of the ransomware in order to receive their version of the threat.\n\n\u201cThis MacRansom variant is not readily available through the portal. It is necessary to contact the author directly to build the ransomware. At first, we thought of it as a scam since there was no sample but to verify this we dropped the author an email and unexpectedly received a response.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\n\nMacRansom implements symmetric encryption with a hard-coded key and the ransomware only encrypts a maximum of 128 files, it demands 0.25 bitcoin (around $700) for decryption keys.\n\nResearchers found two sets of symmetric keys used by the ransomware:\n\nThe ReadmeKey is used to decrypt ._README_ file that contains the ransom notes and instructions, while the TargetFileKey is used to encrypt and decrypt the victim\u2019s files.\n\nThe malicious code implements anti-analysis activity, the first thing the ransomware does is to check if the sample is being run in a non-Mac environment or if it is running in debugged environment.\n\nThe author gives 30 per cent to the Bitcoin address of the customer once the victim has paid the ransom.\n\nCustomers just have to spread the threat, for example delivering it via spam emails on through drive-by download attacks.\n\nThe author discourages drive-by download attacks or other approaches that involve uploading customized versions of MacRansom.\n\n\u201cIt is not every day that we see new ransomware specifically targeting Mac OS platform. Even if it is far inferior from most current ransomware targeting Windows, it doesn\u2019t fail to encrypt victim\u2019s files or prevent access to important files, thereby causing real damage.\u201d concluded Fortinet.\n\n\u201cLast but not the least, this MacRansom variant is potentially being brewed by copycats as we saw quite a lot of similar code and ideas taken from previous OSX ransomware. Even though it utilizes anti-analysis tricks, which differs from previous OSX ransomware, these are well-known techniques widely deployed by many malware authors. MacRansom is yet another example of the prevalence of the ransomware threat, regardless of the OS platform being run.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 MacRansom, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crime-as-a-service", "topic_name": "Crime-as-a-Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/macransom", "topic_name": "macransom"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/raas", "topic_name": "RaaS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Analyzing the attack landscape of the Dark Web.

The researchers automatically recorded all logs after every successful attack and restored the environment to a clean state each day.\n\n\u201cTo this end, we simulated a cybercriminal installation in Tor using several honeypots. Each honeypot exposes one or more vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to take ownership of the installation. Upon infection we automatically recorded all logs and restored the environment to a clean state.\u201d reads the analysis published by Trend Micro.\n\nThe following chart shows the average number of daily attack attempts, as measured by the number of POST requests, in just one month, the number of attacks spiked to 160 per day, most of them successful.\n\n\n\nThe first discovery made by the researchers is that many attacks were originated from Tor proxies like Tor2web that allows reaching hidden services from the clear web.\n\n\u201cTor proxies like Tor2web made Tor hidden services reachable without requiring any additional configuration from the public internet. Our honeypot was automatically made available to traditional search engines, and implicitly dangled as a target for automated exploitation scripts,\u201d states the report.\n\nThe analysis of the attacks revealed that most of them installed web shells on the server to gain control over it, in the majority of the cases attackers used the machine to power DDoS attacks and to run spam campaigns.\n\nIn order to analyze only attacks from within the Dark Web, researchers filtering the traffic from Tor proxies, then observed the number of attacks drastically decreased.\n\nA second point emerged from the analysis is that while the attacks from Tor proxies were performed with automated tools, attacks from within the Dark Web were most manually conducted.\n\n\u201cAttackers from the open internet tended to use automated attack tools, while Dark Web attackers tended to carry out manual attacks as they were generally more cautious and took their time. For example, once they gained access to a system via a web shell, they would gather information about the server first by listing directories, checking the contents of databases, and retrieving configuration/system files.\u201d continues the report.\n\n\u201cThese manual attackers often deleted any files they placed into our honeypot; some even went ahead and left messages for us (including \u2018Welcome to the honeypot!\u2019), indicating that they had identified our honeypot.\u201d\n\nThe results of the study confirm that organizations operating in the Dark Web seem to be attacking each other.

After pruning, we have a graph of 7, 178 nodes and 25, 104 edges (55% and 64% respectively)\u201d states the researchers.\n\nThe first discrepancy emerged from the research is related to the number of the active .onion domain. The maintainers at the Tor Project Inc. states that the Tor network currently hosts \u223c60, 000 distinct, active .onion addresses, meanwhile the team of experts has found only 7, 178 active .onion domains.\n\nThe researchers attribute this high-discrepancy to various messaging services\u2014 particularly TorChat, Tor Messenger, and Ricochet in which each user is identified by a unique .onion domain.\n\nThe Graph-theoretic results show that \u223c30% of domains have exactly one incoming link\u2014of which 62% come from one of the five largest out-degree hubs. 78% of all nodes received a connection from at least one of them.\n\n\n\nThe most intriguing aspect of the research is that 87% of sites do not link to any other site, this discovery has a significant impact on all graph-theoretic measures (see darkweb out-degree in the following image).\n\n\n\n\u201cWe conclude that in the term \u201cdarkweb\u201d, the word \u201cweb\u201d is a connectivity misnomer. Instead, it is more accurate to view the darkweb as a set of largely isolated dark silos\u201d wrote the experts. reads the paper. \u201cIn our darkweb graph, each vertex is a domain and every directed edge from u \u2192 v means there exists a page within domain u linking to a page within domain v.

The author of the thread announced a RAT dubbed Proton, intended for installation exclusively on MAC OS devices. The author offered this product in one of the leading underground cybercrime markets.\u201d reads a report published by Sixgill.\n\nThe Proton RAT first appeared in the threat landscape last year, the variant recently advertised on hacking forums includes many features such as the ability to execute console commands, access the user\u2019s webcam, log keystrokes, capture screenshots and open SSH/VNC remote connections. The malicious code is also able to inject malicious code in the user\u2019s browser to display popups asking victims information such as credit card numbers, login credentials, and others.\n\n\u201cThe malware includes root-access privileges and features allowing an attacker to obtain full control of the victim\u2019s computer. Its capabilities include: running real-time console commands and file-manager, keylogging, SSH/VNC connectivity, screenshots, webcam operation and the ability to present a custom native window requesting information such as a credit-card, driver\u2019s license and more. The malware also boasts the capability of iCloud access, even when two-factor authentication is enabled.\u201d continues the report.\n\nAccording to the author, macOS Proton RAT is written in native Objective-C and it is fully undetected by any existing MAC OS antivirus solution.\n\nBelow the list of features described in the ad:\n\n\n\nThe Proton RAT has root access and is able to elude standard macOS security features, it is also able to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud accounts.\n\nResearchers speculate macOS Proton RAT leverages a zero-day vulnerability in macOS, but most interesting characteristic of the threat is that the malicious code is signed with genuine Apple code-signing certificates. It is likely the author has managed to falsify registration to Apple Developer ID Program or has stolend the credentials to an apple developer.\n\n\u201cThe real threat behind the software is this: The malware is shipped with genuine Apple code-signing signatures. This means the author of Proton RAT somehow got through the rigorous filtration process Apple places on MAC OS developers of third-party software, and obtained genuine certifications for his program. Sixgill evaluates that the malware developer has managed to falsify registration to the Apple Developer ID Program or used stolen developer credentials for the purpose.\u201d reads the report.\n\nThe price for the macOS Proton RAT ranged from $1,200 to $830,000 for the entire project (an absurd price).

The agents used the network investigative technique (NIT) to obtain the IP addresses of the Playpen users.\n\nThe Feds hacked 8,700 computers in 120 countries, based on a single warrant, a procedure considered unconstitutional by privacy advocates.

Moreover, it reports about threat agents their motivations, and how their practices, tools and techniques have advanced.\u201d read an introduction to the report.\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 is an impressive source of data and references to the events that characterized the threat landscape in 2016.\n\nThe vast majority of the attacks was financially and politically motivated, the year 2016 is thus characterized by \u201cthe efficiency of cyber-crime monetization.\u201d Crooks have monetized their effort not only with the illegal activities they conducted but also offering their services through the consolidated model of sale known as \u201ccrime-as-a-service.\u201d\n\nFortunately, we are observing an increasing maturity of defenders when dealing cyber threats and a successful effort of international law enforcement agencies that conducted many operations disrupting criminal organizations.\n\nHowever, attackers are still one step ahead as explained in the report. The advances of defenders have been the result of the superiority of attackers in:\n\nMalware remains the principal cyber-threat in 2016, the number of samples reached ca. 600 million per quarter, mobile malware (reaches a growth of ca. 150%) and ransomware have monopolized the threat landscape. Web based attacks and web application attacks follow malware in the Top 15, no change has been observed respecting 2015.\n\nWeb based attacks include malicious URLs, compromised domains, browser exploits and drive-by attacks.\n\n\u201cWeb based attacks are those that use web components as an attack surface. As web components we understand parts of the web infrastructure, such as web servers, web clients (browsers) content management systems (CMS) and browser extensions\u201d states the report.\n\nThe category of web application attacks includes classic techniques like cross-site scripting and SQL-injection (SQLi) that anyway continues to be a privileged attack vector of threat actors.  In the fourth place there are the Botnets, these infrastructures are an essential component for a large number of cyber attacks.\n\nThe DDoS attacks reached the fourth place, it is the result of extortion activities and the availability in the criminal underground of DDoS-for-hire services that offer to wannabe hackers all the necessary to launch powerful attack.\n\n\n\nThe report also provides an interesting analysis of top threat actors observed in 2016, Cyber-criminals, insiders, cyber spies, hacktivists, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists and script kiddies operate with different techniques, but in many cases the observed an overlap of their TTPs caused by the evolution of the crime-as-service model.\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 also associated the various threat to the above threat agents, an interesting exercize that allowed us to better profile the attackers.\n\n\n\nBased on the material ENISA\u2019s experts collected, the report provided our conclusions for policy makers, businesses, and research.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the cyber-threat landscape is receiving significant high-level attention: it is on the agenda of politicians in the biggest industrial countries. This is a direct consequence of \u2018cyber\u2019 becoming mainstream, in affecting people\u2019s opinions and influencing the political environment of modern societies. Besides this, a lot of developments have taken place regarding the tools and tactics used by adversaries, making 2016 another striking sample of the dynamics of cyber-space.

An attacker can try to hack the browser component forcing it to connect to other than the legitimate Tor proxy part, for example, a server set up by the attacker that gathers user data.\n\n\u201cThat means if an attacker can compromise the Firefox half of Tor Browser, it can de-anonymize the user by connecting to something other than the Tor proxy,\u201d Barnes said.\n\nBarnes a series of improvements, including the use of Unix domain sockets that are data communications endpoints for exchanging data between processes executing on the same operating system.\n\nThis will allow the Tor Browser to securely communicate with the FireFox component without underlying the network protocol. In this was the experts will sandbox the Firefox component, any manipulation or attacks will have no effects on the user\u2019s privacy because the Tor Browser wouldn\u2019t be able to make a network connection to de-anonymize the user.\n\nBasically the intent of the experts at the Tor Project is to sandbox the Tor browser to insulate our users from attacks such as the NIT and similar ones. According to Motherboard, the Tor developer Yawning Angel just finished an experimental prototype that will likely appear in some versions of the Tor Browser later this year.\n\n\u201cThat means that you could run it in a sandbox with no network access (only a Unix domain socket to the proxy), and it would still work fine.

These limitations are not news to the research community. It is well understood that low-latency anonymity networks such as Tor cannot protect against so-called global passive adversaries. We define such adversaries as those with the ability to monitor both network traffic that enters and exits the network.\u201d says Phillip Winter, a researcher at Princeton University that was involved in the research.\n\nThe techniques were dubbed DefecTor by the researchers, they leverage on the observation of the DNS traffic from Tor exit relays, for this reason, the methods could integrate existing attack strategies.\n\n\u201cWe show how an attacker can use DNS requests to mount highly precise website fingerprinting attacks: Mapping DNS traffic to websites is highly accurate even with simple techniques, and correlating the observed websites with a website fingerprinting attack greatly improves the precision when monitoring relatively unpopular websites. \u201d reads the analysis published by the researchers. \u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cOur results show that DNS requests from Tor exit relays traverse numerous autonomous systems that subsequent web traffic does not traverse. We also find that a set of exit relays, at times comprising 40% of Tor\u2019s exit bandwidth, uses Google\u2019s public DNS servers\u2014an alarmingly high number for a single organization. We believe that Tor relay operators should take steps to ensure that the network maintains more diversity into how exit relays resolve DNS domains.\u201d\n\nThe test results obtained with the DefecTor technique are excellent anyway we have to consider that such attacks request a significant effort, typically spent by persistent attackers like government bodies.\n\nThe simulations of the attacks conducted by the researchers allowed them to identify the vast majority of the visitors to unpopular visited sites.\n\nThe experts highlighted that Google operates public DNS servers that observe almost 40% of all DNS requests exiting the Tor network, a privileged point of observation for attackers.\n\nGoogle is also able to monitor some network traffic that is entering the Tor network, the experts reported as an example the traffic via Google Fiber or via guard relays that are occasionally running in Google\u2019s cloud.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Google can monitor some network traffic that is entering the Tor network: for example, via Google Fiber, via guard relays that are occasionally run in Google\u2019s cloud, and formerly via meek app engine, which is now defunct,\u201d Winter explains.\n\nThe experts also remark that DNS requests could be used to obtain other precious information about the traffic of Tor users, they traverse autonomous systems and Internet exchanges.\n\n\u201cthere are entities on the Internet such as ISPs, autonomous systems, or Internet exchange points that can monitor some DNS traffic but not web traffic coming out of the Tor networkand potentially use the DNS traffic to deanonymize Tor users.\u201d says Winter. \u201cPast traffic correlation studies have focused on linking the TCP stream entering the Tor network to the one(s) exiting the network. We show that an adversary can also link the associated DNS traffic, which can be exposed to many more autonomous systems than the TCP stream.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also developed a tool, dubbed \u201cDNS Delegation Path Traceroute\u201d (dptr), that could be used to determine the DNS delegation path for a fully qualified domain name. The tool runs UDP traceroutes to all DNS servers on the path that are then compared to a TCP traceroute to the web server behind the same fully qualified domain name.\n\nOn the other side, experts from the Tor Project are already working on a series of significant improvements to the popular anonymizing network.\n\nIn March the Tor Project revealed how the organization has conducted a three-year long work to improve its ability to detect fraudulent software.\n\nWhile Tor developers are already working on implementing techniques to make website fingerprinting attacks harder to execute, there are other actions that can be taken to prevent DefecTor attacks, such as Tor relay operators ensuring that the network maintains more diversity in how exit relays resolve DNS domains.\n\nThe experts invite the security community to review their paper, for further information visit the DefecTor project page.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DefecTor , Tor Project) \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymizing-darknet", "topic_name": "anonymizing Darknet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defector", "topic_name": "DefecTor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-project", "topic_name": "Tor Project"}]}, {"news_name": "Yahoo is going to confirm the data breach that exposed 200 Million Yahoo accounts", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51536/data-breach/200-million-yahoo-accounts.html", "title": "Yahoo is going to confirm the data breach that exposed 200 Million Yahoo accounts\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 22, 2016", "body": "Yahoo is ready to confirm a massive data breach that affected its service that has exposed several hundred million user accounts.\n\n\u201cYahoo is poised to confirm a massive data breach of its service, according to several sources close to the situation, hacking that has exposed several hundred million user accounts.\u201d reported the website recode.net.\n\n\u201cWhile sources were unspecific about the extent of the incursion, since there is the likelihood of government investigations and legal action related to the breach, they noted that it is widespread and serious.\u201d\n\nIn August, the notorious hacker Peace advertised 200 Million Yahoo accounts on Dark Web, and the company is aware of the sale.\n\nPeace offered for sale the 200 million of Yahoo account credentials (from \u201c2012 most likely,\u201d) on The Real Deal black marketplace.

The trend was confirmed by a study conducted by two students at the Harvard University, Paul Lisker and Michael Rose.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to leverage a longitudinal archive of dark net markets (DNMs) to collect and analyze sale listing images with metadata containing location data.\u201d the students explained in a post.\n\nWhat is EXIF metadata?\n\n\u201cExchangeable image file format (officially Exif, according to JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA specifications) is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras.\u201d reads Wikipedia. \n\nBasically, every image took with a digital camera or a mobile device includes information, in the EXIF standard, such as the device used and the location of the shot. That data are written in the \u201cexchangeable image file format\u201d (EXIF) standard.\n\nPaul Lisker and Michael Rose analyzed images of drugs and weapons used by crooks to advertise their product and services on black marketplaces in the dark web and saved them to a data repository maintained by an independent security researcher Gwern Branwen.\n\nThe archive is very interesting for security experts that intend to study the activities in the dark web, it includes data from some 83 dark markets and 40 associated forums. Information was collected from 2013 to 2015, totalling 44 million files or 1.5Tb of data.\n\n\u201cFrom 2013-2015, I scraped/mirrored on a weekly or daily basis all existing English-language DNMs as part of my research into their usage, lifetimes/characteristics, & legal riskiness; these scrapes covered vendor pages, feedback, images, etc. In addition, I made or obtained copies of as many other datasets & documents related to the DNMs as I could. This uniquely comprehensive collection is now publicly released as a 50GB (~1.6TB uncompressed) collection covering 89 DNMs & 37+ related forums, representing <4,438 mirrors, and is available for any research. This page documents the download, contents, interpretation, and technical methods behind the scrapes.\u201d wrote Branwen.\n\nThe experts used bash scripts to search for EXIF data including longitude and latitude data among the images in the archive.\n\n\u201cIn order to analyze the listing images inside each archive, we first searched for and compiled a list of the file path of all JPEG images to ensure that no file went untested. (Images used for listings were only in the JPEG format; any other image formats \u2014 PNG, GIF, etc. \u2014 were used for website graphics.) Then, using Python and bash scripts, we checked each image\u2019s EXIF data for longitude or latitude data, saving the coordinates for each geotagged photo and its file path to a text file.\u201d explained the student.\n\nThe experts found 229 unique images that contained geolocation data that would reference the location of the shot within a range of two kilometres.\n\nThe duo analysed roughly 223,471 unique dark market images, the vast majority don\u2019t include the EXIF data.\n\n\u201cOut of these markets and forums, we located 2,276 total geotagged images, which after eliminating duplicates available over multiple days, gave 229 total unique images with associated coordinates. The coordinates\u2014with decimals removed from the numbers to protect privacy\u2014can be seen plotted in the map below.

Table 1 presents a summary of markets containing geotagged images:\u201d\n\n\n\nMost popular black markets like Agora stripped metadata from images published in the adv. In the case of Agora, the researchers noticed that EXIF metadata was absent on all images after 18 March 2014.\n\n\n\nBelow the conclusions of the study, the researchers highlighted that sellers and dark market websites are failing to remove EXIF metadata from images.\n\n\u201cFirst, it was common in many cases to observe sites, typically residential, surrounded by 5\u201310 tagged images separated by a few meters,\u201d the students explained in a post.\n\n\u201cThis suggests the behavior of sellers who are careless on a regular basis, rather than the occasional forgetfulness of not stripping data or purposeful manipulation.\n\n\u201cWe also found several instances of these clusters incorporating listings on multiple sites, pointing to sellers with activities across the darknet and failing to strip their products\u2019 location on any of the sites up.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 EXIF metadata, Darkweb)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-marketplaces", "topic_name": "black marketplaces"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darkweb", "topic_name": "Darkweb"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drugs", "topic_name": "Drugs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/exif-metadata", "topic_name": "EXIF metadata"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/weapons", "topic_name": "weapons"}]}, {"news_name": "Members call for a Tor General Strike and shut down Tor for a day", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/50520/deep-web/tor-general-strike.html", "title": "Members call for a Tor General Strike and shut down Tor for a day\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 22, 2016", "body": "Last month, the Tor Project announced that an internal investigation had confirmed the allegations of sexual misconduct against the notorious member Jacob Appelbaum.\n\nThe allegations divided the internet privacy community, as a result of events the entire board of directors of the project was replaced.\n\nNews of the day is that a few members of the community are calling for a \u2018Tor general strike.\u2019 They want to express their dissent on the way the investigation was handled.\n\nA message published on Twitter invites those who run parts of the Tor network infrastructure to shut down their machines, developers to stop working on Tor, and of course, users to stop using the anonymizing network.\n\n#torstrike calls for global sit in on September 1https://t.co/VwaC3BwoQh pic.twitter.com/XtkZGLPam7\n\n\u2014 Cryptome (@Cryptomeorg) 20 agosto 2016\n\n\n\nThe members who are calling for a Tor General Strike are also opposed to the decision of the Tor Project to hire an ex-CIA official.\n\n\u201cTor can no longer be trusted after #jakegate / #torgate and hire of CIA,\u201d states the Ghostbin post  that calls for the Tor Global Strike. \u201cIts sinking credibility is putting people at risk.

In a paper titled, \u201cDarknet and Deepnet Mining for Proactive Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence\u201d, the group of 10 co-authors outlines the possibilities of programmatically identifying zero-days before they\u2019re used in an attack by scraping and parsing known so-called Darkweb and Deepweb forums.  According to the research, various data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to analyze discussions in forums where malicious code is sold in exchange for bitcoins and the initial results are encouraging.\n\nAs an example, the paper highlights the Dyre Trojan discovered by FireEye in July of last year.\n\nIn February 2015, Microsoft reported a Windows remote code execution vulnerability, MS15-010.  According to the team\u2019s research, no known exploit existed for that vulnerability until April 2015, when an exploit (Dyre) that leveraged the vulnerability appeared on a Darknet market site for 48 BTC, or US$10,000 \u2013 US$15,000.  Using this information, the researchers worked to devise an automated process of gathering information from these marketplaces and searching for keywords that could be filtered and classified as possible malicious code for sale. The results so far are impressive.\n\n\n\nThe team is current tracking twenty-seven marketplaces and twenty-one forums selling anything from cocaine to the latest Adobe exploits \u2013 and this is where it gets challenging.\n\nMuch of the information collected on these sites is in the form of unstructured data that is no relevant to cyber security. For example, the word \u201cSALE\u201d could be misspelled causing the automated system to simply skip over this misspelled word as noise.\n\nAnother challenge, of course, is word variations particularly those found in the common hacker vernacular such as \u201cS4L3.\u201d Despite these challenges, the team has proven that automation has some serious value in identifying zero-day exploits in the wild detecting 16 zero-day exploits over a four week period. Despite the initial success, automation of zero-day hunting may remain a novel idea.\n\nGetting to the left of the cyber kill chain has been a topic of discussion for over a year now, with a lot of groups focusing efforts on intelligence gathering at the pre-reconnaissance phase; so far, these approaches have had mixed results.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges facing the cyber intelligence community looking to use automated gathering techniques is the constant change of the forums themselves.\n\nCyber criminals are becoming more and more aware they what they can do to their targets, the targets can do to them. This cat-and-mouse game of shifting techniques only increases the situational awareness of the adversary forcing them to change their behavior.  Forums are becoming increasingly harder to gain access to and sophisticated vetting processes are being established to weed out cyber researchers and law enforcement with intentions of stopping zero-days before they ever hit their first victims.\n\nIn 2013, the FBI brought down the so-called Silk Road, an illegal marketplace selling everything from heroin to hitmen for hire.  Court documents revealed that the FBI used many traditional investigative techniques in the take down but also used cyber as a tool to dismantle the very network the Silk Road was built upon.\n\nIn all, the operation seized US$4 million in BTC and led to the arrest of the alleged operator, Ross Ulbricht. Despite FBI efforts, the Silk Road has been relaunched as the \u201cSilk Road 3.0\u201d with those backing the project proclaiming this new version has \u201cundergone a massive security upgrade and modified design\u201d, likely to keep federal snoops from poking around.\n\nIt\u2019s not just cyber criminals that are making automated techniques difficult, changes in the threat landscape are also forcing changes in the way cyber intelligence is delivered. The scope of attacks is evolving as well.\n\nKevin Mandia, FireEye\u2019s new CEO points out that \u201cAs the current threat environment shifts to smaller scoped breaches, some organizations may be opting for good enough over best-of-breed detection.\u201d This shift in attitude could curb spending on research and development projects in the search of unknown zero-days in favor of resiliency and incident response, the right of the kill chain, the exact opposite of where ASU team believes it can make a difference.\n\nAccording to their paper, the ASU researchers are currently shopping their system around looking for additional funding for their research, and why not?  Their system of collection and parsing isn\u2019t just collecting zero-days it\u2019s also collecting over 300 high-quality cyber threat warnings weekly making it an invaluable source of actionable information.\n\nHopefully, the ASU project will find a home that will mature their system.  Future iterations will likely include the collection and analysis of other types of information being sold in the Dark and Deep webs such as stolen credit card information, health records, and other criminal activity.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

According to several German news outlets, the young man has bought the 9mm Glock 17 he used to kill nine innocents in Munich was a reactivated theater weapon purchased on a dark net. Many media outlets reported the ease with which everyone can purchase a weapon on the dark web.\n\nApart the great confusion about the terms Deep web and Dark Web that many journalists are still using in improper way, readers could have a distorted perception of this hidden part of the web and about the risks for the homeland security of any government.\n\nIn the dark web is it possible to find many black markets that offer illegal products and services, but there is a substantial difference between illegal goods.\n\nIn the dark net it isn\u2019t difficult to find sellers that offer weapons, but even if you pay for a gun or a rifle you will have no certainty about the shipment. Many articles I read highlights the availability of weapons in the Dark markets, but they don\u2019t explain that receive a weapon in total anonymity is not easy. In many cases, sellers are simply scammers, of course, victims of such kind of scams will never report it to law enforcement.\n\nOf course, law enforcement and authorities must monitor black markets and any other crime forums in the dark nets. The tragic event in Munich raised the discussion about the monitoring of the dark web.\n\nThe German police, such as other law enforcement agencies, will fight illegal activities in the Dark Web with new efforts and resources, the news was officialized on Wednesday by Holger Muench, head of Germany\u2019s Federal Police (BKA).\n\n\u201cWe see that the dark net is a growing trading place and therefore we need to prioritize our investigations here,\u201d said Holger Muench while presenting the latest annual report on cyber crime.\n\nAccording to the report, the cybercrime cost Germany 40.5 million euros  in 2015 (+2.8 percent compared to 2014), the German police is concerned about the increasing abuse of dark nets for crime activities.\n\n\u201cThe dark net, which is only accessible via special web browsers, is increasingly used to procure drugs, weapons, and counterfeit money, allowing users to trade anonymously and pay with digital currencies such as Bitcoin, the BKA said.\u201d reported the Reuters.\n\nThe officials from the BKA confirmed that the German police has shut down five market places in the dark web last year. The BKA will be committed to persecuting operators behind principal black markets to dismantle criminal rings behind them.\n\nThe BKA\u2019s document also reports more than 45,000 cases involved computer fraud, but the overall dimension of the criminal phenomena is much bigger.\n\n\u201cIf we look ahead we see little relief,\u201d added Muench. \u201cCyber crime is still a growing phenomenon \u2013 you could say almost a growing business, even a growing industry.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt this point, it is essential for law enforcement to intensify their HUMINT activities. Regarding the dark web and weapons, to better understand if it is so easy to buy weapons in the black market I suggest to take the principal black markets trying to buy such kind of goods \u2026 you will be surprised by the results.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dark Web, weapons)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-net", "topic_name": "dark net"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/german-police", "topic_name": "German Police"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/weapon", "topic_name": "weapon"}]}, {"news_name": "Hackers are offering for sale O2 customer data on the dark web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49716/deep-web/o2-customer-data-dark-web.html", "title": "Hackers are offering for sale O2 customer data on the dark web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 26, 2016", "body": "In the dark web it is possible to find any kind of illegal product and services, from weapons to payment card data, last disconcerting discovery is related to the availability of O2 customer data in the dark web.\n\nAccording to the Victoria Derbyshire programme the data are offered for sale, it seems that belong to the trove of information stolen from the gaming website XSplit three years ago.

This information was shared by the president of the Bavarian Office of Criminal Investigation (LKA), Robert Heimberger, on a Sunday press conference.\n\nIt seems that the Munich gunman purchased the weapon on the Dark Web according to Heimberger.\n\nThis means that someone has converted the weapon from non-functioning to being a killing machine. Who and where? It is still a mystery, the German authorities are still investigating the case, the unique certainty is that the Glock carries a certification mark from Slovakia.\n\n\u201c[it is ]a parallel world to the network from Facebook, Amazon, and other news pages, which most users are familiar with.\u201d are the words used by Heimberger to explain the dark web.\n\nThe president of the LKA highlighted that the dark web is a hidden place on the web where it is easy to find criminals offering weapons, drugs, and child pornography.\n\nThe investigators have found 57 shell casings belonging to the Munich gunman \u2018s 9mm Glock 17.  A police officer fired at David in a parking deck but the shot missed. The police excluded the presence of other shooters in the Munich attack.\n\nDavid was obsessed by mass shooting spree, he was inspired by cases like Anders Breivik\u2019massacre and by the Winnenden school shooting attack in 2009.\n\nDavid had been in psychological treatment for \u201csocial phobia\u201d and depression last year.\n\nBut it is really so easy to find weapons on the dark web?\n\nIn May 2016, producers from the German broadcaster ARD have conducted an interesting experiment to demonstrate if it is really so simple to buy goods on the dark web. He tried to buy an AK-47 rifle, aka Kala\u0161nikov and paid $800 worth of bitcoin.\n\nThe German journalists conducted an investigation for a show titled \u201cFear of terror\u2014how vulnerable is Germany\u201d with the intent to understand how criminals could access weapons offered for sale in the black markets.\n\nThe German channel ARD documented the threat posed by terrorism trying to explain how terrorists could exploit the technology for its activities.\n\n\u201cThere is this experiment at the beginning of the broadcast.#Beckmann Ordered via middleman a Kalashnikov in the darknet.At the end comes out: $ 800 paid \u2013 and get nothing.\u201d reported the German site Focus.\n\n\u201cBecause, as a customs expert, it is not so easy to procure weapons. Sounds weird, but is so.Only that this #Beckmann not nearly as informative as \u201cThe program with the mouse\u201d.\u201c\n\n\n\nThe Beckmann attempt to buy a weapon failed, but it is not clear if the package had been intercepted by law enforcement or it the seller was a scammer.\n\nSuch kind of problems are not rare in the black marketplaces, in November Joseph Cox from MotherBoard wrote an interesting article to explain the difficulty acquiring a weapon from the dark web.\n\n\u201cOne impetus for that is the heavy presence of scammers, who create fake accounts to dupe gullible gun hunters out of their money.\u201d wrote Cox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kinda addicted to the scamming part. It\u2019s too easy,\u201d one scammer told Motherboard in an email chat. The scammer used to operate under the handle \u201cBartsmit\u201d on AlphaBay, a popular market that sells stolen data, weapons, and drugs, among other goods. Today the scammer is still ripping people off, but under a different identity.\u201d\n\nDue to these difficulties, several black markets have stopped stocking weapons altogether.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dark Web, Munich gunman)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ak-47", "topic_name": "AK-47"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/munich-gunman", "topic_name": "Munich gunman"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/terrorism", "topic_name": "Terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/weapon", "topic_name": "weapon"}]}, {"news_name": "Delilah, the first Trojan to recruit Insiders", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49532/malware/delilah-trojan.html", "title": "Delilah, the first Trojan to recruit Insiders\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 20, 2016", "body": "Delilah is a strain of malware developed to extort victims into stealing insider data, it was first discovered on crime forums by the Israeli intelligence firm Diskin Advanced Technologies.\n\nDeliah is not distributed in open crimeware forums, instead, it is shared in among exclusive criminal communities.\n\nDelilah represents a novelty in the malware landscape, it relies on a combination of social engineering and extortion techniques.\n\nThe Gartner security expert Avivah Litan explained that the trojan was specifically designed to target employees, it gathers information on the victims in order to use them in extortion schema.\n\n\n\n\u201cDelilah recruits targeted insiders via social engineering and/or extortion, sometimes using ransomware techniques.

These predictions go back several years and seemingly each year, attention to the healthcare sector has been minimal at best, but we may finally have hit an inflection point in 2016.\n\nThe healthcare sector is a labyrinth of governance and compliance with risk mitigations squarely focused on the privacy of patient data.  We in the industry have accepted the norm that \u201csecurity is not convenient\u201d but for those in the healthcare industry, inconvenience can have a catastrophic impact on a hospital, including the loss of a patient\u2019s life.  Besides patient records, there\u2019s a multitude of other services critical to patient health and wellbeing wrapped by an intricate web of cutting-edge and legacy technologies making it perhaps the most challenging environment to secure.  This may explain the rise in attacks against healthcare providers in the last six months.\n\nAccording to an article on fastcompany.com\u2019s website, complete medical records are selling for US$60 apiece on the dark web compared to stolen credit card selling for about US$3 bucks a piece on the high end. According to the article, one hacker claimed to have over a million full medical records of individuals. Although the individual\u2019s claims were not verified, it should come as no surprise.  Sadly, it may be a more dire situation than we know.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Brookings Institute, since 2009, the medical information of more than 155 million.  The report delves into a number of statistics that really punctuate the problem showing the number of incidents sharply increasing in late 2014 and continuing its ascent upward each year.  The report also outlines other unique significant challenges citing the large volumes of data being for long period of time much of it stored digitally.  This, coupled with the explosion of spending on technologies to handle digital health records, many hospitals are doing what they can to keep their heads above water deploying new technologies that have been mandated upon them rather than a phased approach commensurate with staffing levels.\n\nIt\u2019s not just core network services causing concern.  ICS-CERT recently released an advisory identifying numerous vulnerabilities in Philips Xper-IM Connect systems running Windows XP.   Xper-IM is an automated software composition tool that provides physio- monitoring capabilities along with reporting, scheduling, inventory, and data management.\n\nAccording to the advisory, the breakdown of vulnerabilities by CVSA scores are as follows:\n\nThough mitigating the vulnerability may be as simple as upgrading off of Windows XP, the fact that XP is still out in the wild may be further evidence that the healthcare industry is falling behind in protecting itself from cyber criminals.\n\nIn January of this year, Melbourne\u2019s largest hospital network was significantly impacted when a computer virus affected the hospitals Windows XP systems disrupting meal delivery and pathology results. Manual workarounds such as fax machines were utilized as a contingency but the use of those devices only compounds the issues of patient privacy.  It\u2019s those types of disruptions that really jeopardize the patient privacy and even safety.  It\u2019s hard to determine how many medical devices and critical services in the healthcare industry are still running Windows XP in their environments, but it is likely a number many would shudder to think about.\n\nIt is likely healthcare breaches will continue to grow upward.  Funding and prioritization of initiatives are only the tip of the iceberg for healthcare institutions looking to secure their networks.  Even on a solid footing, the sector will be confronted with a shortage of talent to carry out even the best-intended plans.

Although not a completely anonymizing solution, it does prove to be an additional hindrance for many unprepared law enforcement agencies throughout the globe. Even when particular users seem to be given them a helping hand from time to time.\n\nEuropol, Europe\u2019s law enforcement body made similar calls in a 2014 report when addressing the shortcoming in its capabilities of dealing with online drug dealing.

This release features important security updates to Firefox.\u201d states the announcement published by the Tor Project.\n\nA group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), composed of Mauro Conti, Stephen Crane, Tommaso Frassetto, Andrei Homescu, Georg Koppen, Per Larsen, Christopher Liebchen, Mike Perry, and Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi published an interesting paper entitled \u201cSelfrando: Securing the Tor Browser against De-anonymization Exploits\u201d that presents the recently introduced Selfrando feature.\n\nThe team also shared the Selfrando project on GitHub.\n\nSelfrando is an enhanced and practical load-time randomization technique implemented for the Tor Browser that aims to defend Tor users against exploits.\n\nThe Selfrando will prevent intelligence agencies from de-anonymizing users through exploits. In the past, we discussed many cases where the FBI and law enforcement used exploits to unmask Tor users, including the case of the Playpen child pornography portal.\n\nIn the Playpen case, the FBI arrested Jay Michaud, a Vancouver public schools administration worker right after the law enforcement closed the popular child pornography site that was hosted on the dark web. The authorities used a specific exploit, known as network investigative technique (NIT), to track visitors of the Playpen bulletin board hidden service.\n\nThe FBI was able to harvest around 1300 IPs, and until the moment 137 people have been charged. The network investigative technique used by the FBI included computers in the UK, Chile, and Greece.\n\nWhat is Selfrando?\n\nSelfrando is a solution developed by the experts to significantly improve security over standard address space layout randomization (ASLR) techniques. The ASLR techniques are today used by Firefox and the most popular browsers, they were involved in protection from exploits leveraging buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\nThe team of researchers worked with the experts at the Tor Project to ensure that the Selfrando feature is fully compatible with AddressSanitizer (ASan), a compiler feature to detect memory corruption. The ASan technique is implemented in a hardened version of Tor Browser for test purposes, so the Tor Project decided to include Selfrando in the hardened releases of the Tor Browser.\n\n\n\nThe researchers demonstrated that the startup and performance overheads resulting from the implementation of the Selfrando technique are negligible (less than 1% overhead to running times).\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the feature is that it doesn\u2019t need further development efforts, it doesn\u2019t need too many changes to existing code.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to the report \u2026 it is simply amazing.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013 (Tor Browser, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/code-randomization", "topic_name": "code randomization"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/de-anonymization-exploits", "topic_name": "De-anonymization exploits"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/selfrando", "topic_name": "Selfrando"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-browser", "topic_name": "Tor Browser"}]}, {"news_name": "Over 45 Million passwords from Verticalscope 1,000 sites leaked online", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48404/deep-web/verticalscope-data-breach.html", "title": "Over 45 Million passwords from Verticalscope 1,000 sites leaked online\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 15, 2016", "body": "Data breaches, a never ending saga!

Many of the sites they go to off-hours were likely compromised in a way that allowed the credentials to end up on the dark web.\u201d\n\nExperts from the Anomali firm have found 5,275 employee email and clear text password combinations from FTSE 100 companies available on the Dark Web, on crime forums, on paste sites, or posted through accidental exposure\n\nThe data is alarming is we consider that average of 50 employees for each FTSE 100 company have had their credentials exposed online.\n\n\u201cThe list includes not only included companies with headquarters in the UK, but also any global subsidiary of those companies.\u201d states the report. \u201cThe Oil and Gas vertical accounted for nearly 20% with 1,090 accounts\u201d\n\nExperts pointed out the bad habit of employees for visiting non-work-related sites that have then been hacked. This is the case of a major UK-based football website that suffered a data breach in April and its data was leaked on the Dark web.\n\nAnomali estimated that 40 corporate credentials across 23 companies were exposed in this security breach.\n\n\u201cEmployees need to be reminded of the dangers of surfing to these types of websites and logging in using corporate email addresses and passwords.  Companies should monitor for compromised employee credentials so they can force reset accounts and gather metrics about how often employees are using their work email addresses for access to non-work related websites,\u201d states Anomali.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dark Web, Brand Spoofing)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/brand-spoofing", "topic_name": "Brand Spoofing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/company-reputation", "topic_name": "company reputation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malicious-domain-registrations", "topic_name": "malicious domain registrations"}]}, {"news_name": "Hundred Million Stolen MySpace Passwords for sale in the darkweb", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/47782/data-breach/leaked-myspace-passwords.html", "title": "Hundred Million Stolen MySpace Passwords for sale in the darkweb\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 28, 2016", "body": "A few days ago a hacker with the nickname \u201cPeace\u201d offered for sale on the black market 117 million LinkedIn account credentials.\n\nThe same hacker is offering for sale 360 million emails and passwords of MySpace users, an amazing amount of data, one of the largest password leaks of ever.

These components are the backbone for the generation of encryption keys. If the attacker is able to predict the numbers used for the generation of the encryption keys it could discover the range of possible key and try to compromise the entire encryption process.\n\nNow you can imagine the importance of Random Number Generators (RGNs) for the Tor anonymizing network that heavily rely on encryption.\n\nThe Tor network relies on the Onion routing for anonymous communication over a computer network. Messages are encapsulated in layers of encryption, and encrypted data is transmitted through a series of network nodes (onion routers), each of which peels away a single layer, to establish next hop to send data to. The process is reiterated until the message reaches the final destination. The sender remains anonymous because each intermediary node only knows the immediately preceding node from which the node arrived and the following nodes.\n\nTor developer started to work on a distributed random number generator several months ago and now announced a significant evolution on the project.\n\n\u201cOur main goal with this meeting was to accelerate the development of the Next Generation Onion Services project (aka proposal 224). We have been working on this project for the past several months and have made great progress. However, it\u2019s a huge project! Because of its volume and complexity,\u201d states a blog post published by the Tor Project. \u201cwe started designing a system for distributed random number generation on the Tor network. A \u201cdistributed random number generator\u201dis a system where multiple computers collaborate and generate a single random number in a way that nobody could have predicted in advance (not even themselves). Such a system will be used by next generation onion services to inject unpredictability into the system and enhance their security.\n\nTor developers finished implementing the protocol several months ago, and since then we\u2019ve been reviewing, auditing, and testing the code.\u201d\n\nEach researcher involved in the project set up a Tor node and enabled the \u201cdistributed random number generation\u201d feature. The experts at Tor Project tested their new solution last week on an 11-node belonging the Tor network.\n\n\u201cWe had Tor nodes in countries all around the world, just like the real Tor network, but this was a network just for ourselves! This resulted in a \u201ctesting Tor network\u201d with 11 nodes, all performing the random number generation protocol for a whole week.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe test ran for an entire week and allowed the team to find and fix bugs, they also confirmed that their system can work even in the case of a network failure.\n\n\u201cThis allowed us to test scenarios that could make the protocol burp and fail in unpredictable ways.\u201d states the post \u201cFor example, we instructed our testing Tor nodes to abort at crucial protocol moments, and come back in the worst time possible ways, just to stress test the system. We had our nodes run ancient Tor versions, perform random chaotic behaviors, disappear and never come back, etc.\u201d\n\nThe project for a distributed Random Number Generator is still ongoing, the developers believe they can still improve it.\n\nThe experts believe it will be implemented in the next version of Tor that will also adopt 55-character-long addresses instead actual 55-character-long addresses.\n\nIf you are interested in the full spec for next-generation Tor give a look to the Proposal 224.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

A keyboard, a few bitcoins, and a couple of clicks allows anyone to buy a weapon or any kind of chemical drug. Is it true?\n\nThe dark web is the reign of scammers too, many sellers claim to have products that will send to buyers, even when they have paid for it.\n\nProducers from the German broadcaster ARD have conducted an interesting experiment to demonstrate if it is really so simple to buy goods on the dark web. He tried to buy an AK-47 rifle, aka Kala\u0161nikov and paid $800 worth of bitcoin.\n\nThe German journalists conducted an investigation for a show titled \u201cFear of terror\u2014how vulnerable is Germany\u201d with the intent to understand how criminals could access weapons offered for sale in the black markets.\n\nThe German channel ARD documented the threat posed by terrorism trying to explain how terrorists could exploit the technology for its activities.\n\n\u201cThere is this experiment at the beginning of the broadcast.#Beckmann Ordered via middleman a Kalashnikov in the darknet.At the end comes out: $ 800 paid \u2013 and get nothing.\u201d reported the German site Focus.\n\n\u201cBecause, as a customs expert, it is not so easy to procure weapons.Sounds weird, but is so.Only that this #Beckmann not nearly as informative as \u201cThe program with the mouse\u201d.\u201c\n\nAt the beginning of the show, host Reinhold Beckmann instructed a third party to buy an AK-47 rifle. The journalist also asked to the head of the German Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Criminal Police Office) if it is really possible to find weapons online and he confirmed that black markets are the right places where to buy them.\n\nThe Beckmann attempt to buy a weapon failed, but it is not clear if the package had been intercepted by law enforcement or it the seller was a scammer.\n\n\n\nSuch kind of problems are not rare in the black marketplaces, in November Joseph Cox from MotherBoard wrote an interesting article to explain the difficulty acquiring a weapon from the dark web.\n\n\u201cOne impetus for that is the heavy presence of scammers, who create fake accounts to dupe gullible gun hunters out of their money.\u201d wrote Cox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kinda addicted to the scamming part. It\u2019s too easy,\u201d one scammer told Motherboard in an email chat. The scammer used to operate under the handle \u201cBartsmit\u201d on AlphaBay, a popular market that sells stolen data, weapons, and drugs, among other goods. Today the scammer is still ripping people off, but under a different identity.\u201d\n\nDue to these difficulties, several black markets have stopped stocking weapons altogether.\n\nIn July 2105, one of the most popular black markets, Agora, stopped selling guns as announced in a statement published by the site administrators:\n\n\u201cStarting from July 15th 2015 Agora will no longer list lethal weapons.\nFollowing our mission we wish such objects would be available for purchase, but the current reality of it is that the format of a market like ours does not constitute a good way to do it. Shipping weapons is hard, they are expensive and stimulate both scamming by dishonest vendors and honeypot listings by agencies looking to find buyers who might wish to obtain such weapons illegally from us.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement warns of a growing number of scammers that operate in the weapon trade in the dark web, on the other side many operators of black markets blame authorities for infiltrating this specific trade.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

Ran$umBin is specialized for both criminals as well as the victims. It lets the criminal upload stolen data which contains user credentials, credit data, stolen identities and any other kind of cyber-loot and on the other hand it lets the victims pay for the removal of those stolen data from the Dark Web, where any cyber criminal can buy the stolen data.\n\nThe below dump from Ran$sumBin contain\u2019s username as well as password.\n\n\n\nIt has been found that Ran$umBin has been active for under two months.

But they assure that the stolen data is validated to make sure that the data isn\u2019t old or irrelevant.\n\nSo far it is unknown who runs this operation, but based upon their language and their service structure, it is predicted that these are American Players. In fact, they also promote their service using a designated Twitter Account and have gained some traction among cyber criminals on the other hand this service has also been referred on different forums.\n\nThere is a huge team of cyber criminal teaming in the cyber underground with markets of all kinds, Certainly this type of market was to evolve. Ran$umBin\u2019s operators are indeed American, their initiative might not hold for a long time. The North American underground market is less secretive than similar markets in Russia, Brazil, or the far east.\n\nOften this kind of websites is taken down by authorities.

Bringing up the rear are Kenya (61%), South Korea (61%) and Sweden (61%).\n\nIt is not clear in fact if people interviewed were made aware of the legal usage of dark net before answering the question.\n\nThe Dark Web is a place crowded of cyber criminals and hackers that host the most popular black markets, but it a serious mistake to forgot that it is also a precious environment for journalists, activists, whistleblowers and political dissidents that escape from the censorship and repression.\n\nMany experts ask me if there is a way to discover the real proportions between illegal and legal contents in the dark web, and I always explain that it depends on the sample that we use for the elaboration of the statistics.\n\nRecently the intelligence firms Intelliagg and Darksum have issued an interesting report that tried to provide a reply to the above question. The researchers involved in the study focused their analysis on the Tor network that represent a significant portion of the dark web,but not its totality.\n\nThe experts used a spider software to crawl the Tor network and collect the information used in the study.\n\n\u201cWe compiled our census of the dark web using the Darksum \u2018collection software\u2019, a \u2018spider\u2019 or software application that crawls through the web following links in order to compile an index of its pages, and Intelliagg\u2019s \u2018machine-learning intelligence classification system\u2019 \u2013 complex algorithms that are \u2018trained\u2019 by humans then sent off to classify data automatically.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cOur classification system was \u2018trained\u2019 using data that had been classified manually from 1,000 sites on the dark web. It proceeded to classify the remaining data automatically without human supervision. This automated method proved to be 94% as accurate as it would have been had this process been entirely done by hand, meaning that nine times out of 10 our algorithms came to the same conclusion as an experienced analyst\u201d\n\nThe experts run their spiders two weeks in February 2016 focusing their analysis on selected dark web services, including pornography, fake documentation services, drugs, carding sites, financial fraud sites, weapons, blogs.\n\n\n\nAccording to the experts, the Tor network is currently composed of approximately 30,000 distinct .onion addresses that result active.\n\nThe spiders accessed websites in a total of 32 different languages, the vast majority of information on the hidden services network is in English, followed by German and Chinese.\n\nOf the 29,532 .onion identified during the sampling period, only 46% percent could be accessed, the remaining part is related to C&C infrastructure used to manage botnet, file-sharing applications or chat clients.\n\n\u201cA total of 29,532 \u2018.onion\u2019 addresses were identified during the sampling period. Of these, fewer than half were accessible at some point during this period. The remaining 54% (which were not analysed further) were probably only up on the dark web for a very short period of time. This could be for many reasons: commonly that they were addresses relating to \u2018command and control\u2019 servers used to manage malicious software, chat clients, or file-sharing applications\u201d continues the study.\n\nThe real surprise is related to the hidden services automatically analyzed by the experts, 48% can be classified as illegal under UK and US law. By analyzing manually a separate sample composed of 1,000 hidden services the experts found about 68% of the content to be illegal.\n\nBelow the percentages of content associated with each category.\n\n\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dark Web, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darknets", "topic_name": "darknets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}]}, {"news_name": "CloudFlare considers 94 percent of the Tor traffic as \u201cper se malicious\u201d", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45897/deep-web/malicious-tor-traffic.html", "title": "CloudFlare considers 94 percent of the Tor traffic as \u201cper se malicious\u201d\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 3, 2016", "body": "The experts from the Content delivery network (CDN) CloudFlare revealed that 94 percent of the Tor traffic they ordinary see is \u201cmalicious.\u201d\n\nIt is not a mystery that Tor is becoming a favored tool of cyber criminals so many websites are blocking Tor users or degrading the services they receive, and CloudFlare has analyzed this issue in a blog post entitled \u201cThe Trouble with Tor.\u201d\n\n\n\nCloudFlare is not condemning the Tor network, in the post it highlights its importance for Anonymity online.\n\n\u201cBased on data across the CloudFlare network, 94% of requests that we see across the Tor network are per se malicious.\u201d wrote Matthew Prince, the CloudFlare CEO.\n\nA large portion of traffic on the Tor Network is generated by illegal activities that harm Internet users, for example according to data provided by Project Honey Pot, 18% of global email spam, roughly 6.5 trillion unwanted messages per year, begin with an automated bot harvesting email addresses via the Tor network. In\n\nIn response to a large number of websites adopt many types of restrictions for Tor users like the CAPTCHA verification.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they are visiting controversial content, but instead that they are automated requests designed to harm our customers. A large percentage of the comment spam, vulnerability scanning, ad click fraud, content scraping, and login scanning comes via the Tor network.\u201d continues Prince.\n\nCloudFlare allows its customers to choose how they want to handle the traffic coming from Tor, they can whitelist all Tor traffic, block all traffic, use CAPTCHAs, or use a JavaScript challenge that checks the user\u2019s browser.\n\nExperts at CloudFlare believe that users will have two long term solutions, create a Tor version of their website that will accept only Tor traffic, or get the Tor Browser to make the distinction between human and automated traffic.\n\nSo What\u2019s Next?\n\nCloudFlare is working to reduce problems of navigation for the Tor users, limiting for example, the impact of CAPTCHAs.\n\n\u201cCloudFlare is working to reduce the impact of CAPTCHAs on Tor users without in any way compromising their anonymity and without exposing our customers to additional risk. Over the coming weeks and months we will roll out changes designed to make the lives of legitimate Tor Browser users easier while keeping our customers safe,\u201d Prince said.\n\nIn response to the data published by CloudFlare, the developers behind the Tor Project released the \u201cFact sheet,\u201d a report that analyzed the impact of the CloudFlare actions on the Tor users.\n\nThe experts are accusing CloudFlare of blocking the access of Tor users to major websites, like Amnesty International.\n\nIn many cases, Tor users are displayed annoying CAPTCHAs that might get users surfing with unsafe browsers in revealing their location.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, the problematic CAPTCHAs might get users to access websites via unsafe browsers that can reveal their location, which can represent a serious risk for human rights activists and other groups for which anonymity is crucial. On the other hand, new users might believe they are not using Tor correctly, which could lead to them abandoning Tor altogether.\u201d states the Tor Project.\n\n\u201cCloudFlare\u2019s CAPTCHA system results in de facto censorship, since Tor users either cannot access a site or are deterred from using a site because of the obstacles presented by the CAPTCHAs\u201d the Tor Project said.\n\n.@SwartzCr is probably a robot tho. #dontblocktor pic.twitter.com/jjh3PUpgF7\n\n\u2014 Griffin Boyce (@abditum) 31 marzo 2016\n\n\n\nThe members of the Tor Project are disappointed with CloudFlare that ignored the issue at least since 2013.\n\nThe experts at the Tor Project have argued that the malicious Tor traffic seen by CloudFlare is generated by a \u201ctiny fraction of the millions of daily Tor users.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile many Tor relays appear as \u201cmalicious\u201d from CloudFlare\u2019s point of view, the abuse is likely coming from a tiny fraction of the millions of daily Tor users\u201d states the Tor Project.\n\n\u201cWhen a connection to a website travels over Tor, it will exit the network via one of the thousand exit relays set up by volunteers all over the world. The largest exit nodes transport more than 70,000 connections at a given moment. If a small number of these connections contains what CloudFlare qualifies as \u2018malicious traffic\u2019 (spam, typically), CloudFlare will consider any subsequent connection as \u2018malicious\u2019,\u201d added the Tor Project\u201cBecause exit relays are picked (usually at random) by the Tor client, a single bad guy could have all relays qualified as transporting \u2018malicious traffic\u2019.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Tor Traffic, CloudFlare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/captcha", "topic_name": "CAPTCHA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloudflare", "topic_name": "CloudFlare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spam", "topic_name": "spam"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-traffic", "topic_name": "Tor Traffic"}]}, {"news_name": "Feds request Judge to review the order to reveal TOR Exploit Code", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45772/laws-and-regulations/feds-tor-exploit-code.html", "title": "Feds request Judge to review the order to reveal TOR Exploit Code\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 30, 2016", "body": "A few weeks ago, a judge has ordered the FBI to reveal the complete source code for the TOR exploit to defense lawyers in a child porn case.\n\nIn a case involving child pornography, the FBI was ruled by a judge to provide all the code used to hack the PC of suspects and detailed information related to the procedure they have followed to de-anonymize Tor users.\n\nColin Fieman, a federal public defender working on the case was asked by motherborard.vice.com if the code would include exploits to bypass security features, Fieman\u2019s reply was that the code would bypass \u201ceverything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe declaration from our code expert was quite specific and comprehensive, and the order encompasses everything he identified,\u201d he told to MotherBoard.\n\nFieman is defending Jay Michaud, a Vancouver public schools administration worker arrested by the FBI right after the FBI closed a popular child pornography site called \u201cPlaypen\u201d hosted in the dark web, and where a network investigative technique (NIT)\u2014the agency\u2019s term for a hacking tool.\n\nAccording to court documents reviewed by Motherboard, the FBI had used the NIT to identify the suspects while surfing on the Tor network.\n\nThe FBI monitored a bulletin board hidden service launched in August 2014, named Playpen, mainly used for \u201cthe advertisement and distribution of child pornography.\u201d\n\nThe FBI was able to harvest around 1300 IPs, and until the moment 137 people have been charged.

The study reports the principal solution and services proposed to the crooks in a model of sale known as crime-as-a-service that is able to attract new actors in the cyber arena.\n\nA first data that immediately catches the attacention of the experts is decrease of prices recently offered, this is a further element of attractive for criminals that look to the cyber crime with increasing interest.\n\n\u201cThe barriers to launching cybercrime have decreased. Toolkits are becoming more available and cheaper; some are even offered free of charge. Prices are lower and features are richer. Underground forums are thriving worldwide, particularly in Russia, China, and Brazil. These have become popular means to sell products and services to cybercriminals in the said countries. Cybercriminals are also making use of the Deep Web to sell products and services outside the indexed or searchable World Wide Web, making their online \u201cshops\u201d harder for law enforcement to find and take down.\u201d states the \u2018The Brazilian Underground Market\u2019 report.\n\nAnother element of distinction between the Brazilian underground and the Russian and Chinese ones, is the availability of training services, for this reason, the Brazilian underground ecosystem is also considered as the market for cybercriminal Wannabes.\n\n\u201cWhat distinguishes the Brazilian underground from others is the fact that it also offers training services for cybercriminal wannabes,\u201d according to the whitepaper. \u201cCybercriminals in Brazil particularly offer FUD (fully undetectable) crypter programming and fraud training by selling how-to videos and providing support services via Skype. Anyone who is Internet savvy and has basic computing knowledge and skill can avail of training services to become cybercriminals. How-to videos and forums where they can exchange information with peers abound underground. Several trainers offer services as well. They even offer support when training ends.\u201d\n\nThe Brasilian cyber criminals seem to be more ruthless in the use of media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Skype, and WhatsApp, differently from Russian and Chinese players that \u201chide in the Deep Web and use tools that ordinary users do not such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels\u201d\n\nFor several years, Brazil has been known for the offer of banking Trojans, many malware were designed by Brazilian which targeted internal banking users and that implemented several techniques to steal victims\u2019\ncredentials. Brazil ranks second worldwide in terms of online banking fraud and malware infection, on a global scale it accounts for almost 9% of the total number of online-banking malicious code that compromised\n\n\n\nBanking Trojan source codes are sold for around US$386 each, the offer allows buyers to modify their codes according to their needs, they can obfuscate strings, customize the composition of payloads and add crypters and other solution to evade the detection. Another product very popular are  Bolware kits and toolkits used to create bolware that are offered for around US$155, the applications offered by cybercriminals are user-friendly and implements an easy to use control panel for monitoring and managing infections and malicious activities.\n\n\n\nThe Brazilian underground also offers bank fraud courses for aspiring cyber-criminals, the courses are very articulated and propose detailed information for beginners to the criminal activities. The courses start presenting the fraud workflow and tools necessary to arrange a cyber fraud. Some coursed are arranged in modules that propose interesting information on the illegal practices to cybercriminal wannabes that can acquire also interactive guides and practical exercises (e.g., simulating attacks). A 10-module course for example is offered for US$468, the operators also offer updates and a Skype contact service.\n\nAccording to the author of the study on the Brazilian underground market, Trend Micro Senior Threat Researcher Fernando Merces, several factors have contributed to the growth of cyber-criminal activity in the country like limited resources assigned to law enforcement and the existence of a flexible underground market.\n\n\u201cFor example, Brazil has a lack of concrete laws and limited law enforcement agency resources that address cybercrime in the country,\u201d he noted. \u201cAdditionally, the technological and consumer landscape in Brazil, which has a 50% Internet penetration rate, and a 69% credit card penetration rate, has made the country all too appealing for cybercriminals. However, another factor may have also contributed to Brazilian cybercrime: the existence of a flexible underground market with different offerings, ranging from banking Trojan development to online fraud training. The latter is highly notable as this is the most unique item in the market, which may not be found in other underground markets.\u201d explained Merces in a blog post.  \n\nThe report details prices and products for many other products and services, including Credit card credentials and number generators, SMS-spamming services and phishing pages for popular banks.\n\nLet me close the post with a meaningful statement from the author of the study that explains how is simple today to become a dangerous cybercriminal with limited resources.\n\n \u201cIn Brazil, it\u2019s possible to start a new career in cybercrime armed with only US$500,\u201d Merces blogged. \u201cWould-be cybercriminals are supported and helped by tools, forums, and experts from the dark side of the Internet.

Chakravarty claims that his team has reached a 100 percent \u2018decloaking\u2019 success rate under laboratory conditions.\n\nThe research revealed that more than 81 percent of Tor clients can be de-anonymized by exploiting the Netflow technology designed by Cisco for its network appliances.\n\nThe Netflow technology was introduced by Cisco into its routers to implement an instrument to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. The data provided by NetFlow allows a network administrator to qualify the network traffic managed by the router and identify the causes of congestion. The protocol is a standard de facto and it runs today by default in the hardware of many other network device manufacturers.\n\nThe technique proposed by Chakravarty implements an active traffic analysis based on the introduction of specific traffic perturbations on server side and evaluating a similar perturbation on the client side through statistical correlation.\n\n\u201cWe present an active traffic analysis method based on deliberately perturbing the characteristics of user traffic at the server side, and observing a similar perturbation at the client side through statistical correlation. We evaluate the accuracy of our method using both in-lab testing, as well as data gathered from a public Tor relay serving hundreds of users. Our method revealed the actual sources of anonymous traffic with 100% accuracy for the in-lab tests, and achieved an overall accuracy of about 81.4% for the real-world experiments, with an average false positive rate of 6.4.\u201d states the paper.\n\nIn a previous research, Chakravarty demonstrated that having access to a few Internet exchange points is enough for monitoring a signi\ufb01cant percentage of the network paths from Tor nodes to destination servers. This means that a powerful and persistent attacker can run traf\ufb01c analysis attacks by observing similar traf\ufb01c patterns at various points of the network.\n\nThis new research exploits reveals how to run an effective traffic analysis attack with less traf\ufb01c monitoring capabilities, such as Cisco\u2019s NetFlow,to run a traf\ufb01c analysis attack on a large scale.\n\nUnlike previous research, this new traffic analysis attack would not necessarily need the resources of a Government to run the monitoring activity, the researcher explained that a single AS (Autonomous System) could monitor more than 39 percent of randomly-generated Tor circuits.\n\nA traffic analysis attack doesn\u2019t request the enormous infrastructural effort than the previous technique, but it exploits one or more high-bandwidth and high-performance Tor relays. The team used a modified public Tor server, hosted at the time at Columbia University, running on Linux for its tests.\n\n\n\nThe researchers simulate the internet activity of a typical Tor user, they injected a repeating traffic pattern (i.e. HTML files) into the TCP connection that it sees originating in the target exit node, and then analyzed the traffic at exit node, as derived from the router\u2019s flow records, to improve client identification.\n\n\n\n \n\nIn a first phase the research was conducted in Lab environment with surprising results, in a second phase, the team started the live sessions using real Tor traf\ufb01c. The team analyzed the traffic obtained from its public Tor relay that served hundreds of Tor circuits simultaneously.\n\nThe targeted victims were hosted on three different locations on the Planetlab, the global research network that supports the development of new network services. The chosen locations are Texas (US), Leuven (Belgium) and Corfu (Greece).\n\nThe victim clients downloaded a large \ufb01le from the server that deliberately introduced perturbations in the arriving TCP connection\u2019s traf\ufb01c, thereby deliberately injecting a traf\ufb01c pattern in the stream between the server and the exit node.\n\n\u201cThe process was terminated after a short while and we computed the correlation between the bytes transferred between the server and the recently terminated connection from the exit node and the entry node and the several clients that used it, during this interval.\u201d states the paper.\n\nThe test session was organized in two parts, a first session to evaluate the effectiveness when retrieving data from open-source NetFlow packages, in the second round  the team used sparse data obtained from its institutional Cisco router.\n\n\n\nDe-anonymization of Tor users is a primary goal for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, that having great computational resources are able to run similar attacks. Many experts speculate that also the recent Operation Onymous that allowed the seizure of several dark market places, including the popular Silk Road 2.0, may have exploited a traffic analysis attack against Tor network to identify the operators of the black markets.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Tor Traffic Analysis Attack, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-market", "topic_name": "black market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/netflow", "topic_name": "Netflow"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-onymous", "topic_name": "Operation Onymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sambuddho-chakravarty", "topic_name": "Sambuddho Chakravarty"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/silk-road", "topic_name": "Silk Road"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/traffic-analysis-attack", "topic_name": "Traffic Analysis Attack"}]}, {"news_name": "The good and the bad of the Deep Web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8719/deep-web/the-good-and-the-bad-of-the-deep-web.html", "title": "The good and the bad of the Deep Web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 17, 2012", "body": " \n\nThe Deep Web (or Invisible web) is the set of information resources on the World Wide Web not reported by normal search engines, according a raw estimation of some security experts clear web represents only a small portion of the overall web content, the remaining part is unknown to the majority of web users.\n\nOrdinary web users are literally shocked when understand the existence of the Deep Web, a network of interconnected systems, not indexed, having a size hundreds of times higher than the current web, around 500 times.\n\nTo explain the Deep Web I use to cite the definition provided by the founder of BrightPlanet, Mike Bergman, that compared searching on the Internet today to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed.\n\n\n\n \n\nWho and why could be interested in the Deep Web? Is the Deep Web the reign of cybercrime? Is it legal surf in anonymity?\n\nProfessionals have several advantages to surf through Deep Web and the conviction that it represents a parallel world of illicit activities is profoundly wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the consideration that illicit activities are daily arranged on clear web such as in the Deep Web, in many cases we have read of platforms used to spread and sell malware on the ordinary web and we all know that is quite simple to find any kind of objects, also illegal, on the clear web.\n\nBut what primarily distinguishes the clear web from the Deep Web? Of course, when we speak of hidden web we can think of a dark world characterized by the possibility to surf, under specific conditions, in total anonymity. This aspect makes very desirable the Deep Web for cyber criminals that in short time is moving all their activities in the dark world.\n\nBut consider also that the Deep Web is the privileged channel used by governments to exchange documents secretly, for journalists to bypass censorship of several states and also dissidents to avoid the control of authoritarian regimes\u2026 and these are just a few samples of not illicit use of the resources of the deep web.\n\nHow is possible that resources located on the web are not visible and which are the content of the hidden web? \n\nOrdinary search engines use software called \u201ccrawlers\u201d to find content on the web, they are computer programs that browse the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner and are mainly used to create a copy of all the visited pages for later processing by a search engine that will index the downloaded pages to provide fast searches.\n\nThis technique is ineffective in finding the hidden resources on the Web that could be classified into the following categories:\n\nThe  Tor Network, how to preserve the anonymity?\n\nTor is the acronym of \u201cThe onion router\u201d, a system implemented to enable online anonymity as part of a project sponsored the US Naval Research Laboratory from 2004 to 2005 and successively supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nActually the software is under development and maintenance of Tor Project. A user that navigate using Tor it\u2019s difficult to trace ensuring his privacy because the data are encrypted multiple times passing through nodes, Tor relays, of the network.\n\nTor client software routes Internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers hiding user\u2019s information eluding any activities of monitoring.\n\nHow does Tor network work?\n\nImagine a typical scenario where Alice desire to be connected with Bob using the Tor network. Let\u2019s see step by step how it is possible.\n\nShe makes an unencrypted connection to a centralized directory server containing the addresses of Tor nodes. After receiving the address list from the directory server the Tor client software will connect to a random node (the entry node), through an encrypted connection. The entry node would make an encrypted connection to a random second node which would in turn do the same to connect to a random third Tor node. The process goes on until it involves a node (exit node) connected to the destination.\n\nConsider that during Tor routing, in each connection, the Tor node is randomly chosen and the same node cannot be used twice in the same path. To ensure anonymity the connections have a fixed duration. Every ten minutes to avoid statistical analysis that could compromise the user\u2019s privacy, the client software changes the entry node\n\nUp to now we have considered an ideal situation in which a user accesses the network only to connect to another. To further complicate the discussion, in a real scenario, the node Alice could in turn be used as a node for routing purposes with other established connections between other users.\n\nA malevolent third-party would not be able to know which connection is initiated as a user and which as node making impossible the monitoring of the communications.\n\n\n\nIs it legal to surf in anonymity? Right to anonymity \u2013 Legal implications\n\nEvery day, all our web actions leave traces of ourselves and of our way of life through the storing of massive amounts of personal data in databases on the internet, all these information composes our digital identity, our representation in the cyber space.\n\nUsers are \u201centities\u201d in the cyberspace, built also with the correlation of data that increasingly escapes the control of the owner, anyone can theoretically \u201cexpropriate\u201d of our digital identity.\n\nToday tracking user activities on internet are one of the primary interests of private companies and Governments, business and political motivations are pushing for the development of monitoring and surveillance systems.\n\nAnonymous communications have an important place in our political and social discourse, many individuals desire to hide their identities because they may be concerned about political or economic retribution harassment or even threats to their lives.\n\nAnonymity is derived from the Greek word anonymia, meaning \u201cwithout a name\u201d, in the common usage the term refers to the state of an individual\u2019s personal identity, or personally identifiable information, being publicly unknown.\n\nIn internet the anonymity is guaranteed when IP addresses cannot be tracked, due this reason it has been assisted in the creation of Anonymizing services such as I2P \u2013 The Anonymous Network or Tor address. The anonymizing services are based on the concept of distribution of routing information, during a transmission in fact is not known prior the path between source and destination and every node of the network manage minimal information to route the packets to the next hop without conserving history on the path, the introduction of encryption algorithms makes impossible the wiretapping of the information and the composition of the original messages.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has ruled repeatedly that the right to anonymous free speech is protected by the First Amendment. A much-cited 1995 Supreme Court ruling in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission reads:\n\nProtections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse. Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical minority views . . . Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society.\n\nMany institutions and foundations, such as The Electronic Frontier Foundation, are spending a great effort to protect the rights to on-line anonymity.  As one court observed in a case handled by EFF along with the ACLU of Washington:\n\n\u201c[T]he free exchange of ideas on the Internet is driven in large part by the ability of Internet users to communicate anonymously.\u201d\n\nUS First Amendment settled that the right to speak anonymously, the Supreme Court has held,\n\n\u201cAnonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority,\u201d that \u201cexemplifies the purpose\u201d of the First Amendment: \u201cto protect unpopular individuals from retaliation\u2026at the hand of an intolerant society.\u201d\n\nCourt pronunciations establish the duty of government to guard against undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas, a vigilant review that\n\n\u201cmust be undertaken and analyzed on a case-by-case basis\u201d.\n\nUS laws establish a right to Speak Anonymously on the Internet and also right to Read Anonymously on the Internet, ensuring the principle of free internet ideological confrontation and the right to free movement of information.\n\n \u201cPeople are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law. This ability to speak one\u2019s mind without the burden of the other party knowing all the facts about one\u2019s identity can foster open communication and robust debate.\u201d\n\nThe technological developments of recent years caused high attention to the legal and technological possibility to maintain the online anonymity, especially in the face of the multiplication of resources internet monitoring.\n\nThe right to internet anonymity is also covered by European legislation that recognizes the fundamental right to data protection, freedom of expression, freedom of impression. The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights recognizes in Article. 8 (Title II: \u201cFreedoms\u201d) the right of everyone to protection of personal data concerning him.\n\nThe right to privacy is now essentially the individual\u2019s right to have and to maintain control over information about him.\n\nSailing in the dark\n\nAfter this necessary parenthesis on Tor network routing we are ready to enter the Deep Web simply using the Tor software from the official website of the project. Tor is able to work on all the existing platforms and many add-ons make simple they integration with existing applications, including web browsers. Despite the network has been projected to protect user\u2019s privacy, to be really anonymous it\u2019s suggested to go through a VPN.\n\nA better mode to navigate inside the deep web is to use the Tails OS distribution which is bootable from any machine don\u2019t leave a trace on the host. Once the Tor Bundle is installed it comes with its own portable Firefox version, ideal for anonymous navigation because an appropriate control of installed plugins, in the commercial version in fact common plugins could expose our identity.\n\nWell once inside the deep web we must understand that the navigation is quite different from ordinary web, every research is more complex due the absence of indexing of the content.\n\nA user that start its navigation in the Deep Web have to know that a common way to list the content is to adopt collection of wiki and BBS-like sites which have the main purpose to aggregate links categorizing them in more suitable groups of consulting. Another difference that user has to take in mind is that instead of classic extensions (e.g. .com, .gov) the domains in the Deep Web generally end with the .onion suffix. Following a short list of links that have made famous the Deep Web published on Pastebin\n\n\n\nCleaned Hidden Wiki should be a also a good starting point for the first navigations\n\nhttp://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\nBe careful, some content are labeled with common used tag such as CP= child porn, PD is pedophile, stay far from them.\n\nThe Deep Web is considered the place where everything is possible, you can find every kind of material and services for sale, most of them illegal. The hidden web offers to cybercrime great business opportunity, hacking services, malware, stolen credit cards, weapons.\n\nWe all know the potentiality of the e-commerce in ordinary web and its impressive growth in last couple of years, well now imagine the Deep Web market that is more than 500 times bigger and where there is no legal limits on the odds to sell. We are facing with amazing business controlled by cyber criminals organizations.\n\nThe dark business\n\nAs said the hidden web is considerable a wide marked covered by anonymity, a condition that make it attractive for the cybercrime industry that is moving its business in a region of cyber space where is really difficult to trace sellers and acquires, whatever goods they exchange.\n\nMajority of Deep Web know is just because they have read about the possibility to acquire weapons, malware and drugs in total security avoiding the control of law enforcement and far from any kind of limitations. In effect in several market place present in the dark web it is possible to acquire illegal odds and the press has made great advertising on this aspect, that is the type of news that people love to.\n\n\n\nOne of the most famous dark market is without doubt Silk Road web site, an online marketplace where the majority of products are derived from illegal activities. Of course it\u2019s not the only one, many other markets are managed to address specify products, believe me, many of them are terrifying.\n\nMost transactions on the Deep Web accept BitCoin currency for payments allowing the purchase of any kind of products preserving the anonymity of the transaction, encouraging the development of trade in respect to any kind of illegal activities. We are facing with an autonomous system that advantage the exercise of criminal activities while ensuring the anonymity of transactions and the inability to track down the criminals.\n\nRecently the Carnegie Mellon computer security professor Nicolas Christin published research on Silk Road and its business model, it seems that the market is able to realize $22 Million In Annual Sales only related to the drug market.  Total revenue made by the sellers has been estimated around USD 1.9 million per month, an incredible business also for the Silk Road operators that receive about USD 143,000 per month in commissions.\n\n\n\nThe experts have examined over 24,400 separate items sold on the popular site demonstrating that Silk Road is mainly used as drugs market, very interesting also the composition of the sellers that for obvious needs leaves within a couple of weeks the site to appear in second time.\n\nThe study has analyzed the evolution of the market in the last months demonstrating the increasing of the business may be obtained also thanks to the aura of mystery that many media give the Deep Web.\n\nThe number of sellers of any kind of drugs is passed from 300 in February to around 570 in August as reported in the following graph:\n\n\n\nWhich are the most sold products?\n\nThe study has grouped the product in categories and has revealed that the \u201cmost wanted\u201d items are drugs, following is proposed the list of the Top 20 categories in terms of items available.\n\nMost sellers leave the site fairly quickly, but a core of about 4% of them have been on the site for the entire duration of our study, the majority of sellers are only on the site for less than two months, may be because they leave the site once sold the products or because they move \u201cinto stealth mode as soon as they have established a large enough customer base\u201d.\n\nThe experts and law enforcement are conscious that are facing with an anomalous market where identities are hidden, payments difficult to trace, where no advertising is made and where the access to the \u201cmarket place\u201d implies anonymizing tool such as a Tor client. Despite all this consideration the study has revealed a string growth of the business, the market appears in expansion and number of sellers that use it is dramatically increased.\n\n\n\nChristin declared : \u201cIt\u2019s a stable marketplace, and overall it\u2019s growing steadily.\u201d\n\nBut many users on the site have worried for possible infiltration made by law enforcement, another source of concerns is that several of its high-profile sellers have disappeared. The possibility to infiltrate a similar market is concrete and market place such as Silk Road represents in my opinion a moderate risks for the worldwide community. The most problematic aspects of similar business is that they are controlled by criminal organization but the figure proposed are far from to justify a massive Government intervention,  the problem is how much hidden services like this are in the dark web?\n\nBut Deep Web is also famous because is the place where is relative simple to acquire malware and similar agents to realize cyber fraud, one of the most requested article are bot agents to be able to compose a botnet without particular knowledge.\n\nRecently I read of a botnet offering from the deep web describes many interesting technical characteristics. With just $8000 and three IP addresses it is possible to set up C&C, and get a personalized copy of the bot that has a hardcoded/obfuscated max of 10k zombies. I have no idea is the offer is real but is high probable that similar offers are daily available on deep web, we can imagine the impact on this wave of malware in the cyber space.\n\nWe have explained several time that a new model of business is growing around malware sells, old style criminals are investing in technology to expand their activities, they are requesting support and material to realize complex frauds, I introduced the term C2C (cybercrime to cybercrime) to describe the phenomenon of support provided by new cyber criminality  to ordinary crime.\n\nOne of the most famous malware sold in clear web which is \u201cmigrating\u201d to the deep web is the Citadel trojan, based on  the Zeus experience has evolved becoming one of the most interesting cyber criminal project. Security experts have found an excellent customer relationship management (CRM) model implemented by its creators. Thanks a malware evolution dictated by market needs, the trojan has evolved in time, many instances have been detected with different powerful features developed for specific clients.\n\nThe creators of the agent have structured an efficient service for the sale ( with sale price of nearly $2,500) and the supply of improvement services for the trojan through social network platforms.\n\nBut just one of the strengths of the model, the opportunity to get in touch with the  creators of the virus, paradoxically, could stop the spread of the dreaded malware.\n\nSo how to protect anonymity of the creators maintaining a malware as service selling model?\n\nDeep web gives a great opportunity, that\u2019s why Citadel\u2019s authors will probably migrate to the hidden web, trying to avoid the controls of law enforcement.\n\nThe need to restrict the audience of prospective customers could restrict the global business preserving its vitality. The anonymity is a need for cyber criminal, we have assisted to the proliferation of encrypted instant messaging communications and of VPN service providers, all to avoid to be spied on.\n\nCyber crime is characterized by a technical soul that is pushing the implementation of new hidden services deployed in the dark web, we are assisting to the consolidation of the black market, brokers can set up auctions to sell new malware and zero-day vulnerabilities ensuring the anonymity of the parties.\n\nDeep Web \u2026 a powerful analysis tool\n\nWe have seen that Deep Web thanks to anonymity and its dimensions represents a great opportunity for cyber criminal business it is also a powerful analysis tool.\n\nThe Tor Metrics Portal gives a set of useful the instruments to monitors the workload of the TOR networks, it proposes a complete collection of tools and documentation for statistical analysis regarding the activities of relays and bridges. These metrics could also be used for intelligence purpose, for example analyzing principal network metrics it is possible to investigate on the application of monitoring system inside a country for censorship purpose. Recently in many area of the planet similar systems have been used to suppress media protest and to persecute dissidents, avoiding the circulation of unconformable information outside the country. It is happened for example in Syria and in Iran, country where the control of the web is a major concern of the government. These situations are expression of a political sufferance of a country and could give a further element of evaluation to the analysts.\n\nAnalyzing the number of access to the Tor Network over the time it has been possible for example to discover how The Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation, unique telecommunication service provider of the country, has deployed for testing purpose a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of all Internet traffic.\n\nUsing the metrics it was possible to identify the introduction of the filtering system as displayed in the following graphs.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s simple to note that in the last week of May the Tor Network was not accessible from the country even with trying to use bridged access, evidence of the presence of filtering system for Deep Packet Inspection.\n\nDeep Web is not the hell\n\nAfter this overview I desire to explain to the readers that despite the Deep Web provide an environment to protect their privacy there are several conditions and different type of attacks that could expose user\u2019s identity. Governments are increasing their capability to monitor the hidden network, mainly trying to infiltrating them with spying services. In more than one occasion we have read of several U.S. cyber units totally dedicated to the monitoring if the Deep Web.\n\nWe have said that Deep Web is a creature desired by governments to allow to operate in totally anonymity, of course this aspect has been also exploited by cyber criminals, hacktivists and normal people who desire to defend their privacy, for this reason, institutions and agencies of every countries have promoted project to develop new monitoring systems and at same time they have started a misinformation campaign against the this parallel and hidden world.\n\nThe governments want you stay far from hidden web, because they cannot spy on you, the crime is present in deep web as in the clear web of course the anonymity granted by deep web could encourage and facilitate criminal activities but at same time it represent an obstacle to the criminal that for example desire to steal sensible information of the users or spy on them.\n\nMeanwhile on the clear web we are able to find many reports produced by security firms on cyber criminal activities and related earnings, we know relatively little about the profits related to the Deep Web that is characterized by a size and a criminal turnover dramatically greater than the one in the dark web.\n\nIn the meantime \u2026 don\u2019t believe to those that say you that Deep Web is the reign of the evil, because they are trying simply to defend their secrets keeping you away from that place.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author : Pierluigi Paganini, Security Specialist\n\nCEH \u2013 Certified Ethical Hacker, EC Council\n\nSecurity Affairs ( http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress  )\n\nEmail : pierluigi.paganini@securityaffairs.co\n\n \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Deep Web) \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/search-engines", "topic_name": "search engines"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/silk-road", "topic_name": "Silk Road"}]}, {"news_name": "Citadel trojan, migration of cybercrime to the deep web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7005/cyber-crime/citadel-trojan-migration-of-cybercrime-to-the-deep-web.html", "title": "Citadel trojan, migration of cybercrime to the deep web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 4, 2012", "body": "We all remember the Citadel trojan, based on  the Zeus experience has evolved becoming one of the most interesting cyber criminal project.

Thanks a malware evolution dictated by market needs, the trojan has evolved in time, many instances have been detected with different powerful features developed for specific clients.\n\nThe creators of the agent have structured an efficient services for the sell ( with sales price of nearly $2,500) and the supply of improvement services for the trojan through social network platforms.\n\nBut just one of the strengths of the model, the opportunity to get in touch with the  creators of the virus, paradoxically, could stop the spread of the dreaded malware.\n\nSo how to protect anonymity of the creators maintaining a malware as service selling model?\n\nDeep web gives a great opportunity, that\u2019s why Citadel\u2019s authors will probably migrate to the hidden web, trying to avoid the controls of law enforcement.\n\nThe need to restrict the audience of prospective customers could restrict the global business preserving its vitality. Another threat to the Citadel\u2019s model is represented by the researchers that could infiltrate the customers networks to reverse engine the instances of malware to neutralize them.\n\nRecently the security blog S21Sec discovered a new version of Citadel developed to avoid detection and analysis usually done using sandboxes.\n\nVery interesting the discovery of a specific anti-emulator, which allows to protect botnet from reversing engineering  and being tracked. Once started the component is able to detect if the malware is running in a virtual environment (e.g. VMware, Virtualbox) and in that case to implement hiding techniques to avoid the detecting of the trojan.\n\nThe anonymity is the need for cyber criminal, we have assisted to the proliferation of encrypted instant messaging communications and of VPN service providers, all to avoid to be spied on.\n\nCyber crime is characterized by a technical soul that is pushing the implementation of new hidden services deployed in the dark web.\n\nNew specific figures are emerging, cyber experts that are able to setup  efficient market services far from the eyes of law enforcement.\n\nWe are assisting to the consolidation of the black market, brokers can set up auctions to sell new malware and zero-day vulnerabilities ensuring the anonymity of the parties.\n\nWe are assisting to a massive movement of the malware market from the clear web to the deep web, specific services are multiplying in network such as Freenet and Tor.\n\nFollowing cyber criminals in deep web is much harder, tracking activities are essentially possible due the infiltration of agents, but it\u2019s not so simple. These new dark communities they are increasingly becoming closed, they are elusive and difficult to locate.\n\nIt the deep web is quite simple to find any kind of services that sells every type of odds such as drugs, weapons, credit cards and so on, a market without rules, with a unique imperative \u2026. make money.\n\n\n\nLiving in the deep web with conviction that it can offer a kind of immunity to crime is deeply wrong, technological methods and infiltration make in the time are the winning. Consider that for example law enforcement all over the world maintains a set of fake identities during the years to infiltrate forums, they work in active way proposing solutions or making trade of fraudulent goods.\n\nOne of the phenomena that more is benefiting for the movement of the cg of illegal market from clear web to deep web has been identifies has cybercrime-as-a-service, a new model of Cybercrime to cybercrime (C2C) where ordinary crime meet sthe offer of cyber criminal to prepare cyber attacks or cyber frauds without having technical knowledge.\n\nCyber criminal organizations operate as enterprise, last week we have read about the Capfire4 service that proposes tools for the organization of cyber attacks such as spam of malware, malware hosting, and a to build up a complete command and control infrastructure (C&C) for the arrangement of botnets.\n\nSimilar service is really efficient but to noisy, law enforcement and also security press have immediately localized it, due this reason the crime is emigrating in that part of web not indexable by common search engines.\n\nWhat to expect from the future?\n\nFrom technological point of view, the use of the deep web is the best choice, the right balance between openness of the business and anonymity.\n\nThe crime industries evolved, following the technological solutions proposed by IT leading enterprises, and at least in the computer industry, it has set up a proven and extremely efficient model of sales and CRM.\n\nThe persecution of this type of crime is complex for a multitude of factors, both on the legislative and technological perspective.\n\nSurely there is much to do today in an attempt to infiltrate these emerging organizations, often lack a consolidated background also due young age of gang members and therefore vulnerable to external influences.\n\nAnother critical aspect in the tracking of these activities is related to the circulation of money and problems relating to payments, we discussed about bitcoin and services for the anonymity of the transfers, though to date precisely this phase is the most critical for those who want to make criminal profits without being traced.\nThe only certainty is the need to define a suitable model for investigations in an area that is explored relatively recently.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013 (malware, Citadel)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/c2c", "topic_name": "C2C"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/citadel-trojan", "topic_name": "Citadel trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-as-service", "topic_name": "malware as service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "zero-day vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zeus", "topic_name": "Zeus"}]}]}]
