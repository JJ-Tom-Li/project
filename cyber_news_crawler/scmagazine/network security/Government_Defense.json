Vice President of Policy and Communications Elliot Schrage said about 10 million people in the United States saw at least one of the ads with 44 percent of the ads being served before the November 8, 2016 election and the remainder afterward. Some of the ads were not seen at all as the algorithm's designed to match the ad to the right person simply did not find a proper audience.

Smith also claimed to have no knowledge of the total extent of the problem until July 31 when the issue was brought to him by his cybersecurity team.\n\nIn Smith's prepared remarks he said U.S. CERT notified Equifax of the problem on March 8 and the following day the news was given to the security team. As per company policy these workers had 48 hours to search for and then patch any problems.\n\n\u201cApache Struts within Equifax was not identified or patched in response to the internal March 9 notification to information technology personnel,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAdditional scans were run on March 15 again searching for the Apache Struts vulnerability, but came up empty.\n\n\u201cEquifax's efforts undertaken in March 2017 did not identify any versions of Apache Struts that were subject to this vulnerability, and the vulnerability remained in an Equifax web application much longer than it should have,\u201d he said.\n\nPravin Kothari, Founder and\u00a0CEO of\u00a0CipherCloud, called the CERT notification something that should have triggered an all hands on deck response, but he believes the company's focus was elsewhere and not on cybersecurity.\n\n\"A good security process would have identified vulnerable systems\u00a0within 24 hours\u00a0and patch must have been applied. But the Equifax process was \u201cweak and broken\u201d because it failed to identify the vulnerable systems. This process is supposed to run every day; not only did they not identify the vulnerability immediately, it went unidentified until they found the breach. It was too late,\" he told SC Media.\n\nIn a bipartisan reaction none of the committee members were satisfied with Smith's comments and raked him over the coals with Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., saying it would be hard to pass legislation that would prevent this from happening in the future.\n\n\u201cI don't think we can pass a law that, excuse me for saying this, fixes stupid,\" said Walden.\n\nIt also came out in Smith's testimony that if the Equifax information security team had found the vulnerability in March the entire incident could have been avoided. The recently completed forensic investigation revealed that the hackers did not access any sensitive information until May 13 and that between that date and July 30 the hackers continued to have access to the system exploiting the Apache Struts vulnerability all while Equifax remained in the dark.\n\nThe first clue that something was amiss, Smith said, took place on July 29 when the IT staffers noted suspicious activity in the Consumer Dispute Portal. That day the illegal traffic was blocked, but it was again spotted on July 30 when the application was taken offline.\n\nSmith said he was first informed of the problem on July 31 by Equifax's, now former, CIO David Webb, but he claimed at that time he was unaware \u201cthat personal identifying information had been stolen, or have any indication of the scope of this attack.\u201d\n\nOn August 2 Equifax retained the cybersecurity group at the law firm of King & Spalding to handle the investigation and provide legal advice and the company contacted the FBI. By August 11 it was known that the hackers may have accessed a data table containing\u00a0 customer personal information, and then revealed on August 15 that the information was not only accessed but stolen.\n\n\u201cOn August 17, I held a senior leadership team meeting to receive the detailed briefing on the investigation. At that point, the forensic investigation had determined that there were large volumes of consumer data that had been compromised. Learning this information was deeply concerning to me, although the team needed to continue their analysis to understand the scope and specific consumers potentially affected,\u201d Smith testified.\n\nThe first member of the company's board of directors was not notified until August 22 and the full board not for another two days. The board met for the first time to discuss the matter on September 1. \n\nRep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., asked Smith why he took so long to loop in the board. Smith replied that the situation was fluid and he wanted it to settle down first.\n\nOne of the reasons Smith cited for holding off on going public was the fear that once the news broke it would open the company to further cyber intrusions and the need to further harden their systems.\n\nThe news was released on September 7.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI does not have to reveal San Bernardino shooter iPhone hacking vendor", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/fbi-does-not-have-to-reveal-san-bernardino-shooter-iphone-hacking-vendor/article/697340/", "title": "FBI does not have to reveal San Bernardino shooter iPhone hacking vendor", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 02, 2017", "body": "A federal judge has ruled that the Federal Bureau of Investigation does not have to reveal the vendor it hired nor the price paid to access data on the iPhone 5C used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Malik and his wife Tashfeen.\n\nThe Associated Press, USA Today and Vice Media in September 2016 filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit\u00a0 to press the FBI to reveal the third-party vendorit contracted with that was able to access the iPhone.

Among devices that have been decertified are the AccuVote TSX and AccuVote TSR6 from Premier/Diebold, the Edge and AVC Advantage from Sequoia Voting Systems, the eSlate\u00a0from Hart Intercivic, the iVotronic\u00a0from Election Systems and Software, and the Patriot from UniLect. Another DRE device, the WINVote, was banned by Virginia in 2015.\n\nThe Edge, TSX and ES7S iVotronic\u00a0were among the machines featured at DEF CON's Voting Machine Hacking Village. Cortes partially attributed his decertification recommendation to reports of DEF CON hackers gaining access to DRE devices, as well as revealing their passwords. Citing VITA's findings, Cortes also cautioned that DRE devices in Virginia lack a voter-verifiable paper audit trail that can help election officials confirm vote counts or uncover possible errors or tampering.\n\n\"Each device analyzed exhibited material risks to the integrity or availability of the election process,\" the VITA report states, according to the Cortes recommendation. Moreover, \"In each of the systems, the potential for loss of vote is significant, as none of the machines appear to produce paper audit trails during the voting process.\"\n\nOn Nov. 7, 2017, Virginians will be electing their new governor, choosing primarily between\u00a0Republican\u00a0Ed Gillespie and Democrat\u00a0Ralph Northam. It will be the first Election Day following\u00a0widespread reports of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign -- making this an important test for state election systems leading up to the 2018 House and Senate elections.\n\nThe Cortes recommendation letter states that while 22 Virginian localities currently use DRE devices in their elections, nine of them have either already contracted with companies to obtain new equipment by the upcoming election, or have pending procurements. Still, that leaves 13 additional affected areas, which comprise 140 of Virginia's 2,439 voting precincts and about 3.77 percent of the state's approximately 5 million active voters.\n\nVirginian localities were already under orders to replace their DRE devices by 2020. In letters sent prior to the election board's official resolution,\u00a0some localities urged the board not to decertify the machines, expressing concerns over the accelerated timetable.\n\nFor instance, one day prior to the election board's resolution, the Office of the County Attorney of Culpepper County, Va. stated in a letter that purchasing approved replacement equipment would cost approximately $250,000, creating budgetary difficulties. \"Premature decertification merely days before an election period...imposes a substantial burden and is fiscally unfair to the county and its residents,\" the letter states.\n\nAnother letter from the Virginia Association of Counties stated that \"obtaining the machines in time to train staff and election officers in advance of the absentee voting period could be challenging.\"\n\nHowever, Cortes pointed out in his recommendation that localities actually had less time to replace their machines in 2015 when election officials decertified the WINVote devices. He also noted that Virginia's General Assembly had previously voted down a December 2014 proposal from current governor\u00a0Terry McAuliffe to\u00a0add $28 million to the state budget for the purpose of purchasing new voting equipment for all localities.\n\nOther organizations praised the Department of Election's recommendation and encouraged the board to decertify the machines. \"There have [been] countless studies and security reviews over the years which have found the DREs in use in Virginia to have multiple insecurities making them vulnerable to manipulation and tampering,\" wrote\u00a0Barbara Simons, president of Verified Voting,\u00a0and Alex Blakemore, co-founder of Virginia Verified Voting, in a letter. \"The universally accepted evidence that DREs are insecure and untrustworthy drove the legislature to pass a measure to eliminate them by 2020. But there is an imminent threat to the security of our elections that must be faced now.\"\n\nWhether other states take similar measures remains to be seen.\n\n\"While Virginia is at a point where we feel it's necessary to have new equipment in place to reduce potential risks in our elections, each state has to make those decisions based on their individual circumstances,\" Cortes stated in his recommendation.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}]}, {"news_name": "Severe flaws in voting software threaten integrity of German elections, hacking collective reports", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/severe-flaws-in-voting-software-threaten-integrity-of-german-elections-hacking-collective-reports/article/687625/", "title": "Severe flaws in voting software threaten integrity of German elections, hacking collective reports", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "September 08, 2017", "body": "A European hacker association on Thursday warned that software being used to tabulate and transmit vote totals in Germany's upcoming parliamentary elections contains major vulnerabilities that could threaten the integrity of the outcome and undermine voter confidence.\n\nThe Germany-based Chaos Computer Club is claiming in an organizational blog post\u00a0and technical report that the software, PC-Wahl version 10, is susceptible to various external attacks, including those that could secretly modify vote totals before they are reported to electoral officials.

This key clause is a blatant rebuke of President Donald Trump, who fleetingly announced a U.S.-Russian cyber unit in July before backing off the idea amidst backlash.\n\nUnder the terms of the bill, which is sponsored by Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), any report submitted by the DNI would need to explain the purpose of forming such a joint cyber unit, specify what cyber intelligence would be shared, communicate the value of such an alliance to national security, express any counterintelligence concerns arising from such an arrangement, and recommend steps to mitigate these concerns.\n\nThe proposed act also directs key executive branch officials to submit a series of reports, assessments and recommendations regarding election security in the recent past, present and future.\n\nSpecifically, the bill states that within 90 days of the legislation's passage, the DNI must coordinate with other relevant officials and agencies to develop \"a whole-of-government strategy for countering the threat of Russian cyberattacks and attempted cyberattacks against electoral systems and processes in the United States, including federal, state, and local election systems, voter registration databases, voting tabulation equipment, and equipment and processes for the secure transmission of election results.\"\n\nThis comprehensive strategic plan would include suggested measures for securing voting machines and related electoral technologies, detecting threats, improving attack attribution, deterring future threats, and communicating with state and local election officials.\n\nThe DNI (who is currently Dan Coats) would also be tasked with conducting a postmortem assessment of the U.S. intelligence community's ability to adequately analyze Russia's interference in the 2016 elections, including whether intel resources were properly aligned to detect and respond to the threat, and the effectiveness of information sharing efforts. This report would be due one year after the bill's passage.\n\nStarting one year before any regularly scheduled federal election, the DNI, along with other key intelligence community members, would be required to evaluate the vulnerabilities of state election systems and send\u00a0Congressional leaders the results of this assessment within 180 days of the official vote.\n\nWithin 60 days of the bill's enactment, the\u00a0Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis would be expected to submit to Congress a report describing cyberattacks attempted or perpetrated by any foreign government on the 2016 elections, as well as any anticipated future attacks. Separately, this same official would be required to submit within 180 days\u00a0a plan for implementing bug bounty programs at various U.S. agencies and departments, much like the Department of Defense recently did.\n\nFinally, the DNI, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security and directors of the CIA, NSA and FBI, would be asked to submit a report on any foreign government's attempts to conduct surveillance on Americans by exploiting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in U.S. telecommunications networks, including SS7.\n\n\"...We continue the Committee's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\" said Sen. Burr in an official press release. \"The overwhelming bipartisan support for this bill shows that we all understand the gravity of the threats and how vital our intelligence community is to combating them.\u00a0 We are holding the intelligence community to account for every dollar they spend, and we are committed to giving them the resources they need to continue to be the best in the world.\"\n\n\"This Intelligence Authorization Act will provide the women and men of the Intelligence Community with the resources they need to do their jobs, which is to collect and analyze intelligence and present their best assessment to the nation's leadership,\" said Sen.

political turmoil and deadly protests by citizens seeking to oust Maduro after he created a new legislative body that further strengthens his governmental control.\u00a0Two attackers were reportedly killed in the operation, and several more were captured.\n\nThe defacement message posted on the main governmental website warned that \"This dictatorship has its days numbered,\"\u00a0the BBC\u00a0reported, while the defacement of the NEC website\u00a0included a video clip from the Charlie Chapin film, \"The Great Dictator,\" Reuters noted in its report.\n\nIn late July, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling him\u00a0a dictator.\n\nThe Reuters report also included an account from a representative of the Binary Guardians, who said he did not take part in Operation

Likewise, some members of the DOD were uncomfortable with the lack of control they experienced while outside researchers combed through their code.\n\n\"Some of us on the government side have been skeptical of our engagements with you; some of you have been skeptical with you engagements with us.

He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion.....\n\nThey also made their way through a salad of topics currently facing the world, including the current situation in Syria and the threats to nearby Jordan. \n\nStill, Tillerson mentioned that neither wanted to remain stuck in the mire that surrounded Donald Trump's unforeseen rise to power, nor the incriminating evidence that suggest Russia interfered in the democratic process of one of the world's most powerful democracies. \u00a0Which is why, he told press, \u201cwe've agreed to continue engagement and discussion around how do we secure a commitment that the Russian government has no intention of and will not interfere in our affairs in the future.\u201d\n\nOn the back of that, Trump and Putin have apparently begun exploring a joint framework, around which international state cyber-operations could be defended against and its perpetrators held accountable. \n\nIt was agreed that a \u201cworking-level group\u201d would be set up to explore the matter. \u00a0Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, later corroborated that in his own report to press. \n\nTrump personally expanded upon the idea a short while later, through a portal directly into his mind.\n\nPutin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..\n\nEwan Lawson, senior fellow for military influence at the Royal United Services Institute is sceptical.

Rogers \u00a0the day after a second major ransomware attack was launched that utilized the NSA tools, which were released publicly by the hacktivist group the Shadow\u00a0 Brokers.\n\n\u201cMy first and urgent request is that if the NSA knows how to stop this global malware attack, or has information that can help stop the attack, then NSA should immediately disclose it.\u00a0 If the NSA has a kill switch for this new malware attack, the NSA should deploy it now,\u201d Lieu wrote.\n\nHe also requested that the NSA tell companies like Microsoft when they spot a major vulnerability in one of their products.\n\nWhile WannaCry specifically leveraged the exploit known as EternalBlue, Petya (or NotPetya) takes advantage of both EternalBlue and EternalRomance, a separate remote code execution Windows exploit.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Don't repeal net neutrality, ISPs tell FCC", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/dont-repeal-net-neutrality-isps-tell-fcc/article/671741/", "title": "Don't repeal net neutrality, ISPs tell FCC", "author": "Greg Masters", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/greg-masters/author/3591/", "date": "June 28, 2017", "body": "The battle over control of the internet pathways \u2013 and who has rights to customer data \u2013 rages on.\n\nYesterday, a letter signed by more than 40 internet service providers (ISPs) was delivered to Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In contrast to the argument the FCC chairman has been making \u2013 namely that open internet rules harm ISPs \u2013 the message expressed support for the Open Internet Order and its underlying legal foundation under Title II of the Communications Act.\n\nIn the letter, the ISPs also assert they \"have long supported network neutrality as a core principle for the deployment of networks for the American public to access the internet.\"\n\nThe conflict stems from a Congressional ruling last March that repealed broadband policy rules, according to a post on the blog of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), written by Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the\u00a0nonprofit whose stated purpose is to defend civil liberties in the digital world. At that moment, the classification of broadband services shifted to \"common carrier service,\" regulated by Title II of the Communications Act, rather than an \"information service,\" regulated by Title I of the same Act.\n\nA furor arose from those opposing the change, who argued that small players were being put at an unfair advantage from the bigger players, like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon. Reversing the 2015 decision \u2013 reclassifying broadband as a \"common carrier\" service \u2013 eliminates protections provided by Title II, the message to the FCC chairman stated.\n\n\"If [Chairman Pai] succeeds, not only are\u00a0Section 201\u00a0and\u00a0Section 202\u00a0\u2013 the core provisions that support network neutrality \u2013 on the chopping block, but also a whole host of other active provisions that protect competition in the broadband market,\" Falcon wrote. \n\nAnother issue he pointed to is the fact that ISPs can't determine their legal obligations with consumer data. While he surmises that the larger players plied Congress with millions of dollars in order to win access to the vast trove of customer data the providers retain in their databases, the smaller players are not interested in selling their customers' personal information to third parties for profit, at least not without their permission.\n\nIn fact, he wrote, almost all of these players\u00a0were vehemently opposed to Congress repealing the privacy rules. The plan by the FCC chairman would remove the Section 222 privacy obligations for all broadband companies. \"In essence, Chairman Pai's plan would be the nail in the coffin for broadband privacy that Congress started with its privacy repeal earlier this year,\" Falcon asserted.\n\n\"Network neutrality \u2013 the idea that ISPs should treat all data that travels over their networks fairly, without improper discrimination in favor of particular apps, sites or services \u2013 is a principle that must be upheld to protect the future of our open Internet,\" a spokesperson from the EFF said in a statement sent to SC Media on Wednesday. \"It's a principle that's faced many threats over the years, such as ISPs forging packets to tamper with certain kinds of traffic or slowing down or even outright blocking protocols or applications.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "Senators grill intel community on 702 incidental collection", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/senators-grill-intel-community-on-702-incidental-collection/article/671938/", "title": "Senators grill intel community on 702 incidental collection", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "June 28, 2017", "body": "Even under sometimes intense grilling by the Senate Judiciary Committee, members of the intelligence community (IC) Tuesday continued to advocate for reauthorization of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, but widely refused to yield any details on to what extent that surveillance authority scoops up data on Americans. \n\nCommittee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, repeatedly asked representatives from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and the National Security Agency (NSA) to answer senators' questions regarding the number of Americans incidentally caught up in IC surveillance.\n\n\u201c\u2026what about the privacy of those not in this room?\u201d Sen.

Commons has confirmed in a statement that it has logged \u201cunauthorised attempts\u201d to access the accounts of 9,000 Members of Parliament, peers and parliamentary staff on the parliamentary network.\n\nParliament's email system and remote access tools were switched off during the weekend as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe incident follows on from Friday's report in The Times that a list containing login details of MPs, peers and parliamentary staff was being offered for sale on Russian-speaking websites.\n\nA Parliament press statement said, \u201cWe have systems in place to protect member and staff accounts and are taking the necessary steps to protect our systems.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS) has been criticized by cybersecurity experts for failing to provide other means of protection for email accounts.\n\nA Parliamentary spokesman told the BBC, \u201cThe parliamentary network was compromised due to weak passwords which did not conform to guidance from the Parliamentary Digital Service.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman added: \"As they are identified, the individuals whose accounts have been compromised have been contacted and investigations to determine whether any data has been lost are under way.\"\n\nParliament said that \u201csignificantly fewer than 1 percent of the 9,000 accounts on the parliamentary network have been compromised.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nSpencer Young, RVP of EMEA at Imperva, said that while exactly what the attackers were after is not known, the general thought is email login credentials have been compromised.\n\n\"Passwords continue to be an Achilles Heel in the fight against cybercrime as improper user behavior \u2013 such as weak passwords or use of the same password across different sites continues.\u00a0This is an outcome of a continual lack of understanding and investment from the Government in security strategies that enterprise Britain adopt as standard operating procedures. This attack was unfortunately just a matter of time,\" he said.\n\nThe Guardian's \u201csecurity source\u201d has already attributed the attack to Russia. No further explanation had been given as to how it had reached this conclusion apart from the fact that the credentials were being offered for sale on Russian-speaking forums.\n\nParliament described the incident as \u201congoing\u201d and said it is working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to identify the culprits.\n\nParliament says the NCSC is working to \u201cto identify the method of the attack and have made changes to prevent the attackers gaining access\u201d.\n\nSC has contacted the NCSC for comment.\n\nNeil Larkins, co-founder and COO of Egress Software Technologies said in a statement: \u201cThere are technical measures that could have been put in place to stop this attack. For example, access can be restricted to known IP addresses, which would mean that anyone on an unknown external device trying to get access \u2013 even with the correct password \u2013 would be denied in the first instance.\u201d\n\nHowever, the reason why cybercriminals assaulted the MP's email system, instead of another area of the government's network, is totally logical\u00a0Adam Laub, senior VP of product marketing at STEALTHbits Technologies, told SC Media.\u00a0\n\n\"cWhile the body content of an email and the conversations themselves have their own distinct value, email quietly maintains a high ranking position as one of the largest file repositories within any organization.\u00a0 The amount of files contained within email inboxes is staggering.\u00a0 It's also a given that a substantial portion of those files will contain sensitive information that could be just as (if not more) damning as the off-color comment that accompanied it in its initial delivery,\" he said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacking/topic/47220/", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}]}]
