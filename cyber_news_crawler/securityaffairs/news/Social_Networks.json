Facebook was collecting such kind of data, this is not a surprise for tech-savvy people because we have discussed it in the past.\n\nIn January, the popular Italian expert Simone Margaritelli wrote a blog post (Italian) on Medium inviting users to uninstall  Facebook and Whatsapp.\n\nThe programmer Dylan McKay was able to find data, including logs of calls and SMS messages, in an archive he downloaded (as a ZIP file) from Facebook.\n\nMat Johnson, a Professor at the University of Houston Creative Writing Program, also made the same disturbing discovery.\n\nOh wow my deleted Facebook Zip file contains info on every single phone cellphone call and text I made for about a year- cool totally not creepy.\n\n\u2014 Mat Johnson (@mat_johnson) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica case has is giving users another point of view regarding the collection of such kind of data made by Facebook and the real way they are using for.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson explained that the platform collects this data to improve the users\u2019 experience.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis [above] screen in the Messenger application offers to conveniently track all your calls and messages. But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.\u201d wrote Sean Gallagher, Ars Technica\u2019s IT and National Security Editor.\n\n\u201cFacebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \u201chelp friends find each other\u201d after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \u201copt-in\u201d for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \u201cOK\u201d button to approve \u201ckeeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\u201d\u201d\n\nFacebook denied to collect call data surreptitiously with an official blog post, the social network giant highlighted that it never commercialized the data and that users are in total control of the data uploaded to the platform.\n\n\u201cWhen you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history.\u201d reads the blog post published by Facebook. \u201cFor Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose \u2018learn more\u2019 or \u2018not now\u2019. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or \u2018skip\u2019. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.\u201d\n\nUsers can check data collected by Facebook going to your Facebook Settings\u2192Download a copy of your Facebook data\u2192Start My Archive.\n\n\n\n\u201cCall and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.\u201d continues Facebook.\n\nIf you want to stop Facebook from continuously upload your contacts to its server, you can turn off the uploading feature in the Messenger app. In this way, all previously uploaded contacts will be deleted.\n\niOS users are not affected by this issue.\n\nLesson leaned \u2026 every time we use an app it is essential to carefully read the documentation that details its work.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Facebook, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/big-data", "topic_name": "Big Data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cambridge-analytica", "topic_name": "Cambridge Analytica"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}]}, {"news_name": "Zuckerberg on Cambridge Analytica case: we made mistakes", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70542/social-networks/zuckerberg-comments-cambridge-analytica.html", "title": "Zuckerberg on Cambridge Analytica case: we made mistakes\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 22, 2018", "body": "Finally, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday commented the Cambridge Analytica case, he admitted that his company has failed in protecting its users, but he pointed out that the company has already adopted necessary measures to prevent future abuses.\n\n\u201cwe made mistakes\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can\u2019t then we don\u2019t deserve to serve you,\u201d reads a statement published by Zuckerberg on Facebook. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.

This can be done using both the native Windows Oculus application and using browsers.\u201d wrote Franjkovi\u0107. \u201cI took a deeper look at the native Windows flow, and found a CSRF vulnerability which allowed me to connect a victim\u2019s Facebook account to attacker\u2019s Oculus account. Once connected, the attacker could extract the victim\u2019s access token, and use Facebook\u2019s GraphQL queries to take over the account.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the features implemented by the Oculus application is the authentication to a Facebook account, Franjkovic discovered that attackers could have exploited specially crafted GraphQL queries to connect any user\u2019s Facebook account to their Oculus account.\n\nGraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client\u2010server applications, a GraphQL query is a string that is sent to a server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client.\n\nFranjkovic discovered that a specially crafted query allowed an attacker to obtain the victim\u2019s access token and use it to impersonate the victim by accessing his account.\n\nIn a proof of concept attack, Franjkovic shows how to use a specially crafted query to add a new mobile phone number to the targeted account and use it to reset the victim\u2019s password.\n\nThe vulnerability was reported to Facebook on October 24, the social network giant temporary solved the issue by disabling the facebook_login_sso endpoint.\n\nOn October 30, Facebook rolled out a patch to address definitively the problem, but a few weeks later, the expert discovered a login cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw that could have been exploited to bypass Facebook\u2019s patch.\n\nThe experts informed Facebook on November 18 that disabled again the facebook_login_sso endpoint to mitigate the problem.

No matter.\n\nIn the past months, security experts have collected evidence that links the Russian Government to massive propaganda operations through social networks aimed to influence the sentiment of Americans on the 2016 Presidential elections.\n\nI was analyzing requests for the submissions of White Papers for INSCOM (U.S. Army Intelligence & Security Command) Technology when I noticed a number of very interesting requests for a \u201cContent Translation of PAI,\u201d \u201cAutomated Sentiment Analysis (SA),\u201d and \u201cContent Generation Based off of PAI\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s give a look at the requirements for each requets:\n\n0001: Content Translation of PAI\n\nA. Capability to translate foreign language content (message text, voice, images, etc.) from the social media environment into English. Required languages are Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean.\n\nB. Identify specific audiences through reading and understanding of colloquial phrasing, spelling variations, social media brevity codes, and emojis.\n\n1. Automated capability for machine learning of foreign language content with accuracy comparable to Google and Microsoft Bing Translate. Must be able to incrementally improve over time.\n\n2. Recognize language dialect to ensure effectual communication.\n\n0002: Automated Sentiment Analysis (SA)\n\nA. Capability to derive sentiment from all social media content.\n\n1. At minimum, distinguish negative, neutral, and positive sentiment based on collective, contextual understanding of the specific audience.\n\na) Capability to determine anger, pleasure, sadness, and excitement.\n\n2. Capability to recognize local colloquial and/or slang terms and phrases, spelling variations, social media brevity codes, capitalization, and emojis will be included.\n\n3. Automated machine learning of SA must be able to incrementally improve over time.\n\na) Software should allow for heuristic updates to improve overall capability; e.g., manually suggest updates based on personal knowledge and experience.\n\nB. Capability to suggest whether specific audiences could be influenced based on derived sentiment.\n\n0003: Content Generation Based off of PAI\n\nA. Capability to translate English into Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean.\n\nB. Automated capability to generate/create at least three, and up to 10, unique statements derived from one (1) original social media statement, while retaining the meaning and tone of the original.\n\n1. Customize language in a dialect consistent with a specific audience including spelling variations, cultural variations, colloquial phrasing, and social media brevity codes and emojis.\n\n\n\nWell, considering that the INSCOM executes mission command of operational intelligence and security forces, this software could be used for both monitoring social media (with a specific focus on Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean contents).\n\nThe requirements specifically address the need to create a system to influence the public sentiment on specific topics (i.e. Capability to determine anger, pleasure, sadness, and excitement.)\n\nI have released this interview to explain my point of view on such kind of software:\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the need for such software?\n\nSuch kind of software could be used for social media monitoring. Not only, in this specific case, the project aims to build a machine learning system that is able to identify and influence the sentiment of a specific audience. No doubt, it is software that could be used in PSYchological OPerations (PSYOPs).\n\nWould such software be a threat, or would it be just for snooping?\n\nThis kind of software could be used also to influence the sentiment on specific topics. This software represents a serious threat to the privacy of citizens, but the most disconcerting aspect is that IA based system could be involved in operations to destabilize a political context. Social media are a powerful instrument to make propaganda and to promote mass demonstration, we have all in mind what has happened in the case of the Arab Spring.\n\nThe United States Army Intelligence and Security Command \u2013 collects intelligence for combat operations\u2026 so how would this new software be useful?\n\nIt is an essential software for any Army and Command and Intelligence agency involved in intelligence mission. These systems are essential to gather information from social media and represent a privileged tool for SOCMINT, Social media intelligence.\n\nSOCMINT could be used for several purposes, not only cyber-espionage but also for counterterrorism operations.\n\nClearly, the most disconcerting use is related to the influence of public sentiment on specific topics.\n\nThe U.S. has continually accused Russia of using bots and troll factories to influence U.S. social media\u2026 isn\u2019t this an attempt to do the same. What\u2019s your take on that?\n\nI believe that almost any government is involved in social media monitoring, many states use social media as a military weapon. The answer is that the risk is concrete, but at the moment we have no evidence of this. The software could be used also as a defense mechanism against PSYOPs conducted by foreign goverments through social media.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  US Army,  PSYOPS)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "A new Facebook security feature reveals fraudulent Facebook-like mails", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67271/social-networks/facebook-security-feature.html", "title": "A new Facebook security feature reveals fraudulent Facebook-like mails\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 31, 2017", "body": "Facebook has rolled out a new security feature to protect users from identity theft, the tech giant is taking note of every email it has \u201crecently\u201d sent to its users.\n\nThe full list of email sent by Facebook is available under the Settings menu on the social network platform.\n\nFacebook users that will receive a message allegedly sent by the social network giant can check its authenticity by viewing the new \u201cSee recent emails from Facebook\u201d section at the bottom of the Security and Login page.\n\n\n\nIf the message is not included in the list it is fraudulent and must be discarded.\n\n\u201cFacebookmail.com is a common domain that Facebook uses to send notifications when we detect an attempt to log in to your account or change a password.

Everytime users record a clip and send it to the recipient it is uploaded onto the Facebook\u2019s CDN server.\n\n\u201cWhenever you record an audio clip (video message) to send it to your friend, the clip gets uploaded onto the Facebook\u2019s CDN server (i.e., https://z-1-cdn.fbsbx.com/\u2026), from where it serves the same audio file, over HTTPS, to both the sender as well as the receiver.\u201d states THN.\n\nAn attacker that shares the same network segment could launch a MITM attack with SSL Strip. A hacker can extract absolute links, including secret authentication token embedded in the URL, to all audio files exchanged between the sender and receiver.\n\nThe attacker can modify the links from HTTPS to HTTP to download files without any authentication, this is possible because the Facebook CDN server does not force HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy making possible communications through HTTP connections.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of proper authentication, the expert highlighted that if a file has been shared between two Facebook users it should not be accessible by others, even if a third party has the absolute URL to the resource (which includes a secret token to access that file).\n\nMohamed A. Baset provided a proof-of-concept for the attack by sending an audio clip to one of his friends over Facebook Messenger, below the absolute link to the audio file extracted using MITM attack.\n\nhttp://z-1-cdn.fbsbx.com/v/t59.3654-21/16125468_1645374402144307_1665936690776113152_n.mp4/audioclip-1484602674000-3200.mp4?oh=71fe3abe6b663b1dea5a8028288b6118&oe=587EBD05&dl=1\n\nAnyone can download it from the Facebook platform even if he/she is not authenticated.\n\n\u201cGET requests are something that the browsers can remember it in its cache also in its history, Better to have this files played via POST requests with an anti-CSRF token implemented,\u201d Mohamed told The Hacker News.\n\nThe bad news is that Mohamed was not awarded for his discovery because Facebook doesn\u2019t want to pay for such kind of loopholes.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of rolling out HSTS across various facebook.com subdomains. The fact that we have not rolled it out on particular subdomains does not constitute a valid report under our program.\u201d is the reply provided by Facebook to the expert.\n\n\u201cIn general, sending in reports that claim we should be using defense-in-depth mechanisms like HSTS will not qualify under our program. We make very deliberate decisions about when we roll out (or not) particular protections and so reports suggesting that we make changes there generally do not qualify.\u201d\n\nFacebook still hasn\u2019t patched the flaw and I hope it will give a payoff to the Egyptian expert for his work. yet.\n\nBelow a video PoC of the attack.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Facebook Messenger, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chats", "topic_name": "Chats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook-messenger", "topic_name": "Facebook Messenger"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook hack allowed to disclose email address for each FB user", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54683/hacking/facebook-hack-email.html", "title": "Facebook hack allowed to disclose email address for each FB user\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 24, 2016", "body": "A smart Facebook hack allowed to retrieve the private email address of any user.

The SVG images include the definition of their behaviors in XML text files, this feature makes possible SVG image can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Despite SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, more often they are created directly with a software that elaborates the images.\n\nThe experts at AppRiver noticed that threat actors in the wild were exploiting a small JavaScript entry contained in the SVG files that allow them to redirect victims to a website used to serve the Cryptowall malware.\n\n\u201cThese SVG files however contained a small javascript entry that would open a webpage to download some malware.\u201d AppRiver researchers said in a blog post. \u201cThe IP link in question ends up forwarding to another domain where a zip is downloaded of the actual exe payload. It didn\u2019t auto execute, user interaction would still be needed for that. \u201c\n\nBack to the present, the new attack leverages a downloader called Nemucod that is spread via Facebook Messenger as a .svg file, as confirmed by Peter Kruse via Twitter.\n\nConfirmed! #Locky spreading on #Facebook through #Nemucod camouflaged as .svg file.

The technique allows bypassing any security measure implemented by the giant of the social networks.\n\nSS7 is a set of protocols used in telecommunications ever since the late 1970s, enabling smooth transportation of data without any breaches.\n\nThe security issue in the SS7 signalling system could be exploited by criminals, terrorists and intelligence agencies to spy on communications. The SS7 protocol allows cell phone carriers to collect location data related to the user\u2019s device from cell phone towers and share it with other carriers, this means that exploiting the SS7 a carrier is able to discover the position of its customer everywhere he is.\n\nThe team of researchers from Positive Technologies is the same that recently demonstrated how to hack WhatsApp and Telegram accounts by leveraging on the SS7 protocol.\n\nThe attack method devised by the experts from Positive Technologies works against any service that relies on SMS to verify the user accounts, including Gmail and Twitter.\n\n\n\nHacking Facebook accounts is a reality, the attacker first needs to follow the \u201cForgot account?\u201d procedure by clicking on a link present in the Facebook homepage.

In particular, Facebook explained that for devices running iOS, only the first message is displayed even if attackers send further messages with the same ID.\n\n\u201cOn most clients \u2014 including iOS \u2014 when duplicate messages are detected, the first message takes precedence and is displayed on both the sender\u2019s and receiver\u2019s device.

This phishing attack works even when the victim in not already logged in. The crooks create an app that serves the phishing page from an external website via an iframe.\n\n\u201cThis makes the page appear legitimate, even to many seasoned internet users; however, the verification form is actually served via an iframe from an external site hosted by HostGator. The external website also uses HTTPS to serve the fraudulent content, so no warnings are displayed by the browser.\u201d states the blog post published by Netcraft\n\nThe attackers used the HTTPS for the external web site to serve the malicious page, so no warnings are displayed to the victims by their browser.\n\n\n\nWhen victims visit the phishing page, the information they provide are sent back to the attacker\u2019s server.\n\nThe researchers at Netcraft noticed that crooks also used another trick to deceive victims; when the victims first submit the information on the phishing page, an error message is displayed to the user that warns of incorrect credentials.\n\n\u201cTo win over anyone who remains slightly suspicious, the phishing site always pretends that the first set of submitted credentials were incorrect. A suspicious user might deliberately submit an incorrect username and password in order to test whether the form is legitimate, and the following error message could make them believe that the credentials really are being checked by Facebook.\u201d continues Netcraft.\n\nOnce the victims enter the login credentials for the second time, the page displays a message inviting them to wait up to 24 hours for the approval of the submission, just the time to allow attackers to take over the account and use it for a number of fraudulent activities.\n\nAn excellent protection against these attacks is the two-step verification implemented by Facebook on its accounts. Facebook also implements a login alerts feature to notify users when their account has been accessed from an unknown device.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Facebook Phishing, hacking)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Facebook passes the 1 million Tor users Milestone", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/46621/social-networks/facebook-1m-tor-users.html", "title": "Facebook passes the 1 million Tor users Milestone\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 23, 2016", "body": "Facebook has announced Friday that it has passed 1 million Tor users.

This is according to a document The Intercept recently gained access to.\n\nOf particular significance, however, is the research being conducted in the area of social media data mining and surveillance. In-Q-Tel\u2019s portfolio includes an assortment of tech companies which aspire to delve further into this arena:\n\nThe CIA\u2019s investments reveal a pattern, which demonstrates the agency\u2019s elevated push towards monitoring social media platforms. At least part of the focus is on ISIS\u2019 extensive use of social media for spreading propaganda, recruiting and other activities.\n\nAs an indication of just how engaged the CIA is in this pursuit:\n\n\u201cThe latest round of In-Q-Tel investments comes as the CIA has revamped its outreach to Silicon Valley, establishing a new wing, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, which is tasked with developing and deploying cutting-edge solutions by directly engaging the private sector. The directorate is working closely with In-Q-Tel to integrate the latest technology into agency-wide intelligence capabilities.\u201d states The Intercept.\n\n\u201cOver the last decade, In-Q-Tel has made a number of public investments in companies that specialize in scanning large sets of online data. In 2009, the fund partnered with Visible Technologies, which specializes in reputation management over the internet by identifying the influence of \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 authors on a range of platforms for a given subject. And six years ago, In-Q-Tel formed partnerships with NetBase, another social media analysis firm that touts its ability to scan \u2018billions of sources in public and private online information,\u2019 and Recorded Future, a firm that monitors the web to predict events in the future.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, In-Q-Tel has established a unique technology laboratory known as Lab41. Based in Silicon Valley, it was designed to provide tools for the intelligence community to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d in large data sets.\n\nIt should be noted that this particular CIA-backed surveillance technology is also being used by domestic law enforcement agencies and the private sector in order to spy on individuals, such as activists.\n\nInterestingly, \u201cPalantir, one of In-Q-Tel\u2019s earliest investments in the social media analytics realm, was exposed in 2011 by the hacker group LulzSec to be in negotiation for a proposal to track labor union activists and other critics of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Washington. The company, now celebrated as a \u2018tech unicorn\u2019 \u2014 a term for start-ups that reach over $1 billion in valuation \u2014 distanced itself from the plan after it was exposed in a cache of leaked emails from the now-defunct firm HBGary Federal.\u201d\n\nSource: The Atlantic.com\n\nNews of continuing surveillance, involving the government, has always made a lot of people uneasy\u2013in particular, civil liberties advocates. Mass surveillance always brings into question Fourth Amendment constitutional issues. And, the CIA\u2019s investment endeavours, involving monitoring social media, are really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAs was recently reported in Security Affairs, the CIA has also waded into the health and beauty market with its funding of a new line of skincare products that would enable them to collect DNA. Clearista is a product line that markets itself as a \u201cformula so you can feel confident and beautiful in your skin\u2019s most natural state.\u201d But, the CIA is far less interested in how you look after using these products than in the ability of the Clearista product to remove a thin outer layer of skin that could allow investigators to obtain unique biomarkers that can be used for DNA collection.\n\nThe CIA is not alone in its quest to expand its surveillance capabilities. Police departments across the country have been using Beware, an application developed by Intrado, which crawls billions of records in public and commercial databases. It searches for criminal records, Internet chatter and other data. The Beware algorithms then calculate a threat rating score which is assigned to an individual and that information is sent to the requesting law-enforcement officer. It is not, however, foolproof and misinformation can be generated which could be used against an individual.\n\nThe FBI has also acquired specialized surveillance software, having purchased SocioSpyder, an application for extracting information from social media sites. According to the product\u2019s website, it \u201ccan be configured to collect posts, tweets, videos and chats on-demand or autonomously into a relational, searchable and graphable database.\u201d SocioSpyder was developed by Allied Associates International, a U.S.-based contractor which has government and military and private companies as clientele. SocioSpyder is essentially a pre-configured web scraper for social media.\n\nAnd, just in case the government misses something, in its far-reaching surveillance, an anti-encryption bill has been drafted in the Senate by Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, following the death of an anti-encryption bill in California\u2019s General Assembly last week. The bill, titled the Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016, would require tech firms to decrypt customers\u2019 data at a court\u2019s request.\n\nAdd to that, the ruling by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which recently ruled that warrantless collection of cellphone location data is constitutional.\n\nPrivacy advocates have expressed concern over these new developments involving the government, technology and civil liberties. In particular, apprehension has been expressed in regard to the automated judgments that software targeting social media uses. Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union commented that, \u201cwhen you have private companies deciding which algorithms get you a so-called threat score, or make you a person of interest, there\u2019s obviously room for targeting people based on viewpoints or even unlawfully targeting people based on race or religion.\u201d She also warned that a dangerous trend has begun with government relying on tech companies to \u201cbuild massive dossiers on people\u201d using \u201cnothing but constitutionally protected speech.\u201d\n\nWritten by: Sneacker \n\nAuthor Bio: Sneacker is a writer who works in the information technology field.

When a user forgets the password, Facebook allows him to get back into your FB account through the \u2018Forgot Password\u2019 procedure. Facebook sends a 6 digit code on a user\u2019s phone number or email address.

We are continuing to work together with Adobe to deliver a reliable and secure Flash experience for games on our platform, but have shipped the change for video to all browsers by default.\u201d States the announcement issued by Facebook.\n\n\u201cFrom development velocity to accessibility features, HTML5 offers a lot of benefits. Moving to HTML5 best enables us to continue to innovate quickly and at scale, given Facebook\u2019s large size and complex needs.\u201d\n\nWe are big supporters of the HTML5 since it eliminates the weakest link in the user environment and in terms of development, it makes the job easier for developers.\n\n\n\nFacebook explains the benefits of HTML5 that they will be using:\n\nDevelopment velocity\n\n\u201cUsing web technologies allows us to tap into the excellent tooling that exists in browsers, among the open source community, and at Facebook in general. Not having to recompile code and being able to apply changes directly in the browser allow us to move fast.\u201d\n\nTestability\n\n\u201cWe have an excellent testing infrastructure at Facebook. By moving to HTML5 video, we can avail ourselves of all the web tools in that infrastructure, like jest and WebDriver, at our disposal.\u201d\n\nAccessibility\n\n\u201cHTML5 made it possible for us to build a player that is fully accessible to screen readers and keyboard input. We can leverage the accessibility tools that HTML5 provides to make it easier for people with visual impairments to use our products. Making Facebook accessible to everyone is an important part of our mission to make the world more open and connected.\u201d\n\nWhen doing such a big move, there are challenges that needs to be overcome, and Facebook is no exception, and for that reason Facebook needed to:\n\nGetting logging right\n\n\u201cTo ensure logging correctness, we created a test suite that performs the same user-interaction scenarios against both video players and then validates that the logs are equivalent. This way we had high confidence in the data that our new HTML5 video player reports.\u201d\n\nBrowser bugs\n\n\u201cOne of the major issues we wanted to solve before shipping the HTML5 player was the number of bugs in various browsers around HTML5 videos. One specific bug in Chrome\u2019s implementation of the SPDY protocol caused the browser to simply stop loading and playing videos in News Feed. We determined that the issue was triggered by loading too many videos concurrently, so we reduced the number of videos we load at the same time and make sure we cancel loading videos as soon as they are no longer required.\u201d\n\nWorse performance in older browsers\n\n\u201cIn theory, most browsers in use support HTML5 video. However, in practice we noticed that a lot of the older browsers would simply perform worse using the HTML5 player than they had with the old Flash player. We saw more errors, longer loading times, and a generally worse experience. We decided to initially launch the HTML5 player to only a small set of browsers, and continuously roll out to more browsers, versions, and operating systems as we improved it and fixed small bugs. That\u2019s why we waited until recently to ship the HTML5 player to all browsers by default, with the exception of a small set of them.\u201d\n\nPage load time regression\n\n\u201cThe last major issue we faced while launching the HTML5 player was a regression in the time it takes to load Facebook. At Facebook, we care about the experience we provide to people. How long Facebook takes to load is a contributing factor we look at to gauge user experience. When we shipped the HTML5 player, we noticed that on average it took slightly longer for Facebook to load. By fixing several small performance regressions and making multiple micro-optimizations, we finally reached a level we felt happy with shipping.\u201d\n\nAs said before, this can be a huge improvement for the user but also for the developers. On the user side, they will have an improved video experience, videos will start playing faster which is good.\n\nIt is good that big companies like Facebook and Google are adopting HTML5 forcing sooner or later other websites to switch to HTML5, making everyone a bit safer.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 HTML5, Flash)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/html5-flash", "topic_name": "HTML5.

While out of scope, I would have easily been able to gain full access to any user\u2019s account, [personal] pictures and data.\u201d\n\nWeinberg reported his findings to Facebook, but the company reacted badly due to the exposure of employees\u2019 data and excluded the expert from the bug bounty program.\n\nIn early December, Weinberg claims Synack CEO, Jay Kaplan, received a scary call from Facebook security chief Alex Stamos regarding the vulnerability discovered by Weinberg. Stamos sustains that the expert opened the users to cyber attack compromising the security of the entire platform.\n\n\u201cAlex informed my employer (as far as I am aware) that I had found a vulnerability, and had used it to access sensitive data. He then explained that the vulnerability I found was trivial and of little value, and at the same time said that my reporting and handling of the vulnerability submission had caused huge concern at Facebook. Alex then stated that he did not want to have to get Facebook\u2019s legal team involved, but that he wasn\u2019t sure if this was something he needed to go to law enforcement over.\u201d Weinberg explained a blog post.\n\nStamos issued a statement, saying he \u201cdid not threaten legal action against Synack or [Weinberg] nor did [he] ask for [Weinberg] to be fired.\u201d\n\nStamos published a post entitled \u201cBug Bounty Ethics\u201d to reply Weinberg\n\n\u201cI told Jay that we couldn\u2019t allow Wes to set a precedent that anybody can exfiltrate unnecessary amounts of data and call it a part of legitimate bug research, and that I wanted to keep this out of the hands of the lawyers on both sides. I did not threaten legal action against Synack or Wes nor did I ask for Wes to be fired. I did say that Wes\u2019s behavior reflected poorly on him and on Synack, and that it was in our common best interests to focus on the legitimate RCE report and not the unnecessary pivot into S3 and downloading of data.\u201d Stamos wrote.\n\n\u201cCondoning researchers going well above and beyond what is necessary to find and fix critical issues would create a precedent that could be used by those aiming to violate the privacy of our users, and such behavior by legitimate security researchers puts the future of paid bug bounties at risk,\u201d he added.\n\nFacebook assumed another position on the events, its security team says that Weinberg was never authorized to publish non-public information he accessed.\n\nFacebook admitted the presence of the flaw and promised a $2,500 reward to Weinberg and his friend, but according to the company the expert has gone too far.\n\nBeloo the full statement issued by Facebook:\n\n\u201cWe are strong advocates of the security researcher community and have built positive relationships with thousands of people through our bug bounty program. These interactions must include trust, however, and that includes reporting the details of bugs that are found and not using them to access private information in an unauthorized manner. In this case, the researcher intentionally withheld bugs and information from our team and went far beyond the guidelines of our program to pull private, non-user data from internal systems. \n\nWe paid him for his initial bug report based on the quality, even though he was not the first to report it, but we didn\u2019t pay for the subsequent information that he had withheld. At no point did we say he could not publish his findings \u2014 we asked that he refrain from disclosing the non-public information he accessed in violation of our program guidelines. We remain firmly committed to paying for high quality research and helping the community learn from researchers\u2019 hard work.\u201d\n\nLet me close with a reflection \u2026\n\nWhat would happen if a nation-state actor exploits a similar flaw?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Instagram , hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bounty-program", "topic_name": "bounty program"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/instagram", "topic_name": "Instagram"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}]}, {"news_name": "Twitter warns victims of state-sponsored attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42810/hacking/twitter-state-sponsored-attacks.html", "title": "Twitter warns victims of state-sponsored attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 16, 2015", "body": "Twitter is warning users of state-sponsored cyber attacks, a small number of users, including a few connected to security and privacy advocacy, have been notified that their accounts were targeted by nation-state hackers.\n\nThe Twitter users received the notifications in the inboxes, the warning messages started a couple of days ago.\n\nTwitter informed its users that hackers, likely associated with \u201ca government,\u201d were trying to compromise their account.

This is a winner\u2019s choice because the technique makes it hard to detect botnet activities.\n\nThe interactions with social networking sites can be easily automated and \u201cmalicious\u201d traffic directed to social media platforms is hard to identify due to large volumes. Attackers can set up a network of fake profiles on a social network and use them to post a specific set of encrypted commands to the malware. The infected machine queries the \u201cbootmaster\u201d profile for new commands, summarizing a botnet a using C&C in social media is extremely resilient and allows malware to run for long periods of time.\n\nThe attackers have improved their control techniques over time.

This is what the notification looks like on the desktop version of the Facebook website:\u201d Alex Stamos, Chief Security Officer at Facebook, states in a blog post. \u201cWe do this because these types of attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others, and we strongly encourage affected people to take the actions necessary to secure all of their online accounts. \u201c\n\n\n\nFacebook is already monitoring users\u2019 account for potential compromise while offering users the possibility to proactively secure their accounts. In June, Facebook released two security tools, the Security Checkup and the cleanup tool, aimed at improving the security posture of its users.   The Security Checkup is a tool warn users on the browsers and apps they used to access their accounts, meanwhile the cleanup tool developed in a joint effort with AV firms such as Kaspersky Lab.\n\nThe company will provide users with the possibility to enable the \u201cLogin Approvals\u201d feature that would ensure that hackers cannot login into a user\u2019s account. The alert would be triggered also if the Facebook account is accessed from a new device or browser, also in these cases the user will receive a security code on the mobile phone he registered.\n\nAlex Stamos highlighted that the alert doesn\u2019t mean that the Facebook\u2019s platform has been hacked, instead there is the concrete risk that the user\u2019s device might have been infected with malware. Facebook hasn\u2019t provided further information regarding the method it uses to detect the nature of the attack (i.e. nation-state attacks, frauds), anyway it highlighted that it is focused on state-sponsored attacks that are often very sophisticated.\n\n\u201cTo protect the integrity of our methods and processes, we often won\u2019t be able to explain how we attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers. That said, we plan to use this warning only in situations where the evidence strongly supports our conclusion.

In December the security firm Cylance released a detailed report on the hacking Operation Cleaver that was run by state-sponsored hackers linked to the Iran. The Iranian hackers targeted critical infrastructure worldwide, ten of which are located in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe Cleaver group is once again in the headlines, the hacking crew has created a network of at least 25 well-developed LinkedIn profiles to manage a social engineering campaign that is targeting entities the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhile tracking a suspected Iran-based threat group known as Threat Group-2889 (TG-2889), Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit\u2122 (CTU) researchers uncovered a network of fake LinkedIn profiles. These convincing profiles form a self-referenced network of seemingly established LinkedIn users. CTU researchers assess with high confidence the purpose of this network is to target potential victims through social engineering.\u201d states a blog post published by the Dell\u2019s Counter Threat Unit. The experts labelled the Cleaver group TG-2889.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of the legitimate LinkedIn accounts associated with the fake accounts belong to individuals in the Middle East, and CTU researchers assess with medium confidence that these individuals are likely targets of TG-2889.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts speculate that the Cleaver group has been created by the Iranian Government in in the wake of the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear facility in Natanz.\n\nThe list of targets identified by the researchers at Cylance is very long and includes at least one military entity in the US by name, the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and organizations in several industries such as energy and utilities. The previous report also revealed that airports, principal airlines, government agencies, transportation companies, telecommunications operators, defense contractors and educational institutions are among the targeted institutions.\n\nThe experts revealed that during the period of observation, the threat actors have rapidly improved their cyber capabilities.\n\nNow the Cleaver is exploiting the popular professional social network LinkedIn for intelligence gathering activities, the group used six so-called Leader profiles that have more than 500 profile connections and a number of Supporter personas what are less developed than for Leader personas.\n\nThe leader profiles were used by the threat actors to conduct spear phishing attacks or to redirect users to malicious websites hosting exploit kits.\n\nThe experts at Dell\u2019s Counter Threat Unit who investigated the case, discovered that the fake profiles used by the Cleaver hacking crew claim individuals are employees at companies including defence contractor Northrop Grumman, Malaysia\u2019s RHB Bank, US tech firm TeleDyne and South Korean holding firm Doosan.\n\nThe researchers conducting OSIT researchers discovered that \u201cthe Leader profiles\u201d were fraudulent, hackers used the same profile images for multiple identities across numerous websites. The hackers also copied the summary section in LinkedIn profiles from legitimate LinkedIn profile, meanwhile the employment history matches a sample r\u00e9sum\u00e9 downloaded from a recruitment website. Hackers also used job advertisements from Teledyne and ExxonMobil companies and legitimate job posting from a Malaysian bank in order to create a trustable job description.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cleaver hackers have created a network of credible professional enforced by the use of the endorsements mechanism.\n\nThe Supporter personas appears to be to provide LinkedIn skills endorsements for Leader profiles as it is visible in the following graph.\n\nThe researchers also spotted a novel technique, two Leader profiles appear to be duplicates and while CTU experts were analyzing the profiles, the Cleaver actors altered two of the Leader LinkedIn accounts by replacing profile name and photograph with a new identity.\n\n\u201cThe level of detail in the profiles suggests that the threat actors invested substantial time and effort into creating and maintaining these personas,\u201d states the report published by Dell. \u201cFive of the leader personas claim to be recruitment consultants, which would provide a pretext for contacting targets.\u201d\n\nThe exploitation of social network for cyber espionage is not new, in September security researchers have uncovered a group of fake recruiting accounts on LinkedIn used for intelligence gathering about security experts.\n\nA few months ago, researchers from iSIGHT Partners uncovered a group of Iranian hackers who was using more than a dozen fake profiles to infiltrate social networking websites with cyber espionage purpose.\n\n\u201cThese credible personas then connected, linked, followed, and \u201cfriended\u201d target victims, giving them access to information on location, activities, and relationships from updates and other common content,\u201d iSIGHT Partners explained.\n\nIranian spies used a network of fake accounts (NEWSCASTER network) on principal social media to spy on US officials and political staff worldwide, as reported in the analysis published by iSIGHTPartners.\n\nPierluigi

This was a big concern at the time because LinkedIn has many people from the business area, and any security flaw that makes it spear phishing easier and efficient to execute.\n\nThe big risk is that with a specially crafted spear phishing campaign a crook can steal credentials and most probably gain control of their victim\u2019s assets, doing all this without the need of social engineering.\n\nAt the time, LinkedIn fixed the vulnerability and said: \u201cWhile certain HTML content should be restricted and we have issued a fix and thanked Kaspersky researchers; the likelihood of exploit on popular modern email platforms is unlikely.\u201d\n\n\nUsing the words of SecureList, \u201cResearchers found the vulnerability after noticing escape character differences when posting comments from different devices in various posts.

It proves that LinkedIn was using two different email platforms, and that the one used by the mobile application could be used to deliver a malicious payload.\n\n\n\nAnother good example how the fixed vulnerability could be exploited at the time.\n\nThis is would it would look a comment when you see it directly in LinkedIn:\n\n\nNow see the same comment when received my mail:\n\n\n\nThis means that the crook could use the flaw to inject malicious code, to redirect you to a malicious site to serve a malware\n or just to steal user\u2019s credentials.\n\nMitigation\n\nAs I said, in the beginning of the article LinkedIn fixed this issue, but crooks use LinkedIn to get valuable information about their victims, so be careful and always keep some tips in mind:\n\nThe history can teach us lessons, and avoid future problems, so be careful with the connections you accept, and share your personal/Working details, because that ca be used for good but also for bad, and with the right piece of information, crooks can \u201copen some doors\u201d.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 LinkedIn, Spear Phishing)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linkedin", "topic_name": "LinkedIn"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook query packs detects Hacking Team malware on Mac OS X", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38748/hacking/facebook-query-packs-ht.html", "title": "Facebook query packs detects Hacking Team malware on Mac OS X\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 22, 2015", "body": "The Hacking Team hack revealed to the IT industry the \u201cweapons\u201d used by the Italian firm to compromise practically every system.

Facebook has created an AI research laboratory and hired NYU professor \u201cYann LeCun\u201d as the head of artificial intelligence since 2013. This investment led to a successful experimental algorithm that uses other identifying clues such as hair style, clothing, and body shape in order to recognize people even if their faces are not clear.\n\nThis Facebook algorithm is considered as the latest AI step in facial recognition called PIPER. The technology is able to identify people even when faces are obscured. PIPER has been examined by use of a dataset, consisting of over 60,000 instances of 2000 individuals collected from public Flickr photo albums with only about half of the person images containing a frontal face. The final result is quite astonishing and as Facebook said:\n\n\u201cit has the ability to identify individuals with 83% accuracy\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Pose Invariant Person Recognition (PIPER) method, accumulates the cues of poselet-level person recognizers trained by deep convolutional networks to discount for the pose variations, combined with a face recognizer and a global recognizer.\n\nFacial recognition use has been rapidly increasing both in commercial products, as well as by law enforcement lately. Facebook has used facial recognition technology to enable tag suggestion and for its new photo sharing application named Moments that was introduced on June 15, 2015.Facebook facial recognition software helps users tag photos by suggesting tags of their friends. This software uses an algorithm to calculate a unique number (\u201ctemplate\u201d) based on someone\u2019s facial features, like the distance between the eyes, nose and ears. This template is based on profile pictures and photos users have been tagged in on Facebook. Algorithms like this could help application such as Moments to provide better accuracy and higher user satisfaction.\n\n\u201cIf, even when you hide your face, you can be successfully linked to your identiy, that will certainly concern people,\u201d said Ralph Gross at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It goes without say that, the algorithm and its ability to identify someone even when they are not looking at the camera is very impressive, but it might bring some serious privacy issues to the fore.\n\nAlso, these advanced facial recognition algorithms like PIPER bring limitless possibilities for solving crimes and putting an end to drawbacks of the traditional algorithms which relied on \u2018face alignment\u2019 based on locations of the two eyes and have difficulty to function correctly in situation person wearing sunglasses or face is occluded. It\u2019s hoped these researches can be used to help the police act faster and more accurate in crime prevention.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAli Taherian (@ali_taherian) is an enthusiastic information security Officer.

By promising transparency and security the minds.com has attracted the support of online activists including the popular hacking collective Anonymous.\nThe experts highlighted that minds.com is a long running project started in 2012 and that the product is still in beta version. After a few tests they spotted their first XSS vulnerability, then they decided to exploit it. The XSS vulnerability affecting the minds.com social network is considerable critical due to the possibility to make payments, using both Credit Card and BitCoins, .\n\nBe aware, the two experts already reported the flaw to the developers that actually manages the open source project minds.com.\nBelow a detailed description of the vulnerabilities  discovered by the researchers:\n\nXSS in the search form\nThe search form is vulnerable to a reflected XSS, which can be triggered by using a specifically crafted URL. An attacker can exploit is to run phishing attacks and steal victim\u2019s credentials.\n\n\n\nXSS within profile details\n\nThe following fields within user description are vulnerable to stored XSS attacks:\n\nThis is quite critical since an attacker may steal credentials to every visitor to his profile:\n\n<script>alert(\u2018XSS\u2019);</script>\n\n\n\nXSS within the Archive title\nThe title field within users archives are vulnerable to stored XSS injection; any user visiting an infected archive will execute the javascript the attacker has stored within the title.\n\nDelete of any message from any user\nAn attacker could easily delete any public post of any user from any location (profile, blog, groups):\n\nUpload of arbitrary files\n\nAny user can upload any file to the social network platform allowing malicious activities such as malware distribution.\n\n\n\nEdit profile data of any user\n\nUsing this vulnerability an attacker could edit profile data of any user. It wouldn\u2019t be such a destructive vulnerability if it wasn\u2019t that it can be combined with vulnerability #2. In that way an attacker is sure that his victims will be exploited, because is no more necessary that victims visit attacker profile for being exploited, but they only need to visit their own profiles (default action after successful login) for being exploited. One attack vector, for example, could be the BeEF Hook (http://beefproject.com/)\n\nUnauthorized control of contents\nAny visitor of the platform may completely defaces the main structure, eventually conducting phishing or malware distribution campaigns. An attacker even without being registered on the site may edit a pre-existent article (main page, FAQ, Tos, \u2026) and insert arbitrary content. The attacker may also delete any article within the main structure of the site. The Flaw seems to be fixed at time of writing.\n\n/p/edit/<page_name>\n\n\nSummary\nWe would like to remember and point out that the project is huge and is at beta stage, so things like those we have listed are very common and normal, anyway the experts hope developers will fix them in a very short time.\nIndeed those flaws are very critical since they allow an attacker to completely wipe the platform, potentially infect every user or steal their credentials and sensitive data.\nVoidsec would lie to point out that they have only scratched the surface, they have done this little analysis by hand and they haven\u2019t checked for the presence of other flaws, including SQLi, CSRF, tokens and sessions.\n\nProbably the number of vulnerabilities is greater.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 XSS , minds.com)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/minds-com", "topic_name": "minds.com"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/voidsec", "topic_name": "Voidsec"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/xss", "topic_name": "XSS"}]}, {"news_name": "A new Facebook scam in the wild aims to steal sensitive data", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37526/cyber-crime/new-facebook-scam.html", "title": "A new Facebook scam in the wild aims to steal sensitive data\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 4, 2015", "body": "It\u2019s not new that Facebook it\u2019s the perfect place to try to get precious information and financial gain since it aggregates many people, crossing all generations.

The developer named the extension Marauder\u2019s Map as the magical Marauder\u2019s Map from the Harry Potter books that reveals all of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nThe Chrome extension allows tracking Facebook friends by grabbing location data from Facebook Messenger with location sharing enabled and displaying their locations on a map. As explained by the developer the accuracy of that data and easiness of extracting them from the popular social network allow everybody easily track user\u2019s friends from the messaging service.\n\n \n\n\u201cI wrote a Chrome extension for the Facebook Messenger page (https://www.facebook.com/messages/) that scrapes all this location data and plots it on a map. You can get this extension here and play around with it on your message data.\u201d wrote the developer in a blog post.\n\nThe Facebook mobile app for Facebook Messenger sends out the user\u2019s location with all messages by default and let me add that that the precision of the coordinates is impressive.\n\n\n\nAnother factor to consider it that the popular social network encourages the users of the Messenger app to share their location by enabling location sharing feature by default in the installation phase.\n\nIt is important to understand that in order to track position of a friend in Facebook it is necessary to have had a conversation with him over Messenger with location enabled.\n\nIf someone is able to involve Facebook users, not necessarily friends, in a chat he will be able to track their location.\n\n\u201cI found that I could even do this for people who I am not Facebook friends with. I am currently in a large active chat to organize poker games with some fellow students, many of whom I am not Facebook friends with. However, I can still track their locations extremely accurately from the messages they send the group.\u201d said Khanna.\n\nAnother interesting discovery made by the developer is that it is possible to aggregate information from chat of different users with the same target in order to track him.\n\n\u201cThis means that if a few people who I am chatting with separately collude and send each other the locations I share with them, they would be able to track me very accurately without me ever knowing.\u201d\n\nIt is important to highlight that there is no flaw in Facebook Messenger because the developer has simply exploited a feature that allows users to share their locations with friends.\n\nThe extension for Chrome is available on the Chrome web store, its source code is open and available on Github.\n\nTo avoid being tracked by the extension keep your location data private by disabling location sharing feature in your Messenger.

But in order to get really useful (to the CIA) intelligence you need skilled linguists and analysts to double check and also find out if the selecting and sorting software needs to be tweaked (it often does).\u201d continues the Strategy Page.\n\nSocial networking platforms represent a privileged source of information for the intelligence worldwide, the analysis of metadata extracted by social media could allow agents to track also Facebook users that are using pseudonyms to remain hidden.\n\nSocial media platforms represent a privileged communication carrier for groups of terrorists so it\u2019s normal that the Intelligence agencies will develop tools and methodologies to monitor them and uncover the activities of criminals and terrorist.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  social media, US SOCOM)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/counter-terrorism", "topic_name": "Counter-Terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isis", "topic_name": "ISIS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/military", "topic_name": "military"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/terrorism", "topic_name": "Terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-socom", "topic_name": "US SOCOM"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook Friends Mapper \u2013 How to crawl Hidden Friends", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36675/hacking/facebook-friends-mapper.html", "title": "Facebook Friends Mapper \u2013 How to crawl Hidden Friends\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 9, 2015", "body": "Facebook users can protect their privacy by setting the \u201cprivacy level\u201d for every information related their profile or content they post online.\n\nUsers can decide to completely set as private the information in a way it results invisible to other users, even to the user\u2019s friends.\n\nThere is an option in Facebook that allows the user to set the visibility of his friend\u2019s list to \u201cOnly Me\u201c,  the settings allow users to keep the friend\u2019s list hidden from other Facebook users, including users\u2019 own friends.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a flaw in Facebook that doesn\u2019t allow to completely hide information of the user\u2019s profile, including the friend\u2019s list.

Ask the questions about whether or not their children have heard about it and whether or not their friends are talking about it on the internet.\u201d said Miller.\n\nMiller explained that law enforcement observed numerous cases in the UK linked to the Game of 72, fortunately in all the cases where teenagers disappeared and appeared unharmed days later. It seems that that game was originated in France, according to the French website The Local.\n\n\u201cThe game was reportedly to blame for the disappearance of a 13-year-old girl the French press identified as Emma, who went missing for three days at the end of April before showing up at home unharmed and refusing to reveal to her parents or law enforcement where she\u2019d been.\u201d reported Yahoo. \u201cAfter two girls in Britain went missing over the weekend, speculation arose that they, too, were playing the game, according to The Daily Express. Sammy Clarke and Siobhan Clarke, who are not related, were found safe on Monday. Police have not confirmed whether the girls were playing the game, though friends and neighbors told the papers they suspected it. Still, local authorities have arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with the incident, The Daily Express reported.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that the so-called the Game of 72 could have dramatic consequences for its young players. Vancouver Constable Brian Montague explained that the game is dangerous and potentially criminal because it procures a false alarm in the police.\n\n\u201cWhen you force the police into an investigation you potentially could be charged criminally. That\u2019s always a possibility. We hope that it wouldn\u2019t get to that.\u201d explained the Vancouver Constable Brian Montague.\n\nIn order to discourage the teenager in participating the Game of 72, Montague is also cautioning them that an investigation conducted by the law enforcement on their disappearance could cause the public disclosure for details of their personal life.\n\nThe disconcerting Game of 72 is becoming viral, Revere Police in Massachusetts is warning parents of the absurd practice.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Game of 72, social media)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gameof72", "topic_name": "#Gameof72"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/game-of-72", "topic_name": "Game of 72"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/teenager", "topic_name": "teenager"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous vigilantes are fighting against the ISIS propaganda", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35486/hacking/anonymous-against-isis.html", "title": "Anonymous vigilantes are fighting against the ISIS propaganda\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 30, 2015", "body": "According to The New York Times hackers are targeting accounts used by ISIS members for propaganda and recruit new sympathizers.

Due to its enormous popularity even apart from the fact that it\u2019s blocked in some countries and being accessed by some tools (it shows everyone out there wants to get it, no matter how much effort it requires), Facebook has drawn attention universally and with the ongoing problems emerging thanks to vague statements in previous versions of the terms of use and policies the phenomenon has not calmed down. In order to be kept up to date with the latest version of Facebook\u2019s policies, the report was issued raising awareness to everyone, even in a provisional manner.\n\n\n\nIn response to the revisions announced last December and performed a month later, the report is in accordance to what seems to be the case legally with Facebook to this date. According to the professionals, what has led them to proceed with the report was the following: \u201cIn December 2014, Facebook announced that it would revise\n\n\u201cIn December 2014, Facebook announced that it would revise its Data Use Policy and Terms of Service. At the request of the Belgian Privacy Commission, ICRI/CIR (KU Leuven), in cooperation with iMinds-SMIT (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) conducted an extensive analysis of Facebook\u2019s revised policies and terms.\u201d So, you can see that there is great concern on behalf of some European governments and their commissions , the Belgian Privacy Commission) to shed light to the privacy and freedom concerns of Facebook.\n\nWhat seems to raise suspicions and a great deal of concern about the rights of Facebook and its extensive data process is the fact that there are some policies that are of questionable legality within the European Union (EU) and the respective legislation. To be more specific:\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s data processing capabilities have increased both horizontally and vertically. By horizontal we refer to the increase of data gathered from different sources. Vertical refers to the deeper and more detailed view Facebook has on its users.\u201d\n\nThis has been a result of the cooperation of Facebook with some other companies and services, such as Instagram or Whatsapp. Due to the purchase of these services by Facebook and due to the acknowledgement that a lot of plugins are used by them, it makes total sense why Facebook feels that it is high time it backed its legal rights up properly.\n\nAccording to the report, there are problems and potential red flags with the Unfair Contract Terms Directive. This Directive \u201cintroduces a notion of \u201cgood faith\u201d in order to prevent significant imbalances in the rights and obligations of consumers on the one hand and sellers and suppliers on the other hand.\u201d\n\nSo, you can see that there are several points that need to be discussed further towards outlining the vulnerabilities of the privacy policy of Facebook. It is crucial that all the users are thoroughly informed on what they agree to upon subscribing to Facebook.\n\nThis can result in a much better handling of their privacy as a whole.

Costolo revealed to be embarrassed for the company\u2019s failures and would be operating to eliminate trolls and abuses.\n\n\u201cWe suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we\u2019ve sucked at it for years,\u201d Costolo wrote in a memo obtained by The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day.\u201d\n\nFollowing the declaration of its CEO, Twitter announced that it is introducing new tools to eliminate harassment and any other behavior that violate company policies.\n\n\u201cnow we\u2019re making similar improvements around reporting other content issues including impersonation, self-harm and the sharing of private and confidential information. These changes will begin rolling out today and should reach all users in the coming weeks.\u201d states Twitter in a blog post.\n\nAmong the changes announced by Twitter, all the users that will receive temporary bans will need to verify their email address or a phone number in order to resume their accounts.\n\nTwitter starts tracking phone numbers of users as a measure to prevent abuses like the creation of new bogus accounts. Twitter could discourage fraudsters and harassers from creating fake accounts by checking phone numbers submitted by the users against a blacklist of abusers that have been already banned.\n\n\n\nTwitter will ban its worst users as explained by Tina Bhatnagar, vice president of user services:\n\n \u201cOverall, we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously, and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports,\u201d \n\nIt is also the first time that Twitter allows users to report abuses of other accounts. According to Twitter, its news tools will allow users to report impersonation, self-harm, and the inappropriate posting of confidential and private data.\n\nThe goal of the company is to improve abuse reporting by making it easier for users to discriminate trolls.\n\nAre the measures announced by Twitter enough to eliminate malicious accounts and any other kind of abuse?\n\nProbably no, but it is a good start. The measure to track users requesting their mobile could be ineffective if a user asked to provide its phone number the first time will abandon his account and start illegal activities creating a new one. Twitter, in fact, will not request new users to provide phone numbers to verify their identity.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Twitter, trolls)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/abuse", "topic_name": "abuse"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fraud", "topic_name": "fraud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trolls", "topic_name": "trolls"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/twitter", "topic_name": "Twitter"}]}, {"news_name": "Serious flaws allowed the deletion of any comment on Facebook", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33813/hacking/facebook-comment-on-facebook.html", "title": "Serious flaws allowed the deletion of any comment on Facebook\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 19, 2015", "body": "The 19-year-old hacker Joe Balhis has discovered the way to delete any comment on Facebook by leveraging a session validation flaw and a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

According to the researcher, the Trojan has already infected nearly 110,000 Facebook users in two days by spreading itself through malicious link.\n\nFaghani explained that the Facebook Trojan spreads itself by posting links to a pornographic video from the account of unaware victims that have been previously infected.\n\nThe trojan tags the infected user\u2019s friends in an enticing post. When users open the post, the user will see a preview of a porn video which eventually stops and asks for downloading a (fake) flash player to continue the preview, unfortunately the bogus application is the downloader of the Facebook Trojan.\n\n\n\nTo remain under the radar, the Facebook Trojan tags less than 20 user in each round of post, Faghani explained that the malware can manipulate keystrokes and mouse movement.\n\nThe researchers also added that this malware adopts a new technique in the threat landscape dubbed \u201cMagnet\u201d that consists in tagging the friends of the victim in a the malicious post.\n\n\u201cThis trojan is different from the previous trojans in online social network in some techniques. For instance, the previous trojans sent messages (on behalf of the victim) to a number of the victim\u2019s friends. Upon infection of those friends, the malware could go one step further and infect the friends of the initial victim\u2019s friends. In the new technique, which we call it \u201cMagnet\u201d, the malware gets more visibility to the potential victims as it tags the friends of the victim in a the malicious post. In this case, the tag may be seen by friends of the victim\u2019s friends as well, which leads to a larger number of potential victims.

Facebook also deployed its hidden services website with an SSL certificate to avoid attack against the platform and to mutually authenticate the social network service and the users. It is the first time that a legitimate SSL digital certificate was issued for a .onion website.\n\n\u201cwe have provided an SSL certificate which cites our onion address; this mechanism removes the Tor Browser\u2019s \u201cSSL Certificate Warning\u201d for that onion address and increases confidence that this service really is run by Facebook.

The student at Stanford, Andrew Aude discovered a still unreleased feature of Facebook Messenger by using the iOS and Mac OS X hacking tool Cycript.\n\nIn reality the presence of payments feature in Facebook Messenger code was first discovered by another security researcher, Jonathan Zdziarski a few weeks ago.\n\nThe youngster disclosed its discovery on Twitter last Saturday, he posted screenshots of the payment functionalities implemented by the IT giant for its Facebook Messenger. Aude explained that Facebook Messenger users will be able to pay in the same users of Square\u2019s Cash app allows users to send money with their debit card via their mobile phone.\n\n\u201cThe messenger\u2019s payment option lets users send money in a message similar to how they can send a photo. Users can add a debit card in Messenger, or use one they already have on file with Facebook. An in-app pincode also exists for added security around payments. It\u2019s unclear whether Facebook will monetize Messenger by charging a small fee for money transfers, or offer the functionality for free to drive usage of its standalone chat app.\u201d states a blog post from Techcrunch.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of payments capabilities into Facebook\u2019s messaging app has been anticipated many times, but no one has never demonstrated their existence. IT experts sustain that a Facebook has boosted the design of the new feature  hiring the former PayPal president David Marcus back in June.\n\nAude conducted various tests on the feature uncovered, he confirmed that was only able to get debit cards to work with the system, in time he made the tests banks accounts and credit cards were not accepted for the payments.\n\n \u201cBased on my understanding of the debit interchange rates, each transaction will cost Facebook roughly $0.40 to $0.50 (Durbin swipe fee + ACH fee),\u201d Aude told the site. \u201d The app didn\u2019t mention a fee to send, so it\u2019s probably free, at least initially. Over time they might add a $1 fee.\u201d\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Facebook will provide the service free of charges to stimulate the use of its Facebook Messenger app instead its competitors like Apple iMessage, Tencent\u2019s WeChat and Google Hangouts.\n\nAude also discovered a note in the code that indicates the functionality will initially only allow one-to-one transactions.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, we will only support single payment attachment,\u201d reads the note in the code discovered by Aude. \u201cMultiple payment attachments will be supported in the future\u201d\n\nAude, who says he believes the feature might be rolled out in the next few months, also found another note in the code that indicates the feature will initially only allow one-to-one transactions.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, we will only support single payment attachment,\u201d reads the note in the code discovered by Aude. \u201cMultiple payment attachments will be supported in the future.\u201d\n\nAude highlighted the simplicity of the payment process developed by Facebook engineer, users can authorize a payment simply pushing on a button, then enter the amount to transfer, and send it. Another interesting consideration made by the student is that Facebook seems to maintain the transaction private and doesn\u2019t publish anything about it to the News Feed.\n\nFacebook did not commented the post.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Facebook Messenger, payments)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook-messenger", "topic_name": "Facebook Messenger"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-app", "topic_name": "mobile app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/payments", "topic_name": "payments"}]}, {"news_name": "A new Mac botnet exploits the Reddit platform", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28882/cyber-crime/mac-botnet-exploits-reddit-platform.html", "title": "A new Mac botnet exploits the Reddit platform\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 4, 2014", "body": "Security experts at Russian anti-virus company Dr Web have uncovered a new botnet, which is composed by thousands of Mac computers.

The files used in the spam messages were also refreshed frequently to evade anti-virus vendor detection.\u201d reports Facebook.\n\nThe operation is the demonstration that the fight to the cybercrime need a joint effort of private companies and law enforcement as happened in the case of recent takeover Zeus Gameover botnet.\n\n\u201cStaying ahead of the latest threats is a complex job, and Lecpetex was a particularly persistent malware family,\u201d \u201cWe hope this example will illustrate that cooperation can be helpful and productive in shutting down botnets, particularly when criminals abuse multiple online platforms to achieve their aims.\u201dFacebook states in an official statement.\n\nThe attackers exploited social engineering techniques to trick users into opening an infected .zip attachment, once opened the attachment executes a JAR file, which is used to downloads the Lecpetex module from a file-sharing service, the bad actors used to spread Litecoin mining malware and a version of the DarkComet RAT.\n\nThe malicious code also includes a spam module implemented to hijack the victims\u2019s Facebook account with the intent to stealing browser cookies and have the complete control them.\n\n\u201cUltimately the botnet operators focused on Litecoin mining to monetize their pool of infected systems,\u201d \u201cWe saw reports that the botnet was also seeded using malicious torrent downloads, but did not observe this tactic in our research.\u201dFacebook reported. \n\nAs explained by Facebook, the bad actors behind Lecpatex botnet had begun moving off Facebook exploiting classing phishing emails, just before the Greek police arrested two Greek students of informatics.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (Facebook, Lecpetex botnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darkcomet", "topic_name": "DarkComet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lecpetex", "topic_name": "Lecpetex"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/litecoin", "topic_name": "Litecoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing-emails", "topic_name": "phishing emails"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zeus-gameover", "topic_name": "Zeus GameOver"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook SDK flaw exposes smartphone users\u2019 accounts at risk", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/26348/hacking/facebook-sdk-flaw-exposes-smartphone-users-accounts-risk.html", "title": "Facebook SDK flaw exposes smartphone users\u2019 accounts at risk\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 5, 2014", "body": "The Facebook SDK allows the easy integration of mobile apps with Facebook platform, in particular to implement Login with Facebook authentication and reading and writing to Facebook APIs.

The Facebook experiment was carried out in 2012 and was related to the manipulation of content on users\u2019 newsfeeds to analyze the effect on the user\u2019s sentiment.\n\nThe Facebook experiment ran from January 11 to 18, 2012 during which the hundreds of thousands of Facebook users unknowingly participating may have felt either happier or more depressed than usual because they visualized the post of their friend.\n\nThe study was conducted in conjunction with researchers from the Cornell and the University of California, Facebook filtered users\u2019 news feeds composed by comments, videos, pictures and web links posted by other people in their social network in order to provide evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks.\n\n\u201cEmotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others.\u201d \u201cThree studies have laid the groundwork for testing these processes via Facebook, the largest online social network. This research demonstrated that (i) emotional contagion occurs via text-based computer-mediated communication; (ii) contagion of psychological and physiological qualities has been suggested based on correlational data for social networks generally; and (iii) people\u2019s emotional expressions on Facebook predict friends\u2019 emotional expressions, even days later (although some shared experiences may in fact last several days). To date, however, there is no experimental evidence that emotions or moods are contagious in the absence of direct interaction between experiencer and target.\u201d states the abstract of the project.\n\nThe Facebook experiment shows that emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, with this approach it is possible to induce same emotions without individual\u2019s awareness.\n\nOne of the tests conducted reduced users\u2019 exposure to their friends\u2019 \u201cpositive emotional content\u201d, resulting in fewer positive posts from the observed users. Another test reduced users\u2019 exposure to \u201cnegative emotional content\u201d and fewer negative posts was the result.\n\n\u201c\u201cWhen positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,\u201d \u201c\u201cThe fact that people were more emotionally positive in response to positive emotion updates from their friends stands in contrast to theories that suggest viewing positive posts by friends on Facebook may somehow affect us negatively,\u201d according to the paper\u201d states the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the Facebook experiment ethically correct?\n\nGiving a look to the Facebook\u2019s data use policy it is possible to note that the company informs its users that their \u2019 information will be used \u201cfor internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement,\u201d, in other words every user could be involved in a study like this one. \n\n\u201cThis research was conducted for a single week in 2012 and none of the data used was associated with a specific person\u2019s Facebook account,\u201d \u201cWe do research to improve our services and to make the content people see on Facebook as relevant and engaging as possible.

Unfortunately for these users, they actually ended up hacking their own accounts for the scammers and exposed their friends in the process.\u201d\n\nThe video is used by scammers to redirect victims to a document on Google Drive that contains the instructions to run a stub of JavaScript code. The document requests to victims to paste the code in their browser\u2019s console window and run it, the malicious code hijacks the victim\u2019s account and use it to \u201clike\u201d other pages and follow lists.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat really happens when you paste this code into your browser console window is that a series of actions are performed using your Facebook account without your knowledge. Behind the scenes, your account is used to follow lists and users, and give likes to pages in order to inflate the follower and like counts defined by the scammers.\u201d\n\nThe cybercriminals with this tactic are able to increase the popularity of a specific web page or they are able to increase the reputation of fake profiles.\n\nThis kind of scam is not new, as confirmed by Narang it has been around since 2011, recently experts at Symantec detected some cases in India. The scam is very effective, according Narang it allowed to cybercriminals to inflate the \u201clike\u201d count on some pages by 50,000 to 100,000, giving a close look to the malicious code experts noticed name assigned to variables (e.g. mesaj and arkadaslar) which suggest the authors are Turkish.\n\nTo mitigate the attack Facebook warned its users to disable browser console windows, Facebook allows anyway to re-enable the console, but providing a warning message discourages users\n\n\u201cAllow my account to be hijacked if I paste malicious JavaScript.\u201d\n\nScammers exploited the intentions of Facebook users that naively desire to hack their friend\u2019s accounts, it is very stupid to think it possible pasting code in their own browser.\n\n\u201cBeing able to hack someone\u2019s Facebook password by just pasting some code into your browser sounds way too easy and should signal that this is a scam,\u201d\u201dIt\u2019s best to err on the side of caution and

the illusion that censoring the media will be able to suppress the thought of those who disagree.\n\nA few days ago Twitter was obscured in Turkey, the popular social media is dangerous and the Arab Spring is the demonstration, these platforms could be used to spread messages instantaneously to a large audience. The Turkish Government decided to ban Twitter after the diffusion of an audio clip about the corruption of Turkey Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan through YouTube and Twitter. Erdo\u011fan was instructing his son to dispose of large amounts of cash during a law enforcement investigation.\n\nIn any dictatorship, regimes take complete control of television and the press, but it is unlikely that they can easily influence the participation of the population in the major social media.\n\nThe decision to apply a censorship acting via the DNS of the national ISP was very stupid, because population started using Google\u2019s DNS service, in this way Twitter was easily accessible. Turkish Government decided to make a step forward to definitively ban the \u201chostile\u201d media, he ordered to block the Google DNS service.\n\nThe last Google Transparency Report also referred traffic interruption caused by the Turkish Government as shown in the following image.\n\n\n\nYesterday Google claimed that principal Turkish ISPs, including SuperOnline and TTNet, have set up servers that are masquerading as Google\u2019s DNS service to block the services used by the opponents like YouTube and Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe have received several credible reports and confirmed with our own research that Google\u2019s Domain Name System (DNS) service has been intercepted by most Turkish ISPs (Internet Service Providers).\u201d stated Google official statement.\n\nBGPMON published an interesting analysis of what is happening in the country where the Turkish Government is hijacking IP addresses for popular global dns providers.\n\nThe traffic is redirected to a bogus route, but instead of null routing IP addressed of banned social media it was hijacked to servers controlled by the Turkish Goverment that are pretending to be legitimate DNS servers.\n\n\u201cThese new fake servers are receiving traffic for 8.8.8.8 and other popular DNS providers and are answering DNS queries for the incoming DNS requests.  One of the possible reasons for impersonating these DNS providers instead of just null routing traffic to these DNS providers is that they did not want to break Internet connectivity for the significant number of Turkish users that are using these popular DNS servers.\u201d stated BGPMON.\n\n\n\nThe situation is concerning because with a similar techniques the government could also serve surveillance malware and in the worst scenario he could be interested to track and persecute the single citizens.I close this post inviting you to give a look to the graph related to the number of Tor users which started to use the anonymizing network after the media repression operated by the Turkish Government, that number is more than doubled evidencing the critic moment for the freedom of expression of Turkist population.\n\nThe sad reality is that Turk Telekom is hijacking the IP addresses of popular DNS servers, intercepting traffic and the consequences could be unpredictable for Turkish population.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Turkish Government, Censorship)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/arab-spring", "topic_name": "Arab Spring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bgpmon", "topic_name": "BGPMON"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dns", "topic_name": "DNS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/erdogan", "topic_name": "Erdo\u011fan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/turkey", "topic_name": "Turkey"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/turkish-government", "topic_name": "Turkish Government"}]}, {"news_name": "QUANTUMHAND \u2013 NSA impersonates Facebook to inject malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/23129/hacking/quantumhand-nsa-impersonates-facebook-inject-malware.html", "title": "QUANTUMHAND \u2013 NSA impersonates Facebook to inject malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 17, 2014", "body": "Last Week Ryan Gallagher and Glenn Greenwald revealed the existence of TURBINE platform, a sophisticated hacking architecture used to take control of botnet C&C servers managed by cybercrime.\n\nOne of the details revealed by the journalists raised a heated debate, the NSA secretly pretended to be a fake Facebook server to covertly serve for surveillance purpose.\n\nThe journalists reported that the NSA in different cases \u201cmasqueraded as a fake Facebook server, using the social media site as a launching pad to infect a target\u2019s computer and exfiltrate files from a hard drive.\u201d The documents leaked refer the QUANTUMHAND program as a collection of exploits explicitly designed to hit uses Facebook.\n\n\n\nAccording to the document leaked by Snowden, QUANTUM exploit suite includes numerous hacking tools, the slides refer DNS injection and HTTP injection capabilities.

The climate of suspicion after the revelation on the PRISM program is fueling the debate on the abuse of privileges requested by many mobile applications.\n\nThe update for the popular Android app demands access to SMS and MMS messages, the new version of the app was recently released, but the blogger Tony Calileo noted the unusual request from Facebook.\n\nCarlyle wrote a blog post criticizing the request made by the app to access \u201cYour Message\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLike most people, I blindly clicked \u201caccept\u201d when prompted for new permissions on Facebook\u2019s Android App update today (Jan 27). Something caught my eye, and after I cancelled the update, I look a screenshot.\u201d said the blogger.\u201d \u201cThis is just one of a bunch of new permissions the app is requesting for this update, but it\u2019s probably the most alarming,\u201d\n\nThe Android engineer at Facebook, Franci Penov, provided an explanation on Reddit, revealing that the application of the popular social network needs to read messages to implement automatic two-factor authentication.\n\n\u201cAs for the READ_SMS permission, we require that so we can automatically intercept login approvals SMS messages for people that have turned 2-factor authentication for their accounts, or for phone confirmation messages when you add a phone number to your Facebook account. Unfortunately, the Android permissions system does not allow us to specify that we would like to be able to read only SMS messages from a specific number.It\u2019s also worth noting that we would love to be able to ask only for the permissions we need for the specific features particular users uses. For example if you don\u2019t use Facebook events or you don\u2019t want to see them in your device calendar we would prefer to not request theWRITE_CALENDAR calendar; or if you don\u2019t have login approvals and don\u2019t add a phone number, we don\u2019t ask for READ_SMS. However, Android does not allow permission requests on demand; we have to request all permissions that cover each feature at install time, and the users can only grant or deny all of them and have no control over individual permissions.\u201d  said Penov.\n\nWhen a Facebook user logs in to the platform, it sends an SMS containing the approval code. The Android app captures the text message from the user\u2019s Inbox and uses it to complete the authentication process.\n\nThe Facebook Help Centre includes a page to explain which are the privileges requested by the Android app and why it needs it.\n\nThe real problem is the compromise between usability and security, I agree with the need to improve the authentication mechanism with a two factor, but is it really necessary to do it automatically?\n\nA two factor authentication is a further protection for users, so why, don\u2019t ask them to manually submit the authentication code?\n\nMobile platforms are a privileged target for cyber criminals and state-sponsored hackers, security requirements are crucial, but privacy concern is high. \n\nRecently, Facebook was also accused to violate the user\u2019s privacy because it analyzes everything is typed and not publish (self-censorship content), the content users have intentionally chosen not to share.\n\nUsers fear Government snooping more than frauds, there is a low perception of cyber threats, but a high attention on alleged technological abuses made by private companies and NSA in the name of the Homeland Security.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android-app", "topic_name": "Android app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-criminals", "topic_name": "cyber criminals"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-platforms", "topic_name": "Mobile platforms"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privileges", "topic_name": "privileges"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/two-factor-authentication", "topic_name": "two-factor authentication"}]}, {"news_name": "IntelCrawler update- BlackPOS author forgot delete social network page", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/21441/cyber-crime/intelcrawler-blackpos-author-forgot-delete-social-network-page.html", "title": "IntelCrawler update- BlackPOS author forgot delete social network page\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 20, 2014", "body": "Intelligence firm IntelCrawler announced a few days ago that the author of the BlackPOS/Kaptoxa malware used in the attack against Target and Neiman Marcus retailers a teenager known in the underground with the pseudonym of Ree[4].\n\nThe first sample of malware was created in March 2013, first documented use of BlackPOS were in Australia, Canada and the US. The first name assigned to the malicious code was \u201cKaptoxa\u201d (\u201cpotato\u201d \u2013 in Russian slang), which then was renamed to \u201cDUMP MEMORY GRABBER by Ree[4]\u201d for forum postings, but the title for Command & Control server maintained string \u201cBlackPOS\u201c.

The author of BlackPOS is the bad actor with nickname \u201cree4\u201d or \u201cree[4]\u201d, he started to sell this malware on one of underground forums called \u201cExploit.in\u201d under the same nick at the beginning of 2013 as visible in the following screenshot:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDespite the author of blackPOS malware is a cyber expert, it seems that he has ignored the power of social networking platform, and the possibility to use them for OSINT purposes. One profile of the popular Russian social network VKontakte has the same nickname as BlackPOS author https://vk.com/ree4_ree4. Obviously this is not a body of evidence, but researcher at IntelCrawler noted that one of the interest of the owner of the page is \u201ccoding\u201d and it was checked that one of his emails is linked to this page through password recovery option by email.\n\n\n\nAccording to operative information from IntelCrawler, the person behind the nickname \u201cree[4]\u201d is Rinat Shibaev, working closely with Sergey Taraspov, who was acting as his technical support, having roots in St.Petersburg (Russian Federation), very well-known coder of malicious code in the underground.\n\nLet\u2019s wait for new updates from Andrew Komarov, Dan Clements and the experts at IntelCrawler.\n\nAbout IntelCrawler\n\nIntelCrawler.com is a multi-tier intelligence aggregator, which gathers information and cyber prints from a starting big data pool of over 3, 000, 000, 000 IPv4 and over 200, 000, 000 domain names, which are scanned for analytics and dissemination to drill down to a desired result.

The acquisition of fraudulent accounts is done using a stolen digital identity and payments are executed with stolen credit card or using compromised payment services accounts.\n\nLinkedIn confirmed in the complaint that it is tracking fraudulent activity of the fake profiles and it has already disabled many of them, actually it is seeking a court order blocking the practice and unspecified damages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a members-first organization and we feel we have a responsibility to protect the control that our members have over the information they put on LinkedIn,\u201d said Hani Durzy, a spokesman for the Mountain View, California-based company.

Facebook implemented algorithms that analyzes what users have typed even if they decide not to publish it considering it\u2019s not private stuff.\n\nFacebook calls the unposted thoughts \u201cself-censorship\u201d, the researchers Sauvik Das and Adam Kramer published an article on their study of the self-censorship behaviour conducted on 5 million English-speaking Facebook users.\n\n\n\nThe study examined posts on other people\u2019s timelines, aborted status updates  and comments on others\u2019 posts, the methods isn\u2019t complex, Facebook instructs the user\u2019s browser to analyze what user type into any text box and send back metadata to the company.\n\nThe problem is that the almost every user ignores this sneaky feature of Facebook, it is not clear how the data collected is covered by Facebook\u2019s privacy policy.\n\nThe  section \u201cInformation we receive and how it is used\u201d in the Facebook\u2019s Data Use Policy clearly inform that company collects information you choose to share or when you \u201cview or otherwise interact with things\u201d.\n\nThe problem is that the policy does not refer explicitly if Facebook manage self-censorship behavior, is the act of \u201cTyping and deleting text\u201d a form of interaction? Of course Facebook considers self-censorship behavior an explicit interaction from which it is useful extract data to profile users.\n\n\u201cWe have arrived at a better understanding of how and where self-censorship manifests on social media; next, we will need to better understand what and why.\u201d stated Das and Kramer\n\nFacebook collects metadata on self-censorship behavior and probably the information could be used for intelligence purpose, the company analyzes it to better understand people thought and habits.\n\nFacebook is analyzing thoughts that we have intentionally chosen not to share, Das and Kramer argue self-censorship analysis is an intrusion in users\u2019 privacy.\n\nIf someone chooses not to post, they claim, \u201c[Facebook] loses value from the lack of content generation.\u201d\n\nThe information could be used for commercial purposes to propose the proper best ads to the users, even if they never published their thoughts or preferences, or to evaluate the sentiment of wide audience of users on a large scale.\n\nThe repercussions on security and privacy are evident, Facebook studies self-censorship behavior to improve its system and minimize self-censorship\u2019s prevalence, but this data is a mine of information for intelligece agencies to spy on users.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Facebook, self-censorship)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/reconnaissance", "topic_name": "reconnaissance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/self-censorship", "topic_name": "self-censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook vulnerability allows to view hidden Facebook Friend List", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/19920/social-networks/facebook-flaw-friend-list.html", "title": "Facebook vulnerability allows to view hidden Facebook Friend List\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 23, 2013", "body": "\u201cFBStalker reverse-engineers the Facebook Graph to find information on every user, the tool does not require a direct friendship with targeted profiles, it just needs to access to parts of victim\u2019s posts marked as public.Through the use of Graph Search data mining activities has become very easy, Graph Search mines Facebook\u2019s vast user data returning personalized results from natural-language queries.

The concept is not new, LinkedIn is a mine of information for OSINT activities and attackers could use it to acquire a huge quantity of personal information on the targets, the social media is ideal for long term cyber espionage operation.\n\nI\u2019ve coined in the past a very interesting concept, the social network poisoning, to indicate the way to abuse of social network platform to spy on specific profile or to modify the sentiment of a topic of interest (e.g. PSYOPs and social both).\n\nIt\u2019s easy to build a network of fake profiles to attract \u201cperson of interest\u201d, to monitor their professional activity and obtain precious information for further targeted attacks (e.g. partnership, collaboration and involvement in specific projects).\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that someone decides to attack my profile and note that within my last publications there is a work I made for banking sector evaluating the impact of cybercrime on modern online-banking. The ill intentioned hackers could collect information in the context where I made the presentation an the person who appreciated it or that work in the same area. Well LinkedIn gives to the attacker all the instruments and knowledge to try to compromise targeted profile.\n\nI would act in this way, after noting that the audio of my presentation was not so good due line problems I\u2019ll send a series to fake email apparently sent by me (if hackers are skilled they can also hack my mail account \ud83d\ude09 ) inviting people to download a new version of the presentation with a better audio. In this case LinkedIn provides the attackers info on my activities, on my contacts, on person who follow me and email address for many of them \u2026 Do you need something else?\n\n\u201cSearch features within the social network provide an easy way for scammers and legitimate LinkedIn users to zoom in on their target audience.  Whether you are a recruiter looking for potential candidates, a dating scammer looking for \u201cmature gentlemen\u201d, or an advanced attacker looking for high-profile directors within particular industry sectors, LinkedIn users have access to tools to help refine their search.  LinkedIn\u2019s own statistics report that 5.7 billion searches were conducted on the social network in 2012.\u201d\n\nAnother curiosity is that an attacker could be an advantage of the subscription to a LinkedIn\u2019s Premium Account service that provide a set of useful additional features to exploit for a targeted attack (e.g. Function, Seniority Level, and Company Size). Consider also that \u201cpremium\u201d scammers could also contact any LinkedIn member and search across a greater number of profiles \u2026 Very very cool!\n\nThe Websense post highlights are:\n\nThe popular social networking could be used also to serve malware, inducing the users to visit a compromised website, or to realize more or less complex scam.\n\nThe technique adopted by malicious actors is quite simple, attackers repeatedly view the victim profile, every LinkedIn user can see the most recent 5 users who have viewed their profile and it is very simple, so take advantage of human curiosity.\n\n\n\nVictims often visit the profile of the person interested to them, in the above image the scammer has a set up a profile under the guise of \u201cJessica Reinsch\u201d that reads as a link to a dating website geographically located in Switzerland and hosted on IP 82<dot>220<dot>34<dot>47.\n\n\n\nDespite in the specific case the dating site is used merely as a lure, an alternative use could be to use is to serve a malicious exploit.\n\nWebsense remarked that at the time of writing no malicious code was deployed on the website, but other domains on that same IP have been known to host suspicious code such as black hat SEO.\n\n\u201cWe also see that IPs used to host the dating site are hosted within the same Autonomous System Number (ASN) as multiple Exploit Kit Command and Control URLs, including RedKit and Neutrino exploit kits.\u201d\n\nThis profile examined by security experts at Websense is likely to have been set up to gain connections and harvest intelligence, as I explained in the first part of this post, LinkedIn provides all the necessary information to arrange a targeted attack (e.g. spear phishing, watering hole).\n\nDuring the RSA Europe security conference in Amsterdam last week, the cyberdefense specialist Aamir Lakhani, who works as a solutions architect at IT services provider World Wide Technology, made an interesting presentation on the abuse of LinkedIn network to launch an attack. He described an experiment that showed the effectiveness of using fake profiles on popular social network like LinkedIn and Facebook, the attack was part of a sanctioned penetration test performed in 2012.\n\nSecurity experts used the profiles pretending to represent an attractive young woman to penetrate the defenses of a U.S. Government agency as part of an exercise that shows how effective social engineering attacks even against sophisticated organizations.\n\nThe attacker captured the attention of internal personnel via social media and the real attack started after victims opened a malicious birthday card link that compromised the target systems.\n\n\u201cThis guy had access to everything. He had the crown jewels in the system,\u201d  The whole social media deception project involving Emily Williams lasted three months, but the penetration testing team reached its goals within one week. \u201cAfter that we just kept the project going for research purposes to see how far we can go,\u201d \n\n\u201cAfter we performed this successful attack we got requests from other companies that wanted to try the same thing,\u201d Lakhani said. \u201cSo we also did the same type of penetration test for very large financial institutions like banks and credit card companies, healthcare organizations and other firms, and the results were almost exactly the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time we include social engineering in our penetration tests we have a hundred percent success rate,\u201d\u201dEvery time we do social engineering, we get into the systems.\u201d Lakhani said.\n\nThe lesson is beware of principal cyber threats related to social media abuse and limit to the necessary your media exposure.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Social media, LinkedIn)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linkedin", "topic_name": "LinkedIn"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network-poisoning", "topic_name": "social network poisoning"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/targeted-attacks", "topic_name": "targeted attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/watering-hole", "topic_name": "watering hole"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous OpNSA Campaign \u2013 OSINT to predict DDoS attacks on Nov 5th", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/19322/cyber-crime/web-intelligence-opnsa.html", "title": "Anonymous OpNSA Campaign \u2013 OSINT to predict DDoS attacks on Nov 5th\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 1, 2013", "body": " \n\nWeb Intelligence analysis alerts on early signs of an Anonymous cyber campaign dubbed OpNSA that as usual will address with DDoS attack principal US Government websites. Security experts don\u2019t exclude the possibility that the group will also target subcontractors to gather information for successive attacks within OpNSA campaign.\n\nLast September members of Anonymous hacktivist group collective, known as Anons, targeted US lawmakers who have financial collusion to intelligence contractors in their latest campaign. Different from any other Anonymous operations, OpNSA does not involve hacking, instead the operation aims to bring attention on collusion between US senators and private contractors, whom Anons allege enabled privacy violations as part of National Security Agency surveillance program.\n\nThe names of contractors include Booz Allen Hamilton, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and many others.\n\nAnonymous promoted the physical participation to the manifestations organized in the streets:\n\n\u201cUnder the cover of darkness, you are invisible. Take to the streets in the dead of night and erect over 9,000 posters, banners, flags, anything to show your support for Anonymous, OpNSA, Wikileaks, Edward Snowden, Bradley Manning, or any related campaigns. Also show your contempt for the PRISM program, the FBI and any other high profile opponents of the idea represented by Anonymous. The goal is public awareness! Post as many flyers from the sources listed as you wish. **REMEMBER** Use paste instead of tape. Use the cover of darkness. Be SAFE. Have some fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe encourage the production of videos and the taking of pictures (not to be taken on smart phones, preferably, due to their traceability) showing participation in this operation. **Keep your faces covered** Remember, this is a peaceful protest. Obey all laws, do not destroy any property, and do not do anything that could give law enforcement a reason to arrest you. Comply with their demands and be sure to give citizens a positive image of anonymous. If possible, answer people\u2019s questions in a polite fashion. Distribute propaganda whenever possible. Public awareness of the NSA\u2019s domestic spy programs begins with YOU. The right of free citizens to maintain their privacy is INVIOLABLE. PRISM companies, defense contractors, and federal agencies have gone out of their way to invade that privacy, and Anonymous is not pleased.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe NSA\u2019s website was down for 11 hours on Friday October 22th , officially for problem occurred during a routine website update but not everybody believes in this motivation hyphotizing a cyber attack of hacktivists that protested against NSA surveillance activities.\n\nI\u2019ve found an interesting post on the use of Web Intelligence to detect early signs of OpNSA cyber campaign that allows the researchers to predict the evolution of the operation. The analysts using the web intelligence platform Recorded Future demonstrates that members of Anonymous were promoting the physical protests prior to Saturday 26th, this allowed them to raise an alert on October 11th. Previous researches have put in close relationship the public protests with an escalation of events in the cyberspace.\n\nThe dates of October 26 and November 5 have been visible in the following graph and you have to consider that the demonstration that saw the participation in thousands protest in DC on October 26th was known for weeks in advance.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe above timeline shows the increase of media activities (e.g. Tweets forewarning protests) before the cyber attacks against the NSA occurred  in this past weekend. In the graph is evident another peak planned for November 5th that could be considered as a possiblen date for the next attack of Anonymous.\n\nThe OSINT analysis made possible to discover a growing number of tweets from over the weekend using the hashtags #OpNSA and #OpPRISM, a social media campaign to recruit volunteers in DDoS attacks against the agency on November 5th.\n\n\u201cWhether Friday\u2019s incident was truly an internal error or actually a successful hack, more disruption is on the way.\u201d\n\nLet me also conclude with a reflection \u2026 State-sponsored hackers use the same techniques to analyze the targets and to discover the profitable moment to conduct an attack being anonymous. A rise of hacktivist campaigns is a privileged moment to conduct covert cyber operations for both sabotage and cyber espionage.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Anonymous, OpNSA)\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opnsa", "topic_name": "OpNSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "I don\u2019t like \u2013 Facebook Clickjacking and track screen cursors", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/19298/cyber-crime/facebook-clickjacking-will-like.html", "title": "I don\u2019t like \u2013 Facebook Clickjacking and track screen cursors\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 1, 2013", "body": "The social media are money machines, the interest of private companies, governments and cybercrime are increasing exponentially.

Recently at the Hack In The Box conference in Kuala Lumpur, security experts Jonathan Werrett and Keith Lee from SpiderLabs demonstrated how to conduct a powerful OSINT analysis using a simple tool they created, anyone using it could find a comprehensive amount of data on any user of the popular social network.\n\nThe tool for information gathering on Facebook created by the researchers is named FBStalker, a name that give us the idea of the potential of the instrument. FBStalker reverse-engineers the Facebook Graph to find information on every user, the tool does not require a direct friendship with targeted profiles, it just needs to access to parts of victim\u2019s posts marked as public.\n\nThrough the use of Graph Search data mining activities has become very easy, Graph Search mines Facebook\u2019s vast user data returning personalized results from natural-language queries. Using it is possible to discover what individuals like, where people have visited and if they share those same preferences with their friends.\n\nGraph Search immediately prompted warnings from security experts, who said its powerful data aggregation abilities could make people uncomfortable even though the exposed data is public.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe potentialities of FBStalker are impressive, let\u2019s think for example to use it in a reconnaissance phase of a targeted social engineering attack. FBStalker is an excellent tool for penetration testers as well as hackers that need to collect information for spear-phishing attacks.\n\nThe FBStalker tool is able to find any reference on the subject of interest on photos he has been tagged in, the comments he has put on other people\u2019s posts, the things that he likes and so on.\n\nThe repercussions are clear, to be trackable by FBStalker it is enough that a friend or someone else has tagged the user in a photo, he exploits the fact that the majority of users has an open friends list and this circumstance enlarge the radius of action of the instrument. Clearly analyzing the mutual interaction within the Facebook network the FBStalker is able to discover the \u201ckey persons\u201d for any individual and to use this information to conduct its searches.\n\nFBStalker is also able to discover useful information on the user\u2019s online experience , it allows to analyze the time spent on Facebook by individuals identifying the sleep patterns and active hours.\n\nBut FBStalker exploits other tricks for its investigations for example many users don\u2019t use the Check-In function making possible to determine their favorite places to hang-out based on the tagged photos and posts from their friends.\n\nIt is questionable whether a tool like FBStalker is legal:\n\n\u201cThe tool is basically automating what the user can do in the browser. We\u2019re not using any APIs or unofficial ways of interacting with the interface. We\u2019re using Graph Search to build-up this profile.\u201d argued Jonathan Werrett.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically not feasible for a human to go to the depths that FBStalker script does,\u201d he added.\n\nOf course the condition to obtain maximum yield from the use of FBStalker is that person of interest and his friends haven\u2019t locked down their profiles, it is enough to extract data from a few of them to retrieve useful information.  Consider for example that even if the user\u2019s account is locked down, he can\u2019t make his profile picture as private, it is enough to change it and people like the picture to allow to the attacker to start building a view of his friends list.\n\nFollowing simple practices to protect your privacy:\n\nThe real problem is that Facebook, and similar social networking platforms, grow at a fast pace making hard to keep private user\u2019s data despite the great effort of the companies. These platforms are born to allow socialization and provide continuous improvement to facilitate it, let\u2019s think of the last features proposed by Facebook that make every user discoverable by name.\n\nThe introduction of new features will have as a side effect a growing exposition of our data online.\n\nI close the post with a meaningful observation of the authors:\n\n\u201cNo one is going to turn back the tide of people posting things to Facebook that potentially could be valuable in somebody else\u2019s hands,\u201d  \u201cIf you want to walk away with a lesson, the lesson is that even if you\u2019re protecting yourself, what other people are doing with your information, your friendships, your comments and things like that can still be leaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe people will think twice before commenting on someone\u2019s drunken photos,\u201d Werrett said.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  FBStalker,  Facebook)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbstalker", "topic_name": "FBStalker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/graph-search", "topic_name": "Graph Search"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networking", "topic_name": "social networking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing-attacks", "topic_name": "spear-phishing attacks"}]}, {"news_name": "Cybercrime abuses Facebook paid advertisements", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/17440/cyber-crime/cybercrime-abuses-facebook-paid-advertisements.html", "title": "Cybercrime abuses Facebook paid advertisements\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 1, 2013", "body": "In the last weeks I presented on an interesting study of the techniques adopted by the cybercriminals organizations to abuse of the popular social network Facebook. The researchers Frank Angiolelli, Eric Feinberg, Ian Malloy issued a follow up on the analysis they presented titled \u201cFacebook Paid Advertisements to Defraud\u201c, it is an interesting study that analyze with you in this post.\n\nFacebook, and any other social media platforms, offer a multitude of opportunity for cybercrime that could exploit the numerous services they provide, in particular the study evaluate how organized cybercriminals are leveraging Facebook\u2019s Paid \u201cSponsor Ads\u201d system to deliver nefarious websites to the user of the social network.\n\n\u201cThese cybercriminals are paying Facebook to obtain sponsored advertisement space which is presented to the user without request or choice\u201c\n\nThe investigation revealed that coordinated groups using multiple brand names in a mass distribution system affecting the entire ecosystem.\n\n\n\nIt has been estimated that every single user was presented with as many as 20 unique fraud advertisements in an 8 hour period on Facebook, as well as multiple repeat fraud websites. The Facebook frauds are managed through masses of redirector sites owned by ascribable groups employing varying evasive techniques to redirect users to their fraudulent content.\n\n\u201cThe payment methods being employed by these websites are tied to numerous reports of fraud.Users who are tricked by a Paid Sponsored Advertisement send their money to nefarious groups with no recourse. There are two primary types of advertisements, a \u201croot\u201d website and a \u201czombie redirector\u201d which equates to a farm of websites that can be submitted to Facebook. The root nefarious websites holds the actual content being delivered to the user.\u201d\n\nThe researchers collected evidence that many fraudulent activities are attributable to Chinese actors that anyway adopted different techniques for bot management. Most of the content delivery sources are Chinese CDN networks\n\n\n\nOne of the most interesting aspect of the research is the system developed by cyber security expert Frank Angiolelli, that was able to automatically identify fraudulent content among  a mass of legitimate sites while tracking correlation data.\n\nThe team of researchers identified a body of 225 individual counterfeit paid advertisements in an increasing exponential frequency curve commiserate with the resources assigned during a three week period.\n\n\u201cThe result is that in mere seconds, 95%+ fraudulent sites were identified while tracking and trending the hosting, registrars and software origins. False positives on legitimate websites during the study period started at >0.9% and decreased exponentially as the data set expanded. Only 2% of the nefarious websites seen in this study had been seized, and the pattern of replication we uncovered proves that advanced methods employed by this team are successful countermeasures to address this problem. \u201d states the report.\n\nThe most popular registrar found during the investigation is \u201cGodaddy\u201d, which is primarily used to register pseudo-random Zombie Redirector sites. Outside of Godaddy, the remainders are mostly Chinese technology companies, with some notable exceptions. Cybercriminals are using mainly US hosting companies to deliver their fraudulent content.\n\n\n\nThe criminal conduct evidenced in the report will fall directly to the intellectual property owners, but also the same social network Facebook will lose in reputation, in the short term damage the information collected by the researchers portend a concerning increase for fraudulent advertisements. The phenomena are not interested only to Facebook, once deployed proper countermeasures fraudsters will abandon the popular social network for another vector.\n\nRead the report for further information on Facebook paid advertisements.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Facebook paid advertisements, Facebook, social network)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook-paid-advertisements", "topic_name": "Facebook paid advertisements"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/frauds", "topic_name": "frauds"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "Cybercriminals Leveraging Facebook Report", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/16185/cyber-crime/cybercriminals-leveraging-facebook-report.html", "title": "Cybercriminals Leveraging Facebook Report\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 14, 2013", "body": " \n\nThe Posts for Counterfeit Merchandise \u2013 Once the account is created, it joins hundreds of groups and posts ads.

The notice, that seems to be authentic, dedicates a paragraph to the use of  social networking sites for computer network exploitation.\n\nAccording the notice foreign governments regularly use social networks to conduct cyber attacks against DoD, attackers adopt social engineering techniques to gather sensitive information creating  \u201csignificant operations security (OPSEC) concern\u201d.\n\nThe impact is serious, leak of knowledge of the cyber threats could cause mission degradation or even loss of life, but great concern is also reserved to the possibility of use of social network platforms to inoculate malware in US AF networks.\n\n\u201cThe nature of social networking sites (SNS) which promote socialization and the sharing of information makes personnel more susceptible to exploitation\u201d reports the notice.\n\n\n\nThe notice and with special recommendations to all Air Force members related to the use of social networks, informing on the risks related to cyber espionage conducted by state sponsored hackers:\n\n\u201cFinally, be aware of the security settings on these websites and do not inadvertently release sensitive information to the public because of careless use.\u201d\n\nFollowing the integral notice:\n\nNotice to Airman 2013-080-001:\n\n(U//FOUO) EXECUTIVE SUMMERY: Nation-state adversaries regularly use accounts on popular social networking sites to facilitate social engineering against DoD members. Information disclosed or discovered on social networking sites creates a significant operations security (OPSEC) concern and in the context of a wide spread collection effort could be by adversaries to form a classified picture.\n\n(U//FOUO) MISSION IMPACT: Poor OPSEC practices or general disclosures of sensitive information can lead to kinetic adversary responses to U.S. forces\u2019 actions, potentially leading to mission degradation or even loss of life. Additionally, malware introduced into AF networks via social network sites can degrade or disrupt operations.\n\n(U//FOUO) DETAILS: The nature of social networking sites (SNS) which promote socialization and the sharing of information makes personnel more susceptible to exploitation. SNS applications give the common user an increased opportunity to release official information. In the past two years, there are several examples of adversaries using or attempting to use SNS for likely cyber espionage.\n\n(U//FOUO) ACTIONS: All Air Force members must be aware that they are a potential target of cyber exploitation/espionage and take appropriate caution when using social networking sites. Do not accept contact requests from individuals who you do not personally know and trust. Additionally, hackers are known to spoof requests so that any request may appear to be from someone you know, so treat all requests with suspicion and vigilance. Only accept a request if there is a high level of certainty regarding the identity and authenticity of the requestor.

The study confirmed the growth of cyber threats able to elude traditional defense mechanisms and that mainly targeted mobile platforms and social media.\n\nInternet is confirmed as primary vector for cyber menaces, web threats have increased significantly respect 2012, both as an attack vector and as the primary support element of other attack trajectories (e.g., social, mobile, email).\n\nNumber of malicious web sites grew nearly 600% and 85% are represented by legitimate web hosts that had been compromised by attackers, it is interesting to note that growth was on global scale registering a peck in North America.\n\n\n\nThe attackers mainly targeted legitimate websites belonging to following  categories:\n\nLast year cyber offensive mainly targeted businesses and governments organizations, about 70 % of Websense customers experienced a weekly average of 1,719 attacks per 1,000 users, the attacks initiated through social media, mobile devices, email and other attack vectors.\n\nAs anticipated Social Media represent a privileged channel for cyber threat due the large audience, shortened web links in 32 percent of the time hid malicious content, majority of cyber attacks also took advantage of the confusion related to the introduction new features and changing services.\n\nHigh concern is related to the use of social media in the workspace that could expose company information and sensible data managed by employees.\n\nMobile Threats are considered one of principal concerns for security experts , rapid diffusion of malicious apps and wrong habits of users (e.g. jailbreaking and absence of defense systems) expose them to serious risks.\n\nThe report states:\n\n\u201cLegitimate apps were also a cause for concern; many proved less secure than expected. Consider a study by Philipps University and Leibniz University in Germany involving 13,500 free apps downloaded from Google Play. Researchers found that 8 percent of these apps were vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, and approximately 40 percent enabled the researchers to \u201ccapture credentials for American Express, Diners Club, Paypal, bank accounts, Facebook,Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft Live ID, Box, WordPress, remote control servers, arbitrary email accounts, and IBM Sametime, among others.\u201d\u201d\n\nWebSense reported that malicious apps mainly need three permission requirements that are worth pointing out:\n\n \n\nAnother privileged vector for cyber attacks is the Email, only 20% emails sent was legitimate, phishing messages and spam are monopolizing to totality of email traffic.\n\nEmail represented an essential component for success of a cyber attacks, it is used to infect victims carrying a malware or proposing infected link to compromised web site.  Attacks such as Flame, Stuxnet and recent Red October were advantaged by highly targeted spear-phishing messages sent to circumscribed group of individuals.\n\nEmail-based threats are becoming significantly sophisticated, they are able to circumvent traditional defense, the report refers to the introduction of \u201ctime-delay\u201d to some targeted attacks, \u201cin which embedded web links are kept benign until after traditional email security defenses are bypassed\u201d.\n\n \n\n \n\nPrincipal Categories of Malicious Web Links in Spam Email found by WebSense are:\n\nMalware could not miss in the list of the main threats,  also in this case sophisticated malicious code have been designed to hit specific targets and platforms circumventing defense countermeasures.\n\nReport key finding are:\n\nFrom the analysis of CnC Communication Protocol emerged that HTTP is most used protocol, however Social media and other popular websites are increasingly use HTTPS to encrypt traffic between their services and their customers, this eventuality allows the \u201csafe passage\u201d of malicious code complicating detection activities.\n\n\u201cThe type of CnC communications represented in the table happen only after infection. To avoid detection, such communications are typically short and contain no obviously malicious content. When something significant needs to be transmitted, such as a malware update or stolen data, these communications often use simple but proven data encryption,then send it through HTTP or another channel.\u201d\n\nIn the last part of the report is reported the incidence of data Theft/Data loss incidents that mainly target to gather access to intellectual property (IP), payments credentials, credit card numbers and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII). To reach the scope the principal methods of attacks are malware and hacking techniques.\n\nThe cyber threat landscape proposed by WebSense describes a reality in constant growth, cyber menaces are increasing in numbers and sophistication level targeting mainly new platforms such as social media and mobile.\n\n\u201cSolutions that focus solely on mobile, email, web or otherwise can no longer be trusted to defend against complex, multistage attacks that can move between attack vectors.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 WebSense)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/2013", "topic_name": "2013"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/email", "topic_name": "email"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-middle", "topic_name": "man-in-the-middle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/red-october", "topic_name": "Red October"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/websense", "topic_name": "WebSense"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook compromised by zero-day Java exploit", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12400/cyber-crime/facebook-compromised-by-zero-day-java-exploit.html", "title": "Facebook compromised by zero-day Java exploit\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 16, 2013", "body": "In this last months we have registered numerous clamorous attacks against intelligence agencies, government offices, media and social networking platforms. Twitter was last victim in order of time but the thought of security experts was focuses of Facebook, the biggest social networking with more than 1 billion members, a mine of information related to the widest audience of users. Facebook is a single application that manages an impressive number of information of data and so it represents a privileged target for attackers.\n\nFacebook company revealed on Friday that it has been hit in January by an unidentified group of hackers, fortunately no user information was compromised during the attack.\n\nWhat is really interesting is the level of sophistication of the malware based attack that eluded security defense, it compromised the developer\u2019s website and infected the employees machine when visited it.\n\nThe laptops infected were fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software occurrence that suggests attacker have exploited zero day vulnerabilities hosting an exploit on the web site.\n\nThe official statements reports:\n\n\u201cFacebook, like every significant internet service, is frequently targeted by those who want to disrupt or access our data and infrastructure. As such, we invest heavily in preventing, detecting, and responding to threats that target our infrastructure, and we never stop working to protect the people who use our service. The vast majority of the time, we are successful in preventing harm before it happens, and our security team works to quickly and effectively investigate and stop abuse.\n\nLast month, Facebook Security discovered that our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack. This attack occurred when a handful of employees visited a mobile developer website that was compromised. The compromised website hosted an exploit which then allowed malware to be installed on these employee laptops. The laptops were fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software. As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law enforcement, and began a significant investigation that continues to this day.\u201d\n\nFacebook advisory confirmed that security teams of the company are very active in the fight to cyber threats thanks to an intense collaboration with law enforcement and security teams of other companies. The attacks seems to have exploited a zero-day Java software vulnerability well before the official announcement provided by Oracle company.\n\n\u201cAfter analyzing the compromised website where the attack originated, we found it was using a \u201czero-day\u201d (previously unseen) exploit to bypass the Java sandbox (built-in protections) to install the malware. We immediately reported the exploit to Oracle, and they confirmed our findings and provided a patch on February 1, 2013, that addresses this vulnerability.\u201d\n\nThe investigation are still ongoing as confirmed by Facebook\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with law enforcement and the other organizations and entities affected by this attack. It is in everyone\u2019s interests for our industry to work together to prevent attacks such as these in the future.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/java", "topic_name": "Java"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/media", "topic_name": "media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networking", "topic_name": "social networking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/twitter", "topic_name": "Twitter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "How PokerAgent botnet has stolen Facebook credentials", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12091/malware/how-pokeragent-botnet-has-stolen-facebook-credentials.html", "title": "How PokerAgent botnet has stolen Facebook credentials\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 31, 2013", "body": "We never tire of repeating, social networks are an ideal conduit, due their large diffusion, for the spread of malware, they are used by cybercrime to realize complex fraud schema and by military to conduct offensive operations or cyber espionage campaigns. ESET Security Research has published an interesting analysis on the \u2018PokerAgent\u2019 botnet detected during 2012 that hit Facebook users stealing log-on credentials and collecting information on credit card details linked to the Facebook account and Zynga Poker player stats.\n\nThe botnet infected computers all around the world, mainly located in Israel stealing over 16194 Facebook credentials.\n\n\u201cOur tracking of the botnet revealed that at least 800 computers have been infected with the Trojan and that theattacker had at least 16194 unique entries in his database of stolen Facebook credentials by March 20, 2012\u201d\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIt adopted a consolidated schema providing a link to the victims would lead to a compromised webpage, the pages featured tabloid topics which a user could be curious to click on. Users are anyway redirected to a fake Facebook login page used to collect user\u2019s credentials.\n\nVery interesting the logic implemented in malware code that uses a funcion dubbed ShouldPublish to determine whether the phishing links should be posted to the user\u2019s wall depending on whether the victim has any credit cards linked to his account and his Zynga Poker ranking.\n\n\n\nThe ESET researchers noted that the malware does not log into or in any way interfere with the Facebook account of the victim, the tasks given to bots are not carried out from the attacker\u2019s computer.\n\nHaving said that, the aforementioned facts lead us to the conclusion that the purpose of the botnet is to:\n\nProbably attacker are interested to collect credit card information ro successively sell the database to other criminals.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe \u2018PokerAgent\u2019 isn\u2019t the unique malware-based attack that exploits social media, to avoid to be victim of similar fraud it is suggested to use updated defense system and to take proper conduct in the use of social networks.\nFortunately principal social media platform are implementing a series of countermeasure to mitigate cyber threats such as two-factor authentication to prevent the infected bots from logging into the victim Facebook accounts.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/eset", "topic_name": "Eset"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pokeragent", "topic_name": "PokerAgent"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}]}, {"news_name": "The Facebook engagement in the fight against botnets with FBI", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11061/social-networks/the-facebook-engagement-in-the-fight-against-botnets-with-fbi.html", "title": "The Facebook engagement in the fight against botnets with FBI\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 14, 2012", "body": "Social networks are platforms that have monopolized majority of user\u2019s internet experience, the imperative is to \u201csocial\u201d, and everybody share an incredible amount of personal information exposing its digital identity to serious risks.\n\nAn element of attraction for cyber criminals is the huge number of services, from gaming to payments, that are developing on these platforms that could be exploited to realize more or less complex fraud schemas.\n\nSocial media platforms are very attractive also for governments and intelligence agencies that are adopting them to conduct OSINT researches, cyber espionage and to influence public sentiment of particular thematic, also law enforcement are demonstrating a great interest on new social tools. Corps such as FBI are developing a new generation of tools to conduct its investigations, recently the U.S. Department of Justice announced the arrest of 10 individuals suspected to have created a botnet that infected more than 11 million of pc all over the world causing financial loss of  more than USD 850 millions.\n\nThe suspected are accused to have actively participated to the realization of one of the most profitable cybercrime in the modern history, they are from different countries and continents such as US, United Kingdom, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, New Zealand, Peru.\n\nThe story is dated 2008, when the dangerous botnet Butterfly, also known as Mariposa, was discovered after infected 12 million machines worldwide, in 2009 it was decapitated. As usual, the botnet was designed for different purposes, the criminals used , and also rented, illegal services such as spamming and phishing services, denial of service attacks, and sensible information. The bot agents were able to alter also user\u2019s search results inside browser showing advertisements and pop-up ads, hijacking victims navigation.\n\nThe criminals used file-sharing and instant messaging platforms to spread the malicious code known as Yahos that stolen financial information from over 800,000 victims. The virus was active for years, it uses social networks and instant messaging platforms, such as AIM and Yahoo! Messenger, to send \u201cinfected links\u201d to the victims that once link on it allow the downloading of botnet exploits.\n\nFBI press release states:\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s security team provided assistance to law enforcement throughout the investigation by helping to identify the root cause, the perpetrators, and those affected by the malware. Yahos targeted Facebook users from 2010 to October 2012, and security systems were able to detect affected accounts and provide tools to remove these threats.\u201d\n\nNo news has been provided regarding the support of Facebook\u2019s security team to law enforcement but it must be considered that it\u2019s not first time that the experts are involved in investigation of this type.\n\nSocial network platforms are privileged targets for cybercrime that in a recent past have spread malware through the popular Facebook. Koobface virus is undoubtedly considered as the malware of social network because it was one of the first to use them as vehicle of infection.\n\nKoobface unlike other malware propagated through social networking using an \u201cactive approach to its spread,\u201d infecting each host and then propagate into the network, regardless of user awareness that in some cases deliberately share content with friends.\n\nThe most common infection method is through via fake content on compromised web site. It is sufficient to click on one of the links which Koobface has posted on this web site. Usually this links attract user proposing the download of cool video or applications, unfortunately behind this links is hidden an installer for the Koobface virus. The good news is that usually this type of malware are identified with little difficulty by leading antivirus on the market.\n\nEarly 2012 another virus has hit Facebook, it was named Ramnit and it has stolen usernames and passwords of more than 45,000 users mainly from France and the UK, according to a bulletin issued by security researchers at Seculert.\n\n\n\nAnyway to prevent the spread of malicious agent it is fundamental that users adopt a proper behavior and use updated security defense systems as suggested by the FBI\u2019s release.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/denial-of-service-attacks", "topic_name": "denial-of-service attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fraud-schemas", "topic_name": "fraud schemas"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/koobface", "topic_name": "Koobface"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ramnit", "topic_name": "Ramnit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahos", "topic_name": "Yahos"}]}, {"news_name": "Trend Micro Q3 security report", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9672/cyber-crime/trend-micro-q3-security-report.html", "title": "Trend Micro Q3 security report\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 24, 2012", "body": "Trend Micro has released the report \u201c3Q 2012 SECURITY ROUNDUP -Android Under Siege: Popularity Comes at a Price\u201d that presents a worrying trend for malware growth increased of 483%. The increment include cyber espionage malware and also destructive malicious agents targeting mainly the mobile world and in particular Google Android platform.\n\nMalware targeting Android platform increased from around 30,000 malicious apps in June to almost 175,000 between July and September.\n\n\n\nThe reports highlights the risks for user\u2019s privacy, it states:\n\n\u201cThough most adware are designed to collect user information, a fine line exists between collecting data for simple advertising and violating one\u2019s privacy. Because they normally collect user information for legitimate purposes, they can serve as an effective means to gather more data than some would want to give out\u201d\n\nThe report alerts on the diffusion of aggressive adware and also of malware developed with the specific intent to gather information without consent of mobile users. Mobile devices has suffered more cybercriminal attacks and the lack of awareness on cyber threat is the main reason of the success of these agents. In many cases mobile adware is considerable as business model to pay app development offered for free but TrendMicro also identified several apps that expose user\u2019s data such as call history and locations.\n\n\u201cThe fact that only 20 percent of Android device owners use a security app does not help.\u201d\n\nDavid Sancho, senior threat researcher declared:\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day\u2026 all mobile apps are essentially web clients; therefore, they are as unsecure as a browser and that\u2019s how you should treat them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFake versions of legitimate Android apps are the most prevalent type of Android malware. This quarter, data stealers like Solar Charge and premium service abusers like Live Wallpapers in China or fake versions of best-selling apps that spread in Russia further raised concerns about the open nature of the Android ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAnother potential cyber threat is related by ad networks that provide in-app libraries for developers that intend to create a new application, it has been demonstrated that these libraries collect more data than developers declare and fail to alert users.\n\n\u201cApp developers can either choose to closely examine ad libraries and ask their ad network to modify their code or rely on another ad network. We believe that the value of information stolen from users far outweighs the cost of due diligence on the side of developers and the ad networks that support them,\u201d\n\nOnce again one of the principal cyber threats is represented by zero-day exploits, impossible to detect that benefit of the latency in patch management and of the lack discipline of users. These exploits expose to high risks organizations and private businesses, in 2011 the total number of critical vulnerabilities was of 1,822.\n\nThe following graph demonstrates that Apple is the vendor that disclosed the major number of vulnerabilities but the figure doesn\u2019t consider the related level of severity.\n\n \n\n\n\nTrendMicro revealed, such as other security firms, the increased level of complexity of cyber threats that demonstrate the evolution of capabilities of the cybercrime.\n\nTop three malware in the last quarter are :\n\nDuring last quarter it has been observed a meaningful increase in ZeroAccess malware, that is reached first place in rankings with more than 900,000 detections.\nWorrying is also the increased diffusion of Blackhole Exploit Kit that are defined in the report as \u201cweb pages designed to try and exploit several vulnerabilities on a visitor\u2019s computer. Once any of the exploits runs, the page serves up the end payload, usually a malware\u201d\n\nThe report mentions also the cyber threat related to hacking activities against organization and private companies that exposes to serious risk of disclosure highly sensitive data. Of particular interest the data related to APT attacks, a singular aspect of the offensives is their adaptation for mobile platform such as Android OSs.\n\n\n\nMost APT campaigns target organizations in the corporate/government sector because these handle more sensitive data than any other kind of organization.\n\nThe report is closed with a dutiful reference to social networks and improper use of majority of internet users, we can consider them a mine for cyber criminals and hackers.\n\nBillions of people daily use social media platform without configure in the proper way their privacy settings.\n\nThe reports states:\n\n\u201cWe found that only 50% of Facebook users check their privacy settings every 2\u20133 months. They aren\u2019t likely to change their settings that often though. And so survey scams live on because the payoff\u2014getting tons of personal data from users\u2014is something the bad guys can\u2019t pass up on.\u201d\n\nConcluding the report, like many others, reveals the increased number of cyber threats for private and governments sectors, the major concerns are related to mobile platforms and social networks \u2026 that\u2019s the price of popularity, and let me add that is just the beginning!\n\nPierluigi Paganni\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trend-micro", "topic_name": "Trend Micro"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day-exploits", "topic_name": "Zero-Day Exploits"}]}, {"news_name": "The Deep Dark Web Book Released", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9607/cyber-crime/the-deep-dark-web-book-released.html", "title": "The Deep Dark Web Book Released\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 21, 2012", "body": "\n\nAfter much work during the last months I\u2019m proud and happpy to announce the publishing of The Deep Dark Web book.\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @Amazon website  http://www.amazon.com/The-Deep-Dark-Web-hidden/dp/1480177598 PAPER BOOK\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @Amazon website  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B009VN40DU KINDLE\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @SmashWords website  http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/247146\n\nIt is AVAILABLE @Barnes & Noble website    http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-deep-dark-web-pierluigi-paganini/1113594408?ean=2940015852837\n\nand we have uploaded it also to Amazon kindle, it should be searchable within 24-36 hours and everyone can rush in and purchase one.\n\nWriting the book was an adventure, a pleasure that I shared with my friend and co-author Richard Amores, a true expert in the field.\n\nThese months have been hard, they were months of study and research, of satisfaction and disappointment \u2026. it was exciting as the contents of the book that we have tried to share with you.

We the people of the free world control this network of Tor -Onion Routers by volunteer around the world.\n\nThe Deep Dark Web seems to be full of crooks and cyber criminals, it is the hacker\u2019s paradise, where there are no rule, no law, no identity in what is considered the reign of anonymity, but this is also the reason why many persecuted find refuge and have the opportunity to shout to the world their inconvenient truths.\n\nThe Deep Dark Web is a crowded space with no references but in reality it is a mine of information unimaginable, a labyrinth of knowledge in the book we will try to take you by the hand to avoid the traps and pitfalls hopefully illuminating your path in the dark.\n\nCybercrime, hacktivism, intelligence, cyber warfare are all pieces of this complex puzzle in which we will try to make order, don\u2019t forget that the Deep Dark Web has unbelievable opportunity for business and governments, it represents the largest on-line market where it is possible to sell and acquire everything, and dear reader where there is $money$ you will find also banking, financial speculators and many other sharks.\n\nDo you believe that making money in Deep Web is just a criminal prerogative? Wrong, the authors show you how things works in the hidden economy and which are the future perspectives of is digital currency, the Bitcoin.\n\nThis manuscript proposes both faces of the subject, it illustrates the risks but also legitimate use of anonymizing networks such as TOR adopted by journalist to send file reports before governments agents censored his work .\n\nHere are some question we may answers to:\n\nHow many person know about the cyber criminals and their ecosystem in the deep web? \nHow many have provided information on the financial systems behind the \u201cdirty affairs\u201d? \nHow the law enforcement and governments use Dark Web?\n\nLet\u2019s hold your breath and start the trip in the abyss of knowledge to find answers to the above questions. We hope that with this book you can learn something new about \u2013 The Deep Dark Web.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}]}, {"news_name": "What is the Dorkbot worm that is attacking Skype\u2019s users?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9355/cyber-crime/what-is-the-dorkbot-worm-that-is-attacking-skypes-users.html", "title": "What is the Dorkbot worm that is attacking Skype\u2019s users?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 11, 2012", "body": "What could happen if a malware compromises a communication system adopted daily by 663 million users (info dated September 2011)? Security experts have spread an alert to Skype users about an ongoing attack that try to induce them to load a link that spreads malware.\n\nThe famous voice-over-Internet application is totally changed from its original version created in 2003 by Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m and Janus Friis, it has been considered a \u201ctap-proof\u201d channel for years, easy and efficient it is become an indispensable tool of work, and not only, for millions of users all over the world. It has been owned by Microsoft since 2011, and many experts believe that the original architecture is a distant memory, today the powerful application is a commercial communication platform managed by an enterprise too close to the interests of some governments \u2026 but this is another history. It\u2019s clear that a so diffused tool is subject of interest for many group of hackers, cyber criminals and state-sponsored specialists, interested to exploit the application to compromise the security of a wide community.\n\nSecurity firm Trend Micro was the first to alert Skype community on an attack that has infected users spamming their contact lists with messages in both English and German. sending a message like:\n\n\u201clol is this your new profile pic? h__p://goo.gl/{BLOCKED}5q1sx?img=username\u201d\n\nor\n\n\u201cmoin, kaum zu glauben was f\u00fcr sch\u00f6ne fotos von dir auf deinem profil h__p://goo.gl/{BLOCKED}5q1sx?img=username\u201d\n\n\n\nThe URL sent in the message redirects the user to hotfile.com to download an archive named \u201cSkype_todaysdate.zip\u201d containing a namesake executable file.\n\nRik Ferguson, director of security research and communication at Trend Micro, in a blog post explained:\n\n \u201cThe executable installs a variant of the Dorkbot worm, detected as WORM_DORKBOT.IF or WORM_DORKBOT.DN respectively. On installation, this worm may initiate large scale click-fraud activity on each compromised machine, recruiting it into a botnet.\n\nThese Dorkbot variants will also steal user name and password credentials for a vast array of websites including Facebook, Twitter, Google, PayPal, NetFlix and many others. They can interfere in DNS resolution, insert iFrames into web pages, perform three different kinds of DDoS attack, act as a Proxy server and download and install further malware at the botmaster\u2019s initiation. \u201c\n\nThe malware is completed, it has a large number of features that make very versatile the malicious code, it is able to spy on victims and to transform them in offensive agents to use in a DDoS attack. The agent appears really dangerous, it is able to infect victims transforming them in a bot and it is able to install also a ransomware that throws out the user requesting $200 in 48 hours to avoid the file destruction.\n\nThe malware opens a backdoor to allow a remote control of the attacker communicating with a remote server via HTTP. According to Sophos post on execution the malware copies itself to\n\nDorkbot malware is not new, last year it have been detected several variants spread via common social network platforms such as Facebook or via USB sticks and various instant messaging protocols.\n\nSkype is an excellent vector to spread a malware due its large diffusion especially in workplaces, the machines in this kind of environment are privileged targets because they could be used for cyber espionage and for botnet composition during times not working.\n\nIs it Skype company informed?\n\nYes, the company has releases an official communication to Sophos Naked Security web site asking it to publish the following statement:\n\n\u201cSkype takes the user experience very seriously, particularly when it comes to security. We are aware of this malicious activity and are working quickly to mitigate its impact. We strongly recommend upgrading to the newest Skype version and applying updated security features on your computer. Additionally, following links \u2013 even when from your contacts \u2013 that look strange or are unexpected is not advisable.\u201d\n\n \n\nMany colleagues asked me an opinion on the malware, even some have speculated on the possible state-sponsored origin. We are dealing with a clear example of malware used by cyber criminals in the implementation of fraud, so it appears. Analyzing the functionalities of the malware I think it might be a product obtained through subsequent developments from on the original Dorkbot. Is not uncommon to read news of on demand-developments in a model defined as \u201cmalware-as-service\u201d , including, for example the possibility to improve infection capabilities as happened for the Zeus malware.\n\nThe malware has for example a ransomware feature, but why ask to the victim 200$ if I can steal his banking account or recruit it in a botnet? In my opinion the malware appears as a general purpose product sold to cybercrime to implements different fraud schemas.\n\nHow to protect ourselves?\n\nAwareness first of all, user has to be careful every time accepts a connection on Skype and in general on every social network platform. We are daily submerged by messages, request of friendship, video and images \u2026. we must be conscious that behind each of them could be hidden a cyber threat. Do not click on link just for curiosity, avoid to open attachments from unknown and every time you note strange communication coming from your trusted sources inform immediately them, they may have been infected. \u2026 And of course keep your defense systems updated!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dorkbot", "topic_name": "Dorkbot"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-as-service", "topic_name": "malware as service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/skype", "topic_name": "Skype"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network-platforms", "topic_name": "social network platforms"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored", "topic_name": "state-sponsored"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zeus", "topic_name": "Zeus"}]}, {"news_name": "Why humans could be the weakest link in cyber security chain?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9076/social-networks/why-humans-could-be-the-weakest-link-in-cyber-security-chain.html", "title": "Why humans could be the weakest link in cyber security chain?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 3, 2012", "body": "Last month I attended the Cyber Threat Summit in Dublin and I had the opportunity to assist to the interesting presentation \u201cHumans The weakest link in cyber security\u201d of Mark Johnson, Chairman, The Risk Management Group.\n\nThe topic of presentation is one of the most interesting in cyber security, the massive introduction of technologies in every environment must take in care of the human factor under the security perspective. In many cases wrong behaviors of users, the failure to comply with security policies and leak of awareness on the cyber threats that could target a systems representing main factors that could expose overall integrity of an IT solution.\n\nThe principal families of security standards such as ISO 27001 reserve great attention to the argument explicitly requiring the involvement of employees in the process of securing the information. It makes no sense to have sophisticated security systems if the security of the infrastructure can potentially be affected by the work of human beings.\n\nUnfortunately in different occasions in enterprise and government environment the security is perceived as a further cost and a burden that complicate ordinary work. Let\u2019s consider how much wide is the attack surface for each user today, mobile, wireless access, cloud computing, social media all conspiring to make life more complicated. The human factor is the underlying reason why many cyber attacks are successful, underestimate the severity of potential cyber threats is one of the most common errors.\n\nDistraction, ignorance, curiosity are just some of the factors that can lead to a high risk behavior in terms of security, for this reason is crucial get to define rules to be followed in situations that expose the user at risk.\n\nThe engage to securely manage all these platforms and technological solutions could induce users to improper behavior exposing his personal information with evident risks, and in some cases the entire IT infrastructure.\n\nAccording the presentation of Johnson the main factors that are highlighting the problem of considering the human being as the weakest link in the safety chain are:\n\nIt is possible to formulate the following laws for ICT Rick\n\nWhat make social media so critical?\n\nAmong the various web services in rapid diffusion the ones that create major concerns are the social media and mobile, as said in a past article also governments are really concerned about the use of these powerful communication platforms and are promoting surveillance projects to control and monitor user\u2019s activities.\n\nBut social media and mobile platforms represents also privileged targets for cybercrime that use them to implement complex fraud schemas.\n\nThe social media are point of aggregation for any kind of information, users have to be educated on the proper use of these services that are attracting an increase number of ill-intentioned.\n\nThanks to Social networks it is easy to identify prime victims within Enterprises and send them a message with a malicious attachment or a link to a compromised web site.\n\nIt has been estimated that there are now over 1,000 social networking sites on the Internet, and Facebook currently being the largest, with over 840 million user profiles. The trend is in constant growth with the born of new thematic platform.\n\nSocial networks can be a virtual goldmine of information and knowledge for those who can potentially harvest it for different purpose..\n\nThe human factor in overall security is determinant, user\u2019s have to manage carefully the exposition of their data on-line, a wrong usage of social networking info could damage the user itself but also other accounts linked to him.\n\nBe social, catch the highest number of friend without controlling them \u2026 that is the imperative and the risks are elevated.\n\nToday we all know that thanks to a metadata hidden in a picture posted on line is possible to localize the user \u2026 it is possible to link him to other persons of interest discovering their habits and their on going activities, in private and corporate life.\n\nThe only way to protect users is to teach them that they are part of a network which security is also related to their behavior. When user accepts friendship on a social platform he must be aware on the risks related to the choice, and unfortunately today it doesn\u2019t happen!\n\nSummarizing the main factors of risk related to social media use are:\n\nObviously, the human factor plays an important role not only in participating in social media, there is a wide range of situations in which the services accessed depending once again on it, following other relevant factors of risk:\n\nHow to prevent most common incidents?\n\nCreate a reliable security model globally recognized by all internet users is utopian but we are obliged to share knowledge on the major risks related to human factor.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSpecial thanks to Mark Johnson, Chairman, The Risk Management Group\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/human-factor", "topic_name": "human factor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/humans", "topic_name": "humans"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Social Networks Part 3 \u2013 Are you exposing yourself unnecessarily to physical threats?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8371/cyber-crime/social-networks-are-you-exposing-yourself-physical-threats.html", "title": "Social Networks Part 3 \u2013 Are you exposing yourself unnecessarily to physical threats?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 3, 2012", "body": "\n\nRon Kelson, Pierluigi Paganini, Fabian Martin, David Pace, Benjamin Gittins\n\nIn our first article we talked about the intentional or unintentional disclosure of personal information in social networks that can expose you to logical (computer-based) threats and we gave you some recommendations about how to properly manage this risk of exposure.\n\nIn this article we will touch on a much more delicate aspect of your online existence. We ask this question:\n\n\u201cCan your public disclosure (of information) in the virtual world expose you to any kind of threats in the real world?\u201d\n\nSocial networks are a way to contact people, to make professional relationships, a means to share your personal or professional life. Sometimes you use blogs as a way to simply record your thoughts, your feelings and your memories. This is fine, but the problem is that most of us are not sufficiently aware of the (default or otherwise) security settings of social network (publication) systems, or of the potential ramifications of exposing specific items of personal information to the world.\n\nFirst of all, lets look at the type of information you are publishing in the virtual world. Are you posting information about your lifestyle: such as trips, cars, the brand new top-of-the-line smartphone you bought last week, your last visit to a Louis Vuitton store? Are you posting information about your family and relatives? Does your job description in LinkedIn describe you as a CEO, CIO, or other position that indicates that you could be earning a lot of money?\n\nOf course at this moment you may be double-guessing what comes next. Maybe you have that uneasy feeling in your stomach, and are thinking:\n\n\u201cOk, here they come again with that paranoid fear thing\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to worry. We will not be paranoid. But we will give you some facts.\n\nIt is not uncommon to find a lot of profiles on the Internet that openly publish/expose a lot of personal information. A recent informal research of 20 hours effort made by a Brazilian hacker team found more than 200 open profiles on the MSN-Network (MSNMessenger, Hotmail\u2026). During that time they collected the following statistics:\n\nThe Brazilian hacker team identified some profiles as belonging to teenagers who openly exposed themselves in provocative, sexy or otherwise alluring photos. Many profiles of teenagers published photos of their parent\u2019s \u201cnew car\u201d, \u201cnew boat\u201d, and so on.\n\nThese results were acquired in just a few hours, so we can only imagine what they could achieve if they allocated more time, or programmed computers to automate the process.\n\nWhen not properly configured, social networks may expose significant information about you, your social behaviour, your relatives, friends and colleagues. Complete strangers can track your last trips, recognise your cars and their number plates, identify the restaurants you go to, and the people that surround you. They may also be able to establish your religious or political beliefs, nationality and other characteristics that may be subject to prejudices. They can identify (profiling) if you take high risks in your personal life (for example, party hard, drink heavily, and so on). Then he/she can take a look at your company, discover your position and figure out your social level and, almost certainly, your income. This could be used to identify you as an attractive partner. However, it can also be used to select you for targeted physical attacks, including theft, stalking, harassment, date rape, extortion, blackmail or kidnappings.\n\nConsider that this threat is not only confined to unwary users, apparently some high-ranking Nato officials have demonstrated interest in using social networks, and this has been exploited by cyber criminals.\n\nA series of articles published since 2007 have studied the question regarding the lack of security promoted by the use of social networks, and the way social networks are financially motivated to expose your private information to others in various ways. Mexican journalist Joaqu\u00edn L\u00f3pez D\u00f3riga has carefully studied how kidnappers exploit social networks as a tool to profile targets, and execute physical attacks. We are not talking about the use of computer malware. We are not talking about the use of targeted phishing attacks. We are talking about the risks arising as a result of employing low privacy settings on social networks, and the consequences that can arise from the indiscreet disclosure and publication of personal information.\n\nIn Third World countries, \u201clightning kidnapping\u201d is very common. The process is as follows:\n\nThe attackers search social networks for interesting targets, refining their search for ideal targets by keywords such as \u201cTrip\u201d, brand names of expensive products, matching searches against your \u201clikes\u201d and by inspecting published photos.\n\nAfter identifying an interesting match (for example, affluent? living alone? no dog? travels regularly to the same places? has a good job? doesn\u2019t work out at a martial arts centre? and so on), they identify your habits and where you will most likely be at any given time of the day.\n\nThe kidnapper then abducts their target in the morning. They take you, under duress, to places you normally visit. They force you to withdraw cash from ATMs you normally use, buy items they use with your credit card, then take your mobile/cell phone and leave you in a remote location.\n\nThis type of attack does not raise any \u201cwarning flags\u201d in any financial security systems, because the attacks occur in locations you frequent, and spend money on expensive items that fit your personality type.\n\n\u201cLightning Kidnapping\u201d may be uncommon in Malta, but similar strategies can be employed to identify when people won\u2019t be home in order to steal their items or to identify people susceptible to various types of scams or attacks in the real-world, such as \u201cdate rape\u201d or drug facilitated sexual assault.\n\nLast year, during a hackers conference in Brazil \u2212 The H2HC \u2212 Hackers to Hackers Conference \u2212 a study was presented where some security researchers visited a used computer server store and bought an old server that used to be owned by a major financial institution. They took that server home to study the efficiency of the security cleaning procedures, significant for forensic computing purposes. They were surprised when they discovered that the server contents had not even been erased! Even worse, they were able to access a database with hundreds of profiles of \u201cprivate bank investors\u201d (affluent people who had invested more than US$1 million). With that sensitive information in hand, and under supervision of a lawyer, they designed an experiment to answer this question:\n\n\u201cHow easy is to get physically close to some of these people?\u201d\n\nWell, to shorten the story, in just a few weeks they were able to discover the home address of an investor, get pictures of his house using Google Street View, found the investor\u2019s personal account on Facebook and then started to analyse his social network. The hackers become friends of his friends online (remember our last article on this?) and, finally, were able to meet the investor in person at a party (through his network of connections) and even shake his hand\u2026\n\nSo, read the fine-print agreement before joining a new network. Be sure that the information you post is only about you and that you can remove that posting anytime you want. Complete control of information is the main weapon of defence in the hands of users; always check what protection the laws of your country give you. Be sure that you can moderate any third-party posting about you. Take some time to learn how to properly configure the public level of exposure of your profile(s). Check and find out what a complete stranger may be able to learn about you from your social network postings. Think carefully about what kind of information you are exposing. You do not need to become paranoid, but you also must not be negligent because you can be putting your friends and family in danger, without knowing it. At the very least, your personal lifestyle choices may be a reason for prejudice from potential employers and risk impacting your ability to improve your financial and career position.\n\nSo, it is a fact that social networks can expose you to not just logical/computer threats but also to a wide range of physical threats from complete strangers/predators.\n\nRecommendations to \u201cKeep in mind\u201d\n\n \n\nProf. Fabian Martins (http://br.linkedin.com/in/fabianmartinssilva) is a banking security expert and product development manager at Scopus Tecnologia, (http://www.scopus.com.br/) owned by Bradesco Group.\n\nPierluigi Paganini, Security Specialist CISO Bit4ID Srl, is a CEH Certified Ethical Hacker, EC Council and Founder of Security Affairs (http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress)\n\nRon Kelson is vice chair of the ICT Gozo Malta Project and CEO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited (r.kelson@synaptic-labs.com).\n\nDavid Pace is project manager of the ICT Gozo Malta Project and a freelance IT consultant\n\nBen Gittins is CTO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited. cto@pqs.io\n\n \n\nICT Gozo Malta is a joint collaboration between the Gozo Business Chamber and Synaptic Labs, part funded in 2011 by the Malta Government, Ministry for Gozo, Eco Gozo Project, and a prize winner in the 2012 Malta Government National Enterprise Support Awards. www.ictgozomalta.eu links to free cyber awareness resources for all age groups.

There are now over 1,000 social networking sites on the Internet, with Facebook currently being the largest, with over 840 million user profiles. To put this into context, that is equivalent to the combined populations of the USA and UK, making it the third largest country by population. This illustrates how social networks can be a virtual goldmine of information and knowledge for those who can potentially harvest it both openly and/or covertly as we explain below.\n\nIn our first article we explored how social networks can be described as powerful communication tools capable of reaching clique groups and/or vast audiences instantaneously and globally. We explored two theories behind social networking:\n\nWe then explored a variety of ways governments are interacting with social media, ranging from government interference in the activities of the major social networking companies; adoption of tools for monitoring of communications over social networking; implementation of methods for the direct analysis of social networks through active infiltration; seeking legal authority to install software on your computer without your permission; and even preventing access to social media.\n\nIn this article, we discuss methods being employed to infiltrated user accounts, and the potential impact infiltration can have on people and organisations on a potentially massive scale.\n\nCountless criminal organisations have used social networks for all kinds of social engineering attacks with the intent of gathering sensitive information, or to spread malware or steal financial information from users.\n\n\u201cSocial engineering\u201d is an act of psychological manipulation. All social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision-making known as cognitive biases. These biases, sometimes called \u201cbugs in the human hardware\u201d, are exploited in various combinations to create cyber attacks that exploit weaknesses in both computers and humans simultaneously.\n\nAre you excited about the new \u2018friend request\u2019 from that attractive looking stranger in your Facebook account? An experiment, over a short eight-week period, by researchers at British Columbia University in Canada, simply created 102 \u2018fake\u2019 Facebook user accounts referred to as Socialbots, with the sole intent of making as many friends as possible and harvesting data. The Socialbots began contacting Facebook users by making random \u2018friend requests\u2019 and were accepted by one in five people they contacted. Once the Socialbot made some \u201cfriends\u201d, it increased its number of friends by using the social networks of those users who accepted it, befriending the friends of friends.\n\nThese friend requests by the now popular Socialbot were far more likely to be accepted. The research team found that a staggering 60-80 per cent of these requests were successful. As a result, they were able to harvest 46,500 email addresses and 14,500 physical addresses from users\u2019 profiles, including a massive 250Gb of personal data. What is critical to understand is that this information can be gathered AS SOON as the friend request is accepted. Then a copy can be stored offline, for later recall at any time. Therefore the actual owner can no longer recover, or change or delete that personal data that someone may have recorded. Facebook\u2019s \u201cFacebook Immune System\u201d, the massive security system protecting users, and which checks some 25 billion actions every day, did not detect the infiltration of the Socialbots. This demonstrates a very simple but effective capability to attack people at random. (We will talk about targeted attacks shortly below.)\n\nThe well-known Socialbot malware, called the \u201cKoobface\u201d virus, is specifically created to target social network platforms. Unlike most other malware, Koobface spreads \u201cactively\u201d by delivering messages to people who are \u201cfriends\u201d of a user whose computer has already been infected. Targeted social network platforms include Facebook, MySpace and Twitter as well as others. Once the host has been infected, Koobface connects back to so-called command and control servers (C&C), or receives directives on actions to perform or to upload compromised information. In this way the agent is able in a short time to build its own botnet, a huge number of Internet computers that, although their owners are unaware of it, have been set up to forward spam or viruses to other hosts on the Internet.\n\nThe most common infection method is via fake content on a compromised web site. It is sufficient to click on one of the links that Koobface has posted on the fake web site. Typically, this link would attract users by offering a download of a cool video or application. If they then download and execute the file, Koobface infects their system.\n\nThis malware is a typical example of an agent that could be used:\n\nLet\u2019s recall a case in recent months when a Nato chief\u2019s personal details were exposed thanks to a series of attacks moved through social network platforms.\n\nAs the Nato chief example proves, social engineering techniques can also be used to target specific individuals. In the first phase of the attack, a little bit of research is required to determine the target\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d in society, and their likely \u201cnetwork\u201d of superiors, respected peers and colleagues. Once the attacker has identified those people who are \u201cimportant\u201d to the target, a series of fake accounts are created on the social network. Remember that more than one person can be called by the same name. Furthermore, much of the data you need to create the fake account (name, face, activities) is already public on other social networks. In the case of Nato\u2019s most senior commander, several fake Facebook accounts for several of his colleagues were created, apparently by Chinese spies.\n\nIn a second phase of the attack, the fake accounts try to contact the real one, by establishing a relationship. This is exactly what happened when Senior British military officers and Ministry of Defence officials accepted \u201cfriend requests\u201d from the bogus account for American Admiral James Stavridis.\n\nAt this point, the infiltration attack has now been successfully executed. As a result, it is now possible to steal sensitive information such as personal e-mail account addresses, photos, messages, knowledge of the targets network of friends, which are all potential future targets for subsequent phases of the attack.\n\nSimilar \u201csocial engineering\u201d incidents are worrying and show how vulnerable even the higher echelons of strategic command can be.\n\nThere are some risks you face when your \u201ctrusted\u201d social network platform has a data breach:\n\nAn interesting case study occurred when the professional social network LinkedIn was recently hacked, and users\u2019 passwords stolen and leaked on the Internet. The company, through its blog, confirmed the event, declaring that more than six million passwords were compromised.\n\nThe LinkedIn hack is considered particularly serious, because the popular social network focuses on networking people in a business/professional context. LinkedIn members share information about their professions and employments both in private business and in governments. Each public association between user accounts acts as a type of credential establishing a person\u2019s standing and credibility in the community as previously described.\n\nAccessing a LinkedIn account can expose significant information on the (potential) victims, their relations, and participation in events and discussions related to specific \u2018closed\u2019 professional areas, with their inherent privacy levels. It is clear that the information could represent the basis for other types of attacks, and cyber espionage.\n\nAnother real risk is the possibility of a massive phishing campaign being launched during these \u2018compromised\u2019 hours, inviting LinkedIn users to change their passwords, potentially providing additional information to the criminal. Typically, such campaigns may include strategic dissemination of additional malware types, typically via an e-mail with a link (although this hypothesis has been excluded by LI) which redirects him to the infected web site.\n\nUltimately, all this information that has been garnered can be *stored forever* and utilized for a multitude of reasons, to the benefit of the criminals and the perpetrators of your infiltrated account and private information and network of friends and colleagues.\n\nWhat can you do to avoid being compromised or exploited?\n\nBe sure to read our next article in this series where we explore the *physical* risks associated with online social networking.\n\n \n\nDavid Pace is project manager of the ICT Gozo Malta Project, and a freelance IT consultant\n\nPierluigi Paganini, Security Specialist CISO Bit4ID Srl, is a CEH Certified Ethical Hacker, EC Council and Founder of Security Affairs (http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress)\n\nProf. Fabian Martins (http://br.linkedin.com/in/fabianmartinssilva) is a banking security expert and product development manager at Scopus Tecnologia, (http://www.scopus.com.br/) owned by Bradesco Group.\n\nRon Kelson is Vice Chair of the ICT Gozo Malta Project and CEO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited r.kelson@synaptic-labs.com .\n\nBen Gittins is CTO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited. cto@pqs.io\n\n \n\nICT Gozo Malta is a joint collaboration between the Gozo Business Chamber and Synaptic Labs, part funded in 2011 by the Malta Government, Ministry for Gozo, Eco Gozo Project, and a prize winner in the 2012 Malta Government National Enterprise Support Awards. www.ictgozomalta.eu links to free cyber awareness resources for all age groups.

No matter whether we are at home, in the gym, at work, or elsewhere, we are haunted by the need to be part of something online. We live alternative online lives, and we have dense networks of relationships that vary depending on the context (social, work, family).\n\nThis human propensity for aggregation is now the foundation of the \u201csocial network\u201d concept, a multi-dimensional interdependent community of actors or nodes. These actors/nodes are predominantly individuals, but can also be groups, companies, or even countries. Each relationship or linkage between a pair of nodes is typically a flow of material or non-material resources that may include social and/or emotional support, friendship, companionship, religious beliefs, time, information and interests, passions, expertise, money, business transactions, shared activity, etc.\n\nAccording to DARPA\u2019s representatives: \u201cSocial media have evolved from a platform that provides infrastructure that supports maintaining connections between friends to a platform that supports recruiting, collaborating, organizing and competing for resources\u2026 Among these communities and teams are terrorist and other criminal organizations.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these teams on the social landscape, their interactions with other teams, the evolution of network state over time, and competition with other teams and communities has not been adequately researched. Due to the overwhelming deluge of data generated by users across social media platforms, this analysis cannot be done manually.\u201d\n\nAs with any other subject, there are many and conflicting opinions on what is considered a social revolution.\n\nRecent events have demonstrated the significance and potential of this new type of social media as a communication vector, as an instrument for social analysis, and even as an facilitator of popular dissent, such as its support role in the organisation of non violent protests during the Arab Spring. In this latter example, social media can also provide interested third parties key indicators on how a situation is really developing across potentially vast regions, such as the Middle East or North Africa.\n\nThere are many theories behind social networks, and two in particular are very fascinating:\n\nA more balanced perspective or hypothesis would be somewhere between these two views. That is, one can view social networks as powerful communication tools capable of reaching clich\u00e9 groups and/or vast audiences instantaneously and globally. It is inherently difficult to maintain tight control over each and every communication channel in social media, particularly when run outside your country. This is the real concern for some governments that fear losing centralized top-down control of a situation that (they worry) could explode at any time (against the entrenched interests of a few), and which can develop to become both unpredictable and unstoppable. Let us recall that social media has been touted by CNN and other mainstream media organisations as helping to pull down governments that did not protect the legitimate interests of all its citizens.\n\nIt is precisely this concern which has led to the following developments:\n\nSocial networks are without doubt contributing to, and pushing the boundaries of development of new technologies and the provision of new services. Consider the significance of being able to instantly share any kind of media or document, how new opportunities for e-commerce and banking providing integrated services are generating new jobs. The massive introduction of social networking has radically changed the way we spend our spare time, and, in many cases, has introduced a new professional class that is able to promote and manage new media and services through new powerful platforms.\n\nOf course cybercrime has steadily increased with the rapid growth of social networks where we willingly, or inadvertently, share private information such as birthdays, addresses, phone or mobile numbers, and more intimate details such as interests, hobbies, favourite books/films/music, relationship status and sexual preferences. With this wealth of information we increasingly become an object of interest for a new generation of cyber-criminal.\n\nThe huge media exposure of these new social networking platforms can be a source of significant problems where literally entire populations are potentially exposed to new cyber threats which can be targeted or non targeted, intentional or unintentional, and can stem from a variety of sources, including cyber criminals, foreign nations engaged in information warfare and espionage, hackers and virus writers, employers, even disgruntled employees and contractors within an organisation.\n\nNewer cyber threats to manipulate mass conscience for example have emerged (disinformation), such as when rumours of a possible coup flooded China\u2019s blogosphere, some reporting tank and gunshots on Beijing\u2019s street. It was all a lie, as reported by Mr Kaspersky, of Kaspersky Labs, who happened to be there at the time.\n\nCountless criminal organisations have used the network for all kinds of social engineering attacks with the intent of gathering sensitive information, or to spread malware or steal financial information from users. (We will talk about various black-hat attacks conducted on social media networks against you in our next article in this series.)\n\nIn short, social networks have become an essential mainstay of our times. Keeping in mind the considerable risks of identity theft, stalking, sexual predators, privacy and employment, through to large scale cybercrime, espionage, theft, and mass manipulation, we still have much to do in terms of (user) education, (privacy enhanced) system design and security. So let\u2019s talk about a few simple things you can do right now to improve your social media security:\n\nBe sensible, and limit the amount of information you put up online in social media websites\u2026 After all, Facebook and Twitter are run by humans that \u201cyou don\u2019t know personally\u201d. Why do you personally trust that organisation? Why do you personally trust their technicians and administrators? Check yourself before you post:\n\n\u201cIf a third party that I didn\u2019t know got access to this information, would I care?\u201d\n\nReduce your exposure and periodically go through and delete your old postings.\n\nRead the fine-print on social media websites. You may be surprised just how much information an application is permitted to learn about your account and personal details when you install them on your page. (Ask yourself, why does Facebook have such a high market value? How is money being made on your personal data?) We recommend you remove most of your non-essential Facebook applications to reduce your exposure to unwanted information leakage.\n\nInstall a high-quality antivirus tool;\n\nKeep your web-browser and operating systems regularly patched; and\n\nBeware of phishing attacks. Do not click on attachments with any of the following extensions: \u201c.scr\u201d \u201c.exe\u201d \u201c.com\u201d \u201c.bat\u201d or \u201c.sh\u201d. Do not open attachments from unknown people! Always check the sender\u2019s e-mail address.\n\nSocial media platforms help bring people together in real-world communities. We must find a reasoned approach to managing and running social media that protects the legitimate interests of all stakeholders, under all situations. Right now, it\u2019s clear we are nowhere near achieving that goal. So be smart online and reduce your level of risk exposure.\n\n \n\nDavid Pace is project manager of the ICT Gozo Malta Project, and a freelance IT consultant\n\nPierluigi Paganini, Security Specialist CISO Bit4ID Srl, is a CEH Certified Ethical Hacker,\n\nEC Council and Founder of Security Affairs (http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress)\n\nProf. Fabian Martins (http://br.linkedin.com/in/fabianmartinssilva) is a banking security expert and product development manager at Scopus Tecnologia, (http://www.scopus.com.br/) owned by Bradesco Group.\n\nRon Kelson is Vice Chair of the ICT Gozo Malta Project and CEO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited r.kelson@synaptic-labs.com .\n\nBen Gittins is CTO of Synaptic Laboratories Limited. cto@pqs.io\n\n \n\nICT Gozo Malta is a joint collaboration between the Gozo Business Chamber and Synaptic Labs, part funded in 2011 by the Malta Government, Ministry for Gozo, Eco Gozo Project, and a prize winner in the 2012 Malta Government National Enterprise Support Awards. www.ictgozomalta.eu links to free cyber awareness resources for all age groups.\n\nTo promote Maltese ICT, we encourage all ICT professionals to register on the ICT GM Skills Register to keep abreast of developments, both in cyber security and other ICT R&D initiatives in Malta and Gozo.

Immediately I inserted the voice and described it in detail on Wikipedia, that however demonstrated  great ignorance and arrogance banning the post saying it not supported by official studies\n\nToday I desire to discuss a news published by BBC web site related to Facebook  filings made public this week that states that 8.7% of its 955 million active accounts broke its rules.\n\nBut what does it mean? Which are the repercussion under security perspective?\n\nLet\u2019s start with simple cases, user\u2019s duplicate profiles that are around 4.8% of total amount of registered users.\n\nThen we have the \u201cUser-misclassified accounts\u201d amounted to 2.4% such as profiles related to pets, objects or businesses.\n\nAnother 1.5% of total is composed by users classified as \u201cundesirable\u201d.\n\nFrom the economic perspective the social networks have un undisputed marketing value related to the critical mass of users that it loyalty, millions of people that daily exchange any kind of information, a good chunk of the planet is ensnared by these powerful networks, but 8,3 millions of accounts are not related to human individuals and this represents a loss of economic power attributed to the popular company, at least in commercial terms, related solely to the audience attainable by advertising and commercial operations more or less explicit.\n\nBut social network are principal an excellent tool for massive information gathering and mass-conditioning, thanks social networks is possible to track a detailed profile of any users, analyzing his relationship, his posts and it is also possible to retrieve data on his geo localization in the time.\n\n\n\nWhy a user need a fake account?\n\nWell for sure because he need anonymity without leaving the social network square, he wants to chat with his lover rather than seek new relationships that can handle a flat life\u2026. but there is also another finality, the cyber espionage and conditioning. Fake accounts can be used for the following scopes as I described in my \u201cSocial Network Poisoning\u201d definition.\n\nDo you think it is not enough?\n\nThe personal / social bots, creating a significant number of fake profiles (e.g. millions of fake profiles) managed by machines, capable of interacting with each other and with real users in realistic mode, thus changing the \u201csentiment\u201d and \u201cconversation on \u201d large-scale as well as altering all the social graph, and to preclude meaningful correlations on the data.\n\nBlack curation, using real compromised users or fictitious to speak on topics on which you want to change the meaning, or to create new ad-hoc, in analogy to the black SEO (Search engine optimization) already Use the search engines.\n\nBut social networks are also considered a haven for cybercrime, identity theft, spam and financial fraud are major crimes committed and obviously false accounts are the main tool to achieve this type of crimes.\n\nOn the article proposed by BBC is proposed the experience of a correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, that set up a fake company called VirtualBagel to investigate allegations of fake \u201clikes\u201d.\n\nHis investigation found that the large majority of \u201clikes\u201d for the fake firm originated from the Middle East and Asia by fake accounts.\n\nLast week, digital distribution firm Limited Press based on the results obtained with its own analytics software, 80% of clicks on its advertisements within Facebook had come from fake users.\n\nGuys, we are speaking of 80% of the total amount, the company also added:\n\n\u201cBots were loading pages and driving up our advertising costs. So we tried contacting Facebook about this. Unfortunately, they wouldn\u2019t reply.\n\n\u201cDo we know who the bots belong too [sic]? No. Are we accusing Facebook of using bots to drive up advertising revenue. No. Is it strange? Yes.\u201d\n\nThese data are worrisome and gentlemen they demonstrate that the model on which founded the social networking is to be increasingly compromised for the reasons described.\n\nSocial Networks are poisoned!\n\nOver a year ago we said all this to the lords of Wikipedia En that banned that my post, fortunately Wikipedia Italy has not removed it \u2026 ut my words ended up in the wind!\n\nOr am I too victim of Wikipedia Bot?

The company, through it blog, has confirmed the event declaring that more than six million passwords were compromised. Following the message published\n\nWe want to provide you with an update on this morning\u2019s reports of stolen passwords. We can confirm that some of the passwords that were compromised correspond to LinkedIn accounts. We are continuing to investigate this situation and here is what we are pursuing as far as next steps for the compromised accounts:\n\nThe company also informed the clients that is currently investigating on the data breach doesn\u2019t giving more information on the exact number of exposed accounts. LinkedIn is considered a mine of information related to business and government personnel that include a huge quantity of confidential data on more than 160 million members.\n\nThe data breach has been made public when a user has posted on a Russian forum, specializes in hash cracking, a message that claims that he has hacked and uploaded almost 6.5 million LinkedIn passwords, according to The Verge.\n\n\n\n \n\nOn Imperva Data security Blog have been published some interesting hypothesis that let us conclude that the real dimension of the data breach is bigger. The experts of Imperva noted that the file leaked doesn\u2019t contains what they define \u201ceasy\u201d passwords such as \u201c123456\u201d that are traditionally the most used. Maybe the hacker has only published the more complicated passwords. Another factor that induce to believe that the number of the stolen passwords is bigger is that passwords are typically listed only once, the list in fact doesn\u2019t reveal how many times a password was used by the members. A single entry in this list can be used by more than one account.\n\n\n\nOn twitter many users are reporting in these hours that they have found the hash of their LinkedIn passwords on the list published on internet, meanwhile the company is informing the users that it is analyzing the data publishing in order to advise its customers. The digest for the LinkedIn passwords is calculated using the SHA-1 algorithm, despite is considered secure, it is relative simple to discover weakness passwords.\n\nTo avoid any kind of problem is suggested to immediate change the passwords s a precaution especially if they are shared among different internet services and common to other account on other platforms.\n\nThe hack related to LinkedIn is considerable really serious due the nature of the popular social network, mainly business oriented. LinkedIn members share information about their professions and assignments in private business and also in governments. This characteristic make the social network different from the other ones such as Facebook, exposing sensible information on the business or career relationships of the members.\n\nAccessing to a LinkedIn account is possible to acquire many information on the victims, its relations and it\u2019s participation to events and discussions related to specific professional areas. It\u2019s clear that the information could represent the basis for other type of attacks and for cyber espionage. Just last month a serious vulnerability was been found in the authentication process of the popular network LinkedIN, the news published on the Spanish blog of the security expert Fernando A. Lagos Berardi. The article published reported a vulnerability in LinkedIn that allowed obtaining user\u2019s password.\n\nAnalyzing the relationships of a victims it is possible to discover its actual engage, trace its past experiences and specialization, possibly utilizing its profile to enforce the reputation of fake accounts and members poisoning the network of professional.\n\nStarting from the assumption that Internet and in particular the social network lacks a coherent and safe management of digital identity, last year I introduced the concept of social network poisoning as the effect produced by the application of methods designed to make unreliable the knowledge related to a profile and its relationships. The application of this kind of attack on large-scale could lead to the collapse of Social Networking and could expose member to the risks of cyber espionage and other cyber crime such as identity theft.\n\nIn the same way as the \u201droute poisoning\u201d (affecting the telecommunications network), the \u201cpoisoning action\u201d are conducted with the aim to pollute the contents of this social network profiles typically introducing artifacts and relationships exist between them and real ones thus making the information unreliable. The result is the consequent failure of the chain of trust which is based on all social networks, in order not to allow search engines specifically developed to retrieve information of any kind relating to a particular profile.\n\nThe main tools currently poisoning hypothesize new and viable in a future scenario are:\nReplacement of identity, or the ability to impersonate another user to the wide variety of purposes intelligence social engineering.\n\nDuring this transition is suggested to consider carefully which profiles to add to our network for the possibility that some of them have been already compromised giving the possibility to cyber criminals or spies to access to information shared in the profile.\n\nSocial network such as LinkedIn are also used by a lot of government officials all over the world, don\u2019t forget for example the attacks made months ago against NATO\u2019S most senior commander using  the Facebook platform. The intelligence and the West industry are still too vulnerable to all kinds of attacks, so it is absolutely necessary to define cyber strategies to deal with incidents like those described.\n\nIn the last year it has been observed an impressive growth of state-sponsored attacks aimed at stealing information to give them an economic, political and military advantage.\n\nMany times we have spoken of Advanced persistent threat (APT) usually refers to a group, such as a foreign government, with both the capability and the intent to persistently and effectively target a specific entity. The term is commonly used to refer to cyber threats such as cyber espionage, but applies equally to other threats such as that of traditional espionage or engineering attack.\n\nAnother real risk is the possibility that in these hours is launched a massive phishing campaign to invite the LinkedIn users to change their passwords, might provide additional information to criminal. Typically, such campaigns may be accompanied by strategic dissemination of malware for many different purposes, so the user receives an email with a link (although this hypothesis has been excluded by LI) which redirects him to the infected web site.\n\nI conclude by reiterating that similar events may have serious impacts if not properly managed, at this stage the awareness of the threat and timeliness of information are crucial.\n\nFollowing the detailed instruction for the change of the password:\n\nChanging Your Password:\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Network_Poisoning\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/advanced-persistent-threat", "topic_name": "Advanced persistent threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/identity-theft", "topic_name": "Identity Theft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linkedin", "topic_name": "LinkedIn"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/passwords", "topic_name": "passwords"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pisoning", "topic_name": "pisoning"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/risks", "topic_name": "risks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network-poisoning", "topic_name": "social network poisoning"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerability", "topic_name": "vulnerability"}]}, {"news_name": "CIA, FBI, NSA, differents agencies for an unique intent\u2026global monitoring", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5798/cyber-crime/cia-fbi-nsa-differents-agencies-for-an-unique-intent-global-monitoring.html", "title": "CIA, FBI, NSA, differents agencies for an unique intent\u2026global monitoring\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 28, 2012", "body": "We have discussed several times regarding the intention of the FBI to create a special unit for internet monitoring and surveillance, a task force established to prevent and fight cyber crimes .In reality the Bureau already has different internal units that work with the same purpose and in the last years has promoted different projects for the development of tools and applications for the web monitoring.\n\nThe FBI has recently created a secret surveillance unit to project and develop technologic tools and software for Internet and wireless communications monitoring.\n\nFBI is considered one of the most active agencies in this sense, in the last months it has publicly requested the design of a real time monitor for social networks that have to be able to identify suspect behaviors that could be interpreted as indicator of presence for an ongoing crime.\n\nThe FBI has been lobbying top internet companies like Yahoo and Google to support a proposal that would force them to provide backdoors for government surveillance, according to CNET. The purpose of the collaboration between FBI and major IT companies and Internet services providers is tied to the will of the agency to arrive at the definition of legislation that allows law enforcement to have the controversial backdoor.\n\nFBI desires the collaboration of the major player of the IT sector to implement specific backdoor stubs inside their products with intent to make them wiretap-friendly, the request is related to all those communication platforms, social network, email providers, chats and instant messaging.\n\nThe FBI has trying to maintain maximum reserve on the Unit called the Domestic Communications Assistance Center, for which the Senate committee has already allocated $54 million assigning to it the mission to create technologies for law enforcement to intercept and analyze communications data.\n\nThe power conferred to the unit is wide, every single communication through social networks and over internet in general should be intercepted by the hardware platforms and software applications that the the unit have to implement.\n\nIn February 2011, CNET reported that then-FBI general counsel Valerie Caproni was planning to warn Congress of what the bureau calls its \u201cGoing Dark\u201d problem, illustrating how the wiretapping capabilities were being reduced with the progress of technology.\n\nCaproni singled out \u201cWeb-based e-mail, social-networking sites, and peer-to-peer communications\u201d as problems that have left the FBI \u201cincreasingly unable\u201d to conduct the same kind of wiretapping it could in the past.\n\n\u201cGoing Dark\u201d is the FBI\u2019s codename for its project to extend its ability to real time wiretap communications, it is born inside the bureau, employing 107 full-time expert starting from 2009.\n\nAccording the declaration of Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Kevin Bankston FBI already can intercept messages on social-networking sites and Web-based e-mail services, the system used is known as Carnivore, later renamed DCS1000. The interception is possible because Facebook messages and Gmail messages travel in plain text over those same broadband wires for which the FBI demanded wiretapping capability.\n\nThe main problem is related to rapid technological evolution that make obsolescent surveillance systems in short time, due this reason the request of FBI to include a backdoor in any products that could be involved in communication, like social networking and also online games consoles.\n\nThe Domestic Communications Assistance Center represents the technological factory of the \u201cGoing Dark\u201d project for the internet wiretapping, the document, FY 2013 Performance Budget Congressional Submission refers to the recent establishment of DCAC:\n\nWhile progress is expected through DEA\u2019s participation in the recently established Department-wide Domestic Communications Assistance Center (DCAC) led by the FBI to address the growing technological gap between law enforcement\u2019s electronic surveillance capabilities and the number and variety of communications devices available to the public, the foremost challenge confronting U.S. law enforcement is the diminishing ability to conduct lawful electronic intercepts on current and emerging communications technologies as communications providers continue to offer new and improved services and features to customers.  Addressing this issue is critical to maintain law enforcement\u2019s ability to conduct lawful criminal intercepts.\n\nThe position of the US authorities is worrying, they want to impose to every internet service provider to give full access to Government for surveillance purpose, according the amendment to CALEA, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act.\n\nContrary to what one might think about the news there is no noise, no political debate, confirming a will that seems a common intent.\n\nTo confirm that the FBI is allocating new skilled personnel to the unit a job announcement for the DCAC has been published with a deadline of May 2. Analyzing the announcement we can have an idea on the technological skills requested, such as a meaningful experience with \u201celectronic surveillance standards\u201d including PacketCable, QChat and T1.678 (VoIP communications). One required skill for the position, which pays up to $136,771 a year, is evaluating \u201celectronic surveillance solutions\u201d for \u201cemerging\u201d technologies.\n\n \n\n\n\nDeclan McCullagh, chief political correspondent for CNET, in an excellent article on the argument has reported:\n\nThe NDCAC will have the functionality to leverage the research and development efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement with respect to electronic surveillance capabilities and facilitate the sharing of technology among law enforcement agencies. Technical personnel from other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies will be able to obtain advice and guidance if they have difficulty in attempting to implement lawful electronic surveillance court orders.\n\nIt is important to point out that the NDCAC will not be responsible for the actual execution of any electronic surveillance court orders and will not have any direct operational or investigative role in investigations. It will provide the technical knowledge and referrals in response to law enforcement\u2019s requests for technical assistance.\n\nThe project is really ambitious and without doubt it will involve all the main intelligence agencies of the country, such as Drug Enforcement Administration and National Security Agency.\n\nNSA also is massive investing in monitoring technology, a couple of months ago we have learned that the agency is building the country\u2019s biggest Spy Center in the little known city of Bluffdale. The center, named Utah Data Center is under construction by contractors with top-secret clearances.\n\nIts purpose is to intercept, decipher, analyze every world\u2019s communications under investigation using every kind of transmission.  The center will have a final cost of $2 billion and should be operative in September 2013. Its databases will be store all forms of communication, including the complete private emails, cell phone calls, search engine researches and every kind of digital data related to every individual. The imperative is to monitor everything!\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear the dimension of the project that has the purpose to cover monitoring need of every type includind of course satellite communication, phone calls, computer data and geostationary satellite data.  \n\nOnce the Data Center it\u2019s operational it will be fed data collected by the agency\u2019s eavesdropping satellites, overseas listening posts, and secret monitoring rooms in telecom facilities throughout the US. All that data will then be accessible to the NSA\u2019s code breakers, data-miners, China analysts, counterterrorism specialists, and others working at its Fort Meade headquarters and around the world.\n\nSomeone has defined the project as the NSA monitoring cloud\n\nThe information I\u2019m proposing should not deceive, in reality the country is already littered with centers for the analysis of data traffic and phone interception that make use of sophisticated software programs that conduct \u201cdeep packet inspection,\u201d examining Internet traffic as it passes through the 10-gigabit-per-second cables at the speed of light.\n\nOne of the main software has been developed by company called Narus and is controlled remotely from NSA headquarters at Fort Meade in Maryland. Any suspicion communication is automatically recorded and transmitted to the NSA for futher analysis.\n\nAlso other agency are interested to monitoring and surveillance, let\u2019s introduce project sponsorized by CIA, the intelligence agency is now interested to gather information from every intelligent devices that is surrounding us to spy on every US citizen. We have introduced months ago a spying project that has the intent to acquire information from gaming platform all over the world, a mine of data to collect and analyze.\n\nLet\u2019s me conclude the article speaking of the most interesting part of the web, the one defind Deep Web, that every agency is infiltrating, a volume of data impressive if compared to the ordinary web. the Deep Web represent today a mine of information with high level of interest, this invisible portion of web is considered infact the homeland for cybercrime, intelligence agancies and hacktivists, due this reason it is considered fundamental to be able to control this controversial cyberscenario.\n\nIn the Deep Web are hidden protected data, government communications and noncommercial file-sharing between trusted peers. \n\n\u201cThe deep web contains government reports, databases, and other sources of information of high value to DOD and the intelligence community,\u201d according to a 2010 Defense Science Board report. \n\n\u201cAlternative tools are needed to find and index data in the deep web \u2026 Stealing the classified secrets of a potential adversary is where the [intelligence] community is most comfortable.\u201d \n\nIt \u2018clear that the huge investments mentioned are a blatant invasion of privacy in the name of security, but the scope of the projects suggests that no law or constitution can oppose.\n\nWhat will invent the human intellect to escape this modern form of control?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/domestic-communications-assistance-center", "topic_name": "Domestic Communications Assistance Center"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/going-dark", "topic_name": "Going Dark"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI,content monitoring,backdoors & Going Dark\u2026shake well before use", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/5050/intelligence/fbicontent-monitoringbackdoors-going-dark-shake-well-before-use.html", "title": "FBI,content monitoring,backdoors & Going Dark\u2026shake well before use\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 8, 2012", "body": "Social Networks represent a rich mine of information of great interest for researchers, cybercriminals and government agencies.

Let\u2019s remind that CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act) passed in 1994every communication providers must make their system  wiretap-friendly, in 2004 the concept has been extended also to ISP by the Federal Communications Commission despite a non-application de facto of the major web companies.\n\nStarting on the CALEA Act the FBI is interested to extend the regulation to any kind of communication made using internet has channel, this means that there will be a direct impact on VoIP communication used by famous platforms Skype and Xbox Live. Regarding the Xbox let me remind you that US Government has already committed a project to spy on the communication made through gaming platforms confirming the great interest of the administration to monitor any kind of networks and any kind of information circulating on it.\n\n\n\nIn February 2011, CNET reported that then-FBI general counsel Valerie Caproni was planning to warn Congress of what the bureau calls its \u201cGoing Dark\u201d problem, illustrating how the wiretapping capabilities were being reduced with the progress of technology.\n\nCaproni singled out \u201cWeb-based e-mail, social-networking sites, and peer-to-peer communications\u201d as problems that have left the FBI \u201cincreasingly unable\u201d to conduct the same kind of wiretapping it could in the past.\n\n\u201cGoing Dark\u201d is the FBI\u2019s codename for its project to extend its ability to real time wiretap communications, it is born inside the bureau, employing 107 full-time expert starting from 2009.\n\nWhich are law enforcement today\u2019s capabilities?\n\nAccording the declaration of Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Kevin Bankston FBI already can intercept messages on social-networking sites and Web-based e-mail services, the system used is known as Carnivore, later renamed DCS1000.

Several times I highlighted the importance of social networking and of all related form of communication. Of course with the rapid diffusion of technology the number of crimes is increased dramatically. Here a good summary of the main crimes on social networks.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Facebook has completely revolutionized the way people interact. But there\u2019s a dark side to the world\u2019s love affair with social media. Criminals are finding new ways to utilize Facebook to commit new and disturbing crimes that authorities don\u2019t necessarily know how to police. That\u2019s why if you want to continue to enjoy social media, you should be aware of the common crimes committed on Facebook so that you can avoid becoming a victim. Here are the seven most common Facebook crimes.\n\nCriminals have been utilizing the scam for centuries. In the Facebook world, scams are particularly effective at drawing people in by simply enticing an individual to click on a link that would interest almost anyone, such as an innocent-looking notification that you\u2019ve won a free prize like a gift card. Then, in order to claim the prize, scammers require you to submit some information, such as a credit card number or Social Security number. This description may make it seem like scams are easy to spot, but even the most savvy social media user has to be on the lookout for illegitimate requests for information.\n\nCyberbullying is a common occurrence among teenagers on Facebook and one that can result in serious criminal charges if it goes far enough. Cyberbullying on Facebook has contributed to the deaths of several teens who either committed suicide or were killed by a peer. Cyberbullying that involves hacking or password and identity theft may be punishable under state and federal law. When adults engage in this kind of online behavior it is called cyber-harassment or cyberstalking.\n\nThe term \u201cstalking\u201d is thrown around a lot on Facebook, and it is often meant as a joke for regularly looking at someone\u2019s profile. However, the actual act of cyberstalking is a common crime on the social networking site and can result in a serious offense. Cyberstalking typically involves harassing a person with messages, written threats, and other persistent online behavior that endangers a person\u2019s safety. Although cyberstalking may seem like nothing more than annoying behavior, it is a legitimate cause for concern in many cases and can even lead to in-person stalking or endangerment if not treated seriously.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much for a thief to find out where you live, go to school, work, or hang out if you make that information readily available on Facebook. If you use Facebook\u2019s check-in or Google Maps feature, then you could be in a heap of trouble if a robber is paying attention. This person isn\u2019t always a complete stranger either; they may be an old acquaintance or someone else you\u2019d never expect to come rob you.\n\nWith the large amount of personal information swarming around Facebook these days, it has become fairly easy for criminals to steal users\u2019 identities. Hackers often break into users\u2019 e-mails and make fake Facebook accounts. From there they can access personal and bank information and cause havoc to your sense of security. Protect yourself from identity theft on Facebook by keeping your profile very secure and free of personal information that a criminal would love to have.\n\nAn individual commits the crime of defamation when they communicate a false statement to a third party that paints another individual or entity in a negative light. Facebook makes communicating defamatory statements frighteningly easy, and the exposure Facebook provides makes it more likely that businesses or individuals will be harmed by the defamatory statement, and thus more likely to pursue legal remedies. Be careful what you say on Facebook; you may be committing a crime without even knowing it.\n\nHarassment happens all the time on Facebook. From sexual harassment to assault threats, there has been a significant increase in the number of harassment cases happening on Facebook. It\u2019s not uncommon for sex offenders and sexual predators to prey on unsuspecting victims on Facebook and even pose as a teen or college student. Harassing messages, inappropriate comments, and other persistent behaviors should be reported to Facebook and your local police station.\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.thebestdegrees.org/7-most-common-facebook-crimes/\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Facebook crimes, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crimes", "topic_name": "crimes"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}]}, {"news_name": "Japan and the privacy contradictions", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3692/intelligence/japan-and-the-privacy-contradictions.html", "title": "Japan and the privacy contradictions\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 28, 2012", "body": "The massive use of new technologies has often raised thorny questions about the privacy of network users. The most difficult issue to resolve in the necessary to reach a compromise to assure the users requirements of security and privacy. The debate generates heated arguments, confusion and sometimes decisions in apparent contrast.\n\nIn Japan, to the multinational company Google has been asked to disable the autocomplete function used for the research because it is non compliance with privacy regulations. The decision to disable the famous feature of the popular search engine has been then by a Japanese court acting on a petition accusing Google to have implemented a defamatory functionality.\n\nThe news has been published by The Japan Times that reported that the petition has started by a citizen who alleged that some of the autocomplete suggestions accompanying his name were defamatory and also put at serious risk his privacy bring it up to the job loss. Typing the name of the Japanese citizen inside the search engine it propose as results criminal acts not related to the person. If a suggested term is selected a list of items defaming is proposed.\n\nActually Google has not disabled the functionality but has declared that it is working to review the results proposed to the incriminated query. The Google spokesperson said\n\n\u201cThe judge did not require Google to completely suspend the autocomplete function.\u201d\n\nGoogle has also declared that the results cannot be defamatory they are generated automatically and they don\u2019t refer to a specific individual.\n\nI just brought this case to highlight how Japanese judges were careful to privacy of its citizens, a sign of great civility and respect for the individual. But not all gold that glitters.\n\nWhile we discuss of the sentence against Google another news attract my attention. Japanese CCTV camera from Hitachi Hokusai Electric can scan 36 million faces per second \u2013 and recognize anyone who has walked into its gaze. The camera is equipped with a sophisticated facial recognition software that can instantly recognize a human face, qualify it and create immediately inside its database a responding record.\n\n\n\nThe technology is extremely interesting and it is obvious that governments and security agencies are the main beneficiaries. The system can be used also to analyze photo in an existent archive or inside the photos of a social network, being the starting point for further investigations.\n\nThe software can scan through days of CCTV footage almost instantly because the software works directly on the stored records, every face is stored as a searchable \u2018biometric\u2019 record.\n\nIf we desire to search a specific subject it is necessary to submit its picture to the system that instantly research all the related results inside its database.\nIn this ways it is simple to find a specific individual working on a gallery of pre-indexed faces.\n\nWho are the main client of this kind of applications?\n\n\u2018We think this system is suitable for customers that have a relatively large-scale surveillance system, such as railways, power companies, law enforcement, and large stores,\u2019 says the company that aims to propose the system on the market next year, according to a report in DigInfo.\n\nLet us realize that we are comparing ourselves with the eye of big brother, a tool that when deployed in large numbers in an urban setting allows to the owner to violate the privacy of every individual, this happens in that country that was opposed to Google\u2019s search results. Where is the concept of privacy? Which is the boundary between privacy and security?\nWho controls the systems? Obvious that a distorted use of these technologies raises disturbing questions about the on privacy front. A big electronic eye will always follow us \u2026 then if we join data acquired with these technology with the one acquired by our telco provider and with that managed by our bank we can realize how utopian is the What are we willing to sacrifice in the name of security?\n\nA further consideration must be made \u200b\u200bon the security of these systems that handle valuable information and that if compromised could be a privileged source for intelligence and espionage \u200b\u200bactivities. Are we ready to protect these systems from external attack? The issue is far from trivial, crossing the information retrieved from a video monitoring network on a large scale is possible to trace in a timely manner the experience of an individual in a particular field.

As deactivation is temporary in Facebook, the attacker can reactivate her account as she pleases and repeat the process of activating and deactivating for unlimited number of times. While a friend is deactivated on Facebook, she becomes invisible. She could not be unfriended (removed from friend\u2019s list) or added to any specific list.\u201d\n\nProbably one of the aspects that make this vulnerability more insidious is that the popular social network lack a mechanism for notifying a user of the activation / deactivation of the account considered as friends.\nThe process of alternating activation and deactivation is defined by two experts as \u201ccloacking\u201d\n\n\n\nFurthermore the process of activation and deactivation may be repeated at will without being subject to any control because deactivation is temporary in Facebook.  This behavior then allows an evil intent to reactivate an account for the time necessary to carry out a survey among the information posted by a victim \u2026 a mine as we learned from the news.\n\nIn my opinion the real problem is the distracted behavior of users of social networks, too preoccupied to increase the counter of their relationships without carefully assessing the real identity of those seeking friendship.  Once obtained the friendship it is possible to spy every account as desired, it is simply necessary to activate the account in a time when the victim is not present on the social platform to avoid being spotted and arouse suspicion.\n\nAs the attacker has to uncloak to spy, there is a probability of being detected and unfriended or put under restricted privacy policies. This probability will be dependent on several factors and suspicious events are:\n\nThe expert alerted:\n\n\u201cVarious groups of information aggregators including marketers, background checking agencies, governments, hackers, spammers, stalkers and criminals would find this attractive as a permanent back door to the private information of a Facebook user.\u201d\n\nThe attack is very serious for several reasons:\n\nDuring the presentation the two experts have presented a live demo to prove the problem showing that the one way to avoid any kind of problem is to notify the user the continuous change of states of its friends.\nOf course the situation must be managed by the manager of the Facebook platform that could also monitor a \u201ccloacking\u201d behaviour of an account blocking it or disabling the re-activation features.\n\nBeware, social media are becoming a paradise for cybercriminals.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4043v1.pdf\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}]}, {"news_name": "Stratfor on Iran, Palantir and Goldman Sachs", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2946/intelligence/stratfor-on-iran-palantir-and-goldman-sachs.html", "title": "Stratfor on Iran, Palantir and Goldman Sachs\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 28, 2012", "body": "\n\nIt is impossible to argue otherwise, after one days from the publication of mail stolen during the hack to Stratfor, it\u2019s time to analyze them in the light of political events in recent years. More than a surprise in many cases we have had confirmation on the controversial work made by governments, companies and security agencies involved in many cases in the news.\n\nStratfor was founded over a decade by George Friedman, a former political science professor and is considered a private CIA, an intelligence agency with dense network of informants within the major institutions and governments.\nIt \u2018was not only recognized the company\u2019s ability to provide intelligence reports on extremely delicate situation, but also the ability to intervene in any way by working on the actors involved in the events. We are moving in murky scenario, made of wrongdoing, that everyone imagines, that nobody talks about, who really care at all.\n\n\u201cI think this is a diversion. The Israelis already destroyed all the Iranian nuclear infrastructure on the ground weeks ago,\u201d one intelligence official wrote in an email dated November 14, 2011. \u201cThe current \u2018let\u2019s bomb Iran\u2019 campaign was ordered by the EU leaders to divert the public attention from their at home financial problems. It plays also well for the US since Pakistan, Russia and N. Korea are mentioned in the report. \u201d\n\nWe are talking about diversion bombing ordered by the European Union to divert media attention from far more serious problems at this time.\nRecall that at stake is the seal of the EU itself undermined by the disastrous economic situation of countries like Greece, but also embarrassing prospects that surround the future of countries like Spain and Italy.\n\nTherefore legitimate to ask what was the bargaining chip with Isreal, real executor of the diversions.\n\nAnother interesting news is related to the alleged relationship between the popular social network Facebook and company close to the CIA. Social networks are now recognized as powerful tools for the collection of information and the definition of profiles related to particular interest subject. Friendships, relationships, photos, contacts and data on space-time location of an entity makes social networks privileged tools for the investigation. The news is not new, already circulated in recent weeks, regarding the insistence of the FBI involvement in the development of systems analysis software for monitoring social media. Of particular interest is the popular sentiment, opinions on specific topics, utterances, membership in social and political campaigns, a privileged and indispensable source of information.\nMany people, myself included, do not believe the Zuckerberg\u2019s story, the platform is actually a machine with an immense potential impossible to believe that its genesis is casual, it is for sure the result of a complex project, targeted at a mass voluntary filing. Impossible to know if there is behind the CIA or some group of hungry multinationals.\nIn an email published expressly refers to the Palantir as a possible funder of Facebook. In that email between two Stratfor\u2019s analysts one of them writes: \u201cI think Palantir is involved in things less clear, including the financing of Facebook.\u201d The Palantir is a California company that project platform for complex information analysis. It was founded in 2004 and currently offer two main system Palantir Government and Palantir Finance, both are platforms for integrating, visualizing, and analyzing the world\u2019s information. Palantir Government is broadly deployed in the intelligence, defense, and law enforcement communities, and is spreading rapidly by word-of-mouth. Palantir Finance is in use at some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and financial institutions.\n\nFinance and Government two worlds, one soul.\n\nThe name of Palantir appeared for the first time during the hacking of HBGary Federal company, when documents were some stolen detailing the involvement of the Palantir to attack and destroy WikiLeaks.\nDo not you find it interesting?\n\nThe company\u2019s position is even worse if it is assumed the possibility of use information gained through insider, \u201cconvinced\u201d to cooperate, to make huge profits. Stratfor was then scheduled with the management of Goldman Sachs\u2019 use of information gained from intelligence operations. Several emails demonstrate that in 2009 then-Goldman Sachs Managing Director Shea Morenz and Stratfor CEO George Friedman have had the idea to make profit of the intelligence operations made by Stratfor utilizing the acquired information to start up a strategic investment fund.  CEO George Friedman explained in a confidential August 2011 document, marked DO NOT SHARE OR DISCUSS :\n\n\u201cWhat StratCap (the new fund) will do is use our Stratfor\u2019s intelligence and analysis to trade in a range of geopolitical instruments, particularly government bonds, currencies and the like\u201c.\n\nThe emails show that in 2011 Goldman Sach\u2019s Morenz invested \u201csubstantially\u201d more than $4million and joined Stratfor\u2019s board of directors. Throughout 2011, a complex offshore share structure extending as far as South Africa was erected, designed to make StratCap appear to be legally independent. But, confidentially, Friedman told StratFor staff :\n\n\u201cDo not think of StratCap as an outside organisation. It will be integral\u2026 It will be useful to you if, for the sake of convenience, you think of it as another aspect of Stratfor and Shea as another executive in Stratfor\u2026 we are already working on mock portfolios and trades\u201d. StratCap is due to launch in 2012.\n\nThe question remains \u2026 why a mine of so confidential information in possession of a company that specializes in intelligence services, has not been adequately protected?\nMight someone have an interest in the disclosure of information?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hack", "topic_name": "hack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-analysis", "topic_name": "information analysis"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence-agency", "topic_name": "intelligence agency"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/israel", "topic_name": "Israel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/palantir", "topic_name": "Palantir"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stratfor", "topic_name": "Stratfor"}]}, {"news_name": "Underestimate the threat, a serious error", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2278/cyber-crime/underestimate-the-threat-a-serious-error.html", "title": "Underestimate the threat, a serious error\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 4, 2012", "body": "In recent years it has fully understood the offensive capability of the use of cyber weapons, highly efficient tools to move attacks and espionage operations in total coverage.\nThe effectiveness of the cyber threat is linked not only to its intrinsic characteristics, but also to the choice of channel for its spread and in this social media represent a privileged factor. For this reason, governments and institutions are promoting and supporting the processes of monitoring and surveillance of social networking.\n\nTo ensnare the user through the social networks are proposed sensational breaking news, but beware of malware lurking.

Material defense, aerospace stations, and more generally any critical infrastructure is at risk.\nThe malware polymorphic of the latest generation are able to exploit 0-day vulnerabilities and sometimes to combine mutually accidentally generating a dangerous offensive from which to defend is not simple. These agents, once infected the victim, live by themselves, they can remain silent and steal information, they can in turn be distributed independently user action spreading itself to victim\u2019s contacts, they can infiltrate sensitive systems.\nDo not be deceived so that a scareware is a threat to distracted kids playing on social networks \u2026 there is much more at stake.\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapons", "topic_name": "cyber weapons"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scareware", "topic_name": "scareware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socia-media", "topic_name": "socia media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/threats", "topic_name": "threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Social Media, exercise or not exercise the control", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2134/intelligence/social-media-exercise-or-not-exercise-the-control.html", "title": "Social Media, exercise or not exercise the control\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 30, 2012", "body": "Exercise or not exercise the control, that is the question that divides major governments on the social networks surveillance and social media, at the center of heated debates. Always consider myself an avid supporter of freedom of expression and free access to the network, but what I want to do in this post is to analyze the problem from a different perspective, that of a government that intends to monitor through surveillance mechanisms the social media access. Let\u2019s start first by a unannounced consideration, the fact that social media are a powerful medium that engages large audiences of users reached instantaneously and that today catalyze almost all activities on the Internet, so they are a single point of access, a digital gate, through passes an endless amount of information.\n\n\n\nThis consideration should already be sufficient to motivate a government to support digital surveillance activities, then the possibility of being able to spy on all of \u201cdigital conversations\u201d in a centralizer, an activity that is unthinkable years ago, that is involved today in a growing number of major operations intelligence. Check Social media allows us to study and anticipate operations against the governments themselves, whether carried out by both hostile governments or by groups of hacktivists.\nIn addition to this consideration must be analyzed a second and equally worrying phenomenon intrinsically linked to the use of social media, the impressive growth of computer crime. The social network platforms are the primary drivers for the realization of any kind of fraud usually perpetrated with distribution of malware capable of stealing sensitive information to unsuspecting users. The threat is subtle and is not limited only to the distribution of viruses and the like but also uses advanced social engineering techniques that make use of these powerful tools.\n\nMalware sample used for this purpose the history is full, the first that comes to mind is Koobface, for example because of the noise obtained in these days.\nPrevention of cyber crime and the possibility of intercepted information in time inherent in subversive and terrorist purposes are undoubtedly a strong motivation and final colliding against the desire for freedom of Internet users.\n\nHow are working in this delicated field the principal agencies all over the world?\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has announced that it\u2019s planning the development of a specific application that can track the public user\u2019s activities on the main social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and other social networks) to predict and reacts to criminal operations like public disorder and terrorism.\n\nThe application must alert FBI agents if the searches come up with evidence of \u201cbreaking events, incidents, and emerging threats\u201d.\n\nFBI has publicly requested information to the cost of a similar application and the feature that could be implemented to help the work of its agents. The idea is to build an open platform the will collect any suspect evidence on social media and it\u2019s able to correlate it with other events apparently unrelated locating them on the spatial and temporal axis of analysis.\n\nAgents would have the ability to display any information on a map, and they could then add other layers of information, including past incidents and locations of important buildings like embassies and military installations. The document notes that agents need to \u201clocate bad actors and analyse their movements, vulnerabilities, limitations, and possible adverse actions\u201d.\n\nThe main directive of governments and agencies is to strictly monitor Mobile and social media platforms to dominate cyber threats in incoming year.\nThe 2012 forecasts predict to see innovative and powerfull attacks with the use of social media platforms and mobile technologies with a consistant increasing of threats for also non Windows based products.\n\nIf we consider the potential damage from cyber threats, whatever their origins, it is normal to rely on the control of governments to implement preventive measures to guarantee national security. However, measures of surveillance and control, are accused of meddling and they can undermine the concept of privacy the citizens.\nNeedless to poke fun at himself, it is impossible to have a free network if we need to ensure the security of users. Internet is evolving and if left unchecked, according to some it may become unusable due to the same threats. The main problem is the transparency of surveillance actions and they do not lead to preventive actions that violate the medieval freedom of thought. The crusades of the SOPA and ACTA are a real threat to freedom of expression, although at least in purpose they have been proposed with noble intentions. As always, the solution will be represented by the compromise between security and freedom of access to information.\nThe concept of surveillance must be clearly distinguished from that of control, the interaction with social media by governments should be more transparent, the very fact that there is surveillance could be a deterrent to criminal use of social media resource.\n\nThe position of the CIA is not far from FBI one, social media are classified as \u201c\u201d open source \u201cand as such can and should be subject to a fine-grained control as a source of inside information. The CIA has an internal structure dedicated to the analysis of the media called \u201cOpen Source Center\u201c, Doug Naquin is the its director.\nAnalysts of the center are responsible for monitoring everything that comes out of a specific country, and they\u2019re also tracking political movements and terrorist groups spending time to look terrorist-related websites and monitoring Twitter feeds and Facebook pages that raise red flags.\n\nWe can go on to quote the main agencies and services of the world, so that we can see how crucial it has become the control of social media and how much Governments are investing in this matter. Unfortunately, as repeatedly stressed the unfair use of control systems can result in the process of reprehensible censorship and can not always be helpful to the cause. We move into the minefield of new technologies, and as we refine the technology to control and surveillance on the other hand evolve control techniques to circumvent them. Last year I have defined the term \u201csocial network poisoning\u201d on wikipedia to describe the possibility of circumventing the control implemented through social networks, the term was banned from the English wiki but it is still available on the Italian Wikipedia. Obviously I was not the only one to think about the problem.\n\nI leave you with an interesting read \u201cEasier: Encryption-based Access Control in Social Networks with Efficient Revocation\u201d\nA promising approach to mitigate the privacy risks in the Online Social Networks (OSNs) shifting from the access control enforcement OSN provider to the user by means-of encryption.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/acta", "topic_name": "ACTA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/freedom", "topic_name": "freedom"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring-system", "topic_name": "monitoring system"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/open-source-center", "topic_name": "Open Source Center"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network-poisoning", "topic_name": "social network poisoning"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sopa", "topic_name": "SOPA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Which is the main cyber threat?

It\u2019s already happened and it still happening.\nBy the friction of these two requirements that are at odds, a series of movements arisen, the hacktivist, which have in more than one occasion undermined the smooth operation of government insfrastructures and official institutions preventing the delivery of key services. The phenomenon is manifested in all its explosive force just last year that will be remembered for the countless cyber protests that have stopped banking services, news agencies and other critic organisms.\n\nIn a scenario already extremely complex and we must consider other two variables completely out of control:\n\nSurely the only way to remedy the problems described is the implementation of a series of capillaries control measures that can very quickly be able to identify every action \u201cinconsistent with the ethics of controlled network\u201d. But what we mean by the term \u201cnon-conforming\u201d, which hides the dangers that this statement sounds like a razor blade, the sword of censorship.\nAnalyze each conversation, intercept users each time they are on line, analyze every transaction, in practice check every single user in the name of security.\nAre we really willing to sacrifice our privacy? Do we sacrifice the rights for which we fought so much? How we imagine the network of the future? Surely a carrier not no more to freer access, a payment will be required in relation to the services used. This first issue is already perceived as questionable as it introduces discrimination on the right of access to the network.\nTherefore obvious that there will be no more rights, but only services that will pay handsomely to compensate the expenses incurred for the maintenance and operation of surveillance systems.\n\nThe first hypothesis concerning the possible development of Internet sees a network whose services are provided under strict control of the authorities through the same providers that are in charge to implement the discussed control. The user receiving the services upon payment sacrificing their privacy.\n\nAnother possible scenario is rather one for which the same internet meet the monitoring requirements with a radical division into sub-components, \u201ccyber zones\u201d, completely separate from the governance point of view . These cyber zones, independent and autonomous each other are communities built to ensure safe access and efficient services. This time, the paradigm is no longer conceived delivery \u201cservices\u201d as above but for \u201cdomains of competence\u201d. Expected that it will develop very vertical domains where authorities exert precise control. Divide and conquer!\n\nOf course this are mine , and I hope they remain only mine, fanciful hypothesis of a tired fan of the matter, but the risks are high. Actual Internet model is revealing all its limitations because of the reasons provided. Impossible to predict if ever there will be a real change in its structure, but it is obvious that when this will happen we will be faced with a cultural revolution, the death of a model that has made the history. This transition may trigger new cultural movements that could be a strong force in the search of new and innovative solutions for content sharing within networks with no control. At that point a user may opt for a paid service if interested in a particular matter and he could verticalize his web participation to a particular context (e.g. optabile solution especially for companies).\n\nModels such as those designed, although based on the concept of having to provide security through control, can succumb under the weight of guarantees to offer. Is the new network able to ensure a comprehensive and instantaneous control in order to remove any cyber threat? If the control will fail what are the possible consequences? No doubt it would sanction the premature death of a model that hasn\u2019t withstood the heavy legacy of the beloved Internet 1.0.\n\nIn conclusion, what is the main cyber threat to the network of networks? Surely an obsessive search for a security that is not certain, the only certainty is that we have violated our freedom.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/control", "topic_name": "control"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/criminal-activities", "topic_name": "criminal activities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-protest", "topic_name": "cyber protest"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isp", "topic_name": "ISP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "The strategic importance of censorship in search engines", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1273/intelligence/the-strategic-importance-of-censorship-in-search-engines.html", "title": "The strategic importance of censorship in search engines\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 3, 2012", "body": "Every day, billions of people making an unimaginable number of searches through search engines. Complex algorithms seek to recover in the shortest possible time and with greater sorrowfulness the requested information. We may venture that a good 80% of Internet users interact with the web through these powerful applications. But the engines are much more, they are true and proper systems for the analysis of user behavior, they practically know every thing about us. Forecasting systems and relationships engine have been developed to improve the searches to be able to guide the user during the navigation. Easy to understand how important are search engines in a digital environment, they are an inprescindibile element that accompanies each user in their research.\n\nOf course, as always, we must take in care the compromises that any technology solution offers. In the case of search engines who guarantees that the proposed results are not deliberately manipolated some for reasons that may be the most different?\n\nIn some cases the results of a search are affected by various government related factors, and some specific information can be excluded from them. The suppression may be local to a country, or global to all search enfine results.\n\n\n\nThe exclusion of results has been documented in the past, very interesting is the report Localized Google search result exclusions which investigated certain web material banned in various countries.\n\nIt is contemporary history the practice of a form of censorship through the digital manipulation of search results of major search engines. It \u2018happened for example in China, where the government has imposed filters in online searches made \u200b\u200bthrough the engine Google. Regarding the Chinese situation Schmidt, CEO of Google, has declared:\n\n\u201cWe made a very controversial decision to enter China to Few years ago, and we have to follow by that their law,\u201d\n \u201cTheir law does require a very precise form of omission or censorship around certain things, I know for example the Falun Gong is omitted. But we did something very unusual for China: When we omit something in an answer, we also tell if the Chinese surfer that information was omitted. You can imagine if you\u2019re a Chinese citizen and you see that you\u2019ll be doing what information with that. \u201c\n\n\u201cWe are subject to Chinese law, which effectively obviously we are opposed to,\u201d he says. \u201cThe decision ultimately that we came to China with was that it was better to engage rather than be estranged. The Chinese citizens will eventually rebel over some of these \u2013 in our view \u2013 idiotic restrictions, because they are now aware of them. They now know that information is withheld from being theme by law and those that will be laws overturned from public pressure over time. \u201c\n\nEasy to understand how in the name of the business big companies like Google must bow to the interference of governments in order to continue to operate freely in the host country.  In 2002 all the references to Google in China were even re-routed to Baidu, a China-based search engines, this means that every time a users in China entered Google.com, they would end up on Baidu.cn, who benefited from Google\u2019s marketing and name recognition of it competitor.  The economic impact was devastating for Google, its market share to third risusse is to the benefit of its competitors who reached the 70% point of the internal market and the revenues began to climb the adjacent markets such as Japan. It is impossible to compete with such interference and it is understood as a private company can really little. I understand from a business point of view the response of the serach engine companies in reaction to government law or government pressure but I believe that it must change and to this we need a strong collaboration beetwen governemte and service providers of all the world.\n\nAccording to Smith companies like Google have just to inform the public about the censorship practiced but not openly take sides against any government decision. In countries where human rights are daily violated, these assertions thunder as a fully support to dictatorial policies that use of censorship to stifle dissent in the bud.\n\nThis censorship applied in country like China suppresses any writings and media that express dissent against the central government, hiding related materials in search engine results. We are facing with a serious violation of human rights in the name of the business.  Consider that obscuring operations are used by governments not to enforce copyright restrictions, but to impose a raw censorship of political or religious material that is considered to be offensive.\n\nIt is clear that so far Google has been discussed and cases related to it since the engine is the main player in the world and having a lot of information available for it. The situation is quite common to all major search engines, even in this there is to say that Google is one ofthe same companies that seek to implement policies in the name of transparency.\n\nThe consorship proccess it not so easy for different reason. First of all there is the concrete risk to fail to produce reliable search results. Consider the every time a content is banned all its references have been impacted. Countries with greater censorship might produce lower quality search engines, but primary companies like Google and Microsoft, can avoid this problem accessing to uncensored data and mitigating the indirect effects of censorship. Search engines are of high interest to censors, but cannot sensibly be held responsible the several billions of pages present in Internet.\n\nThe market for search engines is in fact an oligarchy in which the risk of cartel agreements is very high.\n\nWanting to deepen the discussion of censorship by governments point out the two projects,monitoring of the Internet and restrictions imposed:\n\nIn particular I found very interesting results produced by the second of the two portals. It contains data related to the \u201canomalies\u201d in accessing the network. These issues are analyzed using different axes of analysis, such as geographic location and type of intervention performed (eg political, social, conflict / security, Internet tools). The information is produced with detailed reporting that goes along with maps that make it attractive graphical representation of the phenomena.\n\n\n\nAs you can see the situation in countries such as China and beyond, is truly alarming. Internet is used as an instrument of government propaganda and censorship as a gag to everyvoice of dissent.\n\nWe must consider free internet access as a fundamental human right in cyberspace, recently, the United Nations declared \u201cRight to Access\u201d to Internet as Human Right. For instance, right to speech and expression, right to privacy, right to know, etc cannot be violated by any CMS Project. United Nations must expand Human Rights Protection to many more issues considering anyone of this violations.\n\nDon\u2019t forget also that censorship can be placed also for business purpose. Sometimes for example local businesses that fear foreign competition and will work to hide those company web site from search engines results.  It is happened for in China where Google China block searches relating to the French hypermarket chain Carrefour to advantage a local business.  It has no sense to promote human freedom closing the eyes on corruptions events, on the direct correlation that there is between corruption and policy to implement detailed traffic filtering.\n\nIn fact, then how can we combat these forms of censorship?\n\nFirstly it is crucial that global recognition of a single rule before which should not be allowed exceptions. I realize that the road is really difficult but it is the only truly viable. Those who apply censorship must be sanctioned, and particularly affected economically. Any clear violation must be unanimously condemned. Today the situation is too jagged, with sometimes very different approaches. I recommend reading Internet Censorship: Law & Policy Around the World\n\nAnother possibility is the study of structures of alternative communications channels able to by-pass filter. It was a long discussion on the subject, many theorists and groups of hackers are working on solutions of various kinds, but they really are in the high seas due to the refusal of government support and non-availability of adequate budgets.\n\nLike user we have to make the same pression on those companies. Users are the soul of business, their choice is the business \u2026 let\u2019s use, if we can, only search engine that avoid any kind of consorship.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/search-engines", "topic_name": "search engines"}]}, {"news_name": "The power of social networks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1163/social-networks/the-power-of-social-networks.html", "title": "The power of social networks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 31, 2011", "body": "\nFor years now we live with the confirmation of the importance of social networks and their impact on daily life. As with any other subject there are many and conflicting opinions on what is considered a social revolution. Millions, billions of people who daily exchange thoughts, opinions, images, emotions, anything that makes us feel alive and part of a community that filled our gaps. There are many theories behind social networks, in particular two are very fascinating, one who see social networks designed to be powerful tools for governments massive collection of information and monitoring of global sentiment, another who considers this platforms carriers of information but also manifest of social dissents, and for this to be kept under strict control.\n\nI personally prefer a hypothesis that is placed in the middle, that treats social networks as powerful communication tools capable of reaching vast audiences planetary instantaneously and therefore is not very easy to tighter controls on each communication. This is the real concern of governments, losing control of a situation that could explode at any time to grow up to become unpredictable and unstoppable. Precisely this concern led to the following effects:\n\nBut what happens when all these approaches fail in intent?\nThere will be the final weapon, the \u201ckill switch\u201c, the censorship of the twenty-second century. A kill switch, also known as an e-stop is a security mechanism used to shut off in an emergency situation in the devices in which it can not be shut down in the usual manner. In this case the mechanism is the network itself isolating, and acting in this way it is possible to separate one nations from the rest of the world.\n\u201cDivide et impera\u201d\n\nSo far we have been concerned about the potential of social networks, but obviously there is a downside. Just the huge media exposure of these new media can be a source of problems far from negligible. Social networks have literally swallowed whole populations by exposing them to new threats. The cyber crime, but also threats by hostiles government. In the first case, countless criminal organizations have used the network for attacks of all kinds, for social engineering attacks or to spread malware to steal financial information to the users. In the second case are the same Governments that infiltrating social networks to perform intellicence operations or to spread viruses developed for strategic objectives.\n\nAt this point one might wonder about the future of social networks. Will they grow with no brakes being able to exercise precise control of the masses, or we will it be less confidence on the trusting concept on which they are based?\nIn what direction society is moving?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/networks", "topic_name": "networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social", "topic_name": "Social"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Russia, cyber repression in the social networks era", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/869/cyber-crime/russia-cyber-repression-in-the-social-networks-era.html", "title": "Russia, cyber repression in the social networks era\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 22, 2011", "body": "Several times in these posts we have discussed of the importance of social media in recent years. Social Media are the valuable carrier to disclose political decisions taken by central governments. This is well known to the main strategist of governments such as Russia, the country where a massive cyber repressive action was carried out against the opposition websites and more generally against all those who have taken positions opposing the government dictates.\n\nSo here we are confronted with what is a real digital censorship, opposition websites under attack by phantom hackers, actions that have produced the desired effects \u2026 countless blogs have disappeared, massive and successfully actions of defacing on opposition websites, messages delete from social networks and forums judged to discuss against the the regime choices. It happened during the protests against anti-Putin, the focus has moved into cyberspace theater of this new repression. Dumbledore undoubtedly controversial but equally deafening. Nobody knows, nobody seems to contradict the imperative actions and whose authorship is given to hackers phantom whose reasons are frankly incomprehensible.\n\nIn recent months, Hell has successfully attacked with surgical precision blog and web sites of journalists and political activists, many of the opposition. Curious, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThe mud machine did not stop here, but it has operated also beyond the elections, on 4 December all behind the silence of the mainstream press. That is an attack against the main tool of democracy, the vote.\n\nOne of the hardest hit company seems to have been the election monitoring group Golos, which has been under \u201cmassive distributed denial of service attacks. Why Golos? Because Golos was compiling a map of \u201celection violations\u201d occurred during vote, describing detailed places where irregularities have happened.\n\n\n\nGolos , whose monitors vote operations are not affiliated with any party, and it has been funded largely by the US and EU, for this reason Prime Minister Putin has accused foreign powers of meddling in election preparations, while Duma members have questioned why a foreign-funded organisation is allowed to monitor Russian elections.\n\nIs this another coincidence?\n\nBut attacks have continued in cyberspace involving social networking platforms, and ultimately making several account useless guilty of spreading news about what was happening. The operations performed with perfect synchrony, a clear demonstration of the presence of central direction.\nDo you want an example? The Livejournal blog have been made \u200b\u200bunavailable for over two days and also it is happened to Boris Akunin, a famous writer who has decided to enter politics against Putin and expressing discomfort that is common to many Russian intellectuals. His blog has been thrown down.\n\nAccording to security experts at Yandex, Russia\u2019s largest search portal, more than 200,000 computers were turned into \u201cslaves\u201d for the DDoS attack, in which a targeted site receives so many requests for access that it simply shuts down. It is a simple, cheap, and effective way to disrupt a Web site, at least temporarily.  Disabling web site is another strategy adopted by this cyber militias with the goal to eliminate reporting about street protests against the election violations.\n\nThe strategy of disinformation and obscuration through computer hacking operations had already been pursued in the past. It \u2018happened in January 2002, Russian hackers when brought down for a day Kavkaz.org, the Chechen separatist fighters of websites. Other similar DDoS attacks aimed other web sites of independent media sources in Russia, as well as at government agencies in Estonia, Georgia, and Lithuania.\n\nBut what has really changed today? The availability of social media like social networks has effectively made impossible a total blackout. News of the crackdown have been around the world in real time outraging the people of the network.\nSo how can Russian Government operate a control of these new media? By investing on one side in new technologies and systems for network monitoring and on the other side developing and promoting the use of internal social networks, close to the government vision, that would be easy to control.\n\nThe truth is that the government fears the Internet and is unable to exercise a censorship would undermine the explicit form of the republican and democratic country.\n\nI leave you in the hope that Russian hackers are not even entertained against me \u2026 in the meantime I do a backup of the blog.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16024938\n\nhttp://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136727/andrei-soldatov/vladimir-putins-cyber-warriors?\n\nhttp://thevotingnews.com/international/europe/russia/hacking-attacks-hit-russian-political-sites-bbc-news/\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opposition", "topic_name": "opposition"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/political", "topic_name": "political"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/repression", "topic_name": "repression"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "The thin line between monitoring and censorship", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/802/intelligence/the-thin-line-between-monitoring-and-censorship.html", "title": "The thin line between monitoring and censorship\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 20, 2011", "body": "During the last year we have seen the consolidation of the tendency to use social media as a major vector for the exchange of information. The imperative is to be social, no matter if you need to share photos with friends or to express an opinion on a topic of social interest. Over the past year a large number of protests have been conducted through the major social networking platforms from Twitter to Tacebook, because they have an extraordinary power amplifiers media that is able to reach an audience of planetary with a simple click.\n\n\n\nThese considerations are, however, are well known to governments across the world in a more or less declared are confronting these new tools. The approach has been wrong, in my opinion, having raised the issue in too much control, monitoring, instead of listening connentrarsi global sentiment to guide their political choices.\n\nSocial media are designed as new fields of battle, you are thought of as a pawn in a chess board that must be constantly monitored and if necessary excluded from the mediatic circulation when they exceed the exposition of concepts unpopular to governments. Be committing a serious error if we considered only the problem of some realities such as China or Egypt. In various ways and in varying measure all states are equipped to carry out a more or less closely control of the media and of Internet in general. For goodness sake, do not call it censorship looking journalistic bombastic titles, but we must surely reflect on what happening. I will try soon to propose some objective data in order to allow the reader to understand in what direction we are moving forward.\n\nFew days ago I have read a news regarding the Russia approach to the affair. They desire to improve a Chinese-style government regulation of the Internet, a top official said Wednesday, after election protesters organised nationwide rallies through social networking sites.\n\u201cAttempts to stop people communicating are in principle counterproductive and even immoral. But we cannot ignore the use of the Internet by criminals and terrorist groups,\u201d Russia\u2019s Security Council chief Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with Argumenty i Fakty newspaper.\n\u201cOf course there should be reasonable regulation in Russia, just as it is done in the United States, China and many other countries.\u201d\n\nTranslating Russia intent, they are planning to release a massive monitor system that will be used to control internet usage of a Nations that in September became the European country with the largest number of Internet users, according to Comscore ratings agency, and the use of blogs and social networking sites has boomed in recent years.  Do you not find the news disturbing? Is it correct to operate in this way to ensure national security?\n\nChina as a model to follow, in which the plenum of the Communist Party in October, decided to put under the protection the Republic from \u201cimmoral TV \u2018network and from the mother of the disorders, internet.\nIn a previous post we discussed about the father of all the censorship project, \u201cThe Golden Shield\u201c, a system used to\nobscure sites with objectionable content, filtering every sort of network traffic and with whom he has had to confront even the giant \u201cSina Weibo\u201d, the Chinese version of Twitter, banned in the country since August 2009. \u201cSina Weibo\u201d is a colossus that can post 400 million of views, including those responsible for the boom of the Web in China: more than 500 million Internet users, Internet users the world record in the country that invests more nell\u2019ocuramento the Net.  The \u201cPeople\u2019s Daily\u201d, the official organ of the party has released a document in which the plenum concluded on October 18 launched a plan to control and management of social networks and instant messaging services requesting that all Chinese Internet users must be scheduled to internet access. It is in fact an offensive against the microblog, considered the weapon of the last Mediterranean and revolutions in China to escape state control.\n\nLet give a look to what is happening in India where the Minister Kapil Sibal seeks to censor User-Generated Content Online using humans to screen content and not technology, he said after a meeting with officials from Facebook, Google, YouTube and Yahoo on Monday, 5 December 2011.\nThis is a dangerous scenarios, Internet in India is under threat of censorship and e-surveillance. The Government has increased e-surveillance activities to intolerable limits. In first time the Government proposed central monitoring system (CMS) project of India without any parliamentary oversight, after the development of an Internet kill switch also given by India without public consent.\n\nVarious official reasons, the same intent. The United States joined to the common direction proposing the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) that is seriously undermining the principle of freedom of expression. The SOPA is a bill introduced on October 26, 2011 to the U.S. House of Representatives. If approved as proposed, would allow copyright holders to the U.S. to take direct action to prevent the spread of protected content. Imagine the potential impact of the legislation? To this info add the certainty that Cia and FBI use to monitor social network for any kind of investigation.\n\nThis few examples are enough to cover over half the worldwide internet users and to show how tenuous is the line between control and monitoring for safety and the imposition of a brutal censorship.  Needless to illusions, each surfer is now controlled and we need to take in serious consideration also the actions made by large corporations which are building what I call the \u201cprivate cansorship\u201d asserved to government orders. You can access to social platform, share videos, publish comment on a forum \u2026 but be aware to not violate any rule of conduct otherwise you can have an hugly surprise \u2026 your account could be disabled in the same time on differen social media. Try to believe!\n\nObviously the speech deserves more spacious than a few lines in this blog. Personally, I feel obliged to some reflection. I agree on the need for a cyber strategy that will undoubtedlyalso provide mechanisms for monitoring social media, but this does not justify the actions of censorship that can not be tolerated by a civilized society based on freedom of expression.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/media", "topic_name": "media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social", "topic_name": "Social"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}]}, {"news_name": "The year of the networked protest, from SOPA act to Anonymous", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/675/cyber-crime/675.html", "title": "The year of the networked protest, from SOPA act to Anonymous\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 15, 2011", "body": "It\u2019s end of the year and time for reflections. Yesterday we have discussed on incident occurred to CAs, but what else will we remember of this 2011? No doubts, we will remember the new way to use Internet, an irreplaceable vector for social protests, expression of social malaise and of too much stolen liberty.\n\nWe have often heard the word Hacktivism intending to use the usage of computers and computer networks as a Means of Protest to Promote political ends. The term is not new because it was first coined in 1998 by a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow hacker group. Hacking to fight censorship, to promote political ideology, sustain free speech and human rights.\n\n\n\nThe year of the networked revolution, from Wikileaks case to the Occupy movement to the Middle East, calls for political and personal freedom. The winds of protest are really strong, they are an hurricane, none is able to silet them. It is really difficult, the network is reacheable in just one click \u2026 a tweet, a post, a message could be spread to million on persons who share the same thought. This is the year of the social media, preciuos instruments to express the dissent against a power that is silently working to control every one repressing awkward voices.\n\nBut the danger is just around the corner, while we are stroking this breath of freedom, we realize that we are pawns in a much more complex boards. The main countries of the world join forces with large multinational companies to install complex monitor systems for communications, they deploy Internet kill switch to suppress protests in the bud. They spy on our phones and control our communications. Do you think the problem is only in China or India?\n\nDuring the last year we have observed political insurrection events in Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, Tunisia, let consider also mass protests against economic breakdown in Greece, Italy and Spain. Than there were the Occupy Wall Street moviments from New York to London. Events united by the same intent, express a dissent, and by the same vector used to inform public opinion and the problems, Internet.\n\nThis time is really hard, we are facing with the worst economic crisis, with social dissatisfaction and an overwhelming sense of profound vulnerability that the 11/9 has left. The mixture is explosive. On one hand, Governments that have to be able to control, hopefully for noble purposes, to ensure the safety of the people, on the other hand  movements of thought that can not tolerate the interference of these preventive measures.\n\nWe witnessed the consecration of groups of \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d as Anonymous who expressed opposition to a rotten system in every way and with success. In terms of security it has been a Waterloo. Underestimated, mocked by arrogant experts in the pay of the multinationals, have stepped up attacks of all kinds.\nAnd then here who have ventured into the operations of web site defacements of institutional portal, denial of service attacks against financial institutions, information theft, and virtual sit-ins. A protest with digital real effect and an important economical impact. They are a powerful political force genetically supported by the people.\n\nRemaining on subject of protests, objections and regulations let me invite you to read the act \u201cStop Online Piracy Act\u201d (SOPA), also known as H.R.3261, is a bill that was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on October 26. It expands the ability of U.S. law enforcement and copyright holders to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods.The bill would allow the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against websites accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement.\nThe interpretation of this Act could be really the event of 2011, indroducing \u201cde facto\u201d an Internet censorship, a digital dictatorship.\n\nWe meditate, this could represent a real step backwards for mankind, the death of the dream of freedom.  The act gives me a great contrast, I personally have always supported the freedom of expression, to be able to exercise free will and  I find it difficult to accept this legislation imposed on us in the name of global security. I am deeply convinced that this will not fight our real enemies, they just stir up fears and nourished the seeds of discord. Control and repression stifling the dialogue that is the only weapon that man has for a civil coexistence.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nhttp://owni.eu/2011/12/15/an-open-letter-from-internet-engineers-to-the-us-congress/#SOPA\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/act", "topic_name": "act"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/freedom", "topic_name": "freedom"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sopa", "topic_name": "SOPA"}]}, {"news_name": "From the mosaic theory to the stuxnet case", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/566/cyber-crime/from-the-mosaic-theory-to-the-stuxnet-case.html", "title": "From the mosaic theory to the stuxnet case\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 12, 2011", "body": "With the term of Mosaic theory we refer the method used in security analysis to gather information about a corporation. A natural extension of the method hit its application to ordinary life. Mosaic theory involves collecting information from different sources, public and private, to calculate the value of security.\n\nThe key concept is the collection and analyzing of huge quantity of information apparently unrelated. Images of a CCTV camera, some pictures on favorite social network, a series of post exchanged here and there on the web \u2026  all those information gathered over the years and to refer to any kind of research. The technological evolution has endowed us with things that made \u200b\u200bit easy to implement a so futuristic and powerful theory :\n\nAny information is ideally turn a piece of a mosaic can be handled appropriately and give shape to surprising results that lead to the discovery of new information on the reality in analysis.\n\nLet\u2019s try for example to exasperate the concept of research \u2026 let\u2019s use as ingredients \u201cStuxnet virus\u201d , add the \u201cvisit of President Ahmadinejad at a nuclear facility back in 2008\u201d, and crossed it all with a couple of pictures that were posted on the official website of the President. How are these information correlated?\n\n\n\nThe expert security Ralph Langner has demonstrated that paying attention to some of these images is possible to catch some meaningful details regarding the processes used inside the nuclear site, like its internal structure and number and disposition of its components. All this information are really useful to perform a cyber attack against this site.\n\nAs a brief recap, a first-generation Iranian uranium enrichment cascade consists of 164 centrifuges that are not simply piped in a serial fashion but in groups, which are called stages. Centrifuges within one stage are piped in parallel.  The resulting overall pattern is a belly-shaped curve. The exact shape of an IR-1 cascade was not publicly known but was computed in approximation by Alexander Glaser from Princeton, based on revelations of a talkative Gholam-Reza Aqazadeh who let the world know that Iran used to group their IR-1 cascades into fifteen stages. From the IR-1 cascade structure computed by Alex we were able to link Stuxnet\u2019s 417 attack code to Natanz \u2013 the match was simply too good to be a coincidence.\n\n\n\nMore information can be found in detail analyzing the photos that recall the president in front of a screen of the SCADA system present in the control room. Are clearly visible on the screen a series of green dots that represent the active centrifuges arranged in 4 rows, the provision reflects exactly the internal structure of the nuclear site.\n\nWe have found an exact match with the cascade structure as coded in Stuxnet.\n\nThe green dots that you see on the displays are operational centrifuges. There are four rows of green dots (and centrifuges) because this is how they physically group centrifuges in Natanz, as it can be determined easily by looking at the walk-around pictures of the 2008 presidential visit. Look closely at the grey columns below the green dots, highlighted in the detail view by added red arrows. It is easy to see that the column size varies. The rightmost column spans one green dot, the second rightmost column two green dots, then three dots, then four, then five, then six, and then it goes back to five, with the left column edge being overwritten by the ending \u201cr\u201d of the President\u2019s URL. After having looked at the pimped up detail view it is even easy to see in the original photograph, right?\n\nNow multiply the column sizes with four, because every column contains four centrifuges. That makes 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 20. Did we see this before? Yes, that\u2019s exactly the cascade structure as coded in Stuxnet. It also suggests that stage 15 in Natanz is using the rightmost four centrifuges being piped together, stage 14 the next eight centrifuges, and so forth (in Farsi they are writing from right to left).\n\nExcellent isn\u2019t it? Seemingly insignificant information, locate on different time axis, help to provide basic details related to one of the main mystery in the past few months.\n\nWhile in the past the collection of information was related to a few areas, today we move along each axis of interest and the analysis no longer about the single individual but the totality of population.\nThis of course has positive and negative aspects that we can well imagine.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://wlcentral.org/node/2381\n\nhttp://www.langner.com/en/2011/12/07/the-prez-shows-his-cascade-shape/\n\nhttp://www.yalelawjournal.org/images/pdfs/358.pdf\n\n \n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mosaic-theory", "topic_name": "Mosaic Theory"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "India The blurred line between defense and cyber censorship", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/523/cyber-crime/india-the-blurred-line-between-defense-and-cyber-censorship.html", "title": "India The blurred line between defense and cyber censorship\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 11, 2011", "body": "In this article I wish to bring to your attention what I regard as gross contradiction of a nation whose people I admire for their professionalism and dedication to work, India. In my previous article \u201cCyber India\u201d lights and shadows of the country full of contradictions I presented a picture of the nation in terms of cyberwarfare, nation aware of the threat that is fighting against many internal difficulties. It is preparing to adopt measures to strengthen its position in cyber space. Just as I was writing, confirming that which has been described related the potential threat looming, a disturbing news has been published on the web:\n\nChina hacked India\u2019s intel network: Assange\n\nWhat\u2019s happen? China hacked India\u2019s intelligence network and the West intercepted mails and phone calls from India, that\u2019s Wikileaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s stunning disclosures at HT Leadership summit.\n\nJulian Assange said, \u201cTelephone connections and e-mails from India that go through the Pacific (Ocean) can be intercepted and are being intercepted by the West. The information acquired from their intercepts are used as economic intelligence.\u201d\n\nHe also says that:\n\n\u201cChinese intelligence penetrated into the intelligence system of the Indian government including the Indian equivalent of FBI, the Central Bureau of Investigation,\u201d\n\n\u201cInformation on foreign bank accounts held by Indians will come out within the next year,\u201d\n\nThis event, as you can imagine, can be really dangerous for economic stability of India and for its reputation. Of course we are free to believe or not the statements of Assange, always at the center of fierce debate, however, the problem referred is real.\n\nWe are faced with a Nation that is going to play a crucial role in the global economic arena in the coming decades, but that is totally unprepared for events like this before.  To be honest, India is beginning to worry about managing the cyber threat, but probably not in the best way.\n\nThe Information Security and Analysis Center (ISAC) has initiated efforts to enlist the best and brightest among India\u2019s ethical hackers in an effort shore up the nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture. India is also looking to establish itself as a global leader in addressing cyber security issues. In October, Indian Communications & Information Technology Minister Shri Kapil Sibal and the EastWest Institute (EWI) hosted the Third Worldwide Cybersecurity Summit in New Delhi,India.\n\n\u201cTo combat cyber crimes and make the cyberspace secure, there is a need for greater government-to-government collaboration on sharing of information, global vision to deal with hackers, legal framework that addresses the requirements at the global, and wider public-private collaboration,\u201d said Sibal.\n\nThe \u201cNew Delhi Summit Process,\u201d is composed of three high-level working groups comprised of Indian and international experts. To each group is assigned specific cybersecurity issues:\n\nExcellent you say. Fully shared the approach of the Government. But while I\u2019m congratulating with them a news has appalled me.\n\nIndian Minister Kapil Sibal seeks to censor User-Generated Content Online. How he will do it? Using humans to screen content and not technology, he said after a meeting with officials from Facebook, Google, YouTube and Yahoo on Monday, 5 December 2011.\n\n\n\nHe asked them to screen what goes on the sites. Internet censorship in India should not be a norm in a democratic country like India. Censorship of internet is bypassing the constitutional mandates amount to anarchy that should not be the norm in India.\n\nInternet in India is under potential threat of censorship and e-surveillance. Internet censorship and e-surveillance in general in India have increased to intolerable limits.\n\nIn first time the Government proposed central monitoring system (CMS) project of India  without any parliamentary oversight, after the development of an Internet kill switch also given by India without public consent. Hey \u2026 but a Internet kill switch and censorship action are not a solution to cyber threats.  I\u2019m not surprise if what Assange have declared is really happened.\n\nWhat is more worrisome is that e-surveillance and Internet censorship systems in India have increased without any lawful interception law in an unconstitutional manner.  To worsen the situation Internet intermediaries in India have been asked to analyze and monitor contents before they are posted on their platforms. India wants companies like Google and Facebook to censor users\u2019 contents.\n\nThe government seems hasn\u2019t understood where the cyber threat came from and this could lead to unnecessary distractions and a delay in the homogeneous development of the Country.\nGentlemen attention, the threat is elsewhere! In this way you are fighting only the privacy of the citiziens!\n\nThey are watching in the wrong direction!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defense", "topic_name": "defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "Top Nine cyber security trends for 2012?

It is possible that during the next year we will see a rise in attacks which target the worldwide infrastructures that supports SSL. Impervia expects that these attacks will reach a tipping point in 2012. According their forecast it will be the year of the \u201cbreak point\u201d inducing serious discussion about real alternatives for secure web communications. My point of you is quite different. From my prospective SSL is a fine session encryption protocol that is being inappropriate to protect security for Internet based transaction systems because it was not designed for this purpose and it is dated. Several critics can be addressed to the model, for example the incredible number of Certification Authority and their way to protect their \u201ctrust chain\u201d. Comodo case is the worst case we have observed during last year. Which could be valid alternatives \u2026 well, the \u201cConvergence\u201d model launched by Marlinspike is a good one , a secure replacement for the certificate authority system with excellent performances.\n\nTrend #8: HTML 5 goes live \u2013\n\nThe main problem is that HTML5 is not scheduled for official approval by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) until 2014. Developers, meanwhile, want to run the latest technology now. So they will either use proprietary plug-ins such as Flash or protocols considering them a standard.\n\nDuring last few years, vulnerabilities in browsers\u2019 add-ons (third party components such as adobe\u2019s Flash Player or Oracle\u2019s Java) were the significant cause of \u201czero-day\u201d exploits.  Consider that the HTML 5 standard was created to enable browsers to support a richer end user experience in a standardized way. While the new features are attractive to web developers, they are also very beneficial for hackers. I totally agree on this point the events occurred during the last couple of months of 2011 are demonstrating it.\n\nTrend #7: DDoS moves up the stack \u2013 For many reasons this will be one of the main threats of the new year. The year 2011 was a terrible year regarding the number of attacks perpetrated suing this technique. Attacks of this type are widely used for expression of dissent and hacktivism \u2026 and dissent is unfortunately destined to grow. I\u2019m concerned about the conjunction DDOS with other dangerous attacks like spear phishing , because similar techniques used in the same time could create very powerful offensive action.\n\nTrend #6: Internal collaboration meets its evil twin I disagree and do not perceive the criticality as proposed.\n\nTrend #5: NoSQL = No Security? \u2013 I share the concern. I believe that inadequate security mechanisms of distributed  data sources will create several problems like it is happened during the current year.\n\nTrend #4: The kimono comes off of consumerized IT \u2013\n\nFrankly I have not understood the magnitude of the threat and materialize in the coming year. What would make this threat so terrifying the next year? Frankly I did not understand \u2026and you?\n\nTrend #3:  Anti-social media \u2013 As many more organizations are making their way into the social media space, we expect to see a growing impact to the integrity and confidentiality of the enterprise\u2019s information. Moreover, we expect hackers will continue to automate social media attacks, exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe openness to new forms of communication brings undoubted benefits but surely increases the attack surface of each company. The exhibition is expected to increase considerably in 2012 \u2026 it is hoped that together increase the security mechanisms needed to countless threats related to such exposure.\n\nTrend #2: The Rise of the middle man \u2013 I share the prediction on the rise of the cyber broker. This individual matches the buyers of stolen data or compromised machines (aka \u201cbots\u201d) with the sellers of the data (or bot renters).  In the same way stocks and investors gave rise to stock markets, hackers need a middleman. That is an interesting scenario!\n\nTrend #1: Security trumps compliance \u2013 In the past, security decisions were usually driven by compliance.  However, in 2012 we expect to see security decisions driven by security. Considering that the cost of a breach rising, industrialized hacking impacting many organizations and the need to protect of intellectual property, this means that we will probably see more companies making cyber security decisions based on security.\n\nDespite I consider really interesting the Imperva experts\u2019 analysis I believe it is an incomplete list of some of the threats which I consider among the most worrisome.\nWhich one? Following my supplementary list:\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #1 \u2013 The spread of the cloud paradigm will bring with it a series of problems far from negligible.The cloud platforms today are daughters of an aggressive marketing and immature security models. What if cloud platforms were used as a strike force against a predetermined target. It would be a catastrophe, an offensive before which any system would be helpless.\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #2 \u2013 Socialmedia diffusion will be really high. It was becoming a weapon and a battlefield. Governments and private companies have understood the critical of new media platform like social network. Through social network you can collect information, you can perform complex data mining researches, but you can also spread malware and influence common sentiment and event perception \u2026 that is a really a big threat.\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #3 \u2013 Improved Social Engineering Attacks. Attackers will increasingly make use of social-engineering tactics to bypass technological security controls, fine-tuning their techniques to exploit natural human predispositions. We\u2019ve already seen such approaches succeed at influencing victims into clicking on questionable links, opening exploit-laden attachments, and installing malicious software. \n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #4 \u2013  Large diffusion of  Custom Malware developed to attack specific target, Stuxnet Virus and Duqu malware are a good examples. Which will be their evolutions?\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #5 \u2013  2012 will be the year of the IPv6 consolidation? Well consider that its implementation has today to much obscure issues.\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #6 \u2013  Sensible grow for firmware and hardware hack. \n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #7 \u2013  Mobile Security Issue. Increasingly sophisticated mobile devices and for which there is  low perception of threats that can compromise the integrity and security.\n\nSome examples are Ransomware \u201d (an infection that holds a device \u201chostage\u201d until a \u201cransom\u201d payment is delivered) to Take Mobile Devices Hostage and worming into Android platform that are able to quickly propagate from one device to another.\n\nAs you can see the threats listed by me and not on the initial list Imperva is far from negligible, in fact likely to become soon the nightmares of those responsible for security in the coming months.\nAre you agree?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.imperva.com/docs/HI_Security_Trends_2012.pdf\n\nhttp://www.sans.edu/research/security-laboratory/article/security-predict2011\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/06/idUS96123+06-Dec-2011+HUG20111206\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/07/28/html5-poses-threat-to-flash-and-the-app-store/\n\nhttp://www.gartner.com/technology/research/predicts/\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certification-authority", "topic_name": "Certification Authority"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/convergence", "topic_name": "Convergence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl", "topic_name": "SSL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "The utopian privacy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/469/digital-id/the-utopian-privacy.html", "title": "The utopian privacy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 7, 2011", "body": "Are you able to imagine a world in which everybody is free to communicate without being intercepted, spied on, tracked? Have you ever dreamt, reading sad and bad news pages on the censure of many governments, a world where the concept of freedom of thought has been materialized?\n\nIn recent decades we have witnessed radical change communication and the emergence of powerful new channels for sharing information. We think of social networks, the various Facebook, Twitter or Google + \u2026 millions, billions of people eager to communicate, share without fear, away from prying eyes.\n\nWhat to say about the explosion of mobile and the impact on daily life. We are in constant contact with our friends, with colleagues, sharing photographs, documents, and geographic location.Too bad too many people ignore that these tablet that we carry with us, like the smartphone, are equivalent to our computers and as such should be protected.\n\nAnd which are the main mode to communicate on working places. Simple to reply! We prefer even emails to invite our fellow desk to go get some coffee. Then came Skype with video with this powerful tool we can communicate, share files, chat in the absolute belief of many that it can not be intercepted.\n\nWake up. \u201cThey\u201d control us, \u201cThey\u201d control our children, \u201cThey\u201d listen to our communications and read our mail, \u201cThey\u201d know our movements.The statements may appear strong, paranoid, but \u201cTheir\u201d interference goes beyond the imagination. But who do I mean by \u201cthey\u201d? \u201cThey\u201d are our own Governments that drive the adoption of technological means of which require control. Check the network, censor content, intercept the threats.They continuous try to impose any kind of control using laws and formal Act, inviting ISP to trace our data and Telecom Operator to register our communications.\n\nBut what are the real causes of such interference?\n\nThere are two main reasons,\n\nThis second intent is the most dangerous, and even those two reasons are overlapped. Too often in the name of national security is abused to exercise control, unfortunately for private purposes. It \u2018happened to us in Italy, it is common practice in many industrialized countries.\n\n\n\nCarrierIQ scandal, a company that would have deployed on an unspecified number of mobile phones of different brands and models, a silent app able to spy on customers. After reporting of the researcher Trevor Eckhart we have observer tepid denials from CarrierIQ, and the emergence of an uncomfortable truth. The citizens are being spied on. I would like to believe that the producers were unaware of what the device does, but I am skeptical. Who is behind this, and in situations like these how they mediate the exposure? Government simply denied any reference, any involvement of the majors firms, to impute guilt to a small company to be dismantled and provide a remedy to eliminate the spy agent. But what actually install on the devices when they initiate the removal of the app? who knows. The same app works at a very low level, a sort of backdoor and it is developed to be multi-platform. But how much will cost? It has been argued that the costs are certainly not insignificant, and above the primary business of the same company, so why spy the citiziens?\n\nQuestions to which no response can be provides.\n\nAnother case was related to Skype flaws that can be used to track the final user, localizing its position in a simple way. The news came after that some months ago the \u201cThe Chaos Computer Club\u201d hacker group have discovered that the German Government  is in possibly to intercept Skype call for investigations.\n\nWe Could Go on for hours quoting Chinese censorship technology through the implementation of the \u201cGolden Shield\u201d project, introducing such events as the daily Tender Called by the Russian government to build a network monitoring system.\n\nFinally we discuss the social network platforms used to control people and relationships, and, unfortunately, to try and direct the sentiment of generations on issues of social interest, that I think the more subtle form of interference, and I call \u201cpsychological interference.\u201d\n\nThe situation is complex, impossible to manage, because of the enormous interests at stake. We discuss the control of information, access to information in a privileged way primary, before it can be manipulated.\nFrankly, I have no hope, \u201cThey\u201d will push more and more to have total control over the individual, hacking their minds, and this perhaps simply implanting a chip while we vaccinate against another pandemic created in the laboratory .\nWe are children of the era in the concept of privacy has been alienated.

We live alternative lives, we have dense networks of relationships, we feel the irrepressible urge to be part of a group, to fill the void that we carry within. But this human propensity to aggregation is now the foundation of the concept of \u201csocial network\u201c, a community of people, each of  them defined \u201cnode\u201d by researches, which are united by friendship, kinship,  passions, interests, religious beliefs. The whole world is represented by a lattice structure that scientists have long taken to study, to achieve the classification of that human \u201cnode\u201d, classify and customs, and especially to predict the behavior of single and through its influence the response of the community a particular event. The philosophy is that of the control.\n\n\n\nIn May 2011 I have defined the term \u201csocial network poisoning\u201d writing before to Wikipedia EN and also to Italian Wiki.\n\nThe term social network refers to the \u201cpoisoning\u201d effect produced by the application of methods designed to make unreliable the knowledge related to a profile and its relationships. The application of this kind of attack on a large-scale could lead to the collapse of Social Networking platforms affect its value for commercial purposes, as well as the utility in terms of knowledge and correlation of data provided by users, with a significant impact on its economic value.\n\nIn the same way as the \u201croute poisoning\u201d (affecting the telecommunications network), the \u201cpoisoning action\u201d are conducted with the aim to pollute the contents of this social network profiles typically introducing artifacts and relationships exist between them and real ones thus making the information unreliable. The result is the consequent failure of the chain of trust which are based on all social networks, in order not to allow search engines specifically developed to retrieve information of any kind relating to a particular profile.\n\nStarting from the assumption that the Internet and in particular the social network lacks a coherent and safe management of digital identity, it is possible to introduce the main tools currently poisoning hypothesize new and viable in a future scenario\nCurrent tools\n\nFuture instruments:\n\nHow easy to understand the interest in social networks are the stars. Complex systems analyze information, scan faces and places, building new relationships and providing new information. Government agencies and companies have realized the full potential of the medium, a real gold mine in which the imperative is the power, information, and control of a at the expense of a user too distracted and inattentive to the dangers ahead.\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Social Network Poisoning)\n\n \n\nSpecial thanks to \n\nMohit Kumar \u2013 Founder and CEO at The Hacker News\n\nAndrea Zapparoli Manzoni \u2013 Founding Partner @ iDialoghi Srl\n\nCalogero Bonasia \u2013 BPM Senior Analyst\n\nReferences\n\nSocial Network Poisoning  (IT)\n\nhttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Network_Poisoning\n\nhttp://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/?p=331\n\nhttp://news.thehackernews.com/THN-dec2011.pdf\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network-poisoning", "topic_name": "social network poisoning"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spy", "topic_name": "spy"}]}, {"news_name": "Assange, Spy Files and uncomfortable truths", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/346/digital-id/assange-spy-files-and-uncomfortable-truths.html", "title": "Assange, Spy Files and uncomfortable truths\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 2, 2011", "body": "If we talk about security which could be our worst nightmare?

When I have speculated all this scenarios months ago, they called me paranoid, visionary, conspiracy theorist. Yet it happened! How can we still save our privacy policy and how?\n\nEvery day there is an unimaginable number of intercepted information, whether phone, email, SMS and data.

The documents describe how the police is able to access to Facebook user information or to the services provided by companies such as AOL and Microsoft.\n\nOn Cryptome site are also available some guides that explains to cops how to investigate on a person who has used the Yahoo! Messenger. The manual describe how to recover from the computer all the past conversations, even when the function is disabled which provides for the creation of a chat log.  The Cryptome is a true mine that offer in a single place many forensics analysis guide to explain how retrieve all the information from a smartphone like the iPhone bypassing any protection to access to content like sms and photos and other file stored in its memory even if deleted by the user.\n\nFor this analysis Cryptome has used the latest documents provided by the activists of \u201cAnonymous\u201d group and related to AOL, Microsoft. The information regarding Facebook have been provided by PublicIntelligence.net web site.\n\nReally interesting are the authorization procedures implemented to access to this data. Usually the police may need a search warrant or an instance of the court but sometimes the access is more simple.  When there is an emergency related to a concrete risk for human life or for National security issues, the information can be obtained in real time, even making a phone call to the supplier of services.\n\nSome documents report for example how to retrieve Facebook user\u2019s personal data under investigation. This document are directed to the police officer.  To access to the date it is necessary to provide to the offices of Facebook, via email or fax, user id and all the available information regarding the investigated profile. The user id is reported in the url of the profile. The Facebook company will reply within six weeks providing logs that include IP addresses of the user observed during their sessions. All this date are stored for a period with a duration of 90 days.  Of course Facebook is able to provide  \u2026 addition info like e-mail and phone of the person under investigation, its account creation date, last access date.\n\nAfter the online publication of these guidelines, Facebook has decided to upload \u2013 visible to everyone \u2013 a version of this document, updated to 2011 (but without explaining how long you retain log files with the IP, a company spokesman , asked the Cnet site, declined to answer the question).\n\nAOL, however, claims to preserve the logs with the IP messenger for 90 days, Internet users are kept up to 6 months and e-mail for a variable time. Periods of time that is specified in the document, \u201cmay be subject to change without notice.\u201d For emergencies, there is a dedicated phone line from AOL to the police, who need to obtain information as quickly as possible.\nCryptome have published some information regarding Microsoft and how the company manage profile of its users. Some files with IP addresses of Hotmail accounts are held on the servers for 60 days, no logs are stored for all the conversations in the chat on MSN. The policy is dated to 2005 and maybe it has been changed.\n\nI have always been a profound advocate of freedom of expression and thought, however, can not deny that the disclosure of information such as this topic has left me very interdict. The information disclosed are not new for us but to make this information public can cause several problems. How many investigators will improvise, how many will decide that just reading few pages is the shortest path to become security experts, and with what consequences?\nI find it proper to inform the users of a social network on the way in which their data are managed. How many and which information are managed for each user profile and for how long they will be available on corporate servers? Would not it be correct to inform users of the availability of such information so they can access them every time they desire?\nI have a doubt \u2026 and if these files were the result of a campaign of disinformation?\n\nAnd if the user data were stored on a permanent basis to allow for future investigation and analysis by government agencies?\n\n\u2026 I fear that this might be the inconvenient truth.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://publicintelligence.net/facebook-law-enforcement-subpoena-guides/\n\nhttp://cryptome.org/isp-spy/aol-spy3.pdf\n\nhttp://cryptome.org/isp-spy/cellular-spy3.pdf\n\nhttp://cryptome.org/isp-spy/facebook-spy3.pdf\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloud", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptome", "topic_name": "Cryptome"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/networks", "topic_name": "networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/truth", "topic_name": "truth"}]}, {"news_name": "The business of Censorship.

The project is related to the development of the most efficient system of censorship and surveillance in the world of the People\u2019sRepublic of China.\n\nThe project was started in 1998 and officially began in 2003 driven by the government to operate the control of what had become the platform for communication and dissemination most important in the country, internet (officially introduced in 1994).\n\nSince 1997 the Ministry of Public Security started the activities to govern Internet usage with official regulations.  The key conept of the regulation are the Articles 4-6:\n\n\u201cIndividuals are prohibited from using the Internet to: harm national security; disclose state secrets; or injure the interests of the state or society. Users are prohibited from using the Internet to create, replicate, retrieve, or transmit information that incites resistance to the PRC Constitution, laws, or administrative regulations; promotes the overthrow of the government or socialist system; undermines national unification; distorts the truth, spreads rumors, or destroys social order; or provides sexually suggestive material or encourages gambling, violence, or murder. Users are prohibited from engaging in activities that harm the security of computer information networks and from using networks or changing network resources without prior approval.\u201d\n\nPurpose of the project is to block content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through and consists of standard firewalls and proxy servers at the Internet gateways. Through DNS cache poisoning it\u2019s possible to make unreachable when specific web sites are requested.\n\nIn October 2001, Greg Walton of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development published a report; he wrote:\n\nOld style censorship is being replaced with a massive, ubiquitous architecture of surveillance: the Golden Shield. Ultimately, the aim is to integrate a gigantic online database with an all-encompassing surveillance network \u2013 incorporating speech and face recognition, closed-circuit television, smart cards, credit records, and Internet surveillance technologies\n\nChina has implemented most sophisticated Internet content-filtering that is able to effectively filters content using multiple methods of regulation and technical controls:\n\nThis is a real battle in the cyber space that involve the world\u2019s largest online population and weapon created by Chinese government is an advanced Internet censorship and surveillance system to monitor their activity.  What are the targets of censorship? We can categorize the censored contents as\n\nThe Chinese model is a reference for all the others authoritarian regimes but not only for them. We are assisting to a challenge engaged by governments worldwide like USA that desire to legislate cyber space and impose their control to prevent any form of terrorism and dissents. We are observing a growing trend toward Internet censorship in a range of countries that are investing in the necessary technology to implement the control. The technologies are exactly the same used to secure network infrastructure from attack.\n\nWe are facing a new business opportunity, control and censorship through complex content filtering platforms. Just a few days ago I published the news on a tender held by the Soviet government on the implementation of a similar system (http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/?p=156)\n\nOn August Bloomberg reported on Bahrain\u2019s use of surveillance software developed by Nokia  and Siemens to intercept messages and collect information on human rights activists, resulting in their arrest and torture. Countries like Syria, Egypt, Bahrain, Thailand, Lybia are acquiring, or have already bought, surveillance systems and this means the that we will observe block to web activities for their citizens, in the best case, and in worst case brutal suppress of dissent. Electronic Frontier Foundation has documented the sale of surveillance equipment by several companies, including Cisco and Nortel, to China causing torture, cruel, inhuman or other degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention.\n\nIt is wrong to believe that only this government control and monitor web usage , we are living in the era of fake freedom. Do you believe to be able to surf on internet without external control? You are foolish! Western government use in differ way this powerful platform to prevent terrorism, frauds, pornography but also to monitor the sentiment of entire population and maybe to influence it.\n\nPlease analyze the transparency report produced by Google that regularly receives requests from government agencies and courts around the world to remove content from their services and hand over user data. Government Requests tool discloses the number of requests we receive from each government in six-month reporting periods with certain limitations \u2026 you will notice that behind China there are Countries like Germany and France. Surprised? Do you believe that all the request are related to piracy or similar issue?\n\nThe Google itself has been accused to implement censorship with its search engine. Some samples? In the United States, Google commonly censors search results to comply with Digital Millennium Copyright Act-related legal complaints.\n\nOn April 2008, Google refused to run ads for a UK Christian group opposed to abortion, explaining that they were non compliant to Google policy, but this meas that Google could decide what is indexable and what no based on its policies \u2026 dangerous.\n\nWho control the controller?\n\nI conclude with a question: << what sense does it talk about human rights when Western companies cultivate a bloody business selling this systems?>>\n\n(Pierluigi Paganini)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall_of_China\n\nhttp://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/\n\nhttp://sethf.com/anticensorware/general/google-censorship.php\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google#Censorship\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/09/government-internet-surveillance-starts-eyes-built\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/cisco-and-abuses-human-rights-china-part-1\n\nhttp://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/0706_cn_surveillance_and_information_technology.pdf\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 China, Golden Shield)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "Social Network \u201cin-security\u201d", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/192/cyber-crime/social-network-%e2%80%9cin-security%e2%80%9d.html", "title": "Social Network \u201cin-security\u201d\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 17, 2011", "body": "In recent years social networks have succeeded  in the historic feat of bringing to the web a growing number of users. Jupiter users, the elderly, individuals and businesses all within the large network, many, too much, share the total awareness of what happens when they put their credentials or when attracted by a novice or by a video click on a link.\n\nOr this behavior often blind managers of the major social platforms do not provide useful information because it can spread real awareness of the threat they face. Social networks have a primary purpose, they are designed to stimulate the sharing of personal information, more data a person discloses, more useful he is to the entire business.\n\nRecent events have demonstrated that social platforms implement policies very strict in terms of security, consider for example that they don\u2019t encourage users to choose strong passwords, they don\u2019t encourage users to change passwords periodically exposing them to serious risk. 80% of the users reuse the same weak credentials in different context, business and economic usage included.\n\nConsider that around 5 millions of FB accounts were compromised during last year and the numbers is expected to grow. This means that the entire trust chain can be compromised decreeing the end of the business model behind the Social network.  To contribute to the growth of the risks of using social networks is the massive use of mobile computing. The perception that a mobile device can be exposed to the same threats of a desktop pc is virtually nothing in common use. Some studies of the major antivirus software companies show that the user ignores even the possibility of \u201cinfecting\u201d a mobile device. If we project this conception in a work context, the entire security infrastructure could be undermined by what is the weak link in the chain, the undisciplined use of a social network perhaps even through a mobile device.\n\nAnother possible threat that affects social networks is the social engineering. Unprecedented growth of user base, ease of finding information about the victims through common search engines expose each user the possibility of being defrauded. The crime industry is well aware of the problem and potential revenues to the point that it is organized by providing real services for the collection of information relating to a potential victim of an attack. The social networking platforms have a huge quantity of information and knowledge for this reason  cyber criminals are interested to it.\n\nFor this thriving industry specific applications are designed to collection information, to aggregate profiles sharing particular attributes, systems able to analyze the social behavior of the victims identifying vulnerabilities  with the study of customs, traditions and relationships. The new frontier of social engineering. An example? Suppose we want to circumvent the user X, deputy manager for the project Y of a famous company. Knowing him relationships, creating new ones with fake profiles and managed ad hoc building for them a false reputation may soon come into possession of confidential info related to the project Y.\n\nBegin to make you an idea of the potential dangers? Another threat is carried by hackers who are able with various kinds of raids to insert malicious code directly into the social network through links or apps. Most of the time the user is redirected to sites designed to access personal information of the victim.  Incidents of hacktivism and cybercrime are growing, according official statistics because the increase over last year of similar events is about 300%.  The numbers are alarming but they represent only the tip of the iceberg of the phenomenon being referred to official cases and then analyzed. Most often  Cybercriminals use a technique called typosquatting, registering domains such as faecbook.com, fcaebok.com and so on in the hope of catching unwitting users.\n\nThese typosquatted domains are malicious in nature and pose a direct threat to your computing assets.  Websense, a leading content filtering company, has found that over 62% of active domains based on the most common misspellings of Facebook directed the user to malicious websites.  Consider the traffic volumes and the number of users involved in order to imagine the speed and capacity of spreading all kinds of malware.  This is called typosquatting. Cybercriminals are registering domains such as faecbook.com, fcaebok.com and so on in the hope of catching unwitting users.\n\nThese typosquatted domains are malicious in nature and pose a direct threat to your computing assets.  Researchers at Websense, a leading content filtering company, found that over 62% of active domains based on the most common misspellings of Facebook directed the user to malicious websites.  In a business context the above exponentially increases the risk of exposure. Social networks are a logical choice, the need to expose themselves in a market without borders, characterized by instant communication and the possibility to create an unlimited number of new relationships and then to run their business.\n\nBut the main risk in this case is the total absence of policies on the use of social media. Employees must have a thorough knowledge of the instrument, its potential and its risks, it is necessary to establish the objectives and parameters of a social initiative for the company, otherwise it goes against a disaster foretold. You must determine who is authorized to use social media on behalf of the company and what it is it allowed, what information can be managed in this area and what not at all.\n\nWhat are the conclusions? \u2026 Social networks are essential carrier in today\u2019s scenario, however we still have much to do in terms of user education. The cybercrime refines their weapons and before the threats  become unmanageable we must face the problem of security in depth.\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Public Tender for an Internet Content Monitoring System, really strange.", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/156/cyber-crime/public-tender-for-an-internet-content-monitoring-system-really-stange.html", "title": "Public Tender for an Internet Content Monitoring System, really strange.\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 13, 2011", "body": "Few days ago I have partecipated to an open discussion started by Stefano Mele, a security  and cyber-terrorism expert, on the development of Internet Content Monitor System by the Soviet government.\n\nIn April, the \u201cRussian Federal Service for Supervision Telecoms\u201d has announced it that it has launched a tender for developing a Content Monitor System with a budget of $ 530,000.  Following the tender the development phase was started in august and have to be completed in December. After an initial amazement is legitimate to ask  the following questions?\n\nLet us proceed by steps:\n\nBut what are they and what are these control platforms?\n\nThe system, according to official statements of government representatives, will be used for content analysis of online media outlets. Of course, systems with these characteristics can be used for the other purposes allowing the monitoring of any action or form of protest that can be expression of dissent against the government. The system must be able to analyze information composed by text and also pictures and videos on subjects which could be used to affect the subconscious mind with subliminal messages or similar.\n\nWhy lead a public tender for the development of such systems?\n\nIt is difficult to understand the real reasons. Why issue a public tender?

Hacktivist,Politicians, celebrities, revolutionists, and others use OSNs as carrier for their message to a wide audience.\n\nThe downside is that these powerful tools can be used to spread disinformation and propaganda. The next generation of social engineering attacks is even more deceptive; they employ an automation software called a socialbot that controls a profil in an OSN, and has the ability to execute basic online social activities.\n\nIn the attached paper, is demostrated how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infltration by socialbots: computer programs that control OSN accounts and mimic real users.
