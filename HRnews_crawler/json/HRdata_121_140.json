Technology has done so much in our lives, connecting us to family, friends, and lost friends; it has come and made life simpler. But in life with every good thing, there are always some people who want to do something negative with it. The idea of privacy is something that is sensitive at the moment. Smartphone makers, tech innovators, and others may do all they can to block surveillance from the government or from hackers but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all up to us to be vigilant about it.The Edward Snowden leaks of 2013 revealed so much about government surveillance on innocent people. Not only did the American government snoop on their citizens, but they were also targeting foreign dignitaries and diplomats. Another case in Canada also exposed how easy it is for cybercriminals to hack your laptop cam and watch you while you are in bed.must readTime To Cover Webcams: Wannabe Hackers Invading Your Privacy Using RATThis all boils down to one point; when it comes to security and privacy you the user are responsible. Now through all this, surveillance is done in many ways. Most people (hackers and the government) are using the cameras on smartphones and laptops to spy on users. How? Who knows its technology, but fortunately there are ways to stop this. Cameras on our phones and laptops have become one of the prime sources for surveillance, and the following are steps on how to be safe from these attacks.Who knew that our personal phone cameras could be used to spy on us, unknowingly? A television news reporter, Michael Sorrentino found out that school-issued laptops were being used to watch children. This was disturbing of course. People took action and started covering their laptop cameras. Problem number one solved.Unbeknownst to us then, the smartphone camera is also another tool that can be used by cronies and crooks to snoop on someone without their consent. Smartphones go everywhere people go. People carry them wherever they are so surely they make for easier targets.Sorrentino did research about camera covers people could use to solve the problem on the table and unfortunately there was no camera cover case. Thus, he created his own The EyePatch Case. The EyePatch Case is a very simple solution to a complex problem, according to Sorrentino himself.The fact that we have to make such products makes us question humanity as a whole. We should not be worried about things like, have I covered my camera or not before you go to sleep or something.The EyePatch Case works through the use of a switch. When you flick the switch cameras on both ends of the phone are covered completely. Simple indeed. It\u2019s a useful physical solution to a digital problem.Hiding a laptop camera is a piece of cake. Just put a sticker but make sure the sticker is non-transparent otherwise it would be useless to put it up there.In case you want to buy a special laptop cam cover to give a neat look while hiding the cam at the same time, you can also buy one online or from a cell phone accessory store.On a serious note if you can\u2019t find a sticker just put a band-aid.After all, this is said and done; we still need to take into account Snowden\u2019s revelations. The government was unknowingly spying people. And how can we stop the snooping? A sticker!! Yes, low-tech solutions to high-tech problems. Another way to stop the intrusion of microphones is by using dummy plug into the microphone jack which would prevent the hacker from picking up the sound with their internal mic.

This feature appears like an Easter egg and lets users access numerous functions quickly. It doesn\u2019t develop additional improvements in the computer but creates a folder containing a collection of most frequently used and most useful control panel options. This folder is an extremely important one because unlike other folders it does not display a folder icon after being created and turns itself into a God Mode link. It also treats system directories in a completely different manner.But, according to the analysis of McAfee researchers, God Mode feature contains a malicious code that uses the similar name as the God Mode folder to evade detection. Considering the importance of this folder, this revelation is indeed unsettling that Windows God Mode is being exploited by a malware. God Mode is although a very integral and commonly known system tweak from Microsoft but as of now it hasn\u2019t been officially documented. This is why a number of applications and tools cannot access items that are contained in this particular folder and hence, the folder presents the perfect opportunity for a malware to penetrate and hide into a system.As per McAfee researchers, the feature is plagued by a new version of the already existing malware Dynamer. Once it is installed in a device it quickly deploys itself in the AppData directory of Windows OS and then easily establishes its presence in a master control panel directory, which is identical to God Mode.If the user suspects the presence of this malware and even manages to track down the location of the executable, the modified folder would again connect to the Desktop Connections control panel and RemoteApp item because the malware\u2019s developer has taken extreme care in making it irremovable. The malware uses folder name \u201ccom4.{241D7C96-F8BF-4F85-B01F-E2B043341A4B}\u201d, which is a master stroke because in Windows OS anything that has Com4 in its name will be given special privileges. So, Internet Explorer and cmd.exe also consider this folder as a device and thus, the fake folder becomes immune to file management and console commands.Solution:However, don\u2019t lose heart because it is only named as God Mode but there is no divinity involved in this case and it can be removed easily since the malware only uses some exploitable vulnerabilities of Windows. You can easily delete it by killing all the processes from Task Manager and then on the command prompt entering this command: \u201crd \u201c\\\\.\\%appdata%\\com4.{241D7C96-F8BF-4F85-B01F-E2B043341A4B}\u201d /S /Q.\u201dThis command will delete the malware by deleting the directory. But this issue has highlighted the main problem at hand, which is that Microsoft has to do something to stop directories from being created so easily. Otherwise, several other malware will emerge and make use of Windows features.There\u2019s more on this malware on Mcafee\u2019s blog.", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "May 5, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Bug Bounty", "Bugs", "Facebook", "Flaws", "hacking", "Instagram", "Social Media", "Vulnerability"], "title": "10-year-old Kid Hacks Instagram, Gets $10,000 Reward from Facebook", "body": "If a security researcher wants to take part in Facebook\u2019s bug bounty program there is an age requirement but the 10-year-old Finish kid Jani ( the last name not revealed) hacked Instagram and reported it to the Facebook and got 10,000 USD as a reward.The Finnish news site Iltalehti reported that Jani earned $10,000 by taking part in Facebook\u2018s bug bounty program, which offers big bucks to hackers and researchers for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities and security flaws in Facebook.

The malware is distributed via a series of infected subdomains that are actually registered with an authentic domain name, which is owned by a popular shared hosting service provider based in Russia.The malware has been dubbed as RuMMS because the URLs used in this particular scheme are all in the same format: hxxp://yyyyyyyy[.]XXXX.ru/mms.apkHere XXX.ru represents the domain name.FireEye experts noted:\u201cSo far we identified seven different URLs being used to spread RuMMS in the wild. All of the URLs reference the file \u201cmms.apk\u201d and all use the domain \u201cXXXX.ru\u201d, which belongs to a top five shared hosting platform in Russia (the domain itself has been obfuscated to anonymize the provider).\u201d\u201cThe threat actors registered at least seven subdomains through the hosting provider, each consisting of eight random-looking characters (asdfgjcr, cacama18, cacamadf, konkonq2, mmsmtsh5, riveroer, and sdfkjhl2.) The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims.\u201dHow the attack occurs?The victims are attracted to download the malicious code of the malware through SMS phishing campaign in which a short SMS message is sent to the victims. This message contains the infected URL link. Unsuspecting users immediately click on the harmless looking link. As soon as they do so, RuMMs infects their devices immediately. This infection process has been described by FireEye in this diagram:When the malware is able to infect the device of the victim, the malware\u2019s app asks for administrator privileges and will delete all the icons that belong to the app so that the victim doesn\u2019t detect it.

Between this period the company has observed around 300 different samples of the same family. It has been observed by security experts that the malware\u2019s operational capabilities are controlled from the remote C2 server. We can, therefore, assume that the C2 server can customize the contents of the SMS messages that are to be distributed to expand the scope of this malicious Smishing campaign. The servers also determine the recipients of these outgoing messages and also the timespan during which the voice calls will be forwarded.FireEye\u2019s investigators emulated an already infected Android device to communicate with the C2 server of the RuMMS malware and they identified that the C2 server instructed their device to send out four different SMS messages to four unique numbers. The phone numbers were of Russia-based financial institutions. Three out of the four messages were aimed at checking out the account balance of the user at that particular institution. The fourth message\u2019s destination still remains unconfirmed. When the team probed further, they detected a number of forum posts in which various victims complained about transferring of up to 600 rubles from their accounts after their phones were infected with RuMMS malware.It cannot be confirmed as of now how many people have been affected by this malware but FireEye experts believe that \u201cthere have been at least 2,729 infections between January 2016 and early April 2016, with a peak in March of more than 1,100 infections.\u201dUsing a shared hosting service for spreading malicious malware campaigns is an extremely common, flexible and cost-effective option for threat actors and it is also quite difficult for network researchers to identify such a campaign where a moving target is the infrastructure. In Russia, various top service providers offer shared hosting services for very cheap rates and some even offer free 30-day trial period. So, it is quite easy for cyber criminals in Russia to register subdomains and use the service provider\u2019s offer for a brief period and later cancel the trial after fulfilling their malicious goals without even paying a penny.", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "date": "April 30, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Computers", "FBI", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Tor", "USA"], "title": "FBI Given Powers by Supreme Court To Hack Any Device They Want, How They Want", "body": "The US Supreme Court has given a fatal blow to the tech world and its companies after passing regulations which entitle the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to be able to hack into computers.

The new rules will also give the FBI to enter the victims phones, and the legislation will take effect from December this year, that is unless the Congress, both lower and upper, decide to make up contesting legislation.Under previous federal rules that were in force which pertained to criminal proceedings, a magistrate judge could not just issue out a search warrant unless the authorities knew where the computer or mobile device in question was. This was due to the jurisdiction matter which would come into effect.The new rule change, which was sent to Congress as soon as it was passed, however, allows a magistrate to issue out a search warrant regardless of where the device is and whether the know about its whereabouts or not.

This tracking occurs in real-time and according to the university\u2019s computer science professor Ben Zhao, the leader of the research team, this is a \u201cmassive privacy problem.\u201d Professor Zhao personally tested this vulnerability for three consecutive days and identified that he was able to track his movements around Las Vegas.But how does it happen?

And alas, Tor dropped the Vidalia project back in 2013, as they found other user-friendly software they could implement on their browser.The Vidalia project which Edman worked on was also taken by Jacob Appelbaum, famous journalist, and hacker for the WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden.In 2012, Edman was working at one of FBIs Remote Operations Unit. He worked at Mitre Corporation as a senior cyber security engineer for the FBI. With the vast knowledge he got from working on the Tor project in his initial days, he eventually found himself involved in the Operation Torpedo, a sting that was against the child pornography sites that used Tor as a cloak of invisibility.Tor is a company that mainly works by using encryption to hide the identity of users who want to access the World Wide Web. It is also the one used to access sites such as the Dark Net sites which were primarily targeted by the Operation Torpedo. It is used by people from all walks of life, especially criminals. It is widely considered to be one of the most important and powerful Internet privacy tools built so far.

However, DARPA also aims to create a decentralized structure just like the Blockchain structure so that its app becomes immune to cyber attacks and spying. It can be understood that Pentagon\u2019s research arm DARPA needs to develop a perfectly encrypted messaging app so that hackers couldn\u2019t hack it.The information was revealed through a notice published to look for proposals for the development of such an app. This notice was posted on a government forum through which federal research funds are allocated to small businesses.The notice states that blue sky research wing of Pentagon basically wants to have a secure messaging app \u201cthat can provide repudiation or deniability, perfect forward and backward secrecy, time to live/self-delete for messages, one time eyes only messages, a decentralized infrastructure to be resilient to cyber-attacks, and ease of use for individuals in less than ideal situations.\u201dIt is thus, clearly evident that DARPA is in need of a highly secure \u201cpublic wall,\u201d which be easily used or monitored by anyone but cannot be decrypted by all except for those skilled ones.It must be noted that decentralized structure has numerous benefits such as it offer impressive resilience to surveillance because there isn\u2019t any particular centralized server available through which a spy or hacker could steal metadata.A freelance security researcher who helped in the development of Signal, Frederic Jacobs, states that this kind of a structure would certainly involve higher latency and it would also be hard to deploy it at such a massive scale as DARPA wants to. Jacobs acknowledges that when people will start using the service in larger proportions, \u201cit might become challenging to find messages that are addressed to you, without revealing to other people who have the data what exactly you are looking for.\u201dAccording to an official spokesman of DARPA, this unique messaging application will get developed in three stages in which the first stage would involve the creation of a model for the abovementioned decentralized structure. This stage will also involve experimentation on encryption schemes and protocols.In the second stage, the focus will shift towards development, testing and production of its working prototype while the third and final stage will focus entirely on the app\u2019s \u201ccommercialization and full-scale implementation.\u201dSo, we can assume that the research arm of Pentagon has quite ambitious aims but will their SBIR program be able to achieve this aim that is the bigger challenge.

Kaspersky Lab is one such company that stresses upon encouraging groundbreaking researches and discoveries.In one such attempt, Denis Legezo, a researcher at Kaspersky Lab, discovered how easy it is to tamper with traffic sensors in Moscow. He also showed how devastating its consequences could be since it can lead to poor traffic management and obviously that would lead to accidents and all sorts of mishaps for drivers and pedestrians.As per Legezo, he started researching about the potential, inherent vulnerabilities of traffic sensors in Moscow with gaining information about the models installed, the types of communication protocols involved sales related information, identifiers, software used for operating the devices and other key technical details. This, in his opinion, was crucial to the research and there was no ethical violation conducted by him as manufacturers are ready to give away every detail.\u201cThe openness showed by the manufacturers to installation engineers, their readiness to give them access to tools and documents, automatically means they are open to researchers,\u201d said Legezo.This data helped him create a scanner, which could potentially identify those devices that were vulnerable. He used it all over the city and finally came to the conclusion that one of the models of traffic sensors utilized Bluetooth for communicating data. He also identified that it was easy to install new firmware on this device through a wireless connection that is primarily created for servicing.Legezo explains:\u201cAfter selecting any of the identified sensors, you can install the device configuration software supplied by the vendor on your laptop, drive to the location (the physical address saved in the database), and connect to the device.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Legezo did manage to find the firmware of the device\u2019s manufacturer on the Internet but it was useless to get the code because he had no idea about the internal structure of controllers installed in the device.

The issue was that he didn\u2019t have the device to test his hypothesis.Legezo opines that modifying firmware wasn\u2019t as important because the easier technique would be using the software that the manufacturer provides for device configuration and sending out commands to them.He also noted that once the connection gets created with the traffic sensor through this tactic, the commands no longer remain hidden and a sniffer exposes them.\u201cTo sum up, a car driving slowly around the city, a laptop with a powerful Bluetooth transmitter and scanner software is capable of recording the locations of traffic sensors, collecting traffic information from them and, if desired, changing their configurations,\u201d noted legezo.To avoid any mishaps, he recommends that proprietary authentication above the standard protection layer should be implemented on all popular protocols.It will also help if non-standard identifiers and names are used.\u201cPersonally, I agree with the manufacturer and respect them for this, as I don\u2019t think the \u2018security through obscurity\u2019 approach makes much sense these days; anyone determined enough will find out the command system and gain access to the engineering software,\u201d he concluded.You can go through researcher\u2019s finding here.", "authur": "Ryan De Souza", "date": "April 21, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Palo Alto Networks"], "title": "Newly discovered PWOBot malware is a total keylogger", "body": "Now this can be termed as devastating news for computer users around the world.

These devices have been produced by Sochule, which recently acquired Anonabox.These tiny devices can easily fit into the palm of your hand. We can call them miniature routers too because these devices route the traffic of the devices that are connected with it via Tor anonymizing network or through a VPN to a VPN provider.These Anonabox devices may be tiny but these are highly effective. When the user connects to a website using them, his or her identity will remain hidden and anyone would find it difficult to determine the user\u2019s identity or location even.The launch of Anonabox devices was plagued with controversy and security concerns. However, Sochule fixed these concerns in the premiere offering and also improved the suite with three distinct variants offering varying degrees of security and functionality.Initial testing revealed that this is basically a plug-and-play Wi-Fi access point that is combined with Tor router and needs to be wired Ethernet or WiFi to function. So, when a device is connected to the access point of Anonabox through Wi-Fi, its traffic is redirected to the internet route via Tor. This makes identifying the user or his/her location on the internet difficult.The Anonabox pro is also available and is much speedy and compatible with a variety of devices than the preliminary version. Anonabox pro can be connected to the internet through wireless network whereas the previous version relies upon wired Ethernet. Pro version accepts VPN capabilities along with Tor and also supports setting up a Tor-based file sharing and server.Although you can conveniently configure Anonabox device but remember that you need to shut off the Wi-Fi connection of the device to the internet prior to powering it off. If you don\u2019t do so, chances are that you will be unable to connect to Wi-Fi when the next time you turn it on. In that case, you will have to rely upon wired Ethernet.A key benefit of Anonabox\u2019s pro version, apart from retaining anonymity, is that it protects its users from getting identified on a public WiFi network as well as let people to connect various devices to a public wifi network but continue to appear as single on the network.The drawback is that routing every packet via Tor makes the process time consuming and this somewhat affects the internet connection\u2019s speed and performance. When the device was tested for accessing YouTube, it turned out that smaller sized video could be accessed without any speed issues. Speed tests revealed that it offers ranges from 1megabit per second for download/upload to 5.7-download and 4.7-upload.One of the devices in the Anonabox series has a model that is named after the infamous Guy Fawkes mask, which is the symbol of hacktivists collective Anonymous. The model is called Fawkes and offers all the features of the original Anonabox device with some new add-ons like administrative interface. The last model is called Tunneler. It is only VPN dedicated and isn\u2019t compatible with Tor.It must be noted that using Anonabox doesn\u2019t make you completely untraceable because when someone uses Tor while allowing websites to install and check cookies, this makes a person easily traceable. Thus, using Anonabox\u2019s series of devices doesn\u2019t necessarily make you anonymous unless you try to be cautious about it. User behavior does affect its functioning.That being said, we cannot overlook the benefits of Anonabox over software-based implementations. The most important advantage being that users can offload Tor-based processing from the devices they are using to communicate such as smartphones, which have limited storage and processing power. Also, one Anonabox device can handle multiple Tor processes simultaneously for various computers, tablets, and smartphones.The price range of these devices is between $79.99 and $119.99.HackRead had a pleasure of asking some important users\u2019 privacy-related questions from the CEO of Sochule Mr. Marc Preston.

But think again\u2026 don\u2019t we leave our phones on our desks thinking that since these devices are locked so no one could access them?. Now do you understand the gravity of the issue?According to security gurus Roberto Paleari and Aristide Fattori, the devices that we connect to our computers via USB get exposed automatically and it is also possible to make them vulnerable to exposure simply through a serial interface that is in direct link with the USB modem. It has been identified that older mobile devices such as the Samsung S4 Mini with build I9192XXUBNB1 can be accessed automatically while the newer versions need to be forced. However, in either scenario whether the phone is locked or unlocked the result would be the same.The researchers believe that \u201cthis communication channel is active even when both USB tethering and USB debugging (i.e., ADB) are disabled, and can be accessed even when the device is locked. An attacker who gains physical access to a (possibly locked) device can thus use this interface to send arbitrary AT commands to the modem. This permits to perform several actions that should be forbidden by the lock mechanism, including placing phone calls or sending SMS messages.\u201dIn older versions, the smartphone has to be plugged into a Linux host, which exposes it to a USB serial modem. It thus, becomes accessible through the use of the corresponding Linux device like the /dev/ttyACM0. When the connection is created, then AT commands can easily be sent and the hacker may even conduct a series of operations to exploit the device. The attacker can use the AT command AT+USBDEBUG command to enable USB debugging or the enable the wireless network, the AT+WIFIVALUE can be used.List of vulnerable devices:SM-G920F, build G920FXXU2COH2 (Galaxy S6) SM-N9005, build N9005XXUGBOK6 (Galaxy Note 3) GT-I9192, build I9192XXUBNB1 (Galaxy S4 mini) GT-I9195, build I9195XXUCOL1 (Galaxy S4 mini LTE) GT-I9505, build I9505XXUHOJ2 (Galaxy S4)   (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});To analyze and prove the attack possibility, the security experts developed a proof-of-concept too.Samsung lock bypass(vanilla fw,no other apps).Simple trick,no ninja exploit.Not sure if bug or feature /cc @joystick pic.twitter.com/xsQ3NkghVS\u2014 Roberto Paleari (@rpaleari) December 10, 2015On several Samsung phone models, unprivileged applications canperform \"stealth calls\" (i.e., with no visible clue) pic.twitter.com/cMJWcqZ0yg\u2014 Roberto Paleari (@rpaleari) February 22, 2016They acknowledged in their write-up that: \u201cFor our PoC we developed a very rough C tool, USB switcher, that switches any attached Samsung device to USB configuration #2 (this is fine for the devices we tested, but your mileage might vary). The tool uses libusb to do the job, but the same task can probably be accomplished using the /sys/bus/usb pseudo-filesystem.\u201d\u201cThe trick we used to force the phone to switch the configuration is to first reset the USB device (via usb_reset()), and then switching the configuration (via usb_set_configuration()). Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work on the first try, so just run Usb switcher twice to ensure the configuration is switched properly :-)\u201dWhile the technique for exploiting new devices is a bit more complex. The researchers explain that exploiting this sort of vulnerability in new smartphone or firmware versions such as the Samsung S4 andS6 isn\u2019t that easy and straightforward because \u201cin the default configuration, when the device is connected it exposes to the host only an MTP interface, used for file transfer.\u201dBut the experts identified that the modem can still be accessed by an attacker simply by: \u201cswitching to secondary USB configuration. As an example, consider our test Galaxy S6 device. When USB debugging is off, the device exposes two USB configurations, with the CDC ACM modem accessible via configuration number 2.\u201dIn case you are wondering how the attacker can benefit from this trick then for your information access to modems allows attackers to send a text message and make phone calls even if the device is locked.

Hitoshi Kokumai, President, Mnemonic Security, Inc. would like to point out that there already exists a backdoor on many of the latest smartphones, namely, a fingerprint scanner or a set of camera and software for capturing faces, irises and other body features which are easily collected from the unyielding, sleeping, unconscious and dead people.Let us imagine that we are watching two models of smartphones \u2013 Model A with Pincode and Model B with Pincode and Fingerprint Scan.  Which of the two models do you think is secure? \u2013 When you hear that Model A is protected by Pincode while Model B is protected by both Pincode and Fingerprints \u2013 When you hear that Model A can be unlocked by Pincode while Model B can be unlocked by both Pincode and Fingerprints\u2013 When you hear that Model A can be attacked only by Pincode while Model B can be attacked by both Pincode and FingerprintsIs your observation the same for all the 3 situations?Now let us imagine that there are two houses \u2013 (1) with one entrance and (2) with two entrances placed in parallel, not in tandem.  Which house is safer against burglars?Every one of us will agree that the answer is plainly (1).  Nobody would dare to allege that (2) is safer because it is protected by two entrances.  Similarly, the login by a Pincode/password alone is secure than the login by a biometric sensor backed up by a fallback Pincode/password.Both of the two or Either of the two?Biometric products could help for better cyber security ONLY WHEN it is operated together with a password by AND/Conjunction (we need to go through both of the biometrics and the password), NOT WHEN operated with a password by OR /Disjunction (we need only to go through either one of the two) as in the cases of the above-mentioned house with two entrances and most of the biometric products on the market.Biometrics and passwords operated together by OR/Disjunction only increase the convenience by bringing down the security.  Mixing up the case of OR/Disjunction with that of AND/Conjunction, we would be trapped in a false sense of security (We wrongly feel safer when we are actually less safe).Two-factor authentication or \u201cbelow-one\u201d factor authentication?Biometric products operated together with a fallback password, which can be compared to a house with two entrances placed in parallel (not in tandem), may be defined as a \u201cbelow-one\u201d factor authentication because they offer the level of security lower than a password-only one-factor authentication.There is nothing wrong in saying that a house with two entrances is more convenient than a house with one entrance. But shouting \u201cA house with two entrances is safer against burglars than a house with one entrance\u201d would be just silly.Similarly, there is nothing wrong with a biometric product operated with a fallback password when the product is offered as a tool for increasing convenience.  However, it would not be just silly but unethical and antisocial to make, sell and recommend those products as a tool for increasing security.

But in a \u201cnot so surprising move\u201d, the FBI announced it hacked the iPhone without Apple\u2019s help, ending the ongoing court case.At the time, Apple said it did not know how to gain access and said it hoped that the bureau would share with them any security flaws in the iPhone that might provide an illegal access of the devices by a third party.\u201cIt remains a priority for the government to ensure that law enforcement can obtain crucial digital information to protect national security and public safety,\u201d said the Department of Justice in a statement, \u201ceither with cooperation from relevant parties or through the court system.\u201dThe FBI required a backdoor access in order to check if Farook had ties with other groups and if they are planning more attacks in future.

But there are certain loopholes left in Apple\u2019s data encryption mechanisms that point fingers upon the comprehensiveness of the claims made by Apple about the security of its products.Such as, John Hopkins University\u2019s team of researchers have identified that breaking encryption of iMessages is possible. This means it is also possible to spy upon images and videos that are usually exchanged via messaged by users of iPhones, iPads and Apple Macs.The team of researchers was headed by Matthew Green, a computer science professor. They managed to intercept messages by creating software that imitated as an Apple server. After that, the team employed brute-force approach to expose links to seemingly safe images and videos, according to Green\u2019s official blog.Green told The Washington Post that encrypted transmission that they targeted had a link to the images stored on Apple iCloud server and there was a 64-digit key as well, which could be used to decrypt the image.\u201cAlthough the students could not see the key\u2019s digits, they guessed at them by a repetitive process of changing a digit or a letter in the key and sending it back to the target phone. Each time they guessed a digit correctly, the phone accepted it. They probed the phone in this way thousands of times. And we kept doing that until we had the key,\u201d said Green.This discovery is somewhat ill-timed since Apple is already engaged in a very public legal battle with the FBI over letting the investigation agency access the data of the iPhone used by San Bernardino attacker.The vulnerability, explained the team of researchers, affects only the data that is in transit and not on the information stored on a device. However, they are worried that the courts might force tech firms to encourage weaknesses into the security and encryption mechanisms of their products.Green stated that even with all their skills and terrific cryptographers, Apple couldn\u2019t get the job done perfectly, which scares him about \u201cadding back doors to encryption when we can\u2019t even get basic encryption right.\u201dHowever, Apple has claimed to release iOS 9.3 after fixing the vulnerability.

ProtonMail offers end-to-end encryption which makes it literally impossible to access user messages. Not only the spying agencies, and governments but ProtonMail itself cannot breach a user\u2019s security, at all. This is certainly the highest level of privacy that one can enjoy.According to ProtonMail co-founder Andy Yen, \u201cStrong encryption and privacy are a social and economic necessity. Not only does this technology protect activists and dissidents, it is also key to securing the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. This is why, all things considered, strong encryption is absolutely necessary for the greater good.\u201dProtonMail is under development at CERN since 2014 and the purpose was to address the excessively increasing concerns of innocent citizens after the scandalous revelations from Edward Snowden about the spying practices of governments.The Switzer-land based ProtonMail has over time become the fastest-growing companies around the world and boasts of three globally operational offices. In fact, Business Insider ranked it as the hottest new startup in Switzerland last year.The announcement, however, doesn\u2019t come as a big surprise because public resentment over the governments\u2019 growing efforts to emasculate online privacy is quite evident.Yen added that: \u201cThe best way to ensure that encryption and privacy rights are not encroached upon is to get the tools into the hands of the public as soon as possible and widely distributing them.\u201d\u201cThis way, we put the choice in the hands of the consumer, and not government regulators. The past decade has been marked by a massive erosion of privacy and we\u2019re working to reverse this trend. Encrypted communications are the future and ProtonMail is committed to making online privacy a reality again for all Internet users.\u201dIn case you are wondering if you will be able to open an account on ProtonMail, FYI any user can create an account without exposing personal details and the signup process also works on TOR.The sign-up page at ProtonMail reveals that it takes only two minutes to create a free, secure email account. Included in this free service are 500MB storage and several other paid services. The lowest premium plan is priced at $5/month and if annually paid then, it becomes $4/month. This plan includes 5GB storage as well as a custom domain. Users can pay via credit card, PayPal and even Bitcoin, which is a step that complements the company\u2019s promise of securing the users\u2019 anonymity.Yen states that:\u201cProtonMail and Bitcoin actually have a long history together.\u201cBack in 2014 when PayPal instituted a payment block against us, we relied on BTC donations to keep the service running.\u201dHe further added that the company views \u201cApple case as very troubling\u201d one. \u201cUnfortunately, Apple is likely to lose this one in the court of opinion since the FBI picked their case very carefully.

If you think shutting down a hospital for 10 days is serious, things got a little bit more dangerous just a couple of months ago.At the end of December last year, some major disruptions to the Ukraine\u2019s power generation and airport infrastructure were broadly reported in the media. According to reports and investigations by a US interagency cybersecurity team, the power outages were caused by \u201cremote cyber intrusions at three regional electric power distribution companies\u201d. While other organizations, including those in the critical infrastructure sector, also experienced intrusions, they did not experience the same operational impacts.Reports from ICS-CERTS suggest that the initial attacks came from a fairly common piece of malware called BlackEnergy. However, once the use of that malware was detected the attack changed, with the new payload based on a freely available open source backdoor written in Python. This program was specifically engineered and developed to maintain a stealthy and persistent hold on infected systems.While the malware and its effects may have changed, the attack vector is all too familiar. The hackers used spear-phishing emails containing malicious XLS files that tricked the recipient into ignoring the built-in Microsoft Office security warnings. The macro then launched a Trojan that attempted to execute a final payload from a remote server. Claims that Sandworm Team were behind the attack indicate that the Russians \u2013 or their hacker sympathizers \u2013 may well be practicing the art of cyber warfare on critical infrastructure. Ever since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine, the cyber war has continued to play a part in disrupting civilian networks.The US Cyber Command is also displaying significant capability in this area. US Defense Department leaders recently announced that the country\u2019s forces were participating in a coalition operation with Iraqi and Kurdish forces to recapture the IS-held the city of Mosul. At the leading edge of this effort is an ongoing cyber warfare operation against the communications infrastructure.

Clearly, cyber warfare capability is almost as old as dial-up Internet access.Information about the development and execution of cyber warfare capabilities has been revealed through Snowden and various de-classified documents. Indeed, news broke recently of a follow-on campaign of digital mayhem that was being prepared if the Iranian nuclear weapons talks had broken down. Oddly enough in LinkedIn profiles, in biographies, and job postings for cyber warfare operators, a lot of folks appear to have been doing a lot of things in cyber offensive operations for quite some time.The question, of course, is how do cyber warfare events like the above, in far off places and in large organizations impact on the lives of managed services providers (MSPs) and IT Admin providing services to small and medium business?The answer is that they should serve as a warning \u2013 a very serious warning \u2013 of vicious malware yet to be seen. The reality of cyber warfare is that no matter how targeted it is, there will very likely be collateral effects. Stuxnet spread beyond Iran and infected systems far across the world.

Many alternatives are used in other countries: the vote is printed (in addition to being digitized), or even a code is generated, which can be later used to check the vote after the elections.Several times, the Anonymous group, published a critique targeted at the system of Brazilian electronic ballot boxes, accusing it of being deliberately flawed and summarizing many vulnerabilities.The main criticism of the security of electronic Urns is that there is no technology that will ensure the software in the ballot box on election day is the software that the TSE (The Superior Electoral Court) believed was there. No technology at all\u2026 There is no expertise that could check the ballot box after the voting to find out if the software used during the vote is the same software that was inside after the voting had happened.A machine can be programmed, in addition to the defrauding election, one could steal ballots, and then reprogramme to erase all data or traces of the fraud.There could have been some kind of manipulation of the results of calculations to ensure partisan majorities?

However, Tor browser has been receiving criticism by several security researchers regarding various vulnerabilities that may expose the identity of the user.Now, an independent security researcher Jose Carlos Norte has identified several key flaws in fingerprinting techniques that can be used against Tor users.Norte has revealed his findings in a series of articles along with an actual demonstration of how this can take place. He states that a Tor user can be tracked down with the speed at which the mouse wheel is used by him/her to scroll down through a web page. This is an effective technique to track user movements. However, there are millions of users who scroll through web pages using the same mouse wheel speed. So, how can this technique be so effective?To this, Norte responds that it is possible that the attacker identifies the scroll pattern according to every user\u2019s idiosyncrasies. It is also possible that exploiters log the speed at which the mouse cursor is moved across a page.The interesting part is that, since every user has set personal OS mouse sensitivity preferences and preferred set of gestures while using a mouse, therefore, this technique may turn out to be effective. So, if someone is using the trackpad on a laptop, it gets a lot easier to track not just the movements but the entire machine simply by employing a fingerprint technique.Norte also identified that if users run a CPU-intensive JavaScript operation in Tor, the time required to execute that task can be recorded. This information can be used to pin a suspect on a computer from where Tor browser has been used.But Norte states that the effectiveness of these methods is dependent upon the ability of the attackers to measure time accurately on Tor, at the 1-millisecond level. This means an attacker must possess lightning fast reflexes to complete the task within due time.What we can tell you in a nutshell is that, if you don\u2019t want your movements to be tracked- stop using Tor unless it is REALLY necessary.", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "date": "March 15, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Bug", "Bug Bounty", "Facebook", "hacking", "Malware", "security", "Social Media"], "title": "Facebook\u2019s bugs bounty program to the rescue: Rewards programmer with $15,000", "body": "In February, a computer programmer named Anand Prakash from India who works for Flipkart discovered a vulnerability on the popular social media network Facebook that allowed him to access users Facebook account without so much as a hassle.The flaw acts on the fact that, when a user loses their password on Facebook, they can request for a new one if they know their username, email or phone number. Facebook then sends a 6 digit code to either the users phone or their email which then allows them to use the code as a temporary password.Normally after a number of attempts to log in with failure Facebook usually locks the account and, therefore, makes it hard for people without the correct information to hack into someone\u2019s account.

Every point in this supply chain is increasingly reliant on sensors that monitor and measure pressure, fuel levels, pipeline flows, quantities of oil, temperature and whether equipment is working properly.All this information is managed by business applications created by companies such as SAP and Oracle.\u201d He, however, said that the problem was probably acute now because of the low oil prices, but it put the industry under pressure to cut costs.All of these types of equipment are directly or indirectly connected to the internet so manipulating them would be easy for any hacker and make it possible for them to carry out any attacks.

The reverse process of filling a tank up also with oil was possible thus making it even worse because it would allow perpetrators to go unnoticed if maybe they filled tanks they have stolen from with replacement fluid.Another safety feature that he targeted to check for vulnerabilities was the Burner Management System (BMS) used to start safely up and shut down furnaces used at various stages of gas-oil separation. This system if manipulated and making malfunctions would easily lead to explosions.

The drones which are meant to be used by the police and firefighters departments are therefore definitely weak for the industries.The lack of connection to Wifi of the drones makes it impossible to send an update to fix the bugs wirelessly.

They might have to recall the whole product to fix the security flaws. They did, however, state that they got the report from Rodday and will fix it in their next batch of drones they are going to bring out.Rodday says that the Wi-Fi connection between the telemetry module of the drone and the users tablet uses a weak program called WEP, which according to him is crackable in seconds for the average hacker. That allows any hacker to break the connection and send a \u201cdeauth\u201d command which forces the user out of the network and leaves the drone in the command of the attacker.He also went on to mention that the module and the drone use an X-bee chip to communicate which does have encryption capabilities but to avoid latency the chip does not make full use of them.

The contract is part of the larger Distributed Denial of Service Defenses (DDoSD) program initiated by the DHS S&T Cyber Security Division.The problem with DDoS attacks is that these can cripple even the most established and largest organizations. These happen to be devastating for small and/or medium-sized businesses. The generated amount of traffic is adequate to drench their internet connections multiple times and it becomes challenging to get the ISP (internet service provider) to take the matter seriously and respond quickly.The project that DHS is planning with Galois is dubbed as DDoS Defense for a Community of Peers (3DCoP) and it involves peer-to-peer collaboration mechanism with which the organizations detect and combat DDoS attacks by working in cooperation.According to Adam Wick, Galois\u2019 Research Lead, Mobile & Security Systems Software:\u201cCurrent DDoS defense systems are proving ineffective because they operate in isolation, which introduces delays in the detection, reporting, and response to a DDoS attack. This delay is critical. It provides positive feedback to the attacker, who will continue to send more and more traffic to the target network. Our solution advances the state of DDoS defense by providing new tools that allow multiple defenders to coordinate their response, resulting in earlier detection and faster DDoS mitigation.\u201dIt is not a hidden fact that DDoS attacks are a great threat for all kinds of industries and sectors alike such as news entities, financial institutions, critical infrastructure organizations and government agencies, etc.Under the contract with DHS, Galois aims to curb rising DDoS attack threats via the following measures:  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Resultantly, organizations and institutional entities will be able to thwart DDoS attacks prior to its completion.HackRead had a chance to have a conversation with Adam Wick and here\u2019s what we asked and what he replied:Q: How would you like to explain the difference between your services and services provided by other companies?Answer: \u201cCurrently, DDoS defense systems fail to address large DDoS attacks that fully \u201cclog\u201d the internet connection. In those cases, locally responding to an attack is no longer possible. In general, most solutions work in isolation, which introduces delays in the detection, reporting, and response to a DDoS attack. To effectively mitigate a large attack, an organization must involve organizations \u201chigher up\u201d, like ISPs, that can stop the flow of malicious traffic.We\u2019re developing a unique collaborative model, where multiple organizations automatically work together to detect DDoS attacks through automatic traffic analysis. They then generate traffic blocking rules for the malicious traffic and send that to ISPs further up the chain. The ISPs can, in turn, block the necessary traffic and mitigate the attacks.One can see the basis of this in the way people react to DDoS attacks now, but many of these steps are manual and require complicated conversations over the telephone. In many cases, the process is further complicated because the parties involved have never spoken before, and have to build trust. After all, the actions that one takes to mitigate a DDoS can also be used to perpetrate an attack, so upstream ISPs need to convince themselves that they\u2019re talking to the right person.What we\u2019re looking to do is speed up this process, dramatically, by automating the detection, analysis, and mitigation steps. At the moment, this mitigation can be automatic, or it can be manual. That way, even if an organization\u2019s ISP isn\u2019t hooked up to our system, network admins will be able to detect the problem early and trust our solution to have all the information (and all the evidence!) they need to convince their ISP to take early and effective action.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({}); Q: How will your firm will defend its client against DDoS attack leading to ransom such as the ProtonMail DDoS attack?Answer: \u201cRansom in DDoS cases is one of those clear indicators that our current approaches to DDoS defense are failing. Attackers can only ask for ransom when an organization has no way to defend themselves. Ransom cases can be mitigated by having effective DDoS defense that doesn\u2019t allow an attack to become a problem in first place. The most effective defenses in the coming years will take into account the bigger picture by connecting everyone involved, for a more timely response.

Wireless security systems are such a blessing indeed, we all feel so secure and relaxed after installing them. These are easier to install without needing professional help and tend to be a cost-effective DIY system in comparison to wired ones. However, wireless security systems aren\u2019t as foolproof as we believe them to be. Probably, those high-tech movies that show hackers turning off security systems remotely to infiltrate buildings without getting noticed were actually pointing towards a grave vulnerability that plagues wireless security systems.IOActive\u2019s Andrew Zonenberg discovered how in real life hackers can turn-off security systems by exploiting a crucial security flaw that most home security systems inherently have. Zonenberg identified a serious vulnerability in SimpliSafe alarm systems that allow anyone to listen to the PIN easily and repeatedly. This shows that SimpliSafe alarm systems aren\u2019t just insecure but also vulnerable to even lowest level attacks. Firstly, let\u2019s evaluate the elements of SimpliSafe home security systems.How had SimpliSafe wireless Home Security Systems Work?SimpliSafe, as the name suggests, is the manufacturer of state-of-the-art and reliable radio-based home alarm systems. Reportedly, its products are being used by over one million homeowners in North America. There are basically two main components in a SimpliSafe wireless home security system: the keypad and base station. It is possible to combine them with a wide range of sensors extending from smoke detectors to motion detectors and magnet switches for creating a full-fledged home security system. Keypad and sensors are responsible for transmitting data towards the base station through the on-off keying in the 433 MHz ISM band while the reply comes from the base station via similar modulation at 315 MHz.How SimpliSafe Wireless System can be Hacked?Now let\u2019s dig deep and find out how this wireless home security system can be hacked. The system is created around a star topology; the base station has to maintain state data and the keypad acquires events-related notifications from the base station as well as drives the buzzer and the LCD when required. Later, commands are sent back to the base station but since sensors only contain transmitters hence, these cannot receive messages.There are randomly placed test points on all the boards, which can offer easy access to the raw baseband data that shifts between the MCU and RF upconverter circuit. Using a logic analyzer, it is possible to reverse engineer the protocol because when messages are sent repeatedly, the contents remain the same. This shows that messages can either be sent in cleartext or through some kind of cipher without salts or nonces. A few more reversing exercises unravel bits that convincingly distinguish a \u201cPIN entered\u201d packet from another packet.Thus, Zonenberg identified that the attack can be conducted by simply disconnecting the MCUs from the keypad and the base station and joining wires from the RX and TX basebands to any other microcontroller board. After generation of a few hundred \u2018C\u2019 lines, it becomes possible to listen to the incoming 433 MHz radio traffic passively. Eventually, it leads to a SimpliSafe \u201cPIN entered\u201d packet that is recorded in RAM. An LED light indicates that the PIN has been successfully recorded and can now be played. Then, it becomes possible to push the button to listen to the same packet again and again in order to attack the alarm system.Demo videoAn Inexpensive but Effective Attack Indeed:It is evident that this particular hack is very inexpensive to conduct and, on the whole, it requires a one-time investment of around $250. You need to buy a commodity microcontroller board, SimpliSafe base station, and SimpliSafe keypad to target the alarm system. It is also possible that the attacker hides the device anywhere within a hundred feet radius of the target system\u2019s keypad until the time the alarm is disarmed successfully and the code gets recorded. Afterward, the attacker can retrieve the device and can play back the code whenever he wants to disable the alarm and conduct burglary without getting detected. The vulnerability identified in SimpliSafe alarm systems is quite alarming because it is a security ensuring product and is already installed in over a million homes in America. Moreover, it lets the attacker take control of the system completely and can reveal information about how and for what purpose the system is being used by the consumer. This can potentially make the home a target for attackers.What\u2019s the Solution?It is being speculated that other SimpliSafe sensors like entry sensors can also be spoofed in a similar fashion. The issue currently does not have a simpler solution since the keypad can send out encrypted PINs to anyone. This vulnerability cannot be fixed by the manufacturer with new firmware versions that add cryptography to the protocol. This cannot be done with the vulnerable SimpliSafe products since their microcontrollers that have been shipped with the hardware already are programmable only once. Zonenberg explains:\u201cNormally, the vendor would fix the vulnerability in a new firmware version by adding cryptography to the protocol. However, this is not an option for the affected SimpliSafe products because the microcontrollers in currently shipped hardware are one-time programmable.\u201dThus, field upgrades of current systems aren\u2019t possible and the only solution is to replace all the existing base stations and keypads. When contacted by IOActive, SimpliSafe did not respond at all. Then IOActive informed CERT about this flaw in SimpliSafe products.

In fact, it is being stated that out of the three main operating systems, it the Apple\u2019s iPhone that is highly reliable due to the much talked about \u201cErase Data\u201d feature.This week, we were introduced to a new debate, which was largely focused on the iPhone\u2019s strong encryption abilities and data protection features. The FBI wanted to check Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s phone to get information about his alleged actions and activities, which prompted the mass killings in December. Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik went on a mass shooting spree in 2015 and both were killed soon after.Apple was issued an order by a federal court judge on Tuesday, to create software that can disable the Erase Data feature. Erase Data feature in iPhone wipes the data after ten failed passcode entry attempts. This security feature is so unique that it distinguishes Apple\u2019s iPhones from all other available smartphones in the market.Tim Cook\u2019s Response:Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook, as a response, posted an open letter on the company website stating that this request was similar to asking for creating a \u201cbackdoor\u201d on all iPhones. Disabling this feature would allow the FBI to enter as many passcodes as the agency wants to, using a \u201cbrute force\u201d attack until the correct passcode is identified. This, obviously, would lead to gaining access to the phone\u2019s data.Apple Leading the Game At The Moment:Avast Software is a computer security firm based in Prague. According to its Director of Threat Intelligence, Filip Chytry, it is possible to add this function to Windows and Android devices. But, the issue is that it is complicated and designed for system admins, not normal users.Chytri explained that on an Android smartphone, you need to have \u201cdevice administrator permission,\u201d whereas the users are required to get a special app and follow some additional steps. Generally, users aren\u2019t familiar with such intricate procedures. Chytri added that Windows phone users also need to download special software.No response was received from the creator of Android OS, Google and neither did Microsoft facilitate requests for a response.Trend Micro\u2019s global threat communications manager Christopher Budd explains that Apple is currently leading the game as far as encryption capabilities are concerned. There is although a Remote Wipe option present in Android phones with which it is possible to erase the contents of the phone remotely. Moreover, a number of third-party apps are available that equip Windows and Android phones with this ability. However, the users would need to perform additional tasks considering that this isn\u2019t a built-in feature like the case is with iPhone. Thus, Apple is far ahead in encryption since the contents of its iPhone remain hidden unless you have the correct code keys.Apple enabled default encryption on its iPhones since the 3Gs while Android started offering this facility only recently whereas Windows phones still lag behind in this regard, informs Chytri. The new devices being shipped with the Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the full disk encryption has been made mandatory but in upgraded devices, encryption is still optional. More so, some low-cost Android smartphones cannot even support encryption.Senior vice president and GM at security company Sophos, Dan Schiappa, states that \u201cunless you have somebody\u2019s credentials \u2014 username and password \u2014 or the actual encryption key, there\u2019s no way you can break it.\u201dSchiappa finds the situation dissimilar to what is usually shown in sci-fi and spy movies \u201cwhere someone sits down and bangs on a keyboard for 10 minutes and breaks encryption. You can\u2019t do that.\u201dThe Dilemma Continues\u2026..Regarding the debate that is going on between the FBI and Apple, Tripwire\u2019s senior security researcher Travis Smith states that none of the main manufacturers are supporting backdoor creations in consumer devices.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({}); Smith believes that in the case of issuance of a warrant, the decision to give access to the device should be \u201cup to the manufacturer to determine if or how to comply with the warrant.\u201dIt may be possible that backdoors are enabled in phones that are sold elsewhere in the world most specifically in regions where individual privacy isn\u2019t given much importance.In this context, security firm Armor\u2019s director of threat intelligence Chase Cunningham states that any telecommunication or electronic technology manufactured in China or any other nation-state adversary \u201chas the potential to have a backdoor built into it at the hardware layer.\u201dHe added that such a backdoor would be impossible to detect and would be much more powerful than any other software. \u201cThere are huge companies within China that work directly with their government, ensuring they can have direct access to user data,\u201d said Cunningham.", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "date": "February 20, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Android", "Apple", "Encryption", "FBI", "Google", "iPhone", "Privacy", "security", "Terrorism"], "title": "Protect your iPhone from the clutches of the FBI by switching to longer passcodes", "body": "The on-going tussle between the FBI and Apple on the San Bernardino case has raised many concerns, most of which come from security experts. The FBI wants Apple to build a backdoor in one particular iPhone, but CEO Tim Cook is against it, saying it would compromise all iPhones. Users, though, can protect themselves better simply by switching to larger passcodes, as per The Intercept\u2019s report.The case of FBI versus Apple in the San Bernardino issue has attracted the attention of people from all over the world. The issue is the FBI requesting Apple to build a backdoor to help them break into the iPhone of one of the killers involved in the mass shooting spree of San Bernardino, which claimed 14 victims. Apple CEO Tim Cook, though, has rejected the FBI\u2019s appeal to do so, saying that if he were to do it, then the backdoor would hand the FBI the ability to break into any iPhone they wish.No one knows exactly what methods of encryption are used by iPhones or likewise, what methods are used by the FBI to break into a mobile device. However, what is known is that after failing to guess the correct passcode 5 times, iPhone disables further attempts for one minute. This waiting time increases to 5 and then 15 minutes later, till 10 unsuccessful attempts are made.After that, all the data on the iPhone is erased. This is what the FBI wants Apple to change on the device of the accused. They wish Apple to remove this waiting time as well as the number of unsuccessful attempts allowed on an iPhone. Tim Cook has come out against this openly for he believes that doing such a thing would mean that the backdoor could hypothetically be deployed on any iPhone device later. Many security professionals, as well as Google CEO Sunder Pichai, have come out in support for Tim Cook on his stand on the issue.However, if one looks at it from the perspective of a casual iPhone user, a simple method is available to prevent the FBI from getting their way and gain access to your iPhone easily. The FBI, no doubt, will look to enforce some brute force algorithm to guess the correct passcode of the device they want. Brute force algorithms match a code with all possible combinations of numbers.This means that eventually, all brute force algorithms yield a successful result. However, the viability of using a brute force algorithm lies in how long it takes for it to crack the passcode. This is where the trick lies. If you have a 6 digit passcode of your iPhone, that means that there are 10^6 possible combinations to be tested.This takes about 24 hours to do, but not even all the combinations need to be tested after a match is found, so an average of 11 hours is required for cracking a usual 6 digit passcode. This is not a small time, but still bearable, considering the value of data obtained thereafter. However, change that passcode from 6 digits to 11 digits, and the time required to get a match would shoot up to 127 years! Surely no one would sit around for that long time.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});This is a simple way to prevent the FBI from gaining access to your iPhone\u2019s data should they get their way with Apple. However, there are two things of importance. The first is to use a random 11-digit number as a passcode and not a phone number, birthdate, social security number, etc., for such matches are easier to find. Also, it is important not to use touch IDs, since it is fairly simple for legal authorities to get your thumb or finger impression on your device.One might think here that why is so much fuss required to lock your phone away from authorities. Well, it is within the rights of legal agents to confiscate your digital devices for hours when you travel internationally. Even local police officers can get a warrant to search your phone within 15 minutes these days.

Over the course of the investigation, Farook\u2019s iPhone 5C was seized as evidence, but will not be considered sufficient unless it is unlocked using any method available.The ruling, however, was not sufficient to convince the company to find a suitable way to unlock the perpetrator\u2019s phone. On the one hand, the encryption policy used by the iPhone is designed so that no one, other than the user himself, can break the encryption and subsequently unlock the phone.\u201cOur new iPhones are impossible to hack: Apple\u201dThe reason, as explained by Apple, is very simple: the unlock combination chosen by the user is embedded in the encryption key that is part of Apples Data Protection security protocol, and, therefore, the mechanism cannot be broken into without knowledge of the password combination.In light of the fact that Apple phones have an auto-destruct feature which erases the phone\u2019s hard drive if 10 wrong password combinations are attempted consecutively, and thus makes the data completely inaccessible. According to The Hacker News, the judge\u2019s ruling stipulated that Apple should create a \u2018backdoor mechanism\u2019 that would bypass the security system and increase that number of attempts to millions, thus effectively allowing the system to be broken by attempting any combination of digits.Although Apple did not make any claims as to whether bypassing the security system is plausible, the implications of allowing such a mechanism to be created are enormous: it would provide a way for government agencies to unlock any individual\u2019s iPhone within a matter of hours.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Tim Cook, the CEO of the company, wrote a customer letter strongly opposing the judge\u2019s ruling: \u201c\u201cWe have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The tech world stands in agreement with Apple on this case: creating a system which could effectively become a master key for any iPhone is a grave and dangerous step. It would allow not only government agencies, but a number of other interested parties to have an easy way into unlocking other phones, and, therefore, could easily be misused.Cook\u2019s attitude remains fair yet unyielding throughout his address to the public. He maintains that his company would be happy to provide assistance to the government and law enforcement in the resolution of the heinous crime, but that the assistance must and will remain within the bounds of valid subpoenas and search warrants, thus remaining reasonable and safe.With many top-tier smartphone manufacturers being issued similar requests and orders, the future of mobile encryption and, by extension, personal privacy, remains unstable. Apple\u2019s standing on this matter is a strong answer to pressures from governments, but it is still an open question if the company will not suffer legal repercussions for taking a stand.Earlier this year, FBI Director James Comey also expressed his concern about Apple and Google encrypting their devices.

Now, Tel Aviv University and Technion researchers have discovered a way to steal data from air-gapped computers from another room. Air-gapped computers are machines that are disconnected from the internet so as to discourage hackers from remotely accessing the data stored in them. The research is due to be unveiled on 3rd March at the forthcoming RSA Conference.It is quite similar to the research carried out to steal crypto keys by \u201clistening\u201d so this isn\u2019t the first time that such an approach has been used by researchers against elliptic curve cryptography being run on a computer.Elliptic curve cryptography is a powerful and dynamic approach to crypto that is used in securing everything from messages to websites.How is it Possible?The method used to conduct the attack is called side-channel attack. This kind of an attack does not involve the implementation of an encryption head on, as with brute force or by making use of a vulnerability in the algorithm but relies upon other sources.In this case, the attack relies on the electromagnetic outputs of the laptop that are emitted during the decryption process, which are used to work out the target\u2019s key.Researchers acquired the laptop\u2019s private key by running GnuPG. GnuPG is a widely famous implementation of OpenPGP. Once done, they measured the electromagnetic emanations of the target computer and within seconds, they had the secret decryption key.According to the team of researchers, which comprised of Daniel Genkin, Lev Pachmanov, Itamar Pipman, and Eran Tromer, the attack is launched using lab equipment that \u201ccosts about $3000.\u201d This shows that the attack is unwieldy. They further stated, \u201cthe attacks are completely non-intrusive; we did not modify the targets or open their chassis.\u201dHowever, Tromer stated while talking to Motherboard \u201cexperience shows that once the physical phenomena are understood in the lab, the attack setup can be miniaturized and simplified.\u201dTromer further explained that the modifications make GnuPG more \u201cresistant to side-channel attack since the sequence of high-level arithmetic operations does not depend on the secret key.\u201dThe attack\u2019s legitimacy was tested by sending specific ciphertext to the target, which is basically an encrypted message.The Paper:The research team published a paper (pdf) stating the process of the attack, which read:  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});\u201cDuring the decryption of the chosen ciphertext, we measure the EM leakage of the target laptop, focusing on a narrow frequency band.\u201dAfter processing the signals \u201ca clean trace is produced which reveals information about the operands used in the elliptic curve cryptography [and in turn] it is used in order to reveal the secret key.\u201dThe equipment that the team used were quite varied such as they used amplifiers, an antenna and software-defined radio too along with, obviously, a laptop. This process was being carried out through a 15cm thick wall, reinforced with metal studs, according to the paper.The secret key was received after observation of around 66 decryption processes. Each of these procedures lasted for 0.05 seconds. This yielded overall measurement duration of around \u201c3.3 seconds\u201d the paper established.For the information of our readers, when the researchers state that the key was obtained in \u201cseconds\u201d they actually are referring to the total measurement time instead of how long it might take to carry out the attack.Real Life Attack Possibilities:When a real attacker launches an attack, various other factors will be involved in the target will decrypt the encrypted message reliably since observing that process is needed to successfully conduct the attack.As far as an in-the-wild scenario is concerned, this attack is still quite theoretical and it is hard to imagine its wide-scale implementation.Yet, Tromer believes that hackers could possibly adapt their identified techniques or other such mechanisms, and they may even make them more cheap and accessible.While mentioning his previous researchers, Tromer stated that this latest attack \u201ccan also be performed clandestinely and at even lower cost. In this day and age, our personal data, financial assets and private communication are all protected by cryptographic algorithms, and there are ample incentives and precedents for sophisticated attacks on the general population.\u201dHe further added that their work is most potentially pertinent to \u201csystems that are carefully protected against software attacks, but\u2014as we show\u2014may be wide open to inexpensive physical attacks.\u201d", "authur": "Pushpa Mishra", "date": "February 16, 2016"}, {"topics": ["4chan", "Apple", "Bug", "Flaw", "iPad", "iPhone", "security", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Turning back Time on your iPhone can \u201cBrick\u201d the Device- Don\u2019t Fall for the 1970 Scam", "body": "Apple is just not \u201csure\u201d why it\u2019s happening but it\u2019s a fact that if you follow the instructions of a deceptive hoax message your iPhone will be broken and will become unusable for a while.As per reports, a horrid hoax message is doing the rounds over the entire social media and prominent online forums, which says that if you want to \u201cactivate an Easter egg\u201d just turn back time by setting the date to January 1st, 1970 and then reboot the phone which will activate Easter egg for you.

Limited knowledge of how the internet works and how to respond to a situation which could probably expose their personal information makes them prone to such attacks. But who really is to be blamed? Let\u2019s find out.IgnoranceNew users generally tend to pick a password which they can remember easily, without realizing that such passwords can be \u2018easily\u2019 guessed or traced by the hackers and the likes. They set their phone numbers, or their birthday, or their child\u2019s name as their passwords. Or even worse people tend to choose generic words like \u2018password\u2019 and \u2018123456\u2019 as their passwords. This is what a recent survey found about the passwords that most of the netizens are using.Ignorance about the dangers of the internet is what drives the creation of such passwords. Some try to get innovative and replace alphabets with numbers. One such example of such a password is \u201cpa33w0rd\u201d. Although a bit secure, it still fails to protect you completely against any unauthorized access to your accounts.Educating and sensitizing users about strong passwords is the only solution. However, it is not practically possible to educate each and every user about it, largely owing to the huge influx of new users each day. Forget the new users, even we do not keep a strong password for each and every online account. Do we keep separate passwords for every account? Do we create a strong password for EVERY account we use? Do we follow every security measure listed on every website? The straight answer is a big NO!Who is really responsible?Would we have set a weak password had the website not allowed such passwords to be kept? The developers, too, take responsibility in this regard and never allow weak and commonly used passwords for their websites.People are easily annoyed when a website requires them to fulfill certain prerequisites such as having minimum 8 characters, the inclusion of both upper and lower cases as well as a special character and a number. People must realize that this is done for their safety only and the website or the developer has nothing to gain from it.However, not every website has such strong password policy. This makes such people of the website vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Taking advantage of such a situation is extremely easy for any hacker.must readGeneration Y is More Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks than Generation X, says study  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});must readFingerprints are History \u2014 Brain Scans will be the Next-Gen PasswordsCrack-able passwordsStealing passwords is a walk in the park if the hacker has proper computing power/abilities and a password cracking tool.

However, if you have a larger password with a combination of letters, numerals, and symbols then it is much harder to crack even for the biggest of hackers. Just make your passwords complex.How to choose a strong password?Making sure to choose a strong password, even when the website doesn\u2019t require you to do so, make you less prone to cyber-attacks. Also, keeping different passwords for different websites is essential if you wish to keep your online data secure. You make take help of password managers to manage different passwords for your different accounts. This way, you may not have to memorize each and every password of yours. Opt for two-step authentication, wherever applicable/possible.EndnotePasswords are your only key to securing your online data. Losing or exposing your password to some unauthorized person may spell doom for your online life. Users, as well as the developers, are partly responsible for the creation and use of a weak password.

As per Symantec\u2019s analysis, Netflix is not free from malware at all as it has been involved in various attacks that their team has identified so far. One of which is related to fake Netflix apps.It has been discovered by Symantec that fake Netflix apps have been loaded with such a strong malware that it can easily steal credentials of registered users along with their credit card details and banking information. Researchers explained that victims are redirected to Netflix website but the Infostealer.Banload Trojan also gets installed in the background. This Trojan steals the victim\u2019s bank information.According to Symantec\u2019s senior security response manager Satnam Narang, this malware has been disguised as those Netflix applications, which are usually \u201cdownloaded by users who may have been tricked by a fake advertisement or offers for free or cheaper access to Netflix.\u201dHowever, the extent and/or scope of this attack haven\u2019t been determined by Symantec yet and the firm is also unable to analyze the infection rate as of now. What the firm did discover, says Narang, is that user credentials are stolen by a second attack that also is launched via Netflix.Basically, the hackers have started this new phishing campaign to trick innocent Netflix users and steal their credentials by redirecting them to a bogus Netflix website. The phishing emails (some coming from netflix@fakt[REDACTED].com ) have been designed to appear identical to the original notification sent to users by Netflix.The increasing incidences of Phishing attacks:Every other day we hear about prominent online sources being targeted by phishing scams and it won\u2019t be an understatement that phishing attacks have emerged as a serious concern for security experts.In a recent Cloudmark report, it was revealed that 91% organizations were targeted by malicious actors via phishing attacks in 2015. It is though not a new phenomenon but phishing attacks mostly are successful in exploiting innocent users.Possible Perpetrators Behind Netflix Malware Campaign:Apparently, the latest phishing attack involving Netflix apps hasn\u2019t been designed by an individual hacker but it seems to be part of a very elaborate scheme with a full-fledged business model around it. Symantec states that stolen Netflix accounts are in demand right now at underground web market because these offer extensive access to Netflix services without involving high expenses.Symantec detected one such platform that promises users \u201cfreshly cracked accounts\u201d and it is called Netflix Generator. This tool is daily updated and the offered accounts can be bought, used and even resold to other individuals.

It is loaded with rooting abilities and can easily delete all traces of data in your phone\u2019s storage. The malware was discovered by Heimdal Security while inspecting an SMS message sent to random numbers and locations.A Truly Twisted Malware Campaign:The malware Mazar Bot, as per Heimdal Security staff, is involved in active attacks. The campaign takes place in a unique way because it directly sends SMS/MMS messages to users. These messages contain the Android app file APK, which has the infected link. When the link is clicked upon by the user, this malicious APK file gets automatically downloaded. When users run the program they are asked to install another app that seems quite harmless probably due to its simplistic name MMS Messaging. The app also requests for admin privileges. The reason why so many users are falling prey to this new malware is that they generally do not suspect anything fishy due to the misleading name. As evident, this modus operandi is somewhat different from the way Android threats are spread usually since other Android scams involve being installed by users via third-party app stores.The Extensiveness of Mazar Bot:It has been mentioned above that Mazar is capable of rooting and therefore, when it manages to gain root access the malware can perform a variety of diverse functions like gaining boot persistence, which helps it in surviving even after the device restarts. Moreover, it can send and receive SMS messages. It also is capable of making calls to the contacts, infect Google Chrome, observe the state of the phone and even control it by attempting to plague phone\u2019s control keys and change settings on your phone. That is not all by any means since Mazar Bot can enable sleep mode on your phone, access the web and alter network status too.It also can download TOR android app on your device and install it too, without your consent or permission obviously. Heimdal Security experts explained that the malware installs this app using these links:When installed, the malware attempts to connect to this server:With this capability, Mazar can surf the web with full anonymity through the TOR network. After installing Tor app, the malware surprisingly sends a message to an Iranian number 9876543210 (here 98 is the calling code of Iran). The message reads \u201cThank You.\u201d This message contains the location of thedevice and plays the role of a beacon because it informs the instigator of the attack when the malware has penetrated into a new device.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Heimdal Security identified another aspect related to this malware, which is that it sometimes installs Polipo proxy, which is an Android app. This app basically adds a proxy on the device and lets the owner of the malware spy upon the Internet traffic and initiate Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks. Polipo HTTP proxy is brought to Android through Polipoid and it helps in doing various useful stuff like creating web links cache to access them offline and increasing the browsing speed. However, if used by cyber-criminals, the proxy can modify the traffic and intervene between the targeted phone and any sort of internet service. This is how the attackers can transpire MiTM attacks.There is more \u2026..the scariest part we left for the end!Mazar Bot can easily and completely wipe the storage section on your device. This is dangerous isn\u2019t it?Who is Behind this Insane Malware Campaign?Russia probably!Yes, you read it right. Mazar Bot is being distributed by a Russia-based group of cyber-criminals.The clue that led to this assumption about the real location of the attacker is that there is an unwritten law in Russia that states if Russians remain unaffected by any cyber campaign, Russian officials won\u2019t chase the perpetrators of the campaign. Of course, the campaign hasn\u2019t affected anyone in Russia. Also, the source code of this malware contains some specifications on how to halt the installation procedure if the phone uses the Russian language.Recorded Future identified this malware firstly in 2015 while it was being sold in the underground malware marketplace the Dark web. However, in a malware campaign, this has been identified for the very first time by Heimdal Security. The security team at Heimdal Security was analyzing an SMS message that was sent to mobile phone numbers randomly. It is currently unclear how far and in how many regions this message was sent.The content of the deceptive SMS message is as follows:\u201cYou have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number] Follow the link http: //www.mmsforyou [.] Net / mms.apk to view the message.\u201dAttackers can actually do whatever they want to once this crazy new malware Mazar Bot gets installed and performs all of its functionalities. In android phones, it can create a backdoor so that the attackers can monitor and control the phone as per their wishes. It can also send text messages to premium channel numbers, which obviously would lead to an unannounced increment in the victim\u2019s mobile phone bill.

Reportedly, WhatsApp users have become targets of a new scam campaign in which they are tricked into revealing personal information and opening an infected file. The information that they disclose is, obviously, used for nefarious purposes.  What happens is that some unsuspecting users are redirected to the bogus website through the links present in the message. Resultantly, the user\u2019s phone gets infected with malware and the hacker acquires access to crucial data related to the user. No wonder WhatsApp becomes the focus of malicious actors every now and then since the app recently crossed a billion users worldwide with over 65million users in India only. Moreover, the app exchanges more than 42billion messages from across the world on a daily basis. Therefore, it can be assumed that the impact of the malware attack would be far-reaching.    (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The chief security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, David Emm, told This is Money that the scam operates in a wide range of languages. He also noted that \u201cthis WhatsApp scam has been actively circling for some time. It \u2018speaks\u2019 several languages so the attacks can be customised for each market.\u201d Emm further added: \u201cThe message convinces the user to forward the message to 10 contacts, so he/she can receive a certain promotion (such as \u00a35 discount at Starbucks, Zara etc).\u201d  Previously, security researchers have exposed another scam in this app, which posed a threat to the users by accessing and retrieving information stored on banking apps on the targeted smartphone. Another scam occurred when WhatsApp was experimenting with the new calling feature and was planning to roll it out officially. During that phase of deliberation, fake messages started circulating where users of the app were invited to try the new feature (before it was officially launched) and they became victims of a dangerous malware campaign. As far as this new scam is concerned, BT revealed that the links that redirect users to infected website appear to be sent by a \u201cfriend.\u201d It leads to a \u201cdiscount offer\u201d page where the user is asked for entering personal details. Those who fall prey to this trick are led to the bogus website and their phone is infected with malware.

T5000 was identified in 2013 and again in 2014 and targeted the automotive industry, human rights activists and Asia Pacific governments.T9000 Trojan has been spotted by Palo Alto Networks researchers, who claim that it is embedded inside those spear phishing emails that are sent to organizations in the US. However, researchers believe that this new backdoor malware is so versatile that it can be used against any entity that the hackers wish to compromise.The computers are getting affected by this malware through the malicious RTF files, which exploit the CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-2015-1641 vulnerabilities to acquire control over the targeted PC.In comparison to T5000, T9000 is much more complex and security researchers who have analyzed it, claim that this time around the malware\u2019s authors has put in a lot of efforts in making the Trojan undetectable.The Trojan involves a multi-stage installation procedure; before the beginning of every phase, the malware checks for any installed analysis tools and/or the 24 most common and reliable security products on the targeted PC. The security products that this Trojan checks include: \u201cSophos, INCAInternet, DoctorWeb, Baidu, Comodo, TrustPortAntivirus, GData, AVG, BitDefender, VirusChaser, McAfee, Panda, Trend Micro, Kingsoft, Norton, Micropoint, Filseclab, AhnLab, JiangMin, Tencent, Avira, Kaspersky, Rising, and Qihoo 360.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});After checking everything, the malware gets itself installed and conducts internal verifications. It then collects information stored on the infected system and sends it to the command and control server.Once the computer has been infected, identified and recorded, the command and control server sends specific modules to the targeted device according to the information that can be stolen.In fact, Palo Alto researchers assume that most of the damages caused to a system by T9000 are prompted by three main modules. As per their analysis, out of the three, the tyeu.dat is the most important module because it spies upon Skype conversations.When this module is downloaded and executed, the user will receive this message \u201cexplorer.exe wants to use Skype,\u201d the very next time he/she starts Skype as shown in screenshot below:The reason behind the appearance of this message is that the malware taps into the Skype API and this notification are displayed at the top. So, if the users click on the allow button and agrees that the \u201cexplorer.exe\u201d can interact with Skype this gives T9000 permission to spy on Skype activities of the user.T9000\u2019s Skype spying module is so powerful that it records audio and video communications as well as text chats and takes screenshots of video calls regularly. Moreover, it can also steal data and other files from Skype conversations.Vnkd.dat is the second module of the T9000, which gets loaded when the perpetrator of the malicious malware campaign needs to steal files from the computer. It can also steal data from local removable storage devices that contains these extensions: \u201cdoc, ppt, xls, docx, pptx, and xlsx.\u201dHowever, the third one is the most innocuous module among all, which is the qhnj.dat module. This module allows the command and control server to send commands to every targeted computer and instruct T9000 to generate files and directories, remove/delete files and directories and also move files and directories, encrypt data and get the user\u2019s clipboard copied.The extensiveness of this malware is explained by Palo Alto researchers:\u201cThe author of this backdoor has gone to great lengths to avoid being detected and to evade the scrutiny of the malware analysis community.\u201dApparently, T9000 is a professional cyber-espionage tool. Previously, the T5000 was linked to an APT Admin@338, the traces of which were found in Chinese government\u2019s cyber-army.

Vickery identified that the hard drives of HP LaserJet Printer can be used as a secret data storage unit by cyber criminals due to the presence of a default setting that can set-up an FTP server through port9100.This particular setting is mostly part of HP LaserJet\u2019s commercial (or business grade) series printers and it lets the employees of a company host large data troves on the device during printing.The files that are uploaded on the printer using this feature can be usually accessed at:The upload and download operations stored on this anonymous FTP server are tackled through port 9100.In case, a system admin forgets to secure the equipment with a firewall or if the device contains a publicly accessible IP address, then it is quite likely that a malicious actor could access the device through port 9100 and use the printer as a secret storage device to store or even host malicious files. It happens so because such devices are placed on corporate networks.Such files could be anything from illegal copyrighted material to malicious scripts, etc. These can be saved and accessed without alerting the company or any of the employees with ease from the device.It is also very much possible that the hacker\u2019s identity remains unidentified because the only hint of such an activity that is left is in the network logs. However, not many systems admins scan for traffic that moves in-and-out of the printer.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Vickery states:\u201cThis kind of printer is usually powered up and online twenty-four hours a day. Even in sleep mode, it will still host files. And who checks the contents of their printer\u2019s hard drive? What are the odds of this hacker\u2019s secret stash ever being discovered? Pretty low if you ask me.\u201dMoreover, Vickery suggests that the only method that can be utilized to protect the printer from facilitating cyber-crimes is to secure it with a firewall. Disabling the FTP storage if not being used may also help greatly.When LaserJet and port9100 were searched on Shodan (for which you need to log-in first) it showed 20,000 exposed printers that were openly accessible right now.

However, all the games were so similar in packaging and behavior that these appeared to be uploaded by the same source.When any of these games were downloaded by users, it resulted in compromising of their personal information, which was then transferred to a remote command and control server. The information collected includes IMEI and IMSI identifiers, mobile operator information, country and language settings, OS version, MAC address of the phone, kind of memory card inserted into the device and the app from where the Trojan was getting all the information.It makes sense that the Trojan collects information about the app because it happens when the system is infected with multiple malicious apps.

The data center reportedly is used to host the spyware\u2019s proxy server.Previously, news sources reported that two Indonesian government groups including the Lembaga Sandi Negara/National Encryption Body were among the customers of FinFisher and that agencies from more than 32 countries are using this spyware.However, according to Bill Marczak, security research at Citizen Lab, a human rights security-oriented, a laboratory in Toronto, Indonesia seems to be among the largest customers of FinFisher spyware. Evidence confirms that many other government users are relying upon FinFisher in Indonesia apart from the National Encryption Body.Marczak stated:\u201cI felt very concerned about the list of countries we had found.

In 2013, an Israeli traffic tunnel was hit by a cyber attack causing a lot of financial damage. Now the hackers have conducted another cyber attack but this time on the Israel\u2019s Electricity Authority servers.Israel\u2019s energy and water minister Yuval Steinitz stated on Tuesday:\u201cYesterday we identified one of the largest cyber-attacks that we have experienced.

However, the energy minister did not clarify who was behind the attacks or how it was carried out.Moreover, there isn\u2019t any news regarding the results of this attack because none of the news organizations reported about any power disruptions.

However, reports of cyber attacks must be met with caution and demands for proof due to the technical and cultural challenges that face the ICS security community.\u201d\u201cSimply put, there is a lack of expertise in the quantity required alongside the type of data needed to validate and assess all of the true attacks on infrastructure while appropriately classifying lesser events. Given the current barriers present in the ICS community, the claims of attacks should be watched diligently, taken seriously, but approached with caution and investigated fully.\u201dWhile some sources suggest it was a cyber attack Ynet claims that it wasn\u2019t a cyber attack but a malware attack equipped with ransomware capabilities. However, the ransom amount was not disclosed but apparently someone working at the grid station fell for the phishing attack, opened an email and thereby was infected with ransomware which reportedly spread to other computers on the network.Nonetheless, the attack does raise questions about the level of security that protects the sensitive infrastructures all over the world.

The data released this week is in the same format as of the data released by CWA back in November.

The raid ended with a shooting.We can presume that the hacker is a Miami resident, in the light of this revelation made by the hacker.However, despite the fact that the hacker gave his location and nationality away with this hack, and his apparent links with the CWA group involved in high-profile hacks, the FBI failed to catch them until now.

The NIT is a term used to refer to a hacking tool used by the FBI.However, the campaign wasn\u2019t confirmed at the time but now the Washington Post\u2019s report proves that the FBI do relies upon NIT usage. Yet there are now more questions than ever particularly it is unclear if the hacking was conducted on such a large scale as being speculated or not.Most importantly, what did the FBI do with the data received from the privacy-oriented email service?The last two paragraphs of the Washington Post report talk about the TorMail issue, which informed that the email service of Tor was allegedly used by fraudsters, child pornographers, drug vendors and Silk Road employees.Washington Post\u2019s report states: \u201cThis week, people familiar with the investigation confirmed the FBI had used an NIT on TorMail.\u201dThe article further informed readers that the agency obtained a warrant for hacking certain email accounts, owned by people suspected to be involved in child pornography activities.\u201cUsing a privacy-preserving communication service is not an invitation, or a justification, for the government to hack your computer.\u201dThis implies that the FBI was busy in targeting specific users instead of invading the privacy of innocent users. However, considering the previous reports on the way the FBI deployed the NIT previously, it seems quite unlikely that the hacking was targeted, states the Washington Post report.The question that arises in a common person\u2019s mind is that how could the FBI target specific email accounts owned by perpetrators of child pornography.According to American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s principal technologist Christopher Sohogian, \u201cthere were certainly large numbers of TorMail users who were not engaging in any criminal activity.\u201d\u201cIf the government, in fact, delivered an NIT to every single person who logged into TorMail, then the government went too far; using a privacy-preserving communication service is not an invitation, or a justification, for the government to hack your computer,\u201d he added.Sohogian opines that \u201cthis case was from 2013: we still don\u2019t have the NIT order, or the NIT application,\u201d which means that it is yet unclear if the judge who approved NIT really understood what was being authorized.An FBI\u2019s spokesperson Christopher Allen when asked to give his opinion on the recent report from the Washington Post, said that: \u201cI would not be able to comment one way or the other on your specific question.\u201dMuch later in 2015, the FBI conducted a yet unprecedented hacking spree in which the agency deployed malware infections on at least 1000 computers, which were being used for visiting a particular child pornography website.

The unnamed man was captured at a hotel in Ilia, Peloponnese. This particular arrest was also part of an investigation, termed as \u201cinternational authorities code-named Pacifier,\u201d by the Greek news outlet Ekathimerini.com.This website, which was used for child pornography, was a Tor hidden service and its server was seized by the US authorities. This site was named by Chile news service as Playpen, and in Chile, a man was arrested on similar charges as the one in Greece as part of the Operation Pacifier.The Director of Europol Rob Wainwright described this operation as \u201csuccessful infiltration and technical investigation\u201d in a presentation. Wainwright explained that 3,229 cases have been generated so far by the Europol and 34 cases were registered in Denmark only.These cases came to light when the FBI seized Playpen in February 2015. This incident was described in the US court documents as \u201cthe largest remaining known child pornography hidden service in the world.\u201dAfter seizing the website, the NIT technique was used by the agency to identify users of the site. The tool helped in obtaining the IP and MAC addresses of the target as well as other important technical data.According to a report, the FBI obtained around 1,300 accurate IP addresses in 13 days, during which the agency kept the website operational and received criticism for encouraging child pornography itself by running this site.Last year, FBI hacked Tor browser and caught thousands of pedophiles indicating that no one is safe on the Internet even using a VPN or Tor service itself.SourceWashington Post", "authur": "Ryan De Souza", "date": "January 24, 2016"}, {"topics": ["DDOS", "hacking", "Kali Linux", "security", "Tools", "Vulnerabilities"], "title": "8 Most Popular and Best Hacking Tools", "body": "The internet has as many downsides as well as upsides but it\u2019s the lack of knowledge about dangers on users\u2019 behalf makes it easier for hackers to go about their business \u2014 Let\u2019s take a look at some of the best hacking tools and scripts.Hacking can be used both for malicious purposes as well as a means for finding flaws in a system and notify the authorities to help them fortify their defences better.

Network administrators, as well as system engineers, are known to use Angry IP Scanner quite frequently.Kali Linux was released in August 2015. It has a major release known as Kali Linux 2.0. This app is packed with distribution and interface tools. It has an improved hardware and supports a large number of Desktop environments. Kali Linux is a security-focused operating system you can run off a CD or USB drive, anywhere. With its security toolkit, you can crack Wi-Fi passwords, create fake networks, and test other vulnerabilities.Cain & Abel is a password recovery and hacking tool, primarily used for Microsoft systems. It helps with password recovery by cracking encrypted passwords using a few brute force methods like the dictionary method. Cain & Abel can also record VoIP conversations and recover wireless network keys.Burp Suite Spider, which is used to map out and list the different parameters and pages of a website merely by examining the cookies and initiating connections with applications residing in the website, is arguably the most important component of Burp Suite. Vulnerabilities in the web applications can be easily identified using Burp Suite, and many hackers employ this method to find a suitable point of attack.Widely popular tool, Ettercap helps deploy a Man in the Middle attack. Attackers can use different attack methods on a victim\u2019s system if its functioning is successful.John the Ripper is a password cracking tool and uses the method of a dictionary attack, where different combinations of the words in a dictionary are matched against an encrypted string to find a hit. John the Ripper is obviously a brute force technique, and its viability depends on the strength of the password chosen by the user. Like all brute force methods, it will give a positive result, though the time it spends in doing so helps one decide whether to opt for it or not.

The BlackEnergy is a kind of malware that has become the preferred choice of hackers for instigating their cyber-crimes and for attacking engineering systems.Researchers have attributed the attacks on Ukraine and Russia to the so-called Sandworm hacking collective.Ukraine\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT- UA) issued a warning to system administrators on Monday regarding the probability of \u201cpotential attacks using [BlackEnergy].\u201dIn the same briefing, a list of suspicious IP addresses were also presented to the admins so that they could check their systems\u2019 logs against it.\u201cWe recommend checking the log files and information flows for the presence/absence of these indicators,\u201d stated CERT team.Reuters report also informed that a spokesperson from the airport targeted in Ukraine stated that the matter was being investigated by Ukrainian authorities.They were trying to find out whether the malware that infected the computer network of Boryspil airport was BlackEnergy or not. The main issue to worry about is that if it was BlackEnergy, then it could have given hackers valuable information already by letting them access the system in the same way as it happened when the national Power Grid was targeted.SourceReuters ", "authur": "Agan Uzunovic", "date": "January 19, 2016"}, {"topics": ["hackers", "hacking", "javascript", "Lastpass", "Password", "Phishing", "Privacy", "Securty", "Vulnerbaility"], "title": "Bypassing LastPass\u2019s Security?

Security researcher Sean Cassidy, who developed the phishing attack, claims that a simple email could potentially bypass strong security measures in place, such as the two-factor authentication.According to Cassidy, users can be tricked into submitting their LastPass master password and even their second-factor authentication code using lookalikes pop-up notifications in the browser.The victim visits a malicious site that runs javascript code. The code visualizes a browser notification informing the user that has been logged out of its LastPass account. The notification is no different from those found on LastPass website and instructs users to enter their master password and \u2013 if that\u2019s the case \u2013 the two-factor authentication code. The data can then be retrieved by the hacker who therefore has access to all the users\u2019 passwords in the vault.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Cassidy explained how LastPass is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery, that is, any website is able to send a logout notification to the application. Cassidy also underlined how the use of a browser-based password manager, such as LastPass, that stores users\u2019 passwords in the cloud is actually more dangerous than using even a simpler application that stores data on users\u2019 local devices. Another vulnerability could be the encrypted backup of one\u2019s password vault on the application\u2019s server that LastPass recommends to its users: if, on one hand, this is convenient, on the other hand, it gives whoever possesses login credentials the access to a copy of the password file.Cassidy reported the issue back in November and LastPass confirmed it worked with him to fix it. The company though tweaked the claim that there was a vulnerability in LastPass and stressed the fact that it was a phishing attack. The company then released an update to prevent users to be logged out and actually improved security measures so that you would be notified in case you\u2019ve entered your master password into a non-LastPass form.Cassidy disputes that this type of security alert that comes from LastPass itself could be detected by an hacker-controlled website and then stopped in order to render it useless. He also stresses how a phishing attack cannot be treated differently from a remote code execution vulnerability.Means are different but the ends are the same in the majority of the cases: stealing people\u2019s data.

Sensitive data of any company, more so of those that keep largely public data, has been the target of some of the most notorious hackers of the world. Illegal access by an unauthorized person is the most devastating thing that could happen to an organization, for its sensitive data would then be at the mercy of the attacker.Manipulation, data, and theft of data, as well as leaking of company secrets and shutting down services, are just some of the many things that hackers have the license to do once they gain access to a system. The fact that (PDF) over $575 million worth of damage has been done due to cyber crime is indicative of the fact that cyber terrorism and cyber crime is the most dangerous thing in today\u2019s world when everything is computerized.We take a look at the 5 of the most dangerous cyber security vulnerabilities that are exploited by hackers.Buffer overflow is quite common and also painstakingly difficult to detect. In a buffer overflow attack, an application that stores data in more space than its buffer allocation is exploited into manipulating and misusing other buffer addresses. The manipulation includes overwriting the data on those other buffer addresses as well as damage and deletion of the data.Although buffer overflow is difficult to detect, it is also difficult to carry out, for the attacker needs to know the buffer allocation mechanism of the system. However, if the hacker has that knowledge, he or she can easily exploit this by sending an application more data than it can store in the buffer prescribed for it. After doing so, the attacker can gain access to the user\u2019s system when control is returned to his code. Web servers and user systems are vulnerable to this attack.An application sending untrusted data to an interpreter is an instance of injection vulnerability. SQL and XML parsers and program arguments are the common targets of such an attack. If carried out successfully, injection vulnerability attacks can easily result in loss and damage of data.Arguably the most dangerous and most common vulnerability, exposure of sensitive data results in catastrophic losses for any organization. Attackers, therefore, use this vulnerability to inflict as much damage as possible.  The target data can be stolen when it is resting in the system, in an exchange transit or in a backup store. Malware is used by hackers when the data is in the system and cryptanalysis techniques like a Man-in-the-Middle attack when it is in exchange transit.This attack takes advantage of some weak spots in session management as well as connection authentication between two systems. Failure to employ sufficient encryption techniques can help hackers do all kinds of cyber espionage using this vulnerability.Quite easy to avoid and quite common, but disastrous when exploited nevertheless. The reasons for this vulnerability to be exploited are many, like using default system settings and passwords, running out-dated software, and not keeping strong enough passwords. Although such mistakes are easy to avoid, it is alarming how many times an attacker gains access to a user\u2019s system and the sensitive data in it due to failure to avoid such mistakes.Cyber security is something that is quite an important issue. We tried to make our readers aware of some of the most common vulnerabilities and would recommend them to do further research to know all there is to know about protecting their systems. Knowing is the initial step, and with this article, we aim to help you in your initial step.Top, Featured Image CreditYuri Samoilov/Flickr ", "authur": "Ali Raza", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Bug", "Flaws", "security", "SQL", "Vulnerability", "Wordpress"], "title": "Program Languages That Generate Most Software Security Bugs", "body": "You maybe a top notch developer or programmer but do you know which program languages generate most software security bugs?Recently, a lot of reports have been coming up, bringing attention to people regarding the vulnerabilities in Drupal and WordPress. Many hacks have been attributed to hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in WordPress, and similar claims have been made against Drupal. However, it has now been found that the main perpetrator is, and has been all along, the language behind these things, which is PHP.Over the last 18 months, Veracode has studied more than 50,000 applications in popular languages like PHP, Classic ASP, .NET, C and C++, Java, JavaScript, iOS, Android, Ruby, ColdFusion, and COBOL. The report generated based on this analysis reveals troubling findings regarding some languages. For instance, 86% of applications that were written in PHP showed, at least, one XSS vulnerability.Moreover, 56% of those showed, at least, one SQL injection bug. SQL injection bug results are even more worrying for Classic ASP and ColdFusion users, for 64% of the applications written in these two languages also revealed, at least, one SQL injection bug. Similar findings from OWASP test results show that ColdFusion, PHP, and Classic ASP, in that order, are the worst languages when it comes to software security.Veracode\u2019s founder and CTO Chris Wysopal went on to say that the reason why SQL injection attacks keep on happening is the use of scripting languages like PHP. Such languages are difficult to program securely. According to him, scripting languages are the root cause of so many XSS, buffer overflow and SQL injection attacks taking place these days, and the data revealed by Veracode\u2019s report (PDF) based on cloud-based data analysis and application studies simply corroborates his belief.The main reasons cited for the vulnerabilities highlighted in these languages are the way they are used and the way languages like PHP, Classic ASP and ColdFusion are designed. These languages lack the built-in functions and security APIs that come along with better languages like .NET and Java, which is the reason why these scripting languages are more susceptible to XSS, buffer overflows and SQL injection attacks.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});SQL injection attacks occur when parameter binding is not done in SQL queries, and PHP does not help at all in parameter binding, thus making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.Since languages like PHP, ColdFusion and Classic ASP are primarily used by web developers who have recently ventured into the field of coding and are mainly concerned with making their website look better designed, they do not have the security features offered by languages like .NET and Java. Many times, it is not even the developer\u2019s fault, for he or she has to work with whatever platform his or her employing firm provides them with.Veracode\u2019s report, as mentioned earlier, also provided results on Android and iOS apps. When you look to compare the two, there is not a whole lot of difference in their security aspects. 87% Android apps were found to have security bugs while 81% of iOS apps fared similarly. The main reasons for so many bugs being found in these languages are the fact that proper checking of SSL certificates is not performed and out-dated cryptography algorithms are used. Such practises result in security bugs.The worst three languages that generate the most software security bugs are ColdFusion, PHP, and Classic ASP. These languages fared worst in the Veracode analysed as well as OWASP tests, revealing that they have the most security bugs of all other languages.With more than 70% of content management is done using systems like Drupal, Joomla, and WordPress, all of which are PHP-based, the report should open the eyes of companies using such content management systems and scripting languages.", "authur": "Ali Raza", "date": "January 18, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Andrew/Flickr"], "title": "Tor Anonymity: Things NOT To Do While Using Tor", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Do you run Tor on Windows? Do you Google and Torrent on Tor? Here is a list of things you should NOT be doing while using Tor or else your privacy is as vulnerable as without Tor.The Onion Router, or Tor as it is more commonly known as is a free anonymity software which people all over the world use for hiding their real identity while browsing the internet. A user\u2019s online privacy and anonymity is something that is not always respected by ISPs and government officials, not at all in today\u2019s world.In an age where cybercrime is growing at a breath-taking pace, add to that the activity of government agencies like NSA spying intensely on their citizens\u2019 internet activity, anonymity and privacy while using the internet is a hard thing to come by. At times like these, Tor comes out as a boon for people.It is simply a browser that provides you anonymity by routing your network through many different relays on its Tor network. Your identity is protected since your connection to an end node is made through an intricate network of relays. However, the degree to which Tor helps you out depends on the way you use it. We provide you with some Don\u2019ts while using Tor.Tor is a free software, and like all software, it has some bugs and glitches which are frequently resolved via updates. Moreover, Tor is just a browser that works on top of your operating system, so if your OS itself is compromised then, Tor won\u2019t do you any good. Therefore, it is quite essential that you regularly update your Tor client as well as your operating system.Windows is the most used operating system in the world, and with Windows 10, despite its security and privacy issues, the number of users has increased even further. However, using Tor on top of Windows is not a good practice, since Windows is full of security flaws that allow hackers to gain leverage over a user\u2019s system and after that his sensitive data. It\u2019s no use using Tor to hide your identity when Windows OS can cause your sensitive files to be hacked.Google uses a lot of tools like Google analytics to build a complete profile of people who use it. Although it helps in providing people better search results and overall experience, it involves recording a lot of personal data like name, location, etc. If you are using Tor to hide your identity, then using Google on top of that is a waste of Tor. It\u2019s like hitting the gym and then eating a double cheese pizza right after coming out. So, do not use Google while using Tor. Search engines like DuckDuckGo do not track your location or record your search results so give it a try.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});JavaScript, Adobe Flash, etc. are dominant browser languages that can be used by hackers and spies to gain access to your system. These languages use virtual machines and run via user accounts so they have a lot of permissions which can be used to share your personal data online. So even if you are using Tor to hide your identity, keeping these enabled will do you no good.Sorry, but no torrenting on Tor. BitTorrent and other P2P clients provide information like your IP address to the peers and end nodes, so if you use P2P while using Tor then again it is a canceling out factor. Anyone in the peer pool can see your IP address and thus your identity is compromised.Tor is a free software to provide people anonymity on the internet. However, it is merely a traffic router. It cannot, for instance, encrypt all your files and your entire internet connection.Therefore, the onus is on the users to use it to good effect so that they may reap the benefits of using Tor properly and succeed in their aim of remaining anonymous on the internet.

Mix Network was used in David Chaum\u2019s paper \u201ccMix: Anonymization by High-Performance Scalable Mixing\u201d. In this paper, Chaum modifies the concept of Mix Network to form his own concept, called cMix. His breakthrough cryptography protocol is now supposedly the thing that researchers will look to use in order to build their own PrivaTegrity networks.Chaum\u2019s paper also addresses many issues that regular users as well as the government, had with the Mix Network. He believes that the use of cMix to make personal PrivaTegrity networks for organizations will become a good alternative to using Tor.The way cMix works and why it is better is explained in Chaum\u2019s paper. The basic idea behind it is this. First, the sender of the message establishes connections with a few trusted servers and shares a series of keys with them. When the message is initially sent by a sender, it is multiplied with all of the encryption keys.When the message then passes through each subsequent server it is divided by that particular server\u2019s key. The message is also multiplied by a random number upon being divided by a server\u2019s key. Server\u2019s buffer stores the message in a randomized way.When retrieval and decryption are required, each server retrieves the message, divides it with the random number and then multiplies it with its key to get part of the message. Upon the message receiving on the recipient\u2019s system, his or her keys are used to divide it and then decrypt the message.PrivaTegrity solves the issue of tagging in Tor, which is a malicious user tagging an input node with its output location in a Tor network. The only way cMix can be breached is if a user compromises all the details, which is, according to Chaum, very rare.Top, Featured Image Viam00osfoto/Shutterstock ", "authur": "Ali Raza", "date": "January 13, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Canada", "Computers", "cyber attacks", "IoT", "security", "Technology"], "title": "How PING Could Save and Prevent Deadly Accidents", "body": "This Government of Canada press release caught my eye on a recent newsfeed. The release tells the story of how PING could save and prevent accidents. It\u2019s one of those reports that uses language which for most of us is completely unintelligible or steeped in scientific nuance. So let me break it down for you: a train fell off the tracks and PING could have stopped it.Hold on, how can something as simple as an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet save lives? The reality is actually kind of obvious in this world of Internet of things (IoT) \u2013 latency. Using this analogy, the number of seconds or milliseconds it takes for a packet of data to go from one place or another could have prevented this train from being derailed. If there is a change in the latency, there is a problem on the tracks. Yes, my friends, PING works on rail tracks, which in a way are like giant cables reaching out across the nations.This fact got me thinking. PING is one of the most basic of IT functions. The PING check is built into almost every Remote Monitoring and Management Tool (RMM) on the market today, including our own MAXfocus platform. However, this story is not about our great products, it\u2019s about how PING could have mitigated a train derailment \u2013 it blows my mind that all of sudden ICMP becomes the deciding factor between business-as-usual and disaster.If you can accept the idea that the railway is like a big, conductive pipe and has a TCIP stack, you can accept the idea that a simple PING could tell you a lot about the quality of transmission. The intimate relationship between PING and the quality of the Layer 1 \u2013 i.e. the physical layer \u2013 is well known: bad cable equals latency and dropped packets. If you\u2019ve sent thousands or hundreds of thousands of PINGS you would know what the average response time should be.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});When the response time is radically different or there is no response; then you know you have a problem. But surely life is not that simple? Oddly with PING, it really is. One of the first things a helpdesk does (after making you reboot) is to ask you to PING the router/IP you need to get to. If you can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d it, you have a connection problem.Understanding this is going to be key to understanding the IoT. PING will become, if it is not already, one of the default troubleshooting protocols/services we will use to figure out connectivity. If PING does not return, there is a problem. It\u2019s astounding to me that we still have problems understanding this concept.We live in a world where 8.8.8.8 has to answer to a PING if it does not some folks would suggest we will all die, or at the very least our Shoes.com websites will load really slowly. PING is not DNS, it\u2019s not even Https, it\u2019s lower level and it\u2019s what we use to determine \u2013 in IT terms \u2013 if you are alive or not. There are lots of folks that turn PING off on their outside interface because of the PING of death, which caused so many problems back in the day, but if you\u2019re still running a firewall that can\u2019t handle a packet outside of an RFC spec you have other much more serious problems.But I digress. I said PING will save us and I meant it. We have big data \u2013 LOGICcards is an example of that \u2013 but how cool would it be if your PING check worked across all of the customers?Imagine if our 2 million endpoints could tell you the expected PING time to important websites and if your customer\u2019s PING time was outside that. No one will ever complain about too fast, but the phones light up if we\u2019re too slow. How cool would that be?So, how does this affect the IoT or rail cars traveling down the line? It\u2019s simple. If PING gets too long, or there is no ECHO then stop the train, because something is not right. If something is not right it could mean a physical problem that could derail your train. It\u2019s not a super technical thing \u2013 if it\u2019s not ECHO\u2019ing a reply it\u2019s probably not online. If it\u2019s not online and it needs to be you better go fix it.PING may just save you a world of pain when and prevent your train \u2013 metaphorical or not \u2013from going off the tracks.Ian Trump Headshot Ian Trump is security lead for LOGICnow, you can follow Ian on Twitter at @phat_hobbit.", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "January 10, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Android", "Candy Crush", "Facebook", "Google Play Store", "Malware", "Smartphones", "Snapchat", "WhatsApp"], "title": "Google Play Store, Receptacle Of Germs: Malware-Infected Apps Had To Be Removed", "body": "Brain Test malware is back.

The Ukrainian power company maintains that the outage was temporary and not completely the outcome of physical sabotage but occurred due to a cyber-attack.Ukraine also immediately instigated an official investigation into the matter to understand the root cause of the outage.As details started emerging, it was identified that the regional control center\u2019s network was infected with a malware. If this malware is believed to be the cause behind the blackout then it would verify Ukraine\u2019s allegations.More importantly, it also signals that electric grids and industrial control systems (ICS) are actually vulnerable to cyber-attacks.After a week of the power outage, a former US Air Force cyberwarfare operations officer and founder/CEO of security firm Dragos, Robert M. Lee, told MotherBoard that:\u201cThe fact that malware was recovered from the network at all, and the fact that it\u2019s newer, gives a high confidence assessment that the cyber attack on Ukraine was legitimate.\u201dAccording to Lee, the malware was unique and wasn\u2019t something that can be randomly found on grid networks.In his blog post, Lee wrote:\u201cThe malware is a 32 bit Windows executable and is modular in nature indicating that this is a module of a more complex piece of malware.\u201dLee passes on the sample he possessed to Trend Micro\u2019s senior threat researcher Kyle Wilhoit, who stated that this malware was equipped with wiping function. The sample was also shared with the founder of Rendition Security and SANS instructor Jake Williams, who was of the opinion that:\u201cThe resolution of APIs that are not used elsewhere in the code probably means that some of the code was borrowed from another program.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Williams identified that the malware had a code base on which modules can be added.Lee\u2019s blog post compelled other researchers to publish their personal findings in this context. Such as ESET analysts claimed that Ukrainian grid network malware was actually BlackEnergy.Sandworm, an infamous Russian hacking group, is particularly fond of BlackEnergy and has also targeted ICS and power facilities in the past, so it is quite possible that the same group is behind the latest attack.However, nothing can be stated with full surety because of lack of proof as Lee states:\u201cThe BlackEnergy malware has been in existence since 2007 and lots of different actors have used it. People are saying that this piece of malware is linked to BlackEnergy. I can buy that, and there is some good analysis to say that is likely true. But just because the BlackEnergy malware was used, does not mean that it\u2019s linked at all,\u201d to this group.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({}); So, the crux of the matter is that some hackers possibly from Russia attacked Ukraine\u2019s power supply plant and caused a temporary outage in certain sections of the country.Attackers probably exploited the control center\u2019s system\u2019s digital control panel and remotely accessed it. Others speculate that since BlackEnergy can wipe data so it was installed to steal information from the electric grid system.This is not the first time when Russian hackers have been accused of targeting Ukranian infrastructure.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});You must write down the most recent key on a piece of paper or copy/paste it in a file.Users can delete the encryption key from Microsoft\u2019s servers from this page but there is no guarantee that when the same user will log into his account using Windows Home, the system won\u2019t re-upload the encryption key.Unfortunately, Home users cannot benefit from any other solution to use disk encryption without getting its copy saved at the servers.If you think that Microsoft knows a lot about you already and disk encryption is just unnecessary then you may disable it through your Control Panel\u2019s \u201cPC and devices -> PC info -> Device Encryption\u201dYou may alternately search for \u201cDevice Encryption.\u201dIf you are okay with disk encryption but don\u2019t want any involvement from Microsoft\u2019s sneaky backup system then you can make use of open sources disk encryption system such as VeraCrypt or paid options like BestCrypt.Windows Enterprise and Pro users can, however, delete this key and make it obsolete as well, unlike Home version users. For this, a few steps have to be taken.Type BitLocker in your Control Panel\u2019s search tab, if disk encryption is supported on your device then you will find BitLocker on-by-default. You can turn it off but this process takes time.Once it is off, turn it on again to generate a new encryption key. However, this time, BitLocker will ask you whether you want to save this key or not instead of automatically sending it to Microsoft\u2019s servers.It will offer you three to four options and you need to choose the one that is most suitable for you such as save it to file or print to paper, etc. Just remember not to click on saving it on the servers.Now, the BitLocker encryption will prompt you to restart your PC.Check the same link again, that is, onedrive.live.com/recoverykey to confirm if your current key was again uploaded on Microsoft\u2019s servers or not and to delete older encryption keys.Thanks to The Intercept for bringing this to our notice.", "authur": "Ryan De Souza", "date": "December 30, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Computers", "Cyber Crime", "europe", "Infosec", "internet", "IP", "Malware", "Proxy", "security"], "title": "ProxyBack Malware Converts Your PC Into Proxy", "body": "As per Palo Alto researchers, a Russian company\u2019s domain is being used by attackers, which inherently is a patent Web proxy service.The malware has been named ProxyBack and it was firstly discovered in March 2014 but its functioning has only recently been understood by researchers.Palo Alto Networks experts believe that most educational institutes located in Europe have become the targets of this malware and regular home-use PCs are attacked for funneling internet traffic illegally.These infected PCs aren\u2019t used to hide the location of a hacker but are advertised as trusted proxy servers listed in an online proxy service that operate from Russian outskirts.ProxyBack performs its task by firstly infecting a PC and creating a connection with the attacker controlled proxy server from where it receives commands and also the traffic that is to be routed to real web servers.Every PC that ProxyBack infects becomes a bot inside a bigger network that is already being controlled by the attackers, who then send instructions through basic HTTP requests.Though the researchers couldn\u2019t find any reliable electronic trail to identify the perpetrators that use the buyproxy.rudomain but they have discovered that IPs of some of the infected machines did appear in their online advertisement as IPs of some of the available proxy servers.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Just like Android-Spywaller, DroidWall is also used for blocking security applications so that these aren\u2019t able to communicate with their cloud-based threat analysis servers.This act makes security applications useless and provides the malware safe and free access to the device.According to Symantec researchers, the malware isn\u2019t as common among Chinese users, therefore, the risk associated isn\u2019t that great either.This malware can easily pose as a Google App known as \u201cGoogle Service\u201d by exploiting the absence of an official Google Play Store in China.It must be noted that there is no such official Google App with this name.Android.Spywaller is distributed through unofficial Android app stores and fools users to gain admin permissions.The malware works in the background of the phone to steal information present on the device and later transfers it to one of its C&C (command and control) servers.As per the report from Symantec team of researchers, Android.Spywaller is by far the most comprehensive Android spyware families they have discovered.The app can search and exfiltrate data including SMS, call logs, GPS readings, emails, contact list, images, radio and system\u2019s browser data.Moreover, it also gathers data from apps like Oovoo, BlackBerry Messenger, Coco, QQ, Talkbox, Skype.

Most media agencies didn\u2019t realize this and when the hack took place, kept on criticizing the company for selling spying tools to third world governments.What was even worse is that even after knowing about the hackers trying to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, Adobe took several days to fix their zero-day flaws in Flash. During that time, most people had already disabled Flash. Even Chrome and firefox disabled flash due to constant reports of users not satisfied with flash.Comcast Corporation, an American multinational mass media company found its users\u2019 login credentials sold on the dark web. The company confirmed that over 200,000 users were affected from the breach. However, the company failed to catch the culprit behind the breach.Back in July, hackers breached the security of the online dating portal \u201cAshley Madison\u201d. The hackers were able to leak data from the site including site\u2019s database, internal emails and source code in relation to some of their internal apps.Once the data on the site was published online by the hackers, it had severe consequence; even some of the site\u2019s users tried to commit suicide due to the threats from crooks for having extra-marital relationships.The site in late summer received another breach in which passwords belonging to 11 million accounts were cracked by a group of hackers.VTech is a Chinese company which builds and develops learning toys faced a data breach that leaked private information of 4.8 million parents and 200,000 children. Those numbers increased later on to 6.7 million.This was a massive breach because it involved personal details of so many children which can be used by hackers later for hiding their identities.Just like VTech, the Hello Kitty toy manufacturer also faced a massive data breach in which personal information of 3.3 million customers was leaked. The company was unaware of the breach until a security researcher brought the issue the attention of related authorities.OPM (Office of Personnel Management) manages records for all government employees including military personnel in the US.The data breach of OPM took place in March but came to light in June and investigations showed an increase of 4 million breached records to what initial investigations suggested was18 million. Later in July, it further grew to 21 million records. On top of that, investigators found 5.6 million employees\u2019 fingerprints stolen from the database.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});U.S. accused China of these hacks and Chinese officials accepted the responsibility but said it was another group of hackers that is not associated with the government; Chinese government arrested the hacking group in September as part of their upcoming China-US spying pact.Juniper is the latest in the list of security breaches; it was found that Juniper\u2019s NetScreen firewall equipment running ScreenOS operating system had hidden backdoor.Furthermore, the investigation revealed \u201cunauthorized code\u201d programmed inside the ScreenOS code, this was, in reality, a backdoor that allowed the hackers access the devices and even decrypt the VPN traffic.The source of the backdoor is still unknown but some blame China and some NSA. Maybe next year we will have better evidence on who the culprit was.This was basically an attempt to hack cryptographic key that was assigned to over 400 mobile and wireless carriers in over 85 countries.Gemalto, a Dutch maker of SIM cards revealed these attacks and told if these keys would have got to NSA or Britain\u2019s GCHQ all the encrypted communications on the internet and mobile phones might have been decrypted.LastPass is one of the most used password managing portals that faced data breach in June when unknown hackers managed to steal some email addresses and encrypted passwords and hints for these passwords.Though, all the passwords were hashed and sorted which would have allowed for most of the passwords to have been changed.This hack was significant because this was the first time a hacking group has attacked password management service and again sheds light on the fact that nothing is safe online.This was an unusual hack because the company itself (in this case T-mobile) didn\u2019t have a data breach rather Experian (a credit reporting company) had a data breach which leaked T-mobile\u2019s consumers\u2019 data.Experian had the data for checking credit position of people requesting credit for buying devices from T-mobile\u2019s shops. According to the reports, over 15 million records were leaked from Experian containing sensitive details in relation to the customers.TalkTalk faced the data breach not once, not twice but thrice in the year starting from February when the company lost 4 million user data, then on October 4 million and another 2.4 million in August when company\u2019s subsidiary, Carphone Warehouse, faced a data breach.In total the company faced a total of 10.4 million user records breach and if the company does not fire its CSO for such a massive data leak then users should find another ISP.This is one of the high-profile and amazing hacks of the year because three teenagers calling themselves CWA (Crackas With Attitude) hacked personal email address of the CIA director John Brennan with simple social engineering techniques.With that, the hacking group hacked FBI Deputy Director Mark Giuliano\u2019s and his wife\u2019s email accounts. They even got access to JABS (Joint Automated Booking System), an application for managing all the arrest of U.S. citizens.So far the teenage hacking group has kept law enforcement agencies at bay and it would be interesting to see if the agencies can get at them next year!MacKeeper, a utility software suite for Mac OS X faced a data breach which has exposed details in relation to its 13 million customers. The company was unaware of the breach until a whitehat hacker brought the issue was brought to the attention of related authorities.In May, Japan\u2019s national pension system was hacked due to which personal data of 1.25million people got leaked. The scandal exposed the nation\u2019s botched handling of the pension records of its citizens. According to funds\u2019 officials, the hack leaked pension IDs. Names, birth dates and addresses of people by gaining illegal access to personal computers of their workers. The only hacktivist Anonymous conducted a massive cyber attack on the official website of World Trade Organization and leaked personal data of about 53,000 users by exploiting a simple SQL vulnerability.Now that 2015 is almost over one can only hope for a better 2016 when it comes to online or offline security.

From a smart coffee maker to a full-fledged power grid station, everything is hackable, reveals a study conducted by the Associated Press (AP).In its comprehensive investigation the AP concluded, after analyzing dozens of data sets, government reports, private analysis and over a hundred interviews regarding the cyber security infrastructure of the US power grid, that there was every reason to be concerned.AP revealed that cyber-attackers have managed to carve a hole systematically to acquire access to operation networks of a critical nature. They need to compromise sensitive networks to manipulate them so that even from halfway across the world they could potentially deprive millions of consumers from electricity.A security researcher from a cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc, Brian Wallace, firstly identified the breach while evaluating an incident wherein a California-based university\u2019s house files were stolen by hackers. Wallace unwittingly learned something much more important; he traced a group of hackers who acquired access to networks housing the United States\u2019 power grid Calpine Corp.Calpine Corporation is United States\u2019 primary and largest electricity generating station with 83 power plants in operation currently in 18 states across the US and Canada. The plant utilizes geothermal and natural gas resources to create electricity.When Wallace discovered this breach, he also found a trace of FTP servers containing a cache of around 20,000 stolen files, which were gathered from thousands of computers from across the globe. Some important documents of Calpine were also in those stolen files.must read8 Technologies That Can Hack Into Your Offline Computer and Phone  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});\u201cI saw a mention in our logs that the attackers stored their malware in some FTP servers online. It wasn\u2019t even my job to look into it, but I just thought there had to be something more there,\u201d states Wallace.Wallace then tracked those cyber criminals behind the hack in the quest of figuring out their next move and to try to thwart their efforts. He worked on the reverse-engineering malware that were found to be injected into the company\u2019s FTP servers.It took him months to receive a ping that alerted him of the attackers. He also identified that the IP addresses being used by the attackers were located in Tehran, Iran.The ping exposed to Wallace that the hackers were busy deploying TinyZbot, a Trojan malware program, to take the screenshot of the target computer and obtain backdoor access.He tried to gather as much information and evidence as possible before identifying what potentially could be the main agenda of these hackers, which was the folder that contained detailed engineer diagrams of Calpine Corp power plants.This finding was also confirmed by the study conducted by AP, in fact, the news service also confirmed that stealing usernames and passwords were also part of the plan. The data would be very useful for an attacker to get access to an important firewall.Firewalls, as evident, perform a very crucial role of separating Calpine\u2019s communication network from its operations network. According to sources, the blueprints also contained locations of specific devices present inside the power plants\u2019 process control networks. These devices obtain crucial, sensitive information from the power-producing equipment, which is vital for the safe and sound operations of a plant.Experts confirmed that hackers can fundamentally violate Calpine Corp\u2019s operations network to completely shut down power generation and encourage a blackout.Furthermore, experts identified that the hackers were not properly equipped with security measures themselves since the stolen data was found to be located on seven unencrypted FTP servers. These FTP servers revealed the malware that was being custom-authored and was responsible for cloaking the computers of its origin. Some comments written in the Persian language led Wallace and experts to believe that the hackers were operating from Iran.As per the study from AP, it was revealed that hackers could obtain passwords and usernames, which could be helpful for them in remotely connecting to two of Calpine\u2019s networks.Additionally, detailed blueprints of around 71 networks and power stations between New York and California were also possessed by hackers. These contained detailed engineering drawings depicting the accurate locations of sensitive devices that often relay communications with vital equipment like boilers and gas turbines, etc.Moreover, information flow diagrams were also part of the package. These diagrams showed patterns through which the information was relayed back to Calpine\u2019s virtual cloud. In the case of a man-in-the-middle attack, attackers could gain access to this information easily.As per Brett Kerr, a spokesperson from Calpine, the company\u2019s data was hacked by a third-party contractor who previously has business ties with the power generating corp. Kerr admitted that Calpine Corp was unaware of the violation until Wallace\u2019s findings. He claimed that the stolen diagrams and passwords were quite \u2018old\u2019 and therefore, posed no immediate threat.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({}); Wallace also identified while investigating this incident that the hacking group possessed members from other locations including Canada, Netherlands and the United Kingdom apart from Iran.According to an investigation by cyber security experts at AP, the Calpine breach was quite novel since hackers gained a considerable amount of remote access controls over the past decade. Various sophisticated foreign hackers gained remote access to control the operation networks of electricity generation stations in the past decade.Although such breaches haven\u2019t prompted any blackouts as yet but there is the underlying threat of the heightened capabilities of the hackers since they can use this information while engaged in cyber-warfare.A former US Air Force cyberwarfare operations officer, Robert M. Lee, explained:\u201cIf the geopolitical situation changes and Iran want to target these facilities, if they have this kind of information, it will make it a lot easier. It will also help them to stay quiet and stealthy inside.\u201dSome might think that these threats to critical infrastructure are blown out of proportion and are heavily overstated. Shutting down an entire power grid is no easy feat because the power grid structure has been designed in a way that it can ensure constant electricity supply even if regular maintenance is going on.This theory is confirmed by the former NSA director Keith Alexander:\u201cThe grid is a tough target, but a lucrative target. There is a constant, steady upbeat (in the growing number of sophisticated attacks). I see a rising tide.\u201dAlthough cyber security measures have been rising steadily, there is still no fool-proof system intact that could reduce the threat of attackers in gaining access to sensitive infrastructure.Experts do agree that shutting down a whole country\u2019s main power grid would be quite hard for hackers, but they also agree that it is, however, not impossible.In the past, a confidential document from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed that US energy, defense and educational institutions are the top targets of a possible sophisticated cyber attack from the Iranian hackers. The former director of US national security agency Mc Connell warned of cyber 9/11 due to the vulnerable cyber infrastructure of the country.

No hacking or technicalities needed, just tapping your finger on the key.A pair of researchers from the University of Valencia have discovered such a flaw, plaguing a high number of various Linux distributions, allowing just about anyone to bypass any form of authentication and just log in as a privileged user, by yes, pressing backspace 28 times.The issues lie neither in the kernel nor operating system itself but instead stems from a vulnerability within Grub2, or Grand Unified Bootloader, that boots up on Linux systems when they are powered on. The program helps boot up main parts of the OS and even lets you run multiple operating system\u2019s on one machine.The vulnerability within Grub2 is an integer underflow flaw that was first introduced with single commit released initially in Grub v1.98, which came out December 2009, affecting the grub_password_get() function.As the flaw is quite simple, it requires literally zero technical skills, meaning even the first time Linux users could check their systems. To check, start by clicking the backspace key 28 times in a row when met with the Grub username prompt during initial boot.

In 2016, look for two developing malware families. First, as law enforcement becomes more specialized in identifying cybercriminals, ghostware will help hackers conceal indicators of compromise. It will be more difficult for companies to know a compromise has taken place. Second, be on the lookout for \u201ctwo-faced malware\u201d: malware that can avoid detection by a sandbox and then execute once clear of security protocols.Security researchers uncover emerging tactics employed by hackers and other bad actors. They develop solutions to protect individuals and businesses from compromise. And then hackers come up with something new to foil even cutting-edge defenses.In this environment, some types of malware evolve and grow more sophisticated. Others go by the wayside to be replaced by newer, more intelligent tools that drive further innovation among security vendors and researchers. This ongoing cyber security arms race intensifies each year while the stakes get higher as connected devices (the so-called \u201cInternet of Things\u201d) proliferate and the potential attack surface grows exponentially.Malware continues to be one of the primary tools of the hacker trade. Hackers use purpose-built malicious software to gain access to devices and networks, to exfiltrate data, and exploit software vulnerabilities. In 2016, new variants will emerge, confounding security professionals and investigators looking to find and prosecute cyber criminals and state-sponsored actors. Let\u2019s take a look at two types of malware researchers at Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard Labs predict will make an impact in 2016.Ghostware is the Snapchat of malware. Snapchat, the popular social app, allows users to send photos and videos to friends that, once viewed, \u201cdisappear\u201d and cannot be viewed again. The concept of ghostware is similar: The malware enters into a system, completes its mission (i.e., stealing data), then disappears without leaving a trace.As investigators and law enforcement become more adept at forensic analysis and more concerned with cyber crimes and the people who perpetrate them, careful hackers will look for ways to erase all traces before security measures detect that systems have been compromised.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});In 2014, blastware emerged on the scene. This type of malware gets what it needs and then destroys its target or renders its host unusable if it is detected by security systems. Unlike ghostware, it leaves the ultimate calling card behind \u2013 a destroyed machine will let an organization know immediately that their system has compromised.Rombertik is the most well-known variant of blastware \u2013 once installed it checks to see if it has been detected, and if it suspects it has been detected or is being reverse engineered by a researcher, it will self-destruct and permanently crash the host system. Fortinet\u2019s research indicates blastware will continue to be a tool used in targeted attacks, particularly in cases of hacktivism or state-sponsored cybercrime.Ghostware could become more prevalent because of its flexibility \u2013 hackers can infect different types of systems and attempt to avoid identification and attribution for the crimes.The two-faced malware was developed in response to the increasing use of sandboxing to inspect traffic and prevent advanced threats from entering the network. This malware is specifically designed to evade detection in the sandbox. It executes a benign task while in the sandbox and then performs its malicious process once it passes through the security protocols. Currently, it is quite simple with some basic anti-VM and anti-sandbox techniques, which actually raises a red flag for security inspection.Sandbox solutions often employ a rating system based on the observed behavior of the inspected files. If everything looks good, the sandbox will assign an \u201cinnocent\u201d rating that will be reported back through a security vendor\u2019s threat intelligence system. The result? Future versions of files may get the \u201call clear\u201d and be able to bypass sandbox inspection and other advanced security systems. Two-faced malware could be enhanced to game sandbox rating systems in a counter-intelligence move, making it much more difficult to detect.Security vendors may need to develop stronger verification systems in response, which could ultimately impact network performance.There is a constant struggle between cyber guardians and cyber criminals. With a growing attack surface, this battle will come into increasing focus over the next year. It will take new approaches and considerable resources to ensure this doesn\u2019t become the zero-sum game of a Cold War-era arms race. Each year, advanced persistent threats become more sophisticated and hackers become savvier. It\u2019s up to security researchers and vendors to stay one step ahead of emerging trends like ghostware and two-faced malware and begin to develop more sophisticated defenses and security protocols.Derek Manky, Fortinet\u2019s Global Security Strategist, formulates security strategy with more than a decade of advanced threat research with the ultimate goal to make a positive impact towards the global war on cybercrime.

Don\u2019t feel disappointed there is good news! There are several tools out there that can be handy to protect privacy and record whatever is happening around you. Here are some of the tools, apps, and gadgets which may help the activists, protesters and privacy advocates.The Backlash Kit:The Backlash kit has become quite popular over the internet suddenly since everybody seems to be talking about it. It is a wholesome package of numerous devices created by two designers for the safety and communicational ease of protesters while participating in demonstrations.The kit is fully loaded with helpful gadgets in the disguise of regular use items whereas some items are inspired by small-sized military use weapons like a hand grenade. Such as, one of the items in the kit is a black & white colored, digitally patterned blocky bandanna that probably has been inspired from the trademark Arabic Keffiyah.This is, however, no ordinary bandanna because the blocky pattern stores the message and the Backlash app helps the user in accessing these messages later.The kit seems to have hit the market at the right time when the stage is set for unending demonstrations and protests in the wake of Paris attacks and Britain\u2019s decision of joining the war against ISIS. It is not a hidden fact that law enforcement agencies are always equipped with multiple, advanced and high-tech gadgets to disperse the protestors. For example, the controversial Long-Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) sound weapons that primarily helps in dispersing crowds.Another common device used to thwart protesters is the Stingray, which was developed for the US Navy, but is used widely to conduct secret mass surveillance and tracking cell phones. Already, the privacy of citizens is of little importance to law enforcement agencies all over the world.The FBI admitted that it conducted a secret surveillance program over 30 major US cities and used special aircraft equipped with Hi-Res cameras. Part of the program was covering the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson and Baltimore, Maryland.Recently we also were informed that the NYPD had been provided with unmarked white vans equipped with advanced X-ray technology that can see through people\u2019s clothing and walls. Therefore, to help protesters while demonstrating against any cause and providing them with sufficient gadgetry for self-protection became an important point of research for many.The designer duo from NYU\u2019s Interactive Telecommunication Program was among those who were concerned about it and thus, conceived the idea of creating the unique Backlash toolkit.Pedro Oliveira and Xuedi Chen, the designer duo, said in the official statement that:\u201cThere is a huge disparity between a number of technologies used by the authorities and the technologies available to protesters and activists during protests and riots. That gap is only getting wider. The backslash is not created with a political agenda nor is it a call to action. The aim was not to find a solution to these problems; we are far from that. Instead, Backslash focuses on design to provoke thought and to spark debate.\u201dThe toolkit debuted at the Radical Networks conference in Brooklyn in October 2015.Backlash kit is a comprehensive package including various devices created solely for the safety of protestors and also to help them communicate with others.The toolkit has a number of unique gadgets such as portable routers which can enable improved communication networks in case of an Internet blackout occurs. It also can prevent cell phone surveillance by blocking radio signals.According to Oliveira, most of the devices were created after analyzing the first-hand experiences of friends who participated in the year 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul and last years\u2019 Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong.Also came in handy were the experiences of the designers themselves while they were participating in their native country Brazil\u2019s Vinegar Revolt in 2013.The designers state they realized that one relatively common practice by the law enforcement included \u201cBottlenecking.\u201d This involved creating blockades to restrict the movements of protesters into areas where they cannot be covered by television or print media cameras.This tactic also helps police in forcing the protesting crowd to gather at a secluded point where they can be easily beaten or arrested. To counter Bottlenecking tactic, the Backlash toolkit includes a wearable \u201cpanic button\u201d bracelet, which when activated via a button causes all the bracelets to vibrate and flash signals warning of an approaching threat.The kit also contains a small-sized \u201cpersonal black box\u201d that can form its Wi-Fi hotspot and helps protestors to capture pictures, videos and store it on an SD card automatically.This ensures that the evidence will be safe even if the device gets confiscated or destroyed by the police.Looking like a grenade, the black colored device is also part of the toolkit. When the pin is pulled from the top of it, the device turns into a portable router.What else is out there for protestors, activists and privacy advocates?If you feel you fall into any of the categories among the above three, then here are few tools that can help you in the future.Anti-Surveillance Mask:  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});On September 16, 2014, Leo Selvaggio came up with a unique idea of designing an anti-surveillance face mask which if put on the face can let you pass as someone else. The idea was criticized by some and adored by many. The critics took it as a tool which can allow criminals to hide their identity while the activists took it as a tool to protect their identity from the police and avoid facial recognition.Police monitoring and recording app:In May 2015, the ACLU of California introduced a free smartphone app that would enable users to send videos of questionable police activity straight to the organization, streamlined in such a way that recordings would reach ACLU even if the officers try to alter or remove it.

They had 99 percent accuracy rate in revealing what the circuit was about either if it was a web browsing request, an introduction point or a rendezvous point (used when another user wants to connect to the same hidden server).Learning from this, MIT scientists with the help of Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed \u201cVuvuzela\u201d system that will allow messages to be exchanged at the rate of about one per minute.The main differenceWhat\u2019s different about their system is that it doesn\u2019t allow anyone to develop patterns and make their way to the original servers and unlike Tor this system has been proven mathematically by the researchers in a public available paper \u201cScalable Private Messaging Resistant to Traffic Analysis\u201d.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});So, in order to make the system works each user leaves a message on predefined location like on an internet connected dread-drop server and other person retrieves the message.
