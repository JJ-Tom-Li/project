The flaw could allow an attacker to install malware remotely on victim machine that can be used to view, modify or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights, according to MS16-087 bulletin by Microsoft.Usually in corporate networks admins allow printers to deliver the necessary drivers to workstations connected to the network.

Like servers, several computers are also connected to printers in an effort to print documents as well as download drivers.

The profile picture was noted to have often being changed to that of a woman typically in a suggestive pose or wearing lingerie/swimwear.The hackers have also managed to compromise even verified accounts belonging to celebrities, such as electrofunk band Chromeo, a The Telegraph reporter, stand-up comedian Azeem Banatwala, Houston Texans wide receiver Cecil Shorts III, and the late New York Times reporter David Carr.It was also noted that most of the accounts that were hacked were old (the oldest of which was registered in 2007) and some of the accounts also appeared to be dormant, with no new tweets posted in years. It is suggested that if u have a twitter account make sure you have a strong password by using a password manager to generate a strong and secure password to avoid such hacks.
