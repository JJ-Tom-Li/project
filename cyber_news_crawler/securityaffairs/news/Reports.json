Operators of the major black markets in the darknets buy and sell code-signing certificates, but according to an interesting research conducted by threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, the prices for them are too expensive for most hackers.\n\nCybercriminals would use the Dark Web for selling high-grade code certificates -which they have obtained from trusted certificate authorities- to anyone that is interested in purchasing them.\n\nSales of code signing certificates have increased considerably since 2015 when experts from IBM X-Force researchers provided some best practice guides on checking for trusted certificates.\n\nDigital certificates allow companies to trust the source code of a software and to check its integrity, The certificates are issued by the certificate authorities (CAs) and are granted to companies that generate code, protocols or software so they can sign their code and indicate its legitimacy and originality.\n\nUsing signing certificates is similar to the hologram seal used on software packages, assuring they are genuine and issued from a trusted publisher. Users would receive alerts in an attempt to install files that are not accompanied by a valid certificate. This is why cybercriminals aim to use certificates for legitimizing the malware code they make.\n\nAccording to Andrei Barysevich, Director of Advanced Collection at Recorded Future, most of the code-signing certificates are obtained by hackers due to fraud and not from security breaches suffered by the CAs.\n\n\u201cRecorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group investigated the criminal underground and identified vendors currently offering both code signing certificates and domain name registration with accompanying SSL certificates.\u201d states the report published by Recorded Future.\n\n\u201cContrary to a common belief that the security certificates circulating in the criminal underground are stolen from legitimate owners prior to being used in nefarious campaigns, we confirmed with a high degree of certainty that the certificates are created for a specific buyer per request only and are registered using stolen corporate identities, making traditional network security appliances less effective.\u201d\n\nCybercriminals offer the precious commodity via online shops, when buyers place an order the shop\u2019s operators used stolen identities from a legitimate company and its employees to request the certificate for a fake app or website to the CAs (i.e. Comodo, Thawte, and Symantec).  The certificates are used to encrypt HTTPS traffic or sign apps.\n\nRecorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group investigated the criminal ecosystem and identified vendors currently offering both code signing certificates and domain name registration with accompanying SSL certificates.\n\nThe researchers identified four well-known vendors operating since 2011, only two vendors are currently still active in Russian-speaking crime forums.\n\n\u201cOne of the first vendors to offer counterfeit code signing certificates was known as C@T, a member of a prolific hacking messaging board.\u201d continues the report. \u201cIn March 2015, C@T offered for sale a Microsoft Authenticode capable of signing 32/64b versions of various executable files, as well as Microsoft Office, Microsoft VBA, Netscape Object Signing, and Marimba Channel Signing documents, and supported Silverlight 4 applications. Additionally, Apple code signing certificates were also available.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrices for code-signing certificates range from $299 to $1,799, most expensive items are the fully authenticated domains with EV SSL encryption and code signing capabilities.\n\n\u201cStandard code signing certificates issued by Comodo that do not include SmartScreen reputation rating cost $295. A buyer interested in the most trusted version of an EV certificate issued by Symantec would have to pay $1,599, a 230 percent premium compared to the price of the authentic certificate.\u201d continues the report.\n\n \u201cFor those seeking to purchase in bulk, fully authenticated domains with EV SSL encryption and code signing capabilities could also be arranged for $1,799\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nAccording to recorded future, code signing certificates are not widespread among malware developers due to the high price.\n\nVxers prefer to pay less for other AV evasion tools, such as crypters (readily available at $10-$30)that represent an excellent compromise between cost and effectiveness\n\n\u201cUnlike ordinary crypting services readily available at $10-$30 per each encryption, we do not anticipate counterfeit certificates to become a mainstream staple of cybercrime due to its prohibitive cost.\u201d concluded the report. \u201cHowever, undoubtedly, more sophisticated actors and nation-state actors who are engaged in less widespread and more targeted attacks will continue using fake code signing and SSL certificates in their operations\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  code signing certificates, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/code-signing-certificates", "topic_name": "Code-Signing certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darkweb", "topic_name": "Darkweb"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/underground", "topic_name": "underground"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyberattacks cost the United States between $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69298/security/cyberattacks-cost-us.html", "title": "Cyberattacks cost the United States between $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 20, 2018", "body": "How much cost cyber attacks to the US? According to a report published by the White House Council of Economic Advisers last week, the cyberattacks cost between $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016, and things can go worse in the future.\n\n\u201cThis report examines the substantial economic costs that malicious cyber activity imposes on the U.S. economy. Cyber threats are ever-evolving and may come from sophisticated adversaries. Due to common vulnerabilities, instances of security breaches occur across firms and in patterns that are difficult to anticipate.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cFirms in critical infrastructure sectors may generate especially large negative spillover effects into the wider economy.\u201d\n\nThe report analyzed the impact of malicious cyber activities on public and private entities, including DoS attacks, sabotage, business disruption, and theft of proprietary data, intellectual property, and sensitive financial and strategic information.\n\nDamages and losses caused by a cyber attack may spill over from the initial target to economically linked organizations. More exposed are critical infrastructure sectors, at attack against companies and organization in this industry could have a severe impact on the US economy.\n\nThe document warns of nation-state actors such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, that are well funded and often conduct sophisticated targeted attacks for both sabotage and cyber espionage.\n\n\u201cFinally, and perhaps most important, if a firm owns a critical infrastructure asset, an attack against this firm could cause major disruption throughout the economy.\u201d reads the report.\n\n\u201cInsufficient cybersecurity investment in these sectors exacerbates the risks of cyberattacks and data breaches. The economic implications of attacks against critical infrastructure assets are described in more detail later in the paper. \u201c\n\n\n\nThe reports also warn of devastating cyberattacks that would target sectors that are internally interconnected and interdependent with other sectors.\n\nThe report offered little in the way of new recommendations on improving cybersecurity, but noted that the situation is hurt by \u201cinsufficient data\u201d as well as \u201cunderinvestment\u201d in defensive systems by the private sector.\n\n\u201cCyber connectivity is an important driver of productivity, innovation, and growth for the U.S. economy, but it comes at a cost. Companies, individuals, and the government are vulnerable to malicious cyber activity.\u201d concludes the report. \u201cEffective public and private-sector efforts to combat this malicious activity would contribute to domestic GDP growth. However, the ever-evolving nature and scope of cyber threats suggest that additional and continued efforts are critical, and the cooperation between public and private sectors is key.\u201d \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyberattacks cost, US)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberattacks-cost", "topic_name": "Cyberattacks cost"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "CSE CybSec ZLAB Malware Analysis Report: Dark Caracal and the Pallas malware family", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68983/apt/dark-caracal-pallas-malware.html", "title": "CSE CybSec ZLAB Malware Analysis Report: Dark Caracal and the Pallas malware family\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 12, 2018", "body": "The malware researchers from ZLab analyzed a collection of samples related to a new APT tracked as Dark Caracal, which was discovered by Electronic Frontier Foundation in collaboration with Lookout Mobile Security.\n\nDark Caracal has been active at least since 2012, but only recently it was identified as a powerful threat actor in the cyber arena.\n\nThe first analysis of the APT linked it to Lebanese General Directorate of General Security.\n\nDark Caracal is behind a number of stealth hacking campaigns that in the last six years, aimed to steal text messages, call logs, and files from journalists, military staff, corporations, and other targets in 21 countries worldwide.\n\nOne of their most powerful campaigns started in the first months of last year, using a series of trojanized Android applications to steal sensitive data from the victim\u2019s mobile device.

There was a surge of 90% in ransomware detection for business customers in such way that it had become the fifth most detected threat. Regarding its modus operandi, the researchers found out a change in the distribution of malicious payloads, which includes banker Trojans and cryptocurrency miners.\n\nRansomware was on the rise, but it was not the only method employed by hackers. The report reveals that hackers had used banking trojans, spyware and hijackers to steal data, login credentials, contact lists, credit card data and spy on the user as an alternative way to compromise system security. The report discovered that hijackers detection grew 40% and spyware detection grew 30%. The report lists the Top 10 business threat detections with the five most significant threats being: Hijacker, Adware, Riskware Tool, Backdoor, and Ransomware respectively.\n\n\n\nWhile the report covers a variety of threats, it emphasizes how malware outbreak had evolved. A game changer to the ransomware outbreak like WannaCry was the government exploit tool EternalBlue that was leaked and has been employed to compromise update processes and increased geo-targeting attacks. According to the report these tactics had been adopted to bypass traditional methods of detection.\n\nThe report highlights the delivery techniques utilized by ransomware due to the EternalBlue exploit tool leaked from NSA. The usage of this exploit tool was a ground break landmark to the development of WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware. The EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144) is a vulnerability in Server Message Block (SMB) handling present in many Windows operating systems. WannaCry was able to widespread globally due to operating systems that were not properly updated.\n\nThe report dedicates a special attention to NotPetya ransomware, as it was influenced by ransomware Petya and WannaCry. This ransomware has used two Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerabilities: EternalBlue (CVE2017-0144) and EternalRomance (CVE-2017-0145) and was also able to encrypt the MFT (Master File Table) and the MBR (Master Boot Record) on affected systems. Other malware analyzed in the report, that used the leaked exploit tools from the  NSA was: Adylkuzz, CoinMiner, and Retefe.\n\nThe researchers also unveil a new attack vector employed by hackers: Geo Targeting attacks. In this type of attack, groups of hackers or rogue nations employ a variety of techniques to disrupt, destabilize, or compromise data in specific countries. The Magniber malicious code targeted South Korea specifically and the BadRabbit had targeted Ukraine.  Although NotPetya emerged in Ukraine its action was not limited within its borders.\n\nFinally, the report brings forth to light trends based on data collected. Cyptocurrency miners already become a new threat with the recent news of a steal of bitcoins from Japan. Other trends to watch out this year in the report is the attacks on the supply chain, the increase of malware in MAC systems and leaks in government and in companies that will lead to new zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/ransomware-detections-up-90\u2013for-businesses-in-2017/d/d-id/1330909\n\nhttp://www.information-age.com/ransomware-detections-increased-90-123470549/\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jan/25/ransomware-detections-90-percent-2017-leaked-nsa-e/\n\nhttp://www.computerweekly.com/news/252433761/Ransomware-was-most-popular-cyber-crime-tool-in-2017\n\nhttps://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/malware-tactics-shifted/\n\nhttps://press.malwarebytes.com/2018/01/25/malwarebytes-annual-state-malware-report-reveals-ransomware-detections-increased-90-percent/\n\nhttps://www.malwarebytes.com/pdf/white-papers/CTNT_2017stateofmalware/\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and an enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

The huge malvertising campaign was dubbed EvilTraffic\n\nThe compromised websites involved in the EvilTraffic campaign run various versions of the popular WordPress CMS. Once a website has been compromised, attackers will upload a \u201czip\u201d file containing all the malicious files. Despite the \u201czip\u201d file has different name for each infection, when it is uncompressed, the files contained in it have always the same structure. We have found some of these archives not used yet, so we analyzed their content.\n\nThe malicious files are inserted under a path referring probably different versions of the same malware (\u201cvomiu\u201d, \u201cblsnxw\u201d, \u201cyrpowe\u201d, \u201chkfoeyw\u201d, \u201caqkei\u201d, \u201cxbiret\u201d, \u201cslvkty\u201d).\n\nUnder this folder there are:\n\nAn example of this structure is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nThe main purpose of the \u201cmalware\u201d used in the EvilTraffic campaign is to trigger a redirecting chain through at least two servers which generate advertising traffic.\n\nThe file \u201c{malw_name}.php\u201d becomes the core of all this context: if it is contacted by the user through the web browser, it redirects the flow first to \u201ccaforyn.pw\u201d and then to \u201chitcpm.com\u201d, which acts as a dispatcher to different sites registered to this revenue chain.\n\n \n\n\n\nThese sites could be used by attackers to offer commercial services that aim to increase traffic for their customers, but this traffic is generated in an illegal way by compromising websites. The sites could host also fraudulent pages which pretend to download suspicious stuff (i.e. Toolbars, browser extensions or fake antivirus) or steal sensitive data (i.e. credit card information).\n\nIn order to increase the visibility of the web, the compromised sites must have a good page-rank on search engines.

In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago \u2013 at the end of 2014.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\n\u201cSince then, the implant\u2019s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals.\u201d\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll show you that the malware was first found by the security researcher at ESET Lukas Stefanko and the first detailed analysis of the spyware (titled \u201cMalware Analysis Report: Fake 3MobileUpdater\u201c) was published by the experts at the CSE Cybsec ZLab.\n\nThe Android Italian Job \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\n\nAndroid Spy Trojan steals sensitive info from victimsSpreads in #Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 as fake telecommunication company @Tre_ItRemotely controlled, capable of: install apps, upload files, uses accessibility, take pics, record audio, get sms/location, XMPP\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1dHSW1wGQ3\n\n\u2014 Lukas Stefanko (@LukasStefanko) November 9, 2017\n\n\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Skygofree has being distributed through fake web pages mimicking leading mobile network operators. The attackers registered some of the domains used in the attack since 2015.\n\nThe most recently observed domain was registered on October 31, 2017, according to Kaspersky data the malicious code was used against several infected individuals, exclusively in Italy.\n\nThe team of researchers at CSE CybSec ZLab analyzed in November a fake 3 Mobile Updater that was used pose itself as a legitimate application of the Italian Telco company, TRE Italia.\n\n\u201cThe most classic and efficient method used to lure the users is to believe that the application does something good. This is just what 3 Mobile Updater does. In fact, this malicious Android application looks like a legitimate app used to retrieve mobile system update and it improperly uses the logo of the notorious Italian Telco company, TRE Italia, in order to trick victims into trusting it.\u201d reads the report published by CSE CybSec.\n\n\n\nThe analysis conducted by Kaspersky suggests the involvement of an Italian firm due to the presence in the code of strings in Italian.\n\n\u201cAs can be seen from the comparison, there are similar strings and also a unique comment in Italian, so it looks like the attackers created this exploit payload based on android-rooting-tools project source code.\u201d states Kaspersky.\n\nThe CSE CybSec researchers arrived atthe same conclusion, below a portion of the code analyzed by the members of the ZLab.\n\n\n\n\u201cMoreover, both in the logcat messages and in the code, the malware writers used the Italian language. So, we can say with high confidence that this malicious app has been written by an Italian firm that intended to target users of the Italian telco company Tre.\u201d CSE wrote in the analysis.\n\nThe artifacts analyzed by Kaspersky in the malware code and information gathered on the control infrastrucure suggest the developer of the Skygofree implants is an Italian IT company that works for surveillance solutions.\n\n\n\n \n\nKaspersky Lab has not confirmed the name of the Italian company behind this spyware, we at the CSE CybSec ZLab opted for the same decision in October due to the possible involvement of law enforcement or intelligence Agencies.\n\nUnfortunately, the OPsec implemented by the firm is very poor. The name of the company is present in multiple reference of the code. Not only, one of the domains used to control registered by the attacker is linked to an Italian technology company.\n\n\u201cAlthough the security firm has not confirmed the name of the Italian company behind this spyware, it found multiple references to Rome-based technology company \u201cNegg\u201d in the spyware\u2019s code. Negg is also specialized in developing and trading legal hacking tools.\u201d states the blog post published by THN.\n\nOnce installed, Skygofree hides its icon and starts background services to conceal its malicious actions from the victim, one interesting feature implemented by the malicious code prevents its services from being killed.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, a self-protection feature was implemented in almost every service. Since in Android 8.0 (SDK API 26) the system is able to kill idle services, this code raises a fake update notification to prevent it\u201d continues Kaspersky.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the Skygofree malware was enhanced since October implementing a sophisticated multi-stage attack and using a reverse shell payload.\n\nThe malicious code includes multiple exploits to escalate privileges for root access used by attackers to execute sophisticated payloads, including a shellcode used to spy on popular applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Line, and Viber.\n\nThe same spying abilities were implemented in the app we analyzed at the CSE CybSec.\n\n\u201cThe capabilities of this malicious app are enormous and include the information gathering from various sources, including the most popular social apps, including Whatsapp, Telegram, Skype, Instagram, Snapchat. It is able to steal picture from the gallery, SMS and calls registry apps. All this data is first stored in a local database, created by the malicious app, and later it is sent to the C2C.\u201d reads the preliminary analysis published on SecurityAffairs.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple, exceptional capabilities: usage of multiple exploits for gaining root privileges, a complex payload structure, [and] never-before-seen surveillance features,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nSkygofree is able to take pictures and videos remotely, monitor SMS, call records and calendar event, of course, it also able to gather target\u2019 location and access any information stored on the mobile.\n\nSkygofree also can record audio via the microphone, the attacker can also force the victim\u2019s device to connect to compromised Wi-Fi networks it controls in order to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nKaspersky also found a variant of Skygofree targeting Windows users, a circumstance that suggests the same company is also targeting machines running Windows OS.\n\nThe best way to prevent yourself from being a victim is to avoid downloading apps via third-party websites, app stores or links provided in SMS messages or emails.\n\nComparative analysis fake 3 Mobile Updater vs SkyGoFree\n\nI asked my colleague Dr. Antonio Pirozzi, Director of the CSE CybSec ZLab, to compare the stubs of code shared by Kaspersky with the ones related to the code we analyzed back in November.\n\nThis is what has emerged:\n\nThese classes are identical:\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android malware, Skygofree)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/italy", "topic_name": "Italy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-analysis", "topic_name": "Malware Analysis"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/skygofree", "topic_name": "Skygofree"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tre-italia", "topic_name": "Tre Italia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zlab", "topic_name": "ZLAB"}]}, {"news_name": "Mobile App Flaws of SCADA ICS Systems Could Allow Hackers To Target Critical Infrastructe", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67701/iot/scada-mobile-security.html", "title": "Mobile App Flaws of SCADA ICS Systems Could Allow Hackers To Target Critical Infrastructe\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 13, 2018", "body": "In a report released today, by IOACTIVE, researchers\u2019 advice that critical infrastructure mobile applications are being developed without secure coding compliance that could allow hackers to target Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Industrial Control Systems.\n\nSCADA-ICS stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Industrial Control System, that represents the industrial automated systems operating on critical infrastructure. These systems are responsible for the control and operation of critical services like clean water and energy respectively. Researchers of IOACTIVE released a report analyzing the impact on the security of SCADA-ICS systems operating connected to the internet of things (IoT) and mobile applications.\n\nThe report states that mobile applications are present in many ICS segments and can be divided into two groups, Local (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) and remote applications (Internet, VPN), which are exposed to three types of attacks such as Unauthorized physical access to the device or \u201cvirtual\u201d access to device data, Communication channel compromise (MiTM), Application compromise.\n\n\n\nConsidering these attacks mobile SCADA applications can lead to Directly/indirectly influencing an industrial process or industrial network infrastructure and compromising an operator to unwillingly perform a harmful action on the system.\n\nThe research was conducted based on OWASP 2016 and analyzed 34 vendors that released the app on Google Play Store. The mobile app analyzed revealed that 147 security issues were identified related to secure coding programming that would allow code tampering.\n\nThe researchers noticed that hackers could gain remote control to smartphones to further launch attacks on ICS vulnerable app used on hardware and software. Also, the researchers pointed out that there was an increase of 16 vulnerabilities per application.\n\nRegarding the vulnerabilities, researchers found out that insecure authorization was present with some apps failing to include any form of authentication. Other vulnerabilities live reverse engineering were present due to the absence of code obfuscation. insecure data storage and unintended data leakage were present which could allow hackers to access the app or data related to \u2018Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition\u2019 system.\n\nThe security of society is at stake since these new vulnerabilities pose a great threat, even more than the damage caused by the 2016 Ukrainian attack. The report recommends to app developers to consider secure coding in the development planning due to the impacts on society that these flaws represent.\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and a enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

It is likely a new variant of \u201cursnif v3\u201d, another evolution of an old banking trojan that was spreading since November 2017. Moreover, the command and control of this new malware, oretola[.]at has been sinkholed by authorities, so it is difficult to reconstruct the entire behavior and the real purpose of this malware.\n\nHowever, it is very interesting to analyze its stealth evasion technique that allows it to be invisible to many modern antivirus software. In fact, its final stage is to hide itself as a thread of \u201cexplorer.exe\u201d process and this make the analysis very difficult. To reach its goal, the malware uses a sort of \u201cdouble process hollowing\u201d technique based on Windows Native API, leveraging the \u201csvchost.exe\u201d system process as a way to make privilege escalation and to get to inject malicious code in \u201cexplorer.exe\u201d.\n\nOnly after the concealment in \u201cexplorer.exe\u201d it starts to make its malicious operations that consist of contacting a series of compromised sites the host encrypted additional payloads.

In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla.\n\nIn the most recent attacks, the group is packaging its macOS backdoor with a real Adobe Flash installer and downloading the malware on victim systems from endpoint systems that use a remote IP belonging to Akamai, the Content Delivery Network that is also used by Adobe for its supply chain. Legitimate Flash installer, in fact, are also distributed through the Akamai network.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, we have observed a strange, new behavior, leading to compromise by one of Turla\u2019s backdoors. Not only is it packaged with the real Flash installer, but it also appears to be downloaded from adobe.com.\u201d reads the report published by ESET.\n\n\u201cFrom the endpoint\u2019s perspective, the remote IP address belongs to Akamai, the official Content Delivery Network (CDN) used by Adobe to distribute their legitimate Flash\ninstaller. \u201c\n\nResearchers noted that Turla installers were exfiltrating information to get.adobe.com URLs since at least July 2016, data were sent back to legitimate URLs at Adobe.com. The download attempts observed by ESET observed were made through HTTP and not via HTTPS, the researchers state with confidence that Adobe was not compromised.\n\nThe social engineering technique adopted by Turla group to trick victims into believing they are downloading a legitimate software from Adobe server is very ingenious.\n\nData collected by the experts revealed that most of the victims belong to the former USSR, targeted entities include embassies and consulates located in East Europe.\n\nAt the time of the report is still unclear how the Turla APT group distributed the backdoor through Adobe.com.\n\nExperts speculate that this is possible by compromising a machine on the victim\u2019s network to perform a local man-in-the-middle attack. In this attack scenario, the threat actors redirect traffic from a target system through the compromised server and modifying it on the fly. Another possibility is to leverage on a compromised local gateway that could allow the attackers to potentially intercept and modify traffic for the whole organization.\n\nOther attacks scenarios see Turla executing a man-in-the-middle attack at the ISP level, or BGP hijacking.\n\n\u201cWe quickly discarded the hypothesis of a rogue DNS server, since the IP address corresponds to the servers used by Adobe to distribute Flash.\u201d continues the report. \u201cThus, these are the hypotheses that remain: \u278a a Man-in-theMiddle\n(MitM) attack from an already-compromised machine in the local network, \u278b a compromised gateway or proxy of the organization, \u278c a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers.\u201d\n\n\n\nResearchers believe the most likely scenario sees attackers controlling the router for the traffic hijacking.\n\nSuch kind of attack is any way possible because the files are downloaded via HTTP, for this reason, it is important to avoid installing any update or software that was downloaded through unsecured connections.\n\nAdministrators must also check that Flash Player installers downloaded are properly signed with a valid Adobe certificate.\n\nFurther information, including the IOCs are included in the report published by ESET.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Turla APT group, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe", "topic_name": "Adobe"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/turla-apt", "topic_name": "Turla APT"}]}, {"news_name": "For the second year in a row, \u201c123456\u201d was the top password found in data dumps in 2017", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67156/security/100-top-password-2017.html", "title": "For the second year in a row, \u201c123456\u201d was the top password found in data dumps in 2017\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 27, 2017", "body": "For the second year in a row, \u201c123456\u201d was the top password among the millions of passwords exposed online due to the numerous data breaches suffered by organizations and private firms.\n\nThis is the sixth annual Worst Passwords report, the list was published by researchers at SplashData who analyzed more than five million user records containing passwords that were leaked online in 2017.\n\n\u201cUse of any of the passwords on this list would put users at grave risk for identity theft,\u201d said a SplashData spokesperson in a press release.\n\nUsers continue to use simple numerical passwords, five of the top 10 passwords on this year\u2019s list are composed of numbers only.\n\nBelow the list of the Top 10 passwords extracted from the SplashData report.\n\n1 \u2013 123456 (rank unchanged since 2016 list)\n2 \u2013 password (unchanged)\n3 \u2013 12345678 (up 1)\n4 \u2013 qwerty (Up 2)\n5 \u2013 12345 (Down 2)\n6 \u2013 123456789 (New)\n7 \u2013 letmein (New)\n8 \u2013 1234567 (Unchanged)\n9 \u2013 football (Down 4)\n10 \u2013 iloveyou (New)\n\nThe list of Top 100 Worst Passwords of 2017 is embarrassing, it includes a huge number of sports terms (i.e. football, baseball, soccer)and car brands (i.e. Corvette, Ferrari).\n\nUsers continue to use common names as their passwords, names like of Robert (#31), Matthew (#32), Jordan (#33), Daniel (#35) and many others continue to be widely used.\n\n\n\nTop passwords are the basic components of lists used by hackers in brute force attacks based on dictionaries.

But if your business relies on the Internet to sell products or collaborate, a DoS attack is more than a nuisance, it can be critical.\n\nOver the past few years, the number of DoS attacks has continued to slowly grow in a \u201ccat and mouse\u201d evolution \u2014 bad actors get a slightly stronger attack, and network vendors come up with slightly more resilient equipment to defend. Generally the attacks came from botnets comprised of infected computers and servers. The cost of acquiring and keeping these systems in the botnet was relatively expensive, so there was an economic limiter on how fast the attacks would grow. Then Mirai happened in 2016 and everything changed.\n\nThe Mirai botnet didn\u2019t struggle with corporate security teams and technical security controls like anti virus software and firewalls.\n\n\n\nInstead, it focused on the millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices like webcams and Internet routers in the home to build the botnet. With no security controls to overcome, the Mirai botnet was able to grow and launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks larger than ever seen before. A high-profile attack against Internet journalist Brian Krebs signaled that things had changed, then the October 2016 attack against DNS provider Dyn, showed how devastating a DDoS attack can be. And in the world of a cyber criminal, devastating is where the profit opportunities lie.\n\nAccording to an Arbor Networks\u2019 report at the end of 2016, \u201cIn 2016, IoT botnets emerged as a source of incredibly high volume DDoS attacks. So far these massive attacks have not leveraged reflection/amplification techniques. They are simply taking advantage of the sheer number of unsecured IoT devices that are deployed today.\u201d (PDF) The report goes on to highlight that the number of DDoS attacks was up significantly over 2015 and the average size and time of the attack has also increased. \u201cThe longest DDoS attack in Q4 2016 lasted for 292 hours (or 12.2 days) \u2013 significantly longer than the previous quarter\u2019s maximum (184 hours, or 7.7 days) and set a record for 2016,\u201d according to Kaspersky\u2019s DDoS Intelligence Report for Q4 2016. Knowing that cyber crime is fueled by profit motives now, it is safe to assume that the cyber criminals have figured out how to monetize the IoT threat and we can expect this growing trend in attacks to continue.\n\nWe have confirmation of this trend from DDos prevention provider, Corero. According to their most recent analysis, \u201cOrganizations are now experiencing an average of 8 DDoS attack attempts per day, up from 4 per day at the beginning of 2017, fueled by unsecured IoT devices and DDoS-for-hire services.\u201d Massive DDoS attacks are getting all of the press attention, but they are only part of the story. What is most interesting about the analysis, however, is the discovery that, \u201cA fifth of the DDoS attack attempts recorded during Q2 2017 used multiple attack vectors. These attacks utilize several techniques in the hope that one, or the combination of a few, can penetrate the target network\u2019s security defenses.\u201d In other words, the criminals\u2019 objective often isn\u2019t the denial of service, but using overwhelming noise at the perimeter to hide malware injection and data exfiltration activities.\n\nDDoS has joined other cyber crimes as a well established, profitable exploitation technology. For as little as $20 per hour, anyone can take advantage of DDoS-as-a-Services and launch an attack at their target of choice. The opportunity to profit from Ransom Denial of Service, where companies pay to avoid being DDoS\u2019d, to using DDoS as a mask for other profitable cyber crime activities means we haven\u2019t seen the end of the growing trend in Denial of Service attacks.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DDoS Attack, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos-attack", "topic_name": "DDoS attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}]}, {"news_name": "Freedom of the Net report \u2013 Manipulating Social Media, hacking election and much more", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65548/digital-id/freedom-net-report.html", "title": "Freedom of the Net report \u2013 Manipulating Social Media, hacking election and much more\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 14, 2017", "body": "While cyber security experts still debate cyber attacks against 2016 Presidential Election, according to the independent watchdog Freedom House at least 18 countries had their elections hacked last year.\n\nThe group surveyed 65 nation states comprising 87 percent of internet users and observed that in at least 18 cases, foreign governments or outside bodies had tried to influence an election by restricting or interfering with internet use.\n\nAccording to the organization, Governments around the world are dramatically increasing their efforts to manipulate information on social media, threatening the notion of the internet as a liberating technology, this is the message emerged from annual Freedom of the Net report.\n\n\u201cThe use of paid commentators and political bots to spread government propaganda was pioneered by China and Russia but has now gone global,\u201d said Michael Abramowitz, president of Freedom House. \u201cThe effects of these rapidly spreading techniques on democracy and civic activism are potentially devastating.\u201d\n\nWhile in some cases the interference attempts were performed by foreign actors, in the majority of the cases they were carried out either by the local government or opposition.

The money can be delivered in Bitcoin, Western Union, or other direct methods by paying a supplementary fee of 5% to 10%.\n\n\u201cOnce the malware is successfully planted and banking credentials intercepted, the perpetrator has to work with a chain of mule handlers and money-laundering intermediaries to receive a final pay-off.\u201d states the analysis from Recorded Future.\n\n\u201cA money launderer with a stellar reputation and is capable of quick turnaround, will charge a hefty 50-60 percent commission from each payment transferred from a victim\u2019s account.

It is this distribution of expertise that contributes to the underground market\u2019s resiliency.

A website\u2019s purpose is to accept connections from the Internet and return information. A bad actor can take advantage of this setup to overwhelm the web server with so many connection requests that valid connections are denied. If your business relies on eCommerce to sell products, a DoS attack directly affects your revenue. For this reason, a lot of people work to find methods to guard against such attacks. And bad actors work to find new ways of overcoming such protections.\n\nOne method deployed by the bad actors is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Many computers work together to attack a single target. Defenders put in new defences and attackers combine ever-larger collections of devices in a cyber arms race of sorts. This arms race took a new turn in 2016 when the Mirai botnet was unleashed against DNS servers showing how potent a DDoS attack can be. Leveraging consumer devices like home routers and webcams, Mirai was able to maintain a sustained attack of 640Gbps. This overwhelmed DNS servers in the United States making large portions of the Internet unavailable. There followed several equally high profile attacks and people woke up to the new reality.\n\nIn 2017, researchers uncovered a new botnet which is expanding on the tricks used by Mirai. In addition to scanning for default passwords, Reaper uses exploits to compromise more devices and grow the attack potential. There are disagreements about the specific size of the Reaper botnet, but everyone agrees it is a significant threat.\n\nThese major botnets are capable of impacting large portions of the Internet and getting into the headlines doing it. But there is another DoS story that is arguably more impactful and less well known. Over 28,00 DoS attacks occur on the Internet every day!\n\nA group of researchers unveiled their findings at the recent AMC Internet Measurement Conference in London. They gathered data from DDoS Protection Services (DPS) , amplification honeypots, and a DNS measurement platform. The data showed that one-third of all /24 networks recently estimated to be active on the Internet have suffered at least one DoS attack over the last two years.\n\n\u201cOur results reveal the massive scale of the DoS problem, including an eye-opening statistic that one-third of all /24 networks recently estimated to be active on the Internet have suffered at least one DoS attack over the last two years. We also discovered that often targets are simultaneously hit by different types of attacks\u201d reads the research paper published by the experts.\n\nWhile large-scale attacks like Mirai and Reaper may get the headlines, this amount of DDoS attacking will have real impacts for the victims.\n\n\n\nThe researchers noted that victims are likely to engage DPS providers following an attack.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we show is if a website is attacked, this creates an urgency for people to start outsourcing to protection services,\u201d said Mattjis Jonker, one of the researchers from the University of Twente.\n\nThis early research sheds light on the breadth and scale of the problem beyond the headline-grabbing attacks.\n\n\u201cDuring this recent two-year period under study, the internet was targeted by nearly 30,000 attacks per day,\u201d said Alberto Dainotti, one of the researchers from CAIDA (Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis) \n\n\u201cThese absolute numbers are staggering, a thousand times bigger than other reports have shown.\u201d \n\nThe researchers have also validated some assumptions about potential targets. The United States hosts around 25% of web addresses and received around 25% of DDoS attacks. Following a similar pattern, Google, GoDaddy, and Wix services host the most websites and also see the most attacks.\n\nFollowing this early success, researchers are next planning to include more data including DoS attacks on email servers with the ultimate goal being DDoS protection solutions.\n\nThe researchers plan to investigate the impact of DoS attacks on mail infrastructure in future projects, they already instrumented a measurement infrastructure to query for more DNS RRs on the names found in MX records.\n\n \n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DDoS Attack, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos-attack", "topic_name": "DDoS attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}]}, {"news_name": "CSE Malware ZLab \u2013 Full report of Bad Rabbit attack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65048/malware/full-analysis-bad-rabbit.html", "title": "CSE Malware ZLab \u2013 Full report of Bad Rabbit attack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 1, 2017", "body": "Recently a new ransomware, called BadRabbit, infected systems in many countries, most of in East Europe, such as Ukraine and Russia.

Developers typically sell their malware either as a single binary, or a bundle of binary and builder; and in some cases, access to a command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure.\u201d continues the report.\n\nAnother element that characterized these black market is the low presence of weapons or drugs, visitors looking to buy these items were directed to forums in the North American underground instead.\n\nGiving a look at the price list of the underground offering, markets in this area tended to be more expensive than in other regions.\n\nKeylogger goes for $19 in Middle Eastern and North African forums, much more expensive than elsewhere, in the North American underground, it is possible to buy them for between $1 and $4.\n\n\n\nThe same is for credit card data, as usual, the final price depends on the country origin.\n\n\n\nThe stolen credentials and online accounts are also much more expensive, these commodities are very attractive for hackers that use them to access e-commerce\naccounts and hijack government-owned systems and servers with weak authentication.\n\nThe following table shows that the highest price is for PayPal accounts belonging to Israeli users, they go for $50.\n\n\n\nPort numbers for Internet-connected SCADA system were available for free in the criminal underworld in this region, while a WannaCry sample was available for just $50.\n\nLet me stop here and suggest you read this excellent report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 North African cybercrime underground, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/credit-card", "topic_name": "credit card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-african-cybercrime-underground", "topic_name": "North African cybercrime underground"}]}, {"news_name": "Exclusive \u2013 CSE ZLab experts spotted a new Wonder botnet in the wild", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64633/malware/wonder-botnet-dark-web.html", "title": "Exclusive \u2013 CSE ZLab experts spotted a new Wonder botnet in the wild\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 23, 2017", "body": "While investigating the malicious code in the dark web, ZLab experts discovered a \u201cNetflixAccountGenerator.exe\u201d that promises to generate a premium account for Netflix services for free.

Banks used to be attacked by cybercriminals. Today, state-backed hackers are also doing this much more frequently. By destroying IT infrastructure cybercriminals will attempt to cover their tracks during thefts, while the aim of state-sponsored hackers will be to maximize the damage to banks and discontinue banking operations. In both cases, the damage done to banks may be even greater than the amount of funds stolen due to service interruptions and the resulting reputational and regulatory impact.\n\nHackers are increasing their focus on the crypto industry (ICO, wallets, exchanges, funds), which have been accumulating increasingly large capitalisations and funds. In technical terms, the attacks against service providers in this sector are no more difficult than against banks, however the information security in place and maturity of blockchain companies is significantly lower. A further motivation for criminal attackers is that blockchain technologies are more anonymous and unregulated \u2013 this considerably reduces the risk of being caught during money withdrawal.\n\nHackers will now successfully attack more industrial facilities as they have learnt how to work with the \u201clogic\u201d of critical infrastructure. These facilities use complex and unique IT systems: even if one gains access to them, specific knowledge about the principles of their operation is needed to conduct attacks. Over the past year, we have observed that hackers\u2019 competence has increased along with their capacities to impact critical infrastructure. Therefore, we now forecast new large-scale incidents targeting industrials and related core infrastructure.\n\nBlackEnergy group continues to attack financial and energy companies. The group uses new tools that allow Remote terminal units (RTUs) responsible for the physical opening/closing of power grids to be remotely controlled. Test attacks on power generating companies in the UK and Ireland were tracked in the summer of 2017.\n\nHI-TECH CRIME MARKET ASSESSMENT\n\nThe growth in the number of attacks and the totals stolen is a significant indicator of hackers\u2019 capabilities, which drive changes in their tactics and targets. The majority of attackers follow the money, and if they find more efficient and safer ways to earn it, they start investing in them, creating new tools, services, and attack schemes.\n\nIn Russia, the amount of losses caused by theft from legal entities is still in decline, but the loss caused by Android banking Trojans is still on the increase. The number of targeted attacks on banks and payment systems is on the rise, but hackers have earned the majority of their profits outside Russia, as we predicted last year.\n\nAfter phishing attacks on bank clients and payment systems were fully automated, the amount of loss from their activity in Russia became very significant. Every day they attack many more users than banking Trojans, but the net amount of loss is still smaller. However, due to the simplicity of this scheme, an increasing number of criminals are starting to use it.\n\nDevelopment of Hacking Tools\n\nThe full version of Hi-Tech Crime Trends 2017 is available on the Group-IB website\n\nhttps://www.group-ib.com.\n\nAbout Group-IB\n\nGroup-IB is one of the global leaders in preventing and investigating high-tech crimes and online fraud and the first Russian supplier of threat intelligence solutions included in Gartner, Forrester, and IDC reports.

Appthority compiled a list of the top 100 apps (50 iOS and 50 Android)\nbased on millions of scans of devices and apps in the enterprise. Using our Mobile Threat Protection solution, we determined the most common apps and their Mobile Threat Risk Scores\u201d states the report.\n\nAccording to the company, iOS apps are mainly blacklisted because many of them leak data. Whatsapp is the most commonly blacklisted iOS app because it sends information from the device\u2019s address book to a remote server.\n\nGiving a close look at the list of commonly blacklisted iOS apps, we can notice the presence of Pokemon GO, the risks for this app are related to the accesses to the device\u2019s address book and camera, and tracking of the user\u2019s location that poses users\u2019 privacy at risk.\n\nAnother app that is commonly blacklisted is WinZip, the reason is that the application sends SMS messages.\n\nThis type of behavior can pose a serious risk in an enterprise environment, especially if the data is transmitted without being encrypted.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see now which are commonly blacklisted apps for Android. The firth thing that is immediately verifiable is that most of the top blacklisted iOS apps are in the social networking and entertainment category, meanwhile, in the case of Android apps they are in the \u2018tools\u2019 category.\n\nThe most frequently blacklisted Android app is Poot, a tool used by its users to root their devices. Other commonly blacklisted applications are AndroidSystemTheme, Where\u2019s My Droid Pro, Weather, and Wild Crocodile Simulator.\n\nThe Android apps have been mainly blacklisted for data leakage or because they exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n\n\n \n\nAccording to the Appthority report based on the analysis of 150 apps used in enterprise environments, for 86.7% of Android apps the connections are to a server located in the United States, followed by Ireland (7.7%), Germany (2.1%) and Sweden (0.7%). In the case of iOS apps, nearly 94% of connections go to servers in the United States, followed by Ireland (3.82%), the Netherlands (0.86%) and Germany (0.86%).\n\n\u201cA top enterprise security concern is often the countries to which mobile data is being sent. These maps reveal the top locations to which backend servers are connecting via the top 150 mobile apps in enterprise environments.\nIn this quarter\u2019s data, we see a difference in the profile of backend connections between Android and iOS. \u201d continues the report.\n\n\u201cAndroid developers are connecting to a wider set of geographic locations, possibly leveraging lower cost structures overseas. Popular iOS apps have a much lower percentage of connections to countries such as China, Saudi Arabia and Chile than Android apps.\u201d\n\nThe situation is similar for iOS apps for which 94% of connections go to servers in the United States, followed by Ireland (3.82%), the Netherlands (0.86%) and Germany (0.86%).\n\nThe management of mobile devices in enterprise environments is a crucial aspect of their security posture, for this reason, it is essential to assess and evaluate the risks they bring.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look at the report, it also includes the list of the top 100 Android and iOS applications used in enterprises, along with their risk score.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 blacklisted apps, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blacklisted-apps", "topic_name": "blacklisted apps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/byod", "topic_name": "BYOD"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-leakage", "topic_name": "data leakage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Imperva Report Q2 2017- Over 75% of DDoS targets were hit multiple times", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63747/hacking/imperva-report-ddos-q2-2017.html", "title": "Imperva Report Q2 2017- Over 75% of DDoS targets were hit multiple times\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 3, 2017", "body": "Imperva published the Global DDoS Threat Landscape for Q2 2017, the report shows an increase in the amount of persistent application layer DDoS attack over a one-year period.\n\nAccording to Imperva, over 75% of targets were hit multiple times in Q2 2017, while the percentage was only 43.2% in the same period of 2016.\n\n\u201cWe also saw an increase in the frequency of repeat application layer attacks. In total, 75.8 percent of target websites were hit by repeat assaults, the largest percentage we have on record.

The experts noticed that 16 combinations of Mac hardware and OSes had never received any EFI firmware update during the lifetime of the 10.10 to 10.12 versions of OS X/macOS.\n\nThe situation is, even more, critic because Apple does not even warn its customers of the failed EFI update process or technical problems resulting in millions of Macs users vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\n\n\nApple uses Intel-designed Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) for Mac computers that runs before macOS boots up and has higher-level privileges. An EFI malware could be exploited by attackers to gain full control of the device without being detected.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the ability to circumvent higher level security controls, attacking EFI also makes the adversary very stealthy and hard to detect (it\u2019s hard to trust the OS to tell you the truth about the state of the EFI); it also makes the adversary very difficult to remove \u2013 installing a new OS or even replacing the hard disk entirely is not enough to dislodge them.\u201d states the Duo researchers.\n\nYou will be surprised by knowing the numbers for some specific Mac models\u201443% of the analysed iMac models (21.5\u2033 of late 2015) were running outdated, insecure firmware, and at least 16 Mac models had never received any EFI firmware updates when Mac OS X 10.10 and 10.12.6 was available.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the main EFI vulnerabilities that were acknowledged by Apple and patched during the time of our analysis, there were surprising numbers of models of Macs that received no update to their EFI despite continuing to receive software security updates,\u201d Duo researchers say.\n\nIt is very disconcerting to know that even if users are running the latest version of macOS and have installed all the security updates issued by the tech giant they are still exposed to cyber attack.\n\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re running the most recent version of macOS and have installed the latest patches that have been released, our data shows there is a non-trivial chance that the EFI firmware you\u2019re running might not be the most up-to-date version,\u201d\n\nDuo experts also found 47 models that were running 10.12, 10.11, 10.10 versions of macOS and did not receive the EFI firmware update that addressed the known vulnerability, Thunderstrike 1.\n\nWhile 31 models did not receive did not receive an EFI patch for Thunderstrike 2.\n\nThe Thunderstrike attacks were first exploited by the National Security Agency (NSA), agents. According to documents belonging to the WikiLeaks Vault 7 data dumps, the agency developed the \u201cSonic Screwdriver\u201d project, which is a \u201cmechanism for executing code on peripheral devices while a Mac laptop or desktop is booting\u201dallowing an attacker to boot its attack software for example from a USB stick \u201ceven when a firmware password is enabled\u201d.\n\nThe technique allows a local attacker to boot its hacking tool using a peripheral device (i.e. USB stick, screwdriver),\u201ceven when a firmware password is enabled\u201d on the device. This implied that the Sonic Screwdriver allows attackers to modify the read-only memory of a device, the documents revealed that malware is stored in the Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Thunderstrike hack, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bootkit", "topic_name": "bootkit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/efi-hack", "topic_name": "EFI hack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/os-x", "topic_name": "OS X"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/thunderstrike-hack", "topic_name": "Thunderstrike hack"}]}, {"news_name": "H1 2017 \u2013 Twitter suspended a total of 935,897 accounts for the promotion of terrorism", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63246/terrorism/twitter-terrorism-transparency-report.html", "title": "H1 2017 \u2013 Twitter suspended a total of 935,897 accounts for the promotion of terrorism\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 21, 2017", "body": "Twitter suspends 299,000 accounts linked to terrorism in the first six months of 2017, the company revealed that 75 percent of the infringing accounts were suspended before their first tweet confirming the huge efforts in fighting online propaganda and other activities linked to this threat.\n\nAccording to data provided in the transparency report, Twitter confirmed that 95 percent of the suspended accounts for the promotion of terrorism were identified by using internal tools designed to identify and block spam, government requests accounted for less than 1% of account suspensions.\n\nOne-quarter of those infringing accounts were suspended before the accounts posted their first tweet.\n\nIt is interesting to note that according to the report published by the social media giant, fewer than 2 percent of accounts that were suspended were reported by governments worldwide.\n\nGovernments submitted 716 separate reports that triggered the suspension of 5,929 accounts.\n\n\u201cThe second largest volume, a little more than 2% of global reports, fell within the promotion of terrorism category.

Antonio Pirozzi.\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasure for me to share with you one of the first analysis that we have recently conducted on the NotPetya Ransomware.\n\nWe have dissected the ransomware and discovered interesting details that are included in our report.\n\nBelow the abstract, the detailed report is available for free on our website.\n\nDue to the lack of updates performed by users on their machines, many threats spread out exploiting well-known vulnerabilities. This is what happened with the propagation of the NotPetya Ransomware, which infected a lot of users mostly in East Europe. This malware uses a famous exploit developed by NSA, Eternalblue, allowed by a vulnerability (MS17-010; CVE-2017-0143) in the Windows implementation of SMB protocol. The above-mentioned exploit was leaked in April 2017 and was used the first time with another malware, WannaCry, which caused more damage than NotPetya.\n\nNotPetya\u2019s could be confused with Petya ransomware (spread out in 2016) because of its behavior after the system reboot, but actually not because NotPetya is much more complex than the other one. In fact, Petya\u2019s most known characteristic is the enciphering of the Windows MBR and MFT, instead, NotPetya propagates itself in the network as a worm.\n\n\n\nIn the above figure, we have a scheme of the malware\u2019s behavior. We can see that the first phase is the searching of a file representing a kill-switch, to avoid infecting machines already compromised. Next steps are referred to the actual infection, synthesized below:\n\nAfter the reboot, the next step is the fake CHKDSK routine, very similar to Petya, where the malware enciphers the MFT. After that, we no longer have the characteristic Petya skull, but directly the screen with the ransom note, including the e-mail address of the malware writer and the relative Bitcoin address for the ransom payment.\n\nYou can download the full ZLAB Malware Analysis Report at the following URL:\n\nhttp://csecybsec.com/download/zlab/NotPetya-report.pdf\n\nAbout the author: Antonio Pirozzi\n\nPrincipal Malware Scientist and Senior Threat Researcher for CSE CybSec Enterprise spa\n\n\n\nActually, he holds more than 10 Infosec International Certification, from SANS, EC-Council and Department of Homeland Security.\nHis experience goes beyond the classical Computer Security landscape, he worked on numerous projects on GSM Security, Critical Infrastructure Security,  Blockchain Malware, composition malware, malware evasion.\n\n \n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NotPetya, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-analysis", "topic_name": "Malware Analysis"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/notpetya", "topic_name": "notpetya"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zlab", "topic_name": "ZLAB"}]}, {"news_name": "FICO reports a 39 Percent Rise in Debit Cards Compromised in US", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62650/cyber-crime/fico-cards-compromised-report.html", "title": "FICO reports a 39 Percent Rise in Debit Cards Compromised in US\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 3, 2017", "body": "In the same period, FICO reported an increase in the number of ATMs and point-of-sale devices (+21%) in the US.\n\nOne year ago, FICO reported a 30 percent increase in compromised devices for 2016, compared to 2015, and a 70 percent rise in cards compromised for that period.

This number is shockingly high when you remember that this protocol is effectively a way to expose keyboard, mouse and ultimately a Windows desktop over the network.\u201d\n\nIn May, Rapid7 published another study that revealed millions of devices exposed to cyber attacks via SMB, Telnet, RDP, and other types of improper configurations.\n\nThe study reported 10.8 million supposedly open RDP endpoints in early 2016, and 7.2 million such endpoints in the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that even if RDP is disabled by default on Windows, it is commonly exposed in internal networks for administration and maintenance purposes. The protocol poses serious risks, Microsoft addressed dozens of vulnerabilities in the Remote Desktop Protocol over the past fifteen years.\n\n\u201cThe default RDP configuration on older versions of Windows left it vulnerable to several attacks when enabled; however, newer versions have upped the game considerably by requiring Network Level Authentication (NLA) by default. If you are interested in reading more about securing RDP, UC Berkeley has put together a helpful guide, and Tom Sellers, prior to joining Rapid7, wrote about specific risks related to RDP and how to address them.\u201d\n\n\u201cRDP\u2019s history from a security perspective is varied. Since at least 2002 there have been 20 Microsoft security updates specifically related to RDP and at least 24 separate CVEs\u201d \n\nShadowBrokers revealed the existence of an NSA exploit, dubbed EsteemAudit exploit that targets Remote Desktop Protocol service (port 3389) on machines running no longer supported Microsoft Windows Server 2003 / Windows XP.\n\nIt has been estimated that over 24,000 systems remain vulnerable to the EsteemAudit exploit, for this reason, Microsoft released security updates for Windows XP to address ShadowBrokers vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-0176 exploited by EsteemAudit.\n\nRemote Desktop Protocol attacks are a privileged attack vector for malware distribution, especially ransomware.\n\nThere are many malware in the wild that already infects systems using as attack vector the Remote Desktop Protocol, (CrySiS, Dharma, and SamSam), the EsteemAudit exploit can potentially make these threats very aggressive and dangerous.\n\nAccording to the Rapid7 report, most of the exposed Remote Desktop Protocol endpoints (28.8%, or over 1.1 million) are in the United States. China is at the second place for exposed RDP endpoints (17.7%, or around 730,000), followed by Germany (4.3%, ~ 177,000), Brazil (3.3%, ~ 137,000), and Korea (3.0%, ~ 123,000).\n\n\n\nGiving a look at the organizations that own the IP addresses associated with exposed Remote Desktop Protocol endpoints the experts noticed that most of them belong to Amazon (7.73% of exposed endpoints), Alibaba (6.8%), Microsoft (4.96%), China Telecom (4.32%), and Comcast (2.07%).\n\nRapid7 reported that more than 83% of the Remote Desktop Protocol endpoints identified were willing to proceed with CredSSP as the security protocol, meaning that the RDP session was highly secured. Over 15% of the exposed endpoints indicated that they didn\u2019t support SSL/TLS.\n\n\u201cAmazingly, over 83% of the RDP endpoints we identified indicated that they were willing to proceed with CredSSP as the security protocol, implying that the endpoint is willing to use one of the most secure protocols to authenticate and protect the RDP session. A small handful in the few thousand range selected SSL/TLS. Just over 15% indicated that they didn\u2019t support SSL/TLS (despite our also proposing CredSSP\u2026) or that they only supported the legacy \u201cStandard RDP Security\u201d, which is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Over 80% of exposed endpoints supporting common means for securing RDP sessions is rather impressive. \u201d Rapid7 points out. \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Remote Desktop Protocol, hacking )\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/esteemaudit", "topic_name": "EsteemAudit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rapid7", "topic_name": "Rapid7"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rdp", "topic_name": "RDP"}]}, {"news_name": "AV-TEST: The number of malware decreases, but their complexity increases", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60714/malware/av-test-report-2016-2017.html", "title": "AV-TEST: The number of malware decreases, but their complexity increases\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 5, 2017", "body": "According to the AV-TEST Security Report 2016/2017 published by the independent anti-virus testing outfit AV-TEST, the number of malware samples detected in 2016 decreased compared to 2015, but they have been more sophisticated.\n\nThe recent NotPetya and WannaCry ransomware-based massive attacks, IoT malware like Mirai and banking Trojans implement new sophisticated techniques to avoid detection and to rapidly spread.\n\nAV-TEST spotted roughly 127.5 million malware samples in 2016, meanwhile, the number of samples discovered in 2015 was 144 million (+14%).\n\n\n\nThe research institute observed roughly 350,000 new malware samples each day, that correspond to four new samples per second.\n\nLess than one percent of the total share of Windows malware is represented by Ransomware, but the damage caused by this threat is severe.\n\n\u201cComprising not even 1% of the overall share of malware for Windows, the blackmail Trojans appear at first glance to be a marginal phenomenon.

Hackers can power a wide range of attacks on the devices, including ransomware attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and hijacking of medical devices.\n\nThe most disconcerting aspect of the research is that only 17 percent of device manufacturers and 15 percent of HDOs have adopted the necessary countermeasures to prevent attacks. 40 percent of HDOs and manufacturers admitted they haven\u2019t adopted anything to prevent attacks.\n\nUnsecured medical devices represent an entry point for hackers in hospitals and other healthcare organizations, the bad news is that the majority of the participant to the survey believe securing medical devices is very difficult.\n\nThe study revealed that security practices in place are not effective, manufacturers and HDOs lack of practices such as security testing throughout the SDLC, code review and debugging systems and dynamic application security testing.

Managers dealing with Cyber Risk, and there are not many of these, start working at all levels, who shall be entrusted with the management of Cyber Risks and, more specifically, with the transfer of risk to the Insurance Companies? The answer is a joint round table driven by the CIO. \n\nThe Clusit Report 2016 provided the basics of the terminology, key features and usefulness of cyber policies in a Focus On dedicated to insurance in support of the so-called Cyber Risk management. The authors implicitly addressed the CFO, the position that usually supervises the insurance issues in a company.\n\nOne year after, the daily dealings between businesses, insurance brokers and ICT consultants have highlighted the following elements:\n\nThis gave rise to a double investigation in the North-East of Italy, which ended in the \u201cEnterprise Cyber Risk Exposure & Insurance\u201d 1 report by Via Virtuosa, in collaboration with Margas for the insurance part, published on line at the end of 2016, hereinafter, the \u201cWhite Paper\u201d.\n\nThe first survey outlines, through the answers given by CIOs and Systems Administrators, the risk exposure of companies, so that CFOs and CEOs can become aware of the central role of the Cyber Security activity, managed in-house or outsourced. The second survey, also carried out with the help of the CIO, who has to assess the risk or the protection levels in place, tries to assess the level of knowledge and sensitivity of the insurance transfer.\n\nThe results highlight some aspects that show the key role of the CIO in the transition phase from the management of ICT security to cyber risk management for the whole company; the transfer of the so-called \u201cresidual risk\u201d to the insurance company is an ultimate, fundamental component of such management. For this reason, the white paper includes some basic information on the Italian insurance market and, above all, thanks to the 18 questions that three CIOs accepted to ask, it also includes 18 useful answers that allow people to find their direction in the purchase of an insurance policy with increased awareness.\n\n1 *The \u201cCyber Risk Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d white paper is the result of the joint efforts of Luca Moroni and Cesare Burei. It also includes the contributions by CIOs E. Guarnaccia \u2013 BPV | M. Cozzi \u2013 Hypo Bank |A. Cobelli \u2013 ATV| and the answers to their 18 questions on cyber-insurance. The risk exposure survey was carried out in the 2013-2016 three-year period, while the one on Cyber Risk Insurance in summer 2016. The white paper can be downloaded free of charge from: www.viavirtuosa.com/whitepaper and supports the \u201cGeneration Z\u201d survey on online security and the prevention of risk for minors https://www.facebook.com/ProgettoGenerazioneZ/\n\nThe certainty that it is not possible to defend oneself completely from Cyber Risks requires such risks to be managed and the relevant tools to be correctly assessed in terms of costs and benefits. In short, it is a matter of balance between the impact of a cyber or cyber-related adverse event, the money spent in the management /insurance process and the maintenance of business margins.\n\n\n\nSource: L. Moroni \u2013 \u201cCyber Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d White paper presentation at Infosek 2016 \u2013 Slovenia\n\nOn the occasion of the Security Summit and thanks to the Clusit Report, a lot of figures and percentages were made known, the better to describe the overall cyber un-safety, as they all underscore that there is no 100% safe system.\n\n\n\nSource: CHUBB Claim Trends 8/2016\n\nIt is possible to be proactive, with effective and appropriate investments on the reduction of corporate risks, in order to be prepared to deal with accidents and the costs/damages that they engender. Insurance policies turn an uncertain, often unsustainable cost/damage into a programmed and sustainable cost/premium. The choice, therefore, must be based on a careful assessment, in the prevention phase, so that the policies shall truly act as a financial and economic parachute, allowing the company to avoid the closure and be still competitive after the incident, providing the appropriate tools for compensate balance sheet losses and recover the brand reputation.\n\n\n\nSource: CHUBB Claim Trends 8/2016\n\nSpeaking about Cyber Risk Insurance, a policy or set of policies that \u201ccover\u201d the damages and costs generated by a cyber or cyber-related adverse event, it makes no sense if there is no awareness of one\u2019s risk exposure and thus there is no attempt to adopt measures to mitigate such exposure. \n\n\n\nThe risk exposure survey carried out by Via Virtuosa in the course of 3 years, synthesised in the White paper, \u201crather than highlighting an individual company\u2019s positioning and risk exposure, focuses on the statistical trends of the interviewed sample, in this case, companies in the North-Eastern part of Italy, as against a reference Base Line (Red Line). The measuring method used in this case is strictly objective (as was the case for the 2700x) and the same for the whole sample group, even though it was considerably simplified. The method in question is the one adopted by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).\n\nThose who fall in the yellow section at the top right (yellow) have a significant risk exposure, with a potentially disruptive impact on their business. Those who find themselves in this section are invited (as per the Method) to \u201coutsource their risk.\u201d\n\nThis research highlighted the following aspects:\n\nThe sample of this second survey contained a prevalence of subjects from the industry and services sectors (40% and 35%, respectively), with turnovers exceeding 20 million Euro (75%) and with over 100 employees (50% between 100-500 and 30% > 500).\n\nThis presupposes that aspects such as Reputation, Business Interruption and Sensitive Data management might be critical.\n\nIn the survey, IT Managers were asked, first of all, about the best case scenario in terms of board commitment to the creation of a corporate security team, and whether ICT security is considered an integral part of the general security approach or just as a possible source of costs and damages (questions 1,4).\n\n\n\nSource: \u201cCyber Risk Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d White paper, Via Virtuosa 12/2016\n\n\n\nSource: \u201cCyber Risk Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d White paper, Via Virtuosa 12/2016\n\nThen, the same subjects were asked to do something that was probably unusual for them: interact with their respective CFOs, in order to answer the question on the presence of some insurance policies that ought to be taken into consideration with regard to the criticalities highlighted by the risk exposure analysis. (question 3)\n\n\n\nSource: \u201cCyber Risk Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d White paper, Via Virtuosa 12/2016\n\n60% of the interviewed CIOs were involved in a wider approach to security. Again, in 60% of cases the CIO had not, to that point, taken an interest in insurance policies (q.2), and even though in 80% of cases no one in the company thought to ask him about the impact of a possible accident (q. 4), he had a clear idea of its origins (q. 4) and was able to identify the sector that might suffer the most from a business interruption (question 8).\n\n\n\nSource: \u201cCyber Risk Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d White paper, Via Virtuosa 12/2016\n\nThe CIO deals with ICT security: he monitors vulnerabilities (60% of cases) and the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plans (50-60% of cases), but deals very rarely with reputation crisis issues (18%), procedure/policy formalisation (28%) or the standardisation of issues (12%).\n\nIt is a positive sign that the CIO receives requests for information concerning ICT security management (question 7) first of all from inside the company (+70%), then from external auditors (+28%) and from customers and ICT suppliers in equal measure (23-24%). The latter percentages might increase in future, leading to a supply chain control in terms of virtuous management and also of insurance, and in any case they may constitute a good foundation for a Cyber Risk Management policy.\n\n\n\nSource: \u201cCyber Risk Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d White paper, Via Virtuosa 12/2016\n\n39% of them state that they know of security accidents occurred in the last 5 years. An analysis of the causes shows that such accidents are substantially attributable, in equal proportions, to (external/internal) attacks, with a prevalence of Ransomware (as more than 50% declared), to (internal/external) human error and to failures (question 9).\n\n\n\nSource: \u201cCyber Risk Exposure & Cyber Risk Insurance\u201d White paper, Via Virtuosa 12/2016\n\n \n\n \n\nWhat question 8 revealed concerning the CIO\u2019s opinion of the worst impact of a stop of the ICT activities on the Administration/Accounting (+ 80%), logistics and deliveries (73%) and sales (60%) departments, makes it possible for the authors to go back to the value and meaning of insurance outsourcing: failure to pay the suppliers, failure to make orders or failed deliveries can assuredly cause problems for the bottom line in the short-, medium- or long-term.\n\n\u201cVirtuous\u201d companies, that is to say, those that have adopted Cyber Risk Management policies, can therefore deal with the insurance companies with a full awareness of the residual risk that needs to be transferred, especially with regard to business interruption, intentional/accidental cyber issues and issues of general or professional third-party liability, and correctly assess also the reputation risk, if necessary.\n\nThe results of the survey show that the CIO can act as a \u201ccultural mediator\u201d for the company, with the help of a competent insurance broker.\n\nBelow is a brief synthesis of the activities of a hypothetical operational round table on the management of cyber risk:\n\nCyber Risk Exposure and proactive approach: knowing the extent and nature of the exposure\n\nNow the necessary tools and knowledge to deal with the insurance issues are in place, so it is time to TRANSFER THE RESIDUAL RISK.\n\nCyber Risk Insurance: transfer the residual risk to an Insurance Company\n\nFor further details, please refer to the Focus On feature in the 2016 Clusit Report.\n\nWe asked the CIOs of three important companies in the North-East of Italy to ask any questions they could thing of in order to make the layman understand the opportunities and limitations of the insurance policy. Here is a synthesis of the answers to the most frequently asked questions (18):\n\nIt is necessary to analyse the existing policies and check whether they cover also the ICT issues identified during the analysis;\n\nTo date, there is no requirement for a shared standard measure of exposure. Any best practices, certifications for risk mitigation can promote the successful transfer of risk to the insurance company at better coverage conditions;\n\nGDPR and insurance: it will be essential to know whether the company is in possession of Sensitive Data according to the expanded definition of the new Regulation, in which country and which measures it adopts to defend against data breach. If the company\u2019s own or Third-Party Sensitive Data are entrusted to a third party, it shall be necessary to analyse the existing contracts with the relevant supplier and check the contractual indemnities, in order to transfer the cost of the GDPR mandatory actions correctly. If the company writes or customises code, the extent of the corporate (professional, general, product) liability is to be assessed quite thoroughly;\n\nSimulate the impact of a Cyber adverse event on the bottom line, in terms of cost increases and loss of gross profit. This is maybe the most critical and underestimated field, one that is known to insurers as Business Interruption.\n\nTo conclude, it is clear that the Cyber Risk Management approach must be based on a close cooperation between the corporate risk owners and the CIO and CFO and on a virtuous supply chain that includes customers and suppliers, the help of IT professionals expert in Cyber Security management and implementation and brokers expert on cyber matters who can support the Company in the choice of the right balance between costs and insurance guarantees.\n\nContents on http://www.clusit.it/rapportoclusit\n\nGet the full report contacting rapporti@clusit.it\n\nCopyright 2017 @ CLUSIT\n\nAll rights reserved to the authors of the Opera and Clusit\n\nAny reproduction even partial publishing without the written permission of CLUSIT is forbidden.\n\nAbout the author \n\nLuca Moroni \u2013 Coordinator Working Group \u201cWhite Paper Cyber Risk Exposure e Cyber Insurance\u201d\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cyber risk, cyber security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-risk", "topic_name": "cyber risk"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/risk-management", "topic_name": "risk management"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Industrial Sector ICSs under attack \u2013 Kaspersky Lab\u2019s ICS-CERT", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57490/hacking/kaspersky-ics-cert-icss-attacks.html", "title": "Industrial Sector ICSs under attack \u2013 Kaspersky Lab\u2019s ICS-CERT\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 29, 2017", "body": "The Kaspersky Lab\u2019s ICS-CERT has published a report on the threat landscape for industrial automation systems (ICSs) related to second half of 2016.\n\nThe report shows a disconcerting reality, the number of targeted attacks on the Industrial sector continues to increase.\n\nOn average, in the second half of 2016, the security solutions deployed by Kaspersky Lab across the globe blocked attempted attacks on 39.2% of protected computers being part of industrial enterprise technology infrastructure.\n\nThe targeted systems include machines running Windows OS and performing the following functions:\n\nEvery month, an average of 20.1% of industrial computers is hit by malware, the most used attack vectors are known malicious and phishing web resources (22%), removable media (11%) and email (8%).\n\nThe devices typically used by network administrators, developers and contractors are more exposed to cyber attacks because they are often freely connected to the Internet.\n\nAt the same time, stationary workstations on the operational network (OT) are more secure because they don\u2019t typically have an always-on Internet connection.\n\nTop 15 countries based on the percentage of industrial computers attacked are Vietnam, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Iran, China, Peru, Chile, India, Egypt, Mexico, and Turkey. According to Kaspersky, Western European countries and the US are less targeted by hackers.\n\n\n\nAttackers leverage on both custom malware leveraging on zero-day exploits and widely available malicious codes to targeted ICS.\n\nIn the second half of 2016, Kaspersky detected about 20,000 different samples of malware representing over 2,000 different malware families. In most cases, they weren\u2019t specifically designed to infect industrial automation systems. These malicious codes detected by Kaspersky include Trojan spies, financial malware, ransomware (including encrypting ransomware), backdoors and Wipers (KillDisk).\n\n\u201cRemarkably, there is very little difference between the rankings of malware detected on industrial computers and those of malware detected on corporate computers. We believe that this demonstrates the absence of significant differences between computers on corporate networks and those on industrial networks in terms of the risk of chance infections. However, it is obvious that even a chance infection on an industrial network can lead to dangerous consequences.\u201d reads the report.\n\nIndustrial companies continued to be victims of spear phishing campaigns, the Kaspersky Lab ICS-CERT detected a series of spear phishing attacks which began in June 2016 and that according to the experts are still active.

The asking prices for the services we managed to find were, on average, $25 per hour, meaning the cybercriminals organizing DDoS attack are making a profit of about $18 for every hour of an attack.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\nIt is easy for criminals to pay for a DDoS attack service available in one of the numerous black markets. The services are easy to use and implement an efficient reporting system.\n\nThe majority of booters implements useful dashboards that allow them to manage loyalty programs and allow customers to plan their DDoS attacks according to the availability of the attacking infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky explained that prices for DDoS attack services depend on their generation as well as the source of attack traffic. For example, DDoS attacks powered by IoT botnets are cheaper than the ones powered by a botnet of servers.\n\n\u201cFor example, a botnet of 1000 surveillance cameras may be cheaper in terms of organization than a botnet of 100 servers. This is because cameras and other IoT devices are currently less secure \u2013 a fact that is often ignored by their owners.\u201d reads the report.\n\nAnother factor that influences the final price for a DDoS attack service is the target and its characteristics. Some services could be used to hit also well-resourced websites, such as the site of a Government. Of course, these services are more expensive.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the service may also depend on the type of anti-DDoS protection the potential victim has: if the target uses traffic filtering systems to protect its resources, the cybercriminals have to come up with ways of bypassing them to ensure an effective attack, and this also means an increase in the price.\u201d reads the report.\n\nTo give an idea of the cost, a DDoS attack against an unprotected website ranges from $50 to $100, while an attack on a protected site can go for $400 or more.\n\nThe cost of a cyber attack depends also on the location of targeted websites, DDoS attacks on English-language websites are usually more expensive than similar attacks on Russian-language sites.\n\nCrooks can power DDoS attacks for extortion, ransomware DDoS have already turned into a high-margin business, experts at Kaspersky explained that the profitability of one attack can exceed 95%.\n\nVictims of an ongoing DDoS attack are often willing to pay a ransom to stop the offensive.\n\nAll the data presented suggests that the average cost of DDoS attacks in the near future will continue to drop, while their frequency will increase.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DDoS attack service, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/booters", "topic_name": "booters"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos-attack-service", "topic_name": "DDoS attack service"}]}, {"news_name": "Global DDoS Threat Landscape Q4 2016 \u2013 US, UK and Netherlands top attacked countries", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57228/reports/global-ddos-threat-landscape-q4-2016.html", "title": "Global DDoS Threat Landscape Q4 2016 \u2013 US, UK and Netherlands top attacked countries\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 17, 2017", "body": "Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks continue to represent a serious threat to organizations worldwide.

In Q3 the experts observed longest network layer attack of the year, which lasted for 29 days.\n\nThese amazing volume of malicious traffic is reached thanks to the use of amplification vectors.\n\nThe number of application layer attacks continued to increase peaking in Q4 the number of 889 attacks a week.\n\nIn the last quarter of the year, experts from Imperva mitigated an average of 280 network layer attacks per week, totaling 3,603, a 39.4% drop from Q3. According to the experts, the majority of DDoS attacks (89%) lasted for less than one hour.\n\nImperva mitigated 11,727 application layer attacks, for an average of 889 per week (+2.9% from Q3 2016).\n\n\u201cIn Q4 2016, single-vector network attacks increased by almost seven percent from Q3, reaching a yearly high of 71%.

Axur focused on monitoring phishing attacks on financial organizations, technology firms, airlines, and online marketplaces located in the country.\n\n\u201cFraudsters in Brazil are using both traditional phishing and social media to defraud Internet users. They are also using technical tricks to make it harder for responders to stop theses scams. \u201d states the APWG.\n\nAccording to the APWG, the overall number of brands targeted by phishers during the holiday season dropped in a significant way, likely because crooks concentrated on fewer targets.\n\nThe company RiskIQ that monitored thousands of phishing attack revealed that the top-10 TLDs where phishing attacks occurred in 4Q2016 were:\n\n\n\nThe report shows that very few phishers registered domain names that were confusingly similar to the legitimate brands.

This is the first time that the JAR attributes a malicious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors.\n\n\u201cIn foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical infrastructure networks. In some cases, RIS actors masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack. This JAR provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, recommended mitigations, suggested actions to take in response to the indicators provided, and information on how to report such incidents to the U.S. Government.\u201d States the report.\n\nDespite the vast majority of information reported in the JAR were known to the experts I invite you to focus on the first statement of the above excerpt, because according to the President Obama\u2019 executive order issued in April 2015, an attack against critical infrastructure can trigger an unpredictable cyber response of the US Government.\n\nThe JAR reports the activity of two different RIS actors, the APT28 and the APT29, that participated in the cyber attacks on a US political party. The APT29 known as (Cozy Bear, Office Monkeys, CozyCar, The Dukes and CozyDuke) broke into the party\u2019s systems in summer 2015. The APT28 known as (Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit and STRONTIUM) entered in spring 2016.\n\nBoth groups and their activities were well known to security firms and intelligence agencies due to their cyber espionage campaigns that targeted organizations and companies worldwide.\n\nThe nation-state actors conducted numerous attacks leveraging spear phishing messages containing web links to a malicious dropper, also APT28 group relied heavily on shortened URLs in their spearphishing email campaigns. These take advantage of neutral space for setting up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAPT29 has been observed crafting targeted spearphishing campaigns leveraging web links to a malicious dropper; once executed, the code delivers Remote Access Tools (RATs) and evades detection using a range of techniques. APT28 is known for leveraging domains that closely mimic those of targeted organizations and tricking potential victims into entering legitimate credentials\u201d reads the JAR. \u201cOnce APT28 and APT29 have access to victims, both groups exfiltrate and analyze information to gain intelligence value. These groups use this information to craft highly targeted spearphishing campaigns. These actors set up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure, host domains and malware for targeting organizations, establish command and control nodes, and harvest credentials and other valuable information from their targets,\u201d\n\nGovernment experts explained both groups used multiple malware in their campaigns, including the XTunnel malware, the Fysbis backdoor, the Komplex Trojan, the Carberp malware.\n\nExperts observed two waves of attacks against US targets starting in the summer of 2015 and in November 2016.\n\nAccording to the FBI-DHS JAR report, nation-state hackers designated as Grizzly Steppe targeted more than US recipients in  April 2015 as part of a spear phishing campaign.\n\n\u201cIn summer 2015, an APT29 spearphishing campaign directed emails containing a malicious link to over 1,000 recipients, including multiple U.S. Government victims. APT29 used legitimate domains, to include domains associated with U.S. organizations and educational institutions, to host malware and send spearphishing emails.\u201d Continues the report.\n\nIn Spring 2016, hackers belonging to the APT28 hacker group, targeted the same political party via spear phishing email aimed to trick victims into changing their email credetianls. The hackers used a fake webmail domain hosted on operational infrastructure used by the APT28. Then APT28 used the stolen credentials to gain access target systems and exfiltrate sensitive information. The APT28 breached U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\n\u201cIn the spring of 2016, attackers were again successful when they tricked a spear phishing recipient to change their password through a fake web domain controlled by the attackers. \u201cUsing the harvested credentials, APT28 was able to gain access and steal content, likely leading to the exfiltration of information from multiple senior party members.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe JAR report confirmed information stolen by hackers was released to the press and publicly disclosed in the attempt to interfere with Presidential Election.

Crooks are now focusing their efforts on the banks in the attempt to steal cash directly from the ATMs.\n\nIn the last months, cyber criminals targeted ATM machines in Taiwan and Thailand, in both cases, crooks used a malware to infect the machine and have instructed them on spitting out cash on demand. The principal ATM manufacturers, Diebold Nixdorf and NCR Corp., confirmed to be aware of the ATM attacks and had already been working with their customers to mitigate the threat.\n\n\u201cWe have been working actively with customers, including those who have been impacted, as well as developing proactive security solutions and strategies to help prevent and minimize the impact of these attacks,\u201d said Owen Wild, NCR\u2019s global marketing director for enterprise fraud and security.\n\nThis technique is known as ATM jackpotting, the FBI has warned U.S. banks of the potential attacks.\n\nThe FBI confirmed in a bulletin earlier this month that it is \u201cmonitoring emerging reports indicating that well-resourced and organized malicious cyber actors have intentions to target the U.S. financial sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to law enforcement, the malware used in the attack could be a product of the Buhtrap ATM gang, which stole 1.8 Billion rubles ($28 Million) from Russian banks between August 2015 and January 2016.\n\nAccording to Group-IB, crooks have been targeting ATMs for at least five years, but the recent wave of attacks mostly targeted small numbers of ATMs because criminals have to physical access to the machines.\n\n\u201cTo perform a logical attack, hackers access a bank\u2019s local network, which is further used to gain total control over ATMs in their system. Cash machines are then remotely triggered to dispense money, allowing criminals to steal large amounts with relative ease. With full control over ATMs, criminals can choose the exact attack time to loot newly  filled ATMs.\u201d states the report from Group-IB. \u201cThis results in millions of dollars lost, as in the case of the First Bank. That said, such attacks do not require developing expensive advanced software \u2013 a significant amount of tools used by the hackers is widely available from public sources, as will be further covered later in this report. \u201d\n\nGroup-IB attributed the attacks against the ATMs across Europe to a single criminal group, dubbed Cobalt.\n\nThe group launched spear phishing attacks with a malicious attachment in order to infect systems in the target banks. The emails purport to come from the European Central Bank, the ATM maker Wincor Nixdorf, or other banks.\n\n\u201cCriminals send emails with attachments containing exploits and password-protected archives with executable files. In the attacks, phishing emails were sent from virtual servers, which had installed an anonymous mailing script \u201cyaPosylalka v.2.0\u201d (another name of the service is \u201calexusMailer v2.0\u201d) developed by Russian-speaking cyber-criminals.\u201d continues Group-IB.\n\nThe criminal gang use Cobalt Strike, a legitimate program designed to perform penetration testing and the Mimikatz tool to compromise domain and local accounts.\n\n\n\nThe researchers from Group-IB believe that Cobalt gang is linked to Buhtrap,\n\n\u201cGroup-IB specialists believe that just after the arrest of the Buhtrap group in May their botnet was sold to other criminals who are continuing its use to steal money from corporate accounts. That said, according to our analysis of Cobalt attacks on ATMs of Russian and European banks, the methods used by criminals to deliver phishing emails and obtain control over a domain controller are identical to those used by the Buhtrap group. Purportedly, at least a part of the Buhtrap group became Cobalt members, or more likely Buhtrap core members shifted their focus to attacks on ATMs. \u201d explains Group-IB.\n\nI suggest the reading of the Group-IB report on the Cobalt gang, it is full of details that are very useful to prevent such kind of attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cobalt gang, jackpotting attacks)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/atm", "topic_name": "ATM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/atm-jackpotting", "topic_name": "ATM jackpotting"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/buhtrap", "topic_name": "Buhtrap"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cobalt", "topic_name": "Cobalt"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "AV-TEST study sees search engine results even more poisoned with malicious links", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52867/cyber-crime/malicious-search-engine-results.html", "title": "AV-TEST study sees search engine results even more poisoned with malicious links\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 30, 2016", "body": "The vast majority of the Internet users blindly trust data provided in response to their queries to the search engines.

Let me highlight that botnet location doesn\u2019t mean that the country also hosts control infrastructure neither that criminal organizations live in the same area.\n\n\u201cThis map reveals which countries and cities unwittingly played host to the most bot-infected devices, such as PCs, Macs, smartphones, tablets and connected home devices, across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in 2015.\u201d states Symantec. \u201cThe rankings, tables and percentages are determined by total bot volumes for each country and city. The measure of \u2018Bot density\u2019 refers to a comparison of the bot population to the number of internet users in any given country or city, and calculated by dividing the amount of internet users, as reported by Internet World Stats on September 20, 2016, by total number of unique bot infections detected in a given city or country in 2015.\u201d\n\nThe experts of the security firm discovered that the Turkey (18.5% of EMEA\u2019s total bot population) there is the highest number of infected machines recruited in botnets, Istanbul and the capital city Ankara contain the highest number of botnet controlled devices in EMEA.\n\nBad news for my country, Italy is at the second place (9.8% of EMEA\u2019s total bot population) followed by the Hungary at the third place (9.1%\nof EMEA\u2019s total bot population), Rome is third in the ranking of  places with highest bot population, followed by Budapest and Szeged.\n\n\n\nThe availability of botnets for sale and rent is a precious commodity for cyber criminal organizations that could use them for many illegal activities, such as DDoS attacks and spam campaigns.\n\nIn many cases, botnets are composed of compromised IoT devices (i.e.  Cameras, routers, modems, and sensors) that could be used to launch powerful attacks.\n\nHungary ranks as the top country for bot density, Hungarian Internet users have a one in 393 chance of using a compromised device that is part of a botnet, meanwhile, in Italy the experts have found one bot for every 1829 internet users.\n\nIt is curious the data related to the principality of Monaco where people have the second largest chance of one of their devices being recruited in a botnet. Internet users in the principality have a one in 457 chance of owning a bot.\n\nGive a look at the interactive map, by clicking on a country it is possible to see all the data collected in the study.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 botnet, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spam", "topic_name": "spam"}]}, {"news_name": "ICS-CERT annual vulnerability coordination report 2015, +74% flaws", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51891/reports/annual-vulnerability-coordination-report.html", "title": "ICS-CERT annual vulnerability coordination report 2015, +74% flaws\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 4, 2016", "body": "The US ICS-CERT has published its annual vulnerability coordination report for the fiscal year 2015.

In particular, experts from CISCO were evaluating the impact of the BENIGNCERTAIN exploit. The experts also discovered another zero-day exploit dubbed EXTRABACON that could be used to hack CISCO ASA software.\n\nThe CVE-2016-6415 resides in the IKEv1 packet processing code. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit it retrieve memory contents.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the part of the code that handles IKEv1 security negotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKEv1 packet to an affected device configured to accept IKEv1 security negotiation requests,\u201d reads the security advisory published by Cisco.\n\nThe flaw affects Cisco IOS XR versions 4.3.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x and 5.2.x \u2013 versions 5.3.0 and later are not impacted. All IOS XE releases and various versions of IOS are affected.\n\nWhich is the real impact of the CVE-2016-6415 vulnerability?\n\nThe Shadowserver Foundation tried to provide further information to estimate the impact of the vulnerability in the wild, it has conducted an Internet scan for the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), which is a part of IKE.\n\n\u201cThis scan is looking for devices that contain a vulnerability in their IKEv1 packet processing code that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve memory contents, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. More information on this issue can be found on Cisco\u2019s site at: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160916-ikev1\u201d reads the page related to the Vulnerable ISAKMP Scanning Project.\n\n\u201cThe goal of this project is to identify the vulnerable systems and report them back to the network owners for remediation.

They used a specifically crafted 64 byte ISAKMP packet collecting the response from the scanned appliance.\n\n\u201cWe normally tune our scans as tightly as possible to limit the impact on the end users as well as trying to be nice to the general network traffic.  In this case we are not as tuned as we would like to be since we are having to do a full IKE negotiation making our packets almost 2600 bytes in size, at least in the first sets of tests.  With a huge amount of assistance from Cisco we were able to reduce the packet size down to 64 bytes. \u201d  reads the page on the \u201cISAKMP Scanning and Potential Vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe scan results are disconcerting, the experts discovered more than 840,000 unique IP addresses related to appliances vulnerable to the CVE-2016-6415 exploit.\n\nBelow the Top 20 countries with vulnerable ISAKMP\n\nThe highest percentage of vulnerable devices were in the United States (255,000), six times more than Russia (42,000), United Kingdom (42,000) and Canada (41,000).

The first variant of  BKDR_VAWTRAK abused a Windows feature called Software Restriction Policies (SRP) to prevent victims\u2019 systems from running a wide range of security programs\n\nWe saw several versions of the malware over the years, the last variant of Vawtrak was discovered this summer  by experts from Fidelis firm. The new version of the Vawtrak banking Trojan included significant improvements such as the SSL pinning.\n\nResearchers from Blueliv now have conducted a reverse engineering of the Vawtrak banking Trojan that confirmed the presence of two clearly differentiated infrastructures. One infrastructure dedicated exclusively to malware distribution (primarily spam), and a second one used for maintenance, control and the reporting of stolen data.\n\nThe analysis of the Vawtrak v2 revealed a complex infrastructure used to deliver the malware as well as other Trojans. Blueliv named the cybercriminal group behind this infrastructure Moskalvzapoe.\n\nMoskalvzapoe uses several servers hosting command and control (C2) for Vawtrak and other Trojans (i.e. Pony credential stealer). The threat is primary spread through spamming and drive-by download mechanisms that involved Exploit Kits (mostly Nuclear EK).\n\n\n\nThe Moskalvzapoe infrastructure presents an unusual network topology in terms of the way crooks have set up C&C servers and how they rotate their domains and exposed IPs.\n\n\u201cAll these hosts forward all the incoming connections towards the back-end.\u201d reads the analysis from BlueLiv. \u201cThe Trojans dropped by the loaders are usually found in compromised servers which share multiple characteristics including geolocation. Most of the compromised hosts can be found in Russia. Usually these hosts are compromised using security vulnerabilities found in commonly used software such as WordPress, Joombla, or Bitrix. Furthermore, the deployment of Pony Grabber, the credential-stealing malware, enables them access to other hosts and services.\u201d \n\nThe Vawtrak V2 is able to implement further actions by using additional modules, significantly expanding its capabilities. These most common modules used by the banking Trojan are:\n\nThe largest number of Vawtrak v2 infections was observed US (69,010), followed by Canada (6,777) and UK (969), meanwhile, the impact on Europe was minimal.\n\n\u201cThe total amount of data exfiltrated by the botnet is more than 2,500,000 credentials. The fact that U.S. is the most affected country is also reflected in the most affected services.\u201d reads the report published by BlueLiv.\n\nThe analysis published by BlueLive revealed the use of large-scale communication networks that increased in a significant way the level of sophistication of the criminal infrastructures to support the distribution of Vawtrak V2 worldwide.\n\nThe data emerged from the report shows the amazing abilities of cybercrime groups which have complex hierarchies and the availability of an efficient business model.\n\nI suggest the reading of the report titled \u201cChasing cybercrime: Network insights into Vawtrak v2\u201d that is full of interesting data on the malware and the threat actors behind it.\n\nBlueliv also provided Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that could be used by organizations to detect the threat.\n\nEnjoy the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Vawtrak v2, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking-trojan", "topic_name": "banking trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vawtrak-v2", "topic_name": "Vawtrak v2"}]}, {"news_name": "Akamai Q2 2016 report, the number of DDoS attacks has doubled in one year", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51295/reports/akamai-q2-2016-report.html", "title": "Akamai Q2 2016 report, the number of DDoS attacks has doubled in one year\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 16, 2016", "body": "The DDoS attacks continue to be privileged attack vectors for crooks, according to the last report published by Akamai (Akamai Q2 2016 report) the number of distributed denial of service attacks has doubled over the last 12 months.\n\nIn Q2 Akamai experts have observed a 129 per cent year-on-year increase in total DDoS attacks, the company has mitigated in Q2 a total of 4,919 attacks.\n\nOne of these DDoS attacks hit a media company and reached a 363 Gbps, anyway 10 attacks reached out over 100 Gbps.\n\nA close look at the type of attacks reveals that NTP reflection attacks almost quadrupled, increasing 276 percent over the same time frame.\n\nCompanies in the gaming and software industries are privileged targets of hackers that leverage on DDoS as an attack vector.\n\n\n\nAnother worrisome trend is related to web application attacks that increased of 14 percent in Q2 2016 over Q1.

The vast majority of the vulnerabilities documented by the experts was spotted after 2010, the year that cyber security expert link to the discovery of the cyber weapon Stuxnet.\n\nThe document published by FireEye reveals that in 2010 there were discovered 149 ICS vulnerabilities, in 2011 the number increased by 300 percent. From 2012 until 2014, the average number of ICS flaws increased by five percent year by year.

The scam is carried out by compromising legitimate business e-mail accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.\u201d reported the last Public Service Announcement (PSA). \u201cMost victims report using wire transfers as a common method of transferring funds for business purposes; however, some victims report using checks as a common method of payment.

The cyber attack was announced by the Swiss defense minister Guy Parmelin that explained that the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports was targeted by hackers.\n\nIt was not possible to attribute the attack, anyway, experts have found many similarities with another cyber attack that hit the government-owned Ruag firm.\n\nThe Ruag firm is a technology company, based in Bern, that supplies the country\u2019s military with munitions. Threat actors exfiltrated data from the systems of the firm, which is wholly owned by the Swiss government, though the extent of the theft was unknown.\n\nBelow a portion of the interview released by Parmelin to the Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger.\n\n\u201cAccording Tagesanzeiger.ch/Newsnet-Informationen hang the attacks against the VBS with a major cyber attack on the defense group RUAG together, behind Russia is suspected. Is become active in this matter, the Federal Council?\nThe Federal Council has been informed. He has proposed several measures that are now being implemented. The Attorney General has instituted a process.\n\nWhat were these attacks?\nThe attacks were of industrial espionage. Because Ruag working for the army and the federal government and 100 percent of the federal government is one, it is very important for us to minimize risks.\u201d\n\nParmelin pointed out industrial espionage has the root cause of the cyber attack and said his department was able to mitigate the attack and restore normal operations.\n\nNow the Reporting and Analysis Center for Information Assurance (MELANI) has published a detailed Technical Report about the Malware used in the Cyberespionage against RUAG.\n\nOnce the attackers found an entry point in the target network, they moved laterally compromising other devices in the architecture, this was possible by targeting directly the active directory.\n\nThe malicious code contacted its C&C servers through HTTP requests, it received from them commands and also new malicious payloads to execute. The experts noticed that only some of the infected machines directly contacted the C&C servers, instead, they received instructions and communicated through named pipes.\u201cThe malware sent HTTP requests to transfer the data to the outside, where several layers of Commandand-Control (C&C) servers were located. These C&C servers provided new tasks to the infected devices. Such tasks may consist of new binaries, configuration files, or batch jobs. Inside the infiltrated network, the attackers used named pipes for the internal communication between infected devices, which is difficult to detect.\u201d states the report published by Melani. \u201cThis way, they constructed a hierarchical peer-to-peer network: some of these devices took the role of a communication drone, while others acted as worker drones\u201d\n\nThe experts from Melani distinguish the following phases of the attack:\n\nVictim evaluation: During this phase, the attacker tries to get as much information about the target as possible. It is a preparation for the actual attack and covers at least the IP ranges, platforms and some usage patterns of their users. It is important for him to place the right waterholes and to be able to filter out unwanted victims from the actual targets. This phase is divided into several sub phases, not all need to be necessarily be in place: \u2022 Passive information gathering \u2022 Active scanning \u2022 Preparing waterholes \n\nInfecting: The infection phase consists of a fingerprint of the victim in order to find the best suited infection method (using an appropriate exploit or a social engineering technique). It has the following sub phases: \u2022 Activating waterholes / sending spearphishings \u2022 Fingerprinting: This is most often done using JavaScript \u2022 Exploiting: Depending on the target, a suitable exploit is chosen. If this is not feasible, a social engineering approach is applied. \n\nActive Infection: The attacker is now in the network. There are several sub phases here: \u2022 Trojan supported Reconnaissance: We often see an initial reconnaissance tool being placed, performing additional reconnaissance actions from within the network of the victim. This tool has not many capabilities, but can be replaced by a more powerful malware at any time. \u2022 Gaining Persistence: If the recon tool has been placed successfully and has sent out enough information, it is replaced by the actual malware with more functionality and deeper persistence in the system and the network. \u2022 Lateral Movement: The attacker begins to move laterally in order to gain access to the information he is interested in. Lateral movement is often done by using \u201cnormal\u201d tools that are also used for managing systems. The lateral movement also comprises the collection of credentials, as well as the elevation of privileges. \u2022 Data Exfiltration: As soon as the attacker begins to steal data, he must transport it outside of the network without being discovered. This is often done by first compressing the data and then sending it out, piece by piece.\n\nThe experts confirmed that it is quite difficult to estimate the damage caused by the hacking attack. The analysis of the proxy logs revealed periods of intense activities in alternate with very few activity.The report published by Melani also includes recommendations and countermeasures to defeat this Turla variant and promptly identify the presence of attackers, the authors also invite victims to share information about the attack.\n\n\n\nWho is behind Turla?\n\nIt is very hard to discover the real identity of the attackers, the report itself did not make speculation on the alleged culprits.\n\nGoing back in March 2014 the researchers at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence spotted a Russian cyber espionage campaign codenamed as SNAKE that targeted Governments and Military Networks.\n\nThe attackers behind the operation SNAKE penetrated highly secured systems all around the world, but most interesting revelation is that the Uroburos rootkit recently discovered by German security firm G Data Software was just one component of the overall SNAKE campaign.\n\nFor the SNAKE campaign the attackers used various pieces of malware, Western intelligence officers have found another spyware, dubbed Turla, used to infect government network all over the world.\n\nResearchers linked the malware Turla to popular cyber espionage campaign Red October discovered by Kaspersky in 2013 that hit government, military and diplomatic organizations all around the world.\n\nFollowing this chain of events and the discoveries made by various security firms we can speculate that behind the Turla malware there are Russian nation-state hackers.\n\nHowever, we cannot be sure that Russian hackers have now targeted the Ruag firm too.\n\nI suggest you to give a look to the report, it is full of interesting data.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

In spite of the launched hacking attacks, the overall capabilities are neither advanced nor do they demonstrate sophisticated targeting.\n\nDuring the past two years that ISIS has been growing, at least five different pro-ISIS hacking group launched cyber-attacks in favor of the Islamic State.\nAccording to techworm, on April 4, 2016, Cyber Caliphate Army (CCA), ISIS\u2019s main hacking unit, and other pro-ISIS groups like the Sons Caliphate Army (SCA) and Kalacnikov.TN (KTN) merged and formed The United Cyber Caliphate (UCC). These pro-ISIS activities are still poorly organized and likely under-resourced and have not been neither officially acknowledged nor claimed by ISIS itself.\n\nMost of the claimed attacks by the pro-ISIS hackers are beginner level and opportunistic such as exploiting known vulnerabilities to compromise websites. These pro-ISIS actors have launched attacks chiefly on government, banking, and media targets, so far, but researchers at Flashpoint expect as growing to maturity, they keep targeting financial institution.\n\nThe IS is not explicitly attempted to recruit sophisticated hackers, but its followers can broaden their knowledge and skills through hacking courses, tools, and guidance available in Deep & Dark Web forums. Pro-ISIS cyber actors are likely to download hacking tools from publicly available sources while also utilizing both off-the-shelf and custom malware.\n\nOn Monday, the UCC published a new kill list featuring 43 names linked to the U.S. State Department, the DHS, and other federal agencies on the messaging app Telegram, Vocativ reported.\n\nWhilst the current cyber capabilities of the IS are not sophisticated, it won\u2019t remain the same and could change quickly. \u201cThere is clear evidence that they are growing in number, coalescing in rank, and zooming in on American and other Western targets,\u201d Alkhouri told SecurityWeek.\n\nThe report published by Flashpoint can be downloaded from their website through the link below:\n\nhttps://www.flashpoint-intel.com/home/assets/Media/Flashpoint_HackingForISIS_April2016.pdf\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAli Taherian (@ali_taherian) is an enthusiastic information security Officer.

The experts in collaboration with peers from the startup PatternEx have designed an Artificial Intelligence system that is able to detect 85 percent of attacks by using data from more than 3.6 Billion lines of log files each day.\n\nThe researchers have developed a system that combines an Artificial Intelligence engine with human inputs. , which researchers call Analyst Intuition (AI), which is why it has been given the name of\n\nThe system is composed of an Artificial Intelligence and Analyst Intuition (AI) components, for this reason, it was named by the experts Artificial Intelligence Squared (AI2).\nThe AI2 system first performs an automatic scan of the content with machine-learning techniques and then reports the results to human analysts which have to discriminate events linked to cyber attacks.\n\n\n\nThe AI2 perform a daily analysis, the final results provided by the Analyst Intuition component is used as input for the machine learning system itself that uses it the next day for analyzing new logs.\n\n\n\nAccording to the experts at the MIT the approach implemented by the AI2 system is 3 times better than modern automated cyber attack detection systems.\n\n\u201cThe team showed that AI2 can detect 85 percent of attacks, which is roughly three times better than previous benchmarks, while also reducing the number of false positives by a factor of 5.

Bringing up the rear are Kenya (61%), South Korea (61%) and Sweden (61%).\n\nIt is not clear in fact if people interviewed were made aware of the legal usage of dark net before answering the question.\n\nThe Dark Web is a place crowded of cyber criminals and hackers that host the most popular black markets, but it a serious mistake to forgot that it is also a precious environment for journalists, activists, whistleblowers and political dissidents that escape from the censorship and repression.\n\nMany experts ask me if there is a way to discover the real proportions between illegal and legal contents in the dark web, and I always explain that it depends on the sample that we use for the elaboration of the statistics.\n\nRecently the intelligence firms Intelliagg and Darksum have issued an interesting report that tried to provide a reply to the above question. The researchers involved in the study focused their analysis on the Tor network that represent a significant portion of the dark web,but not its totality.\n\nThe experts used a spider software to crawl the Tor network and collect the information used in the study.\n\n\u201cWe compiled our census of the dark web using the Darksum \u2018collection software\u2019, a \u2018spider\u2019 or software application that crawls through the web following links in order to compile an index of its pages, and Intelliagg\u2019s \u2018machine-learning intelligence classification system\u2019 \u2013 complex algorithms that are \u2018trained\u2019 by humans then sent off to classify data automatically.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cOur classification system was \u2018trained\u2019 using data that had been classified manually from 1,000 sites on the dark web. It proceeded to classify the remaining data automatically without human supervision. This automated method proved to be 94% as accurate as it would have been had this process been entirely done by hand, meaning that nine times out of 10 our algorithms came to the same conclusion as an experienced analyst\u201d\n\nThe experts run their spiders two weeks in February 2016 focusing their analysis on selected dark web services, including pornography, fake documentation services, drugs, carding sites, financial fraud sites, weapons, blogs.\n\n\n\nAccording to the experts, the Tor network is currently composed of approximately 30,000 distinct .onion addresses that result active.\n\nThe spiders accessed websites in a total of 32 different languages, the vast majority of information on the hidden services network is in English, followed by German and Chinese.\n\nOf the 29,532 .onion identified during the sampling period, only 46% percent could be accessed, the remaining part is related to C&C infrastructure used to manage botnet, file-sharing applications or chat clients.\n\n\u201cA total of 29,532 \u2018.onion\u2019 addresses were identified during the sampling period. Of these, fewer than half were accessible at some point during this period. The remaining 54% (which were not analysed further) were probably only up on the dark web for a very short period of time. This could be for many reasons: commonly that they were addresses relating to \u2018command and control\u2019 servers used to manage malicious software, chat clients, or file-sharing applications\u201d continues the study.\n\nThe real surprise is related to the hidden services automatically analyzed by the experts, 48% can be classified as illegal under UK and US law. By analyzing manually a separate sample composed of 1,000 hidden services the experts found about 68% of the content to be illegal.\n\nBelow the percentages of content associated with each category.\n\n\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dark Web, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darknets", "topic_name": "darknets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}]}, {"news_name": "A NIST guide tells enterprises how to secure email systems", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45889/security/nist-guide-secure-email.html", "title": "A NIST guide tells enterprises how to secure email systems\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 2, 2016", "body": "The last effort of the NIST Agency in the development of email security guidelines is dated 2007 when it published the  NIST SP 800-45, Version 2 \u2013 Guidelines on Electronic Mail Security.\n\nThe new NIST guide is a document composed of 81 pages that aim to give recommendations and guidelines for enhancing trust in email.\n\nThis guideline applies to Government IT environment, but it is also useful for private organizations of any size.\n\nThe recommendations in NIST guide for secure email include suggestions on the practices to adopt for securing the environments around enterprise mail servers and mail clients. This guide also provides recommendations and guidance for email digital signatures and encryption (via S/MIME), recommendations for protecting against spam messages.\n\nSecurity email needs a multidisciplinary approach that involves secure solutions, effective configurations and trained personnel.\n\n\u201cEmail communications cannot be made trustworthy with a single package or application. It involves incremental additions to basic subsystems, with each technology adapted to a particular task.\u201d states the NIST guide on secure email. \n\n\n\nEncryption is essential to secure email systems, the guide urge administrators to build out a cryptographic key management system (CKMS) and use keys to protect email sessions.\n\n\u201cAs with any cryptographic keying material, enterprises should use a Cryptographic Key Management System (CKMS) to manage the generation, distribution, and lifecycle of DKIM keys. Federal agencies are encouraged to consult NIST SP 800-130 [SP800-130] and NIST SP 800-152 [SP800-152] for guidance on how to design and implement a CKMS within an agency.\u201d\n\nDespite the numerous incidents occurred in the last years, the NIST still considers trustable the DNS due to the numerous security enhancements, including the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), which is a set of extensions to DNS that provide to DNS clients origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity.\n\nThe NIST guide highlights the importance of the S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) for secure email messages.\n\n\u201cSecure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is the recommended protocol for email end-to-end authentication and confidentiality. S/MIME is particularly useful for authenticating mass email mailings originating from mailboxes that are not monitored, since the protocol uses PKI to authenticate digitally signed messages, avoiding the necessity of distributing the sender\u2019s public key certificate in advance. This usage of S/MIME is not common at the present time, but is recommended.\u201d states the guide.\n\nThe guide included a warning to the organizations that rely on cloud services for their email, in particular on services offered by a third party.\n\nOrganizations need to make sure any email sent by third parties will pass SPF checks, the verification is simple because the enterprise administrator should include the IP addresses of third-party senders in the enterprise SPF policy statement RR.\n\nThe NIST guide is out for public comment until May 1st, I suggest you to read it.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NIST, secure email)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptographic-key-management-system", "topic_name": "Cryptographic Key Management System"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nist-guide", "topic_name": "NIST Guide"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/secure-email", "topic_name": "secure email"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Terrorists and dark web, what is their relationship?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45755/terrorism/dark-web.html", "title": "Terrorists and dark web, what is their relationship?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 29, 2016", "body": "Every day I receive a lot of requests about terrorist activities in the Dark Web, and contrary to what you might think anonymizing networks like Tor and I2P aren\u2019t cyber places preferred by terrorist organizations.

The terrorists decided to move on the Darknet to make the Daesh more resilient to take over attempts.\n\nAccording to the study conducted by Daniel Moore & Thomas Rid, and titled \u201cCryptopolitik and the Darknet,\u201d terrorists and radical groups hardly use darknets.\n\nThe researchers developed a web crawler that allowed them to analyze and classify about 300,000 hidden services on the Tor network.

There is nothing to prevent such acts, causing a massive destruction and severe radiation flowing everywhere.\n\nTerrorism is one of the major threats to the industry of nuclear plants, making these facilities one of the most prestigious targets to focus on.\n\n\u201cA serious accident is possible in case of every German nuclear plant,\u201d Becker explained in a separate study published on March 8 and titled \u201cNuclear power 2016 \u2013 secure, clean, everything under control?\u201d\n\nBecker considers insufficient security standards, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and emergencies caused by the deterioration of the German nuclear plants\u2019 security systems as major threats to the industry.\n\n\u201cthere are no appropriate accident management plans.\u201d she added Becker. \u201cThe interim [nuclear waste] storages lack protection against aircraft crashes and dangers posed by terrorists,\u201d Becker said,\n\n\n\nThe media in Belgium concentrate on the initial thoughts of the terrorists to hit the nuclear plants. If it weren\u2019t for the arrest in Paris, these thoughts would have been made reality and the casualties would have been even greater. Dernier Heure, a newspaper from Belgium, revealed that the terrorists had planted a camera in front of the house of the director of the Belgian nuclear research program. In this way, they had gained a lot of information.\n\nAll these events have made a lot of people skeptical as to the importance of shutting down nuclear plants. The head of BUND, Hubert Weiger, has said:\n\n\u201cIt is even more necessary than ever to abandon this technology,\u201d and this thought reflects the opinions of thousands in Germany, Belgium and Europe altogether.\n\nAP has reported that IS (or ISIS) has been training hundreds of people especially for external attacks and this would be a threat beyond any control.

More disconcerting the fact that a single employee, or an attacker, could manage the entire utility by accessing the IBM AS/400 system. If a data breach were to occur at KWC, this SCADA platform would be the first place to look.\n\n\u201cEven more concerning, many critical IT and OT functions ran on a single AS400 system. KWC referred to this AS400 system as its \u201cSCADA platform.\u201d This system functioned as a router with direct connections into several networks, ran the water district\u2019s valve and flow control application that was responsible for manipulating hundreds of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), housed customer PII and associated billing information, as well as KWC\u2019s financials.\u201d\n\nExperts discovered that the KWC facility was targeted by hacktivists had that breached the internal architecture by exploiting a vulnerability in the payment application web server.\n\n \n\nOnce compromised the server, the attackers obtained the internal IP address and admin login credentials for the AS/400 system, this information was used to steal 2.5 million records containing customer and payment data. Fortunately the attackers haven\u2019t used the stolen data to carry on fraudulent activity.\n\nBy accessing the AS/400 system the attackers were also able to completely gain control over water flow and the amount of chemicals used to treat the water.\n\nDuring the 60-day period of the assessment, the experts discovered four connections to systems at the water utility.

In April 2015, ESET discovered a malware campaign dubbed Operation Buhtrap, a conjunction of the Russian word for accountant \u201cBuhgalter\u201d and the English word \u201ctrap\u201d.  So far Buhtrap has not been seen anywhere else in the wild, 88 percent of targets have been in Russia and ten percent in Ukraine.  Analysts have also likened the campaign to the Anunak/Carbanak campaign, which also targeted Russian and Ukrainian Banks.\n\nThe modus operandi of these particular cybercriminals is usually associated with targeted attacks rather than cyber fraud, which make this move to financial crime unusual and effective.\n\nIn the last wave of, the attackers hit Russian banks by pretending to be FinCERT, a center established by the Russian Central Bank for dealing with cyber-attacks in Russia\u2019s financial sector.\n\nAccording to a report released by the security firm Group-IB, Buhtrap has been active since 2014, despite their first attacks against financial institutions were only detected in August 2015. Earlier, the group had only focused on targeting banking clients. At the moment, the group is known to target Russian and Ukrainian banks, below the timeline of the attacks published by Group-IB:\n\n\n\nThe Buhtrap timeline is a sequence of successful attacks, in August 2015 the hackers stole \u20bd25.6 million RUB ($375,617 USD), two months later a new campaign resulted in the losses of \u20bd99 million RUB ($1.4 million USD).\n\nIn November 2015, the group raked \u20bd75 million RUB ($1.1 million USD) with two distinct campaigns against two banks. In December the group reached a peak in its activity targeting 5 banks and taking down \u20bd571 million RUB ($8.3 million USD). They also conducted two successful attacks in January and two more a month later. In all, the group has stolen \u20bd1.86 billion RUB ($27.4M USD) from banks in Russia\n\nThe activities continued in January and February stealing dozen million dollars from banks in Russia. \n\nIn February 2016, a developer for Buhtrap leaked the complete source code for the malware used by the group because he wasn\u2019t paid by the gang. Experts who have analyzed it discovered that the code is related to an earlier revision and not to the one used in the recent attacks.\n\n\u201cEarlier, the group had only focused on targeting banking clients. At the moment, the group is known to target Russian and Ukrainian banks.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cIn many respects, this group\u2019s activity has led to the current situation where attacks against Russian banks causing direct losses in the hundreds of millions of rubles are no longer taken as something unusual,\u201d \n\nThe tactic used by the Buhtrap group is consolidated, the hackers register typo domains or domains that are familiar to the victim, and from there they rent servers where mail servers were set up to send phishing emails on behalf of the legitimate company avoiding being filtered as spam.\n\nThe group used a custom malware which is able to detect security software and other defensive solutions. The malware uses to track every banking operation made by the victims, the malicious code notice these operations, it downloads a legitimate remote access tool (LiteManager) which is used to carry on fraudulent transfer orders.\n\nWhat to expect in the next months?\n\nThe experts have no doubt, the group will continue its activity, likely improving its TTPs, researchers at Group-IB fears that the public availability of the gang\u2019s malware may trigger the number of campaigns against banks conducted by other criminal organizations.\n\n\u201cThe published source codes are active.

We have named this Ransomware \u201cKeRanger.\u201d states the report published by Palo Alto Networks.\n\nThe researchers named this new Ransomware family KeRanger, they also released a technical analysis of the malware.\n\nRansomware attacks on MAC OS X systems is a novelty, in the past the unique malware with similar characteristics was FileCoder, a malicious code detected by Kaspersky Lab in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe only previous ransomware for OS X we are aware of is FileCoder, discovered by Kaspersky Lab in 2014. As FileCoder was incomplete at the time of its discovery, we believe KeRanger is the first fully functional ransomware seen on the OS X platform.\u201d continues the post.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, users who have directly downloaded Transmission installer from the official website in a specific time interval may be been infected by KeRanger MAC OS X ransomware.\n\n\u201cUsers who have directly downloaded Transmission installer from official website after 11:00am PST, March 4, 2016 and before 7:00pm PST, March 5, 2016, may be been infected by KeRanger.\u201d\n\nThe Transmission project promptly removed the malicious installers on Saturday (March 5) and it is urging its users to update to the latest version (2.92).\n\nThe experts discovered that the malware was embedded within the Transmission DMG file itself, but this was not enough to install the malware.

The Russian underground, for instance, can be likened to a well-functioning assembly line where each player has a role to play. It acts as the German market\u2019s \u201cbig brother\u201d as well in that it greatly influences how the latter works. The Chinese market, meanwhile, boasts of robust tool and hardware development, acting as a prototype hub for cybercriminal wannabes. Brazil is more focused on banking Trojans while Japan tends to be deliberately exclusive to members.\u201d states the report.\n\nThe last report published by TrendMicro explains the differences, revealing the peculiarity of the offer in each ecosystem.\n\n\u201cCybercriminals from every corner of the world take advantage of the anonymity of the Web, particularly the Deep Web, to hide from the authorities. Infrastructure and skill differences affect how far into the Deep Web each underground market has gone. Chinese cybercriminals, for instance, do not rely on the Deep Web as much as their German and North American counterparts do. This could, however, be due to the fact that the \u201cgreat firewall\u201d of China prevents its citizens (even the tech-savviest of its cybercrooks) from accessing the Deep Web. The fact that Germany and North America more strictly implement cybercrime laws may have something to do with their greater reliance on the Deep Web, too.\u201d\n\nThe Russian underground is defined \u201ca well-functioning assembly line,\u201d it is an ecosystem crowded by professional sellers that competing each other by providing goods in the shortest amount of time and most efficient manner possible. Marketplaces like fe-ccshop.su and Rescator that offer products and services for credit card frauds are very popular in the criminal underground worldwide.\n\nThese markets offer escrowing services or \u201cgarants,\u201d that make them an important aggregator for the criminal demand, offering them a privileged environment where operate anonymously.\n\nThe Japanese underground is characterized by members only bulletin board systems, the criminals make large use of special jargon to evade the authorities. This market is characterized by the attitude in accepting more unusual kinds of payment, including gift cards and forum points instead of bitcoins or cash paid via money transfer.\n\nThe Chinese underground is focused on the provisioning of hardware several illegal activities rapidly responding to the cybercriminal demand.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese underground is a teeming hub of prototypes. It not only sells the usual array of software and services found in its counterparts, but also hardware. It adapts the fastest to the latest in cybercrime trends and leads the way in terms of cybercriminal innovation. And true to its adaptive nature, it now boasts of uncommon offerings like leaked-data search engine privacy protection services that can only be dubbed \u201cmade in China.\u201d states the report.\n\nThe North American underground is considered the most open to novices, it is visible to both cybercriminals and law enforcement, meanwhile the Canadian underground is focused on the sale of fake/stolen documents and credentials (fake driver\u2019s licenses and passports, stolen credit card and other banking information, and credit \u201cfullz\u201d or complete dumps of personal information).\n\nGermany\u2019s underground is a subsidiary of the Russian one, the market heavy rely on DarkNets, the most popular forums use mirrors on the Tor Network. Deep Web.\n\nLet\u2019s close with the Brazilian underground, which is characterized by the presence of youngsters with no regard for the law. They use the Surface Web, exploiting popular social media for their activities.\n\nThe key findings of the study highlights:\n\nFor more details on the criminal ecosystem in the Deep Web give a look to the report \u201cCybercrime and the Deep Web\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Deep Web, criminal underground)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/brazil", "topic_name": "Brazil"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/canada", "topic_name": "Canada"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/criminal-network", "topic_name": "criminal network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/criminal-undergroun", "topic_name": "Criminal Undergroun"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-market", "topic_name": "Dark market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/germany", "topic_name": "Germany"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/japan", "topic_name": "Japan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-america", "topic_name": "North America"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Operation Transparent Tribe targets Indian diplomats and military", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45093/cyber-warfare-2/operation-transparent-tribe.html", "title": "Operation Transparent Tribe targets Indian diplomats and military\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 6, 2016", "body": "A new cyber espionage campaign dubbed Operation Transparent Tribe is targeting diplomats and military personnel in India. The researchers at Proofpoint who have uncovered the hacking campaign confirmed that threat actors used a number of hacking techniques to hit the victims, including phishing and watering hole attacks, and drop a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) dubbed MSIL/Crimson.\n\nThe MSIL/Crimson RAT used in the cyber espionage operation implements a variety of data exfiltration functions, including the ability to control the laptop cameras, take screen captures and keylogging.\n\nThe researchers discovered the campaign on February 11, 2016, when they noticed two live attacks against Indian diplomats operating in embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan.\n\nProofpoint discovered that IP addresses involved in the attacks are in Pakistan, the attacks appear sophisticated and are part of a wider operation that relies on a network of watering hole websites and multiple phishing email campaigns.\n\nThe nature of the target and the methods used by attackers suggest the involvement of a nation-state attacker as explained by Kevin Epstein, VP of threat operations center at Proofpoint.\n\n\u201cThis is a multi-year and multi-vector campaign clearly tied to state-sponsored espionage,\u201d Epstein told to ThreatPost. \u201cIn the world of crimeware, you rarely see this type of complexity.

Technically, these services are called booter or stresser services and could be sold as would-be legitimate tools for security professionals that need to test the resilience of their infrastructure to cyber attacks or their capacity to support a high-volume of traffic.\n\nThe problem is that criminal organisations are abusing booters for illegal DDoS attacks, one of the most popular examples is the one used by the LizardSquad hacking crew, the LizardStresser.\n\nThe popular security expert Brian Krebs and a research team discovered that the Lizard Stresser DDoS tool relies on compromised Home Routers, this is very common for such kind of illegal services.Schwarz examined one\n\nSchwarz examined one booter service sold in the Russian underground a user with the pseudonym of Forceful. The researcher has compared the cost to rent per day with the average damage suffered by the victims.\n\nSchwarz noticed numerous advertisements for a DDoS booter service on one of the many public Russian language forums, one of them was published by a bad actor known as \u201cForceful\u201d who operated one of these services. Searching for ICQ number and/or Jabber address the experts discovered a number of advertisements starting from November 2014.\n\nThe ads typically contain:\n\nForceful charges $60 a day to rent the booter, meanwhile the cost on an entire week is $400, and anyway it offers a 10-minute test sessions to its clients.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this marketplace, it almost always starts with an advertisement for a DDoS booter service on one of the many public Russian language forums,\u201d Schwarz says.\n\n\n\nThanks to a series of OPSEC mistakes made by Forceful, Schwarz and his team were able to identify the malware used by the threat actor and the structure of botnet he uses.\n\nAccording to the Arbor Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report the average suffered by victims of the attack is US$500 per minute. The cost is attributable to downtime of the targeted infrastructure, reputational damage, and the price of remediation.\n\nAccording to the data elaborated by the experts, a booter attack could cause US$7.2 million in damages a day, costs that could be drastically reduced by the adoption of DDoS defense solutions.\n\nSchwarz highlighted the extreme asymmetry of the economics of DDoS attackers and urged organizations in adopting defensive solutions.\n\n\u201cAs we see in Arbor\u2019s most recent Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR), the average cost to the victim of a DDoS attack is around $500 per minute. And as we\u2019ve seen above, the mean cost to the attacker is only $66 per attack. This finding highlights both the extreme asymmetry of the economics of DDoS attackers vs. those of the victims of DDoS attacks, as well as the importance of robust DDoS defenses to all organizations which depend upon their online presence for revenue, customer support, and other important business functions.  The cost to launch a DDoS attack is so low that the barrier to entry for attackers is practically nil \u2013 and that means that *any* organization can potentially be the target of a DDoS attack, since the investment required to launch an attack is so low.\u201d\n\nAccording to Arbor Network\u2019s BladeRunner, from July to October the Forceful\u2019s booter bot was rented for 82 attacks equaling $5,408.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DDoS booter,cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos-booter", "topic_name": "DDoS booter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/distributed-denial-of-service", "topic_name": "Distributed Denial of Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Which are most used passwords in opportunistic criminal attacks?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45001/breaking-news/passwords-opportunistic-criminal-attacks.html", "title": "Which are most used passwords in opportunistic criminal attacks?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 4, 2016", "body": "Recently the firm Splashdata revealed in its annual report on the worst 2015 passwords (\u201c123456\u201d and \u201cpassword\u201d), today I desire to present you a new interesting study on passwords conducted by Rapid7.\n\nThe experts used Heisenberg, a network of low-interaction honeypots that took note of the most common passwords used the hackers in targeting Internet-exposed systems.\n\nThe research conducted by Rapid7 has focused on the brute force attacks that tried to guess Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials for control home, point-of-sale (PoS), and kiosk systems.\n\n\u201cAttackers do not merely pick random strings as passwords (or usernames). Such brute force attacks are process intensive, time consuming, and tend to have very poor performance from the attacker\u2019s point of view. Instead, attackers in our data set were clearly conducting dictionary attacks; i.e. they were using chosen usernames and passwords that have an assumed high likelihood of success when applied to a target system. \u201d states the report published by Rapid7.\n\nThe experts analyzed more than 221,000 attacks from 119 different countries observed between March 2015 and February 2016. 40 percent of the attacks came from China, followed by the United States with 25 percent of attempts, South Korea with 6 percent, the Netherlands with 5 percent and Vietnam with 3 percent.\n\n\n\nThe most common usernames attempted by hackerd were \u201cadministrator\u201d and \u201cAdministrator,\u201d (60%), other usernames are \u201cuser1,\u201d \u201cadmin,\u201d \u201calex,\u201d \u201cpos,\u201d \u201cdemo,\u201d \u201cdb2admin,\u201d \u201cAdmin\u201d and \u201csql.\u201d\n\nThe most common passwords \u201cx\u201d (5,36 %), \u201cZz\u201d (4,79%) and \u201cSt@rt123\u201d (3,62%).\n\n\u201cTruly, the surprising detail to be uncovered here is just how weak these passwords are. One or two characters, easily guessed strings, and a strange appearance of a series of dots. Since these passwords were deliberately chosen by the various scanners which ran up against Heisenberg, it implies that the default and common passwords to several POS and kiosk systems are chosen out of convenience, rather than security.\u201d continues the report.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe experts used Dropbox\u2019s Zxcvbn application for measuring password complexity, determining that less than 9 percent of the passwords used by hackers got the highest score, meanwhile 14.3 percent scored \u201c3.\u201d\n\n\u201cZxcvbn is hosted on a GitHub repository and was released by Dropbox with a permissive open source license. Rapid7 data scientists and software engineers absolutely love well-cared-for open source projects, so we have adopted zxcvbn as a means to measure the complexity of Heisenberg-collected passwords.

Security experts speculate the involvement of Russian nation-state actors that have used the BlackEnergy to infect SCADA systems of Ukrainian grid and critical infrastrcuture.\n\nAccording to a Ukrainian media TSN, the power outage was caused by the destructive malware that disconnected electrical substations. The experts speculate that hackers run a spear phishing campaign across the Ukrainian power authorities to spread the BlackEnergy malware leveraging on Microsoft Office documents.\n\nNow a new report published by the DHS Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team confirms that the outage was caused by a cyber attack.\n\nThe report is based on interviews with operations and IT staff at six Ukrainian organizations involved in the attacks. The thesis has been supported first by the SANS industrial control systems team, but it is still unclear the real impact of the BlackEnergy malware of the incident.\n\n\n\nThe SANS report reported that attackers flooded the call centers at the power authorities with phone calls, the intent of the attackers was to prevent customers from reporting the incident to the companies operating the critical infrastructure.\n\nThe DHS report highlights the possibility that the two strains of malware were used by the attackers after the outage in an attempt either to destroy evidence the intrusion or make recovery more difficult.\n\n\u201cFollowing these discussions and interviews, the team assesses that the outages experienced on December 23, 2015, were caused by external cyber-attackers. The team was not able to independently review technical evidence of the cyber-attack; however, a significant number of independent reports from the team\u2019s interviews as well as documentary findings corroborate the events as outlined below.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cThrough interviews with impacted entities, the team learned that power outages were caused by remote cyber intrusions at three regional electric power distribution companies (Oblenergos) impacting approximately 225,000 customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cyber-attack was reportedly synchronized and coordinated, probably following extensive reconnaissance of the victim networks. According to company personnel, the cyber-attacks at each company occurred within 30 minutes of each other and impacted multiple central and regional facilities. During the cyber-attacks, malicious remote operation of the breakers was conducted by multiple external humans using either existing remote administration tools at the operating system level or remote industrial control system (ICS) client software via virtual private network (VPN) connections. The companies believe that the actors acquired legitimate credentials prior to the cyber-attack to facilitate remote access.\n\nAll three companies indicated that the actors wiped some systems by executing the KillDisk malware at the conclusion of the cyber-attack. The KillDisk malware erases selected files on target systems and corrupts the master boot record, rendering systems inoperable. It was further reported that in at least one instance, Windows-based human-machine interfaces (HMIs) embedded in remote terminal units were also overwritten with KillDisk. The actors also rendered Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations inoperable by corrupting their firmware. In addition, the actors reportedly scheduled disconnects for server Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) via the UPS remote management interface. The team assesses that these actions were done in an attempt to interfere with expected restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nThe report confirmed that every company victim of the attack was infected with the BlackEnergy malware, but avoided to provide further details on the role played by the malware.\n\n\u201cEach company also reported that they had been infected with BlackEnergy malware; however, we do not know whether the malware played a role in the cyber-attacks. The malware was reportedly delivered via spear phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office attachments. It is suspected that BlackEnergy may have been used as an initial access vector to acquire legitimate credentials; however, this information is still being evaluated. It is important to underscore that any remote access Trojan could have been used and none of BlackEnergy\u2019s specific capabilities were reportedly leveraged.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SCADA , BlackEnergy malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackenergy-malware", "topic_name": "BlackEnergy malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}]}, {"news_name": "Securing Hospitals from hackers that can put lives in dangers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44841/hacking/securing-hospitals-report.html", "title": "Securing Hospitals from hackers that can put lives in dangers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 27, 2016", "body": "A group of experts from the Independent Security Evaluators research team have tested the security of hospital networks, demonstrating how it is possible to gain access to critical medical equipment in attacks they say could put lives in danger.\n\nThe study was led by healthcare head Geoff Gentry, the results of the test conducted are reported in an interesting paper titled \u201cSecuring Hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe experts demonstrated that such kind of cyber attacks could put lives in danger, for example hacking patient monitors is possible to display false information which could result in medical responses that injure or kill patients.\n\nThey security researchers examined 12 healthcare facilities, two data centres, two web applications, and a couple of live medical devices that could be hacked remotely by threat actors.\n\n\u201cThe research results from our assessment of 12 healthcare facilities, 2 healthcare data facilities, 2 active medical devices from one manufacturer, and 2 web applications that remote adversaries can easily deploy attacks that target and compromise patient health.

In one of the tests, the team of researchers dropped 18 infected sticks around hospitals, the malware present on the USB sticks allowed them to harvest information from terminals and establish a backdoor inside the systems.\n\nIn one case the attackers successfully breached the hospital drug dispensary service.\n\n\u201cAt the time of this reporting, we are working to demonstrate that an attack against the particular dispensary is possible, meaning that anyone who can connect to the dispensary can then get access to the configuration interface and manipulate what the device believes it has to be its inventory. If this medication were then given to a patient, it would likely harm or kill the patient.\u201d said the hackers.\n\nThe researchers also dedicated great attention to physical security, the team analyzed the presence of exposed hardware device ports and open computers operating in patient rooms, too easy to hack.\n\n\u201cThe findings show an industry in turmoil: lack of executive support; insufficient talent; improper implementations of technology; outdated understanding of adversaries; lack of leadership, and a misguided reliance upon compliance,\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201c[It] illustrates our greatest fear: patient health remains extremely vulnerable. One overarching finding of our research is that the industry focuses almost exclusively on the protection of patient health records, and rarely addresses threats to or the protection of patient health from a cyber threat perspective.\u201d\n\nThe experts concluded that networks in the Hospitals are often insecure, in many cases the organizations lack of security policies and never audit their systems exposing patients to risk of cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cWe found egregious business shortcomings in every hospital, including insufficient funding, insufficient staffing, insufficient training, lack of policy, lack of network awareness, and many more,\u201d researcher Ted Harrington says. \u201cThese vulnerabilities are a result of systemic business failures.\u201d\n\nThe findings demonstrate that patient health remains extremely vulnerable to cyber attack.\n\nEnjoy the \u201cSecuring Hospitals\u201d report!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Securing Hospitals, cybersecurity)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybersecurity", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/identity-theft", "topic_name": "Identity Theft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/medical-devices", "topic_name": "medical devices"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/securing-hospitals", "topic_name": "Securing Hospitals"}]}, {"news_name": "Gemalto Breach Level Index report 2015, what are hackers looking for?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44834/cyber-crime/44834.html", "title": "Gemalto Breach Level Index report 2015, what are hackers looking for?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 27, 2016", "body": "As per the security firm Gemalto, Government and healthcare have overwhelmed the retail area as most-focused for information breaks.\n\nAn aggregate of 1,673 information ruptures prompted 707 million information records being traded off worldwide amid 2015, as indicated by the most recent release of Gemalto Breach Level Index report.\n\n\n\nNot all ruptures are just as genuine and the quantity of records revealed is stand out metric. The Gemalto Breach Level Index report endeavors to perceive this by appointing a seriousness score to every rupture (security breach) in view of elements including the sort of information and the quantity of records traded off, the wellspring of the break, and regardless of whether the information was encoded. The philosophy expects to recognize aggravations from high effect mega breaks.\n\nMore than 3.6 billion information records have been uncovered following 2013, when Gemalto started benchmarking freely unveiled information breaks. In 2015, vindictive outcasts (ie, programmers) were the main wellspring of these ruptures, representing 964, or 58 percent of breaks and 38 percent of records being compromised. Exposure or coincidental of data records represented 36 percent of all records.\n\nAccording to the Gemalto Breach Level Index report, the quantity of state-supported assaults represented only 2% of the data breach incidents being reported, yet the quantity of records bargained as an aftereffect of those assaults made up 15 percent of all records uncovered.\n\nThe lopsided effect of a little number of breaks is halfway clarified by the high effect rupture at the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which uncovered the individual points of interest of different government workers and released all way of \u201csensitive\u201d data from historical verifications and related archives. Noxious insiders represented 14 percent of all the data ruptures and only 7% of the traded off (compromised) records.\n\nRegarding geographic areas, 59 per cent reported break mishaps happened in the United States. Europe represented twelve percent of general rupture occurrences, trailed by the Asia Pacific locale at 8%.\n\nIdentity theft issue remained the essential kind of break, representing 53 per cent of the data ruptures and 40 percent of all records that were compromised.\n\nSector of Government represented 43 percent of the compromised/traded off information records, a five-fold increment more than 2014 because of a few substantial information ruptures in the United States and Turkey, and sixteen percent of all the information/data breaks. Healthcare area represented 19 percent of the aggregate records being compromised and 23 percent of all information/data breaks.\n\nBy complexity, the retail area saw the quantity of stolen information records dropping 93 per cent year-on-year, so it represented only six percent of stolen records and 10 percent of the aggregate number of ruptures in 2015.\n\nThis is in expansive part in light of the fact that 2014 was an especially unpleasant year for data information breaks in the retail division, with issues at Home Depot and others skewing numbers towards the stratosphere. The financial administrations segment likewise saw an almost 99 percent drop, speaking to only 0.1 per cent of the traded off/compromised data records and 15 percent of the aggregate number of ruptures.\n\nThey are not attempting to split your ledger \u2013 and that is terrible news for you \n\nCriminal programmers in the course of the most recent year or so have moved their concentrate far from conventional card misrepresentation and towards taking individual data in the facilitation of the identity fraud/theft. This change is terrible news for both buyers and organizations alike, as indicated by Gemalto.\n\nChief technology officer for data protection and Vice President at Gemalto, Jason Hart said,\n\n\u201cIn 2014, consumers may have been concerned about having their credit card numbers stolen, but there are built-in protections to limit the financial risks\u201d . \u201cHowever, in 2015 criminals shifted to attacks on personal information and identity theft, which are much harder to remediate once they are stolen.\u201d\n\nAs organizations and gadgets gather continually expanding measures of client data and as purchasers\u2019 online advanced exercises turn out to be more different and productive, more information about what they do, who they are and what they like is at danger to be stolen from the organizations that store their information.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf consumers\u2019 entire personal data and identities are being co-opted again and again by cyber thieves, trust will increasingly become the centerpiece in the calculus of which companies they do business with\u201d.\n\n\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

According to Kaspersky the hacking crew has been active since at least 2009 and is still operating undercover.\n\nKaspersky Lab, alongside with a number of security firms  including Novetta, AlienVault, Invincea, ThreatConnect, Volexity, Symantec, and PunchCyber have published reports related to the activities of the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe group of security firms formed an alliance called Operation Blockbuster that issued the detection signatures to neutralize the hacking tools used by the APT.\n\nThe Lazarus Group \u2019s arsenal includes the Destover wiper malware, the same used against the systems of the Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\n\u201cThe group deployed multiple malware families throughout the years, including malware associated with Operation Troy and DarkSeoul, the Hangman malware (2014-2015) and Wild Positron / Duuzer (2015). The group is known for spearphishing attacks, which include CVE-2015-6585, which was a zero-day vulnerability at the time of discovery.\u201d states a report published on SecureList.\n\n\n\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab revealed that the Lazarus Group\u2019s malware is mostly custom-tailored and appears highly sophisticated.\n\nThe activity of the Lazarus Group surged in 2014 and 2015, the experts of the firm composing the Operation Blockbuster team noticed a number of similarities across a number of attacks worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe researchers discovered that malware used in the attacks linked to the Lazarus Group reused several components, including at least six user-agents.\n\n\u201cStudying multiple coding quirks within any given malware variant actually revealed these to be coding conventions implemented across both different malware families as well as entirely new samples. A simple example of code reuse is the networking functionality that includes a half-dozen hard-coded user-agents with the misspelling \u2018Mozillar\u2019 instead of Mozilla.\u201d states the post.\n\nThe experts also noticed other similarities in the modus operandi of the threat actors, such as the use of BAT files to delete malware pieces after infections and the password reuse in the malware droppers.\n\n\u201cThese BAT files are generated on the fly and, while they serve their purpose of eliminating initial infection traces, they ironically double as a great way to identify the malware itself by honing in on the path-placeholder strings that generate the randomly-named BAT files on the infected systems,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said in its report. \u201cA high-confidence indicator of correlation is the reuse of a shared password across malware droppers used to drop different malware variants. The droppers all kept their payloads within a password-protected ZIP under the resource name \u2018MYRES\u2019. The dropper contains the hardcoded password \u2018!1234567890 dghtdhtrhgfjnui$%^^&fdt\u2018 making it trivially easy for an analyst to reach the payload. \u201c\n\nThe researchers confirmed that the group is still active and is currently working to new weapons to add to its arsenal.\n\nGive a look to the reports published by Kaspersky and its partners,  Symantec, Novetta and AlienVault.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus Group, Operation Blockbuster)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Operation Dust Storm, hackers Target Japanese Critical Infrastructure", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44749/cyber-crime/operation-dust-storm.html", "title": "Operation Dust Storm, hackers Target Japanese Critical Infrastructure\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 24, 2016", "body": "Security firm Cylance have uncovered a long-running hacking campaign dubbed \u2018Operation Dust Storm\u2019 targeting commercial and critical infrastructure organizations in Japan.\n\nThreat actors behind the Operation Dust Storm have been active since at least 2010, the hackers targeted several organizations in Japan, South Korea, the US, Europe, and other Asian countries.\n\nExperts believe that the group is well-organized and well-funded, a circumstance that lead the researchers to speculate the involvement of a nation-state actor.\n\nThe researchers at Cylance revealed that the threat actors started focusing on Japanese organizations since 2015, they hackers breached networks of Japanese organizations in the electricity generation, oil and natural gas, transportation,  finance, and construction industries.\n\nThe list of victims includes an automaker, the Japanese subsidiary of a South Korean electric utility firm, and an oil and gas company.\n\nThe hackers demonstrated the availability of unique backdoors and zero-day exploits in their arsenal, used to launch watering holes and spear phishing attacks. In a number of attacks conducted in May 2015, the group also used several Android backdoors against targets in South Korea and Japan.\n\n\n\nFortunately the attacks launched by the group behind Operation Dust Storm were not sophisticated. The researchers spotted the group in 2011, when the hackers relied on Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2011-0611) and Internet Explorer (CVE-2011-1255) zero-day vulnerabilities to deliver a strain of malware dubbed Misdat.\n\n\u201cVery little public information was available throughout 2010 on this threat, despite the group\u2019s primary backdoor gaining some level of prominence in targeted Asian attacks\u201d states the report published by Cylance \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until June 2011 that Operation Dust Storm started to garner some notoriety from a series of attacks which leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, CVE-2011-1255, to gain a foothold into victim networks. \u201c\n\nIn October 2011, the hackers targeted gathering intelligence about the Libyan crisis following the death of Muammar Gaddafi. In 2012, the group leveraged the Internet Explorer zero-day (CVE-2012-1889) for their cyber espionage campaigns.\n\nExperts at Cylance noticed a significant reduction of the Operation Dust Storm in March 2013, after the publication of the Mandiant\u2019s analysis of the Chinese APT group dubbed APT1.\n\nIn February 2014 the group behind Operation Dust Storm appeared again, it launched a series of attacks leveraging a new Internet Explorer zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0322) used in watering hole attacks.\n\nThe researchers at Cylance have no doubts, the attacks against Japanese critical infrastructure will rapidly increase in the future.\n\n\u201cHowever, our team believes that attacks of this nature on companies involved in Japanese critical infrastructure and resources are ongoing and are likely to continue to escalate in the future.\u201d Cylance concluded.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Operation Dust Storm, APT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/japan", "topic_name": "Japan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-dust-storm", "topic_name": "Operation Dust Storm"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Project Cumulus \u2013 Tracking fake phished credentials leaked to Dark Web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44646/cyber-crime/project-cumulus-dark-web.html", "title": "Project Cumulus \u2013 Tracking fake phished credentials leaked to Dark Web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 21, 2016", "body": "In April 2015, a group of experts at Bitglass used watermarks to track data through the Deep Web and discover how far does it get after a data breach.

The phrase is converted into a 256-bit private key with a hashing or key derivation algorithm (example: SHA256). That private key is used to calculate the final Bitcoin address.\n\nThis method was erroneously considered secure because malware based attacks are ineffective in stealing private keys, but now an expert demonstrated that brain wallets are not secure because the passwords can be easily cracked by an attacker. The researcher explained that brain wallets used no salt and passed plaintext passwords through a single hash iteration, this makes easy for hackers to crack brain wallet passwords. Another problem is represented by the fact that a form of the insecurely hashed passwords is stored in the Bitcoin blockchain giving more information for the attack to the hackers.\n\nThe researcher Ryan Castellucci demonstrated at the DEF CON conference last year how to crack brain wallets:\n\n\u201cOur implementation improves the state of the art by a factor of 2.5, with focus on the cases where side channel attacks are not a concern and a large quantity of RAM is available. As a result, we are able to scan the Bitcoin blockchain for weak keys faster than any previous implementation.\u201d states the paper .\n\nNow researchers at the University of Tulsa, Stanford University and the Southern Methodist University have discovered a new method to crack brain wallet passphrase faster respect the method elaborated by Castellucci.\n\nThe researchers published a paper demonstrating the efficiency of their Bitcoin Key Recovery Attacks, that is 2.5 times faster compared to Castellucci\u2019s technique.\n\nThe researchers analyzed roughly 300 billion passwords and discovered that only less than 1,000 brain wallets used between September 2011 and August 2015.\n\n\u201cIn this paper, we report on the first large-scale measurement of the use of brain wallets in Bitcoin. Using a wide range of word lists, we evaluated around 300 billion passwords. Surprisingly, after excluding activities by researchers, we identified just 884 brain wallets worth around $100K in use from September 2011 to August 2015.\u201d researchers wrote in their paper. \n\n\u201cOur results reveal the existence of an active attacker community that rapidly steals funds from vulnerable brain wallets in nearly all cases we identify,\u201d explained the researchers. \u201cIn total, approximately $100K worth of bitcoin has been loaded into brain wallets, with the ten most valuable wallets accounting for over three-quarters of the total value. Many brain wallets are drained within minutes, and while those storing larger values are emptied faster, nearly all wallets are drained within 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThe passwords were derived from words available in dictionaries, the passwords were then compared to a list of all used Bitcoin addresses to determine which of them were associated with brain wallets.\n\nExperts identified 884 brain wallets storing 1,806 BTC (worth approximately $100,000)  and discovered that only 21 of them were not drained by cyber criminals.\n\n\n\nIt was disconcerting that in many cases, the accounts were drained within minutes or seconds, the researchers also noticed that there is no evidence that Bitcoin wallets containing larger amounts of money were protected by the owners with stronger passwords.\n\n\u201cWe find that all but 21 wallets were drained, usually within 24 hours but often within minutes. We find that around a dozen \u201cdrainers\u201d are competing to liquidate brain wallets as soon as they are funded.\u201d continues the researchers.\n\nThe experts analyzed the Bitcoin transactions involving brain wallets and discovered that at least 14 entities were involved in the attacks.\n\n\u201cA few drainers are very successful while the rest do not make very much,\u201d researchers wrote in their paper. \u201cThe top 4 drainers have netted the equivalent of $35,000 between them. The drainer who has emptied the most brain wallets \u2014 100 in all \u2014 has earned $3,219 for the effort. But other drainers have stolen very little money. For example, one drainer stole from 78 different brain wallets but netted only $62 worth of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe group of researchers will present the study, titled \u201cThe Bitcoin Brain Drain: A Short Paper on the Use and Abuse of Bitcoin Brain Wallets,\u201d at the next Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Brain Wallets, Bitcoin)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/brain-wallets", "topic_name": "Brain Wallets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/password", "topic_name": "password"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "27% of all detected malware appeared in 2015", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44111/cyber-crime/panda-security-malware-2015.html", "title": "27% of all detected malware appeared in 2015\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 31, 2016", "body": "In 2015, security experts have detected the a record number of new malware, according to a report published by Panda Security more than 84 million new malware samples were collected.\n\nIt is an impressive number considering that corresponds to the 27 percent of all malware ever created.\n\n\u201cLast year saw the greatest number of cyberattacks recorded around the world, with a total of 304 million samples, which means that more than a quarter of all malware samples ever recorded were produced in 2015 (27.63%).\u201d states the report.\n\nGiving a closing look at the report it is possible to note that Trojans are the main threats, they account for 51.45 percent, followed by viruses at 22.79 percent, worms at 13.22 percent, potentially unwanted programs such as adware at 10.71 percent and cases of spyware at 1.83 percent.\n\n\n\nThe spike in the number of threats despite the improvement of Antivirus solution is mainly caused by an intensification of the activities of malware authors.

The ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 summarizes top cyber threats, experts have identified during the last 12 months.\n\nThe document synthesizes the emerging trends in cyber security, it is a must reading for the experts in the industry and executives of any sector.\n\nIn 2015, we have assisted a greater effort of law enforcement in the fight against criminal organizations that are becoming even more advanced.\n\nThe experts at ENISA analyzed the Top 15 cyber-threats, identifying the threat trends, trends of threat agents and trends for emerging technologies, the report also includes for each cyber-threat a list of mitigation controls.\n\nMalware remains the principal cyber-threat in 2015, they have increased in the number of instances detected and the level of sophistication, albeit mobile malware may not have reached expected levels of growth.\n\nWeb based attacks and web application attacks are in second and third place, no change has been observed respecting the previous report. Web based attacks include malicious URLs, compromised domains, browser exploits and drive-by attacks.\n\nThe category of web application attacks includes classic techniques like cross-site scripting and SQL-injection (SQLi).  In the fourth place there are the Botnets, these infrastructures an essential component for a large number of cyber attacks, but in the last year law enforcement has coordinated a significant number of takedowns against many malicious architectures.\n\nIn 2015, the number of DDoS attacks continues to increase, the attacks increased with the volume and also their average duration has increased.\n\nGiving a look at the table below, we can verify that in 2015 the spam decreased once again, despite it still represents a valid vector to spread malware malicious links.\n\n\u201cSpam is in a declining trend since some years now, its importance in the malicious arsenal remained at least almost equal: new methods of \u201cweaponization\u201d of this threat make it a serious threat.

Be that as it may, as indicated by the 2016 NTI Index, while a few nations have begun finding a way to ensure atomic facilities against cyber assaults, numerous still don\u2019t have legitimate laws and regulations set up.\n\n\n\nA cyberattack on an atomic facility could have extreme results  as it could be utilized to encourage the burglary of atomic materials or to attack the facility.\n\n\u201cFor example, access control systems could be compromised, thus allowing the entry of unauthorized persons seeking to obtain nuclear material or to damage the facility,\u201d. States the report issued by NTI. \u201cAccounting systems could be manipulated so that the theft of material goes unnoticed. Reactor cooling systems could be deliberately disabled, resulting in a Fukushima-like disaster.\u201d\n\n\nThe Nuclear Threat Initiative has verified that of the 24 nations with atomic materials\u2019 weapons-usable and 23 states with atomic facilities, just 13 merit the most extreme cyber security score of \u201c4\u201d. These nations are the Australia, United States, Canada, Russia, Belarus, the United Kingdom,  Finland, France, Taiwan, Bulgaria,  the Netherlands, Hungary and Switzerland.\n\nThen again, 20 nations got the base score as they don\u2019t have even the fundamental necessities for shielding their atomic facilities against assaults over the Internet. Worryingly, a portion of the states that scored 0 have been extending the utilization of atomic force.\n\nThese scores depend on the responses to a progression of inquiries concentrating on a state\u2019s digital security prerequisites for atomic assets, including assurance for basic advanced resources, consideration of digital dangers in risk appraisals, and the presence of an execution based project.\n\nIn the course of recent years, eight states have passed new laws and regulations or upgraded existing ones to fortify cybersecurity prerequisites, which has brought about enhanced scores in the NTI Index for them. The rundown incorporates the United Kingdom, South Africa, Russia, France and Pakistan.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential consequences, all states must work aggressively to ensure that their nuclear facilities are protected from cyber attacks. Governments should include the cyber threat within the national threat assessment for their nuclear facilities, and they should put in place a clear set of laws, regulations, standards, and licensing requirements for all nuclear facilities that require protection of digital systems from cyber attacks\u201d. Adding further,  \u201cAt the facility level, leadership must prioritize cybersecurity, determine potential consequences, and implement a program that ensures that digital assets and networks are characterized and secured and that the security is routinely tested.\u201d states the Nuclear Threat Initiative.\n\nA report published in the October 2015 by Chatham House uncovered that the worldwide atomic industry still doesn\u2019t completely comprehend the danger postured by the cyberattacks. And given the fact that the Internet is becoming Internet of dangerous things (because of the Internet of things/connected devices\u2019 wild spread somehow, I\u2019d say), anyone can get infected over it \u2013 anytime!. The study, concentrating on common atomic facilities, demonstrated that this part had fallen behind different commercial ventures.\n\nICS-CERT, The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team in the United States said not long ago that of the 295 basic framework episodes answered to the association in the monetary year 2015, two percent was recorded in the atomic reactors, materials and waste segment.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

These seven discovered malware offer threat actors a variety of capabilities including espionage and the means to move laterally within targets in order to achieve more strategic access.\u201d states the report.\n\nThe experts obtained the source of the malware, including a README file that details the basic functionality of the RAT.\n\n\n\nThe RAT functionalities include a shellcode extension, remote uninstall, a file manager, download and execute, upload and execute and of course, the access to the system information. Officials with Arbor Networks said the malware has \u201cthe means to move laterally within targets in order to achieve more strategic access,\u201d as well.\n\nThe malware appears very insidious, it has the ability to remain under the radar while moving laterally within the infected systems.\n\nExperts at Arbor Networks first uncovered traces of the Group 27\u2019s activity in the middle 2015, but Trochilus appeared in the wild only in October 2015, when threat actors used it to infect visitors of a website in Myanmar.

A first study on the Brazilian criminal ecosystem was published by the security firm in November 2014, Trend Micro described a thriving marketplace where cyber criminals proposes their services and products to criminal crews that instead of creating their own attack tools from scratch could benefit of the competitive offer. The study reported the principal solutions and services offered to the crooks in a model of sale known as crime-as-a-service that is able to attract new actors in the cyber arena.\n\nThis new study confirms that new players appeared in the Brazilian cybercriminal underground in 2015, mainly unscrupulous youngsters.\n\n\u201cMost of them are young and bold individuals with no regard for the law. Unlike their foreign counterparts, they do not rely so much on the Deep Web for transactions. They exhibit blatant disregard for the law by the way they use the Surface Web, particularly popular social media sites like Facebook\u2122 and other public forums and apps\u201d. States the report\n\nThe report confirms a trend observed in the previous study, bad actors in Brazilian Cybercriminal Underground have a great expertise in online banking malware. The black market is very prolific and new malware continue to appear, but as explained in the report it is quite easy to pay for a ransomware, or the customized of any malicious code.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the underground players means understand the overall market, so how do they operate?\n\n\u201cBrazilian cybercriminals operate either solo or in groups, though more often than not, they prefer to work individually. They can be classified under two main categories\u2014developers and operators.\u201d\n\nThe developers are normal people with an educational background that turn to cybercrime because it\u2019s a lucrative job, they are the ones behind the creation of new malware. They don\u2019t use the deep web as their peers  in other countries, they prefer to publicize their product through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter\u2122, YouTube\u2122, Skype\u2122,and WhatsApp\u2122. Developers are normally young students that are financially motivates.\n\n\u201cOne such developer is the notorious 20-year-old Lordfenix2 whom we profiled in June 2015. This computer science student was able to build more than 100 banking Trojans that can bypass Brazilian banks\u2019 security measures. This has earned him a reputation as one of the country\u2019s top banking malware creators. He supposedly started developing his own malware when he was still in high school and remains an active underground player to date.\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe operators may have or not specific educational background, they are the actors that buy the malware to the developers. They are the ones who interact with the actual victims, they normally buy the malware from developers via crime-as-a-service model. Operators are the ones that normally law enforcement agencies catch, in opposite the malware developers that are hard to track down.\n\nWhich products/services can be found in the Brazilian underground?\n\nRansomware\n\nA very important tool in the underground, and a must have in a cybercriminal arsenal. Anyone can get it for US$3,000 or 9 Bitcoins, and can use it in Windows\u00ae, Linux\u00ae, Android, iOS\u2122, and OSX devices. It encrypts all sort of files.\n\nModified Android apps\n\nAlso a big hit recently appeared in the Brazilian criminal underground. These apps can be configured to steal credentials or credit card info.\n\nPII-querying services\n\nThese services are normally sold for US$6.81, or 0.015 bitcoins, and can get you information like vehicle registration plate database, or CadSUS database (the Brazilian heath card system).\n\nKAISER malware\n\nIt\u2019s a malware focus in bypassing Sicredi\u2019s (a Brazilian credit union), the time-based token system, among many others, can also exploit clients from the banks, Banco do Brasil, Ita\u00fa, HSBC, Santander, and Bradesco. The malware logs the victim\u2019s credentials.\n\nProxy keyloggers\n\nUseful tools to redirect victims to the attacker\u2019s page, like a fake bank page. When infected the victim\u2019s computer can be accessed remotely and the attackers can see the victim\u2019s screen.\n\nRemota keyloggers\n\nRemota means remote, and has the ability to fake all sorts of browser windows, when a user tries to access a bank site, for US$511.61, an operator can get full support and updates each week.\n\nDNS changers\n\nDNS changers are offered for sale in the market for around US$1279.02 (prices may vary), they redirect the victim to a phishing pages when accessing a target site. DNS changers found in Brazil during 2015 were mainly written in JavaScript.\n\nCybercrime training\n\nIn the Brazilian market it is possible to pay for all sorts of training courses, including malware development, managing botnets, stealing credit card data, among many others.\n\nCrypter programming\n\nFor around US$51.16, can provide programming training with online support via Skype.\n\nCredit card-related goods\n\nIn this domain, you can many things, as Stolen credit card credentials, Credit card number generators, etc. etc.\n\nPoS skimmers\n\nCybercriminals modified legitimate PoS terminals to be able to steal credit cards, these devices are normally sold for around US$2046.43.\n\nModified smart card readers and writers\n\nModified Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) card readers are commonly sold in the Brazilian underground. Recently was discovered the modus operandi of the cyber criminals that would convince a waiter to use a modified PoS terminals for credit card payments. The waiters were offered with US$255.80.\n\nCredit card transaction approval services and training\n\nIn this case, the crook needs to work with more accomplices that are experts at getting transactions made with stolen credit cards approved. They normally help the operator to use the stolen card to buy good online.\n\nFake documents and counterfeit money\n\nYou can get a new ID card, or a new driver\u2019s license.\n\nFake diplomas\n\nWhy not get a fake degree?

Also in 2015 users used simple numerical passwords, with six of the top 10 passwords on the 2015 list comprised of numbers only.\n\nSome users have started using new and longer passwords in an attempt to improve their security, or simply because websites forced them to do so, however are still easy to guess.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an effort by many people to be more secure by adding characters to passwords, but if these longer passwords are based on simple patterns they will put you in just as much risk of having your identity stolen by hackers,\u201d explained SplashData chief executive Morgan Slain.\n\n\u201cAs we see on the list, using common sports and pop culture terms is also a bad idea.

The security expert from ESET Anton Cherepanov explained that hackers are attacking a group of unnamed organisations in the country with the BlackEnergy trojan.\n\nBlackEnergy is a popular DDoS Trojan, gained notoriety in 2008 when it was reported to have been used during the conflict Russia-Georgia conflict, the malicious code was used to launch cyber attacks against the infrastructure of Georgia.\n\nThe BlackEnergy malware was authored by a Russian hacker and originally used for DDoS attacks, bank frauds and spam distribution, but the new variant was used in targeted attacks on government entities and private companies across a range of industries.\n\nAccording to the report proposed by experts at ESET in 2014, the malware targeted more than 100 government and industry organizations in Poland and the Ukraine, F-Secure reported other attacks based on BlackEnergy which hit a target in Brussels.\n\nF-Secure security advisor Sean Sullivan speculated that BlackEnergy detected in Brussels has been used in a targeted attack on the European Parliament or European Commission.\n\n\u201cA large number of state organizations and businesses from various industry fields in the Ukraine and Poland have been targeted in recent attacks. What would otherwise be a mundane scenario in today\u2019s world of cybercrime is spiced up by the fact that the malware-spreading campaigns have leveraged the tense current geopolitical situation in Eastern Ukraine and the use of a malware family with a rich history. The most recent campaigns are dated August 2014.\u201d states the blog post on VirusBulletin. \n\nAccording to ESET the campaign targeted  hundreds of victims mainly located in Eastern Europe.\n\n\u201cWe have observed more than 100 individual victims of these campaigns during our monitoring of the botnets,\u201d Lipovsky said. \u201cApproximately half of these victims are situated in Ukraine and half in Poland, and include several state organisations, various businesses, as well as targets which we were unable to identify.\u201d \n\nThe same nations hit by BlackEnergy malware were already targeted by another cyber espionage campaign documented by F-Secure, dubbed CosmicDuke, which targeted dozens of computers at government agencies across Europe.\n\nNow experts at ESET discovered a new component in the BlackEnergy trojan, the KillDisk component, which is capable of destroying some 4000 different file types and rendering machines unbootable.\n\nThe KillDisk component used to compromise the energy companies in Ukraine was slightly different from other versions, below the list of new features observed by the experts:\n\nThe BlackEnergy configuration example used in 2015 (ESET)\n\nThe strain of malware detected by ESET in 2015 also uses a previously unknown SSH backdoor to access the infected systems, in addition to BlackEnergy backdoor.\n\n\u201cESET has recently discovered that the BlackEnergy trojan was recently used as a backdoor to deliver a destructive KillDisk component in attacks against Ukrainian news media companies and against the electrical power industry. \u201d states the blog post published by ESET.\n\nThe experts at ESET highlighted the presence of Build IS numbers in the BlackEnergy code, these data could provide information useful for the attribution of the malicious code. In the specific case the build identity numbers suggest the possible involvement of Russian hackers, but ESET avoids confirming it.\n\n\u201cApart from a list of C&C servers, the BlackEnergy config contains a value called build_id. This value is a unique text string used to identify individual infections or infection attempts by the BlackEnergy malware operators. The combinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes reveal information about the campaign and targets.\u201d states the post \u201cWe can speculate that some of them have a special meaning. For example 2015telsmi could contain the Russian acronym SMI \u2013 Sredstva Massovoj Informacii, 2015en could mean Energy, and there\u2019s also the obvious \u201cKiev\u201d.\u201d\n\nGive a look to the report published by ESET that also includes Indicators of Compromise (IoC).\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 BlackEnergy Trojan, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Aethra botnet made up of 12000 Italian devices threatens businesses", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42992/cyber-crime/42992.html", "title": "Aethra botnet made up of 12000 Italian devices threatens businesses\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 23, 2015", "body": "Earlier February, experts at VoidSec where performing ordinary maintenance on their personal website when noticed something of strange in the logs. It was a \u201cstrange\u201d recurring pattern, revealing a brute force attack against the administrative interface of the WordPress website.\n\nThe experts noticed that all IPs involved in the attack (they were thousands) came from ranges of IP addresses associated to all the principal Italian Internet Service Providers. The involved IPS are\n\nThe experts then tracked back the source of attack discovering that all the IPs involved were users by anAethra modem/router (BG1242W, BG8542W etc.).\nAs usual happen in this case, thousand of SOHO devices were compromised because they were using default credentials (blank: blank).\n\nThe interface of such devices is vulnerable to various reflected XSS, for example in the field username of the login form, in the \u201csource host ping\u201d field, mtrace etc. etc. \u2013 CSRF and to HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing (partly mitigated).\n\nSummarizing the experts discovered a botnet of thousands of devices, by using Shodan they were able to extract some additional information about the infected devices.\n\n\u201cThere are many Aethra devices around the world (~ 12,000), of which 10,866 are in Italy; filtering by type they are approximately 8000 Aethra Telecommunications PBX devices, the device involved in this specific attack.\n\nThe Aethra devices (including 104 models ranging from SIP / 2.0 to Aethra VegaX3_Series_4 Videoconference System) involve 254 unique providers around the world in fifty different countries.\u201d States the report published by VoidSec.\n\n\n\nThe botnet is considered very dangerous because Aethra modems are mainly exclusively sold for business contracts, this means that vulnerable devices belong to business is various industries and could be used to facilitate targeted attacks towards those specific companies.\n\n\u201cFrom our statistics we noticed that 70% of those devices are vulnerable (default credentials), therefore 8400 devices with a business contract (ADSL 1Mbps upload / optic fiber 10Mbps) bring a maximum output power ranging from 8400 Mbps to 84000 Mbps, approximately 1-10 Gigabytes per second, that could be used for DDoS attacks.\u201d continues the post.\n\nThe action of the Italian ISP Fastweb in a joint effort with Bug Hunters and Vendors allowed to identify and patch the vulnerability in just 7 business day. The operation allowed Voidsec to update their statistics revealing a more disturbing scenario.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt appears that our initial estimates values, (made using only Shodan) were reductive and partly wrong; Fastweb has about 40,000 devices, but only 4% had default credentials, for a total output power ranging between 1.7 and 17 Gbps (based on average optic fiber coverage).\u201d\n\nWell done Fastweb!\n\nUnfortunately, all BT Italia devices are still vulnerable.\nBelow the timeline published by VoidSec:\n\nKrebs on Security wrotes:\n\u201cThe malicious code that converts vulnerable systems into stresser bots is a variation on a piece of rather crude malware first documented in November by Russian security firm Dr. Web, but the malware itself appears to date back to early 2014.\n\nIn addition to turning the infected host into attack zombies, the malicious code uses the infected system to scan the Internet for additional devices that also allow access via factory default credentials. In this way, each infected host is constantly trying to spread the infection to new home routers and other devices.\n\nThe botnet is not made entirely of home routers; some of the infected hosts appear to be commercial routers at universities and companies, and there are undoubtedly other devices involved.\u201d\n\nI think that Aethra routers may have contributed extensively to the LizardSquad botnet and its expansion.\n\nEnjoy the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013Aethra botnet, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/aethra", "topic_name": "Aethra"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot-devices", "topic_name": "IoT devices"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Inside the German cybercriminal underground", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42802/cyber-crime/german-cybercriminal-underground.html", "title": "Inside the German cybercriminal underground\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 14, 2015", "body": "We have reported several times the news related to various criminal cybercriminal underground underground communities in the wild, such as American underground, the Russian underground, the Brazil underground, the Chinese underground and also the Japanese one.\n\nWhat about the European cybercriminal underground?\n\nThis time, we will talk about the Germany cybercriminal underground, Trend Micro investigated on German crime forums and concluded that Germany possesses the most advanced cybercrime ecosystem in the European Union, beating known markets as the French and Spanish.\n\nThe Trend Micro survey examined 10 big crime forums, some of them holding a registered, active base between 20.000 and 70.000 users. The findings of the investigation are available in the paper titled U-Markt: Peering into the German Cybercriminal Underground.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe German underground does not have as wide a selection of offerings as the Russian market. In most cases, it isn\u2019t necessary to search for special goods and services in local communities because global (English-speaking) markets have more to offer. But when it comes to customized wares, it is harder to find appropriate equivalents. This is a niche that smaller communities (like the German underground) need to find in order to thrive and stay up.\u201d Reads the paper-\n\nIn these places, it is quite easy to buy any kind of illegal product and service including:\n\nIn terms of banner ads, \u201care an easy way to promote partner sites (a marketplace run by those behind a certain forum in any community, most notably in the Russian underground). These can help marketplaces widen their client bases.\u201d\n\n\n\nVery interesting is the Packstation service described in the report as a delivery method exploited by criminals and that takes advantage of the German postal service.\n\n\u201cMost underground markets rely on droppers who cash in stolen credit cards and online accounts. There is no longer a need for droppers in the German underground. Users instead rely on the so-called \u201cPackstation service\u201d that takes advantage of the German postal service. This allows sellers to put goods sold in publicly accessible metal boxes for their buyers to pick up using their pTANs and access cards.\u201d\n\nThe advantage of the \u201cPackstation\u201d redides in the fact that cybercriminals can easily perform \u201cexchange of goods and payment. Users\u2019 addresses cannot be tracked though they need to apply for the service using a physical (home) address and a mobile phone number (which are easy to fake) so they can receive short messaging service (SMS) notifications alongwith their pTANs to claim their parcels\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does really make the Germany cybercriminal underground the most advanced cyber-crime in the all European Union? The answer is Russia, because both the German and the Russian underground forums are full of carding service banner ads. These adds are normally associated with Russian underground offerings but heavily advertised in German forums.\n\nA good examples is \u201cRescator.cm\u201d, one of Russia\u2019s biggest stolen credit card marketplaces that is being advertised in the German underground, also \u201cSecureVPN.to\u201d but there are more.\n\nTrend Micro also published the list of usernames per forums, probably to help future investigations.\n\nI believe we will keep seeing more and more news about this cybercriminal underground due to the rapid growth of black markets.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cybercrime, criminal underground)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/credit-card", "topic_name": "credit card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercriminal-underground", "topic_name": "cybercriminal underground"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/germany", "topic_name": "Germany"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/packstation", "topic_name": "Packstation"}]}, {"news_name": "The North American cyber-criminal underground it\u2019s easy to access!", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42663/cyber-crime/north-american-criminal-underground.html", "title": "The North American cyber-criminal underground it\u2019s easy to access!\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 9, 2015", "body": "The new report released by Trend Micro reveals that the cyber criminal underground market in North America isn\u2019t so hidden like in other countries.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist in the dark web as much as other undergrounds do, or practice as much security,\u201d ,\u201dEssentially, it\u2019s become a gun show for everyone as long as they can participate and are willing to pay.\u201d says Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro.\n\n\u201cThe North American Underground primarily caters to customers within the region\u2013users based in the United States (US) and Canada. Unsurprisingly, most of the offerings (stolen accounts, products and services, and fake documents) are US based. This is consistent with what we see in the Japanese1 and Brazilian2 undergrounds and suggests that US-based information is most sought after in it.\u201d states the report.\n\nGigging in the underground markets users can buy, guns, drugs, hacking services, bulletproof vests, and even money laundering services or maybe hire a murder.\n\nIt could be useful to help different criminal activities, tradition organized criminals are becoming \u201ccyber aware\u201d and now do their business through the internet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done studies and exposes of the most significant undergrounds in the world,\u201d \u201cThe U.S. underground doesn\u2019t practice operational security. They\u2019ve essentially become a shopping mall.\u201d\n\nOf course, law enforcement is aware of this trend and probably in the future more of these underground markets in response to the increasing pressure of the authorities will migrate to the darkweb, where they would be more protected.\n\nIn the decade of 2000, law enforcement agencies were doing very well, and almost every U.S cyber-criminal underground was dismantled, but in the last 3 years, the criminal underground market did a came back and its getting stronger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s larger because it\u2019s providing a wider multiplicity of goods and services,\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re there for the drugs, weapons, passports, stolen cards, and murder for hire.\n\nLooking at the numbers, it can be seen that drugs it\u2019s the popular item in the criminal underground ecosystem, getting 62% of the market, but also its interesting to see that stolen data dumps account gets 16%, fake documents 4%, weapons 2%, and murder for hire 1%.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of \u201cmurder for hire\u201c, you have some options available like a simple beating for $3,000, or an \u201caccidental death\u201d for $900,000.\n\nThe last bit that we hadn\u2019t covered yet was the crimeware that takes 15% of the market and include things like, buying malware, hacking services.\n\nOther best seller besides drugs are malware, and the service provider for the malware does his homework, encrypting the malware multiple times as needed until the malware can pass undetectable through the endpoint products.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s why targeted attacks have become so prevalent,\u201d,\u201dThey will make sure their attacks cannot be stopped by perimeter defenses.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTalking about differences in countries, Kellerman explains:\n\n\u201cIn the Russian or Chinese underground, they won\u2019t sell you the back door into the system,\u201d,\u201dThat\u2019s a North American phenomenon. It\u2019s like, I broke into a house last night, I made a duplicate of the key.

The researchers have expressed a positive opinion of the popular freeware utility used for on-the-fly encryption (OTFE).\n\nThe experts have examined in detail the vulnerabilities affecting TrueCrypt and revealed that the popular application is safer than previous examinations suggest. The details of the analysis are included in a 77-page report, titled Security Analysis of TrueCrypt, that examined also extra vulnerabilities in the software.\n\nThe maintenance of TrueCrypt was mysteriously interrupted in May last year, a message on the official SourceForge-hosted page was encouraging users to adopt Microsoft Bitlocker because TrueCrypt was insecure.\n\n\u201cThe development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP. Windows 8/7/Vista and later offer integrated support for encrypted disks and virtual disk images. Such integrated support is also available on other platforms (click here for more information). You should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform,\u201d states the message on Truecrypt website.\n\n\n\nRumors online states that developers were aware of a critical vulnerability or backdoor that would jeopardize the integrity of the software, and for this reason, they suspended the project.\n\nSince then, a group of experts under the Open Crypto Audit Project who audited the software confirmed that it was \u201cwell-designed.\u201d The report published by the OCAP highlights that popular appl is affected by several buffer overflow vulnerabilities, but tests conducted by Fraunhofer SIT researchers have demonstrated that these vulnerabilities cannot be exploited by hackers.\n\nIn September, the popular hackers James Foreshaw has discovered further privilege escalation vulnerabilities that were not reported in the previous security audits of the software.\n\nNow the group of experts hired by the Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Security in Information Technology has provided more details on the real level of security implemented by the encryption platform.\n\nFrom a security standpoint, the group of researchers explained that despite there are security issued related to the software, it is good for protecting data stored on an unmounted hard drive or a USB flash drive.\n\n\u201cThe AES implementation is not timing-resistant, key files are not used in a cryptographically secure way and the integrity of volume headers is not properly protected. There are many redundant implementations (sometimes for hardware-optimization) and disused algorithms are still present in a deactivated form in the source code,\u201d state the report.\n\nAccording to the experts, TrueCrypt is not resilient to attacks in which the attackers have privileged access to a running system, but this is not a novelty.\n\nThe experts evaluated the software not optimal but still effective under specific circumstances.\n\n\u201cOverall, the analysis did not identify any evidence that the guaranteed encryption characteristics are not fulfilled in the implementation of TrueCrypt. In particular, a comparison of the cryptographic functions with reference implementations or test vectors did not identify any deviations. The application of cryptography in TrueCrypt is not optimal. The AES implementation is not timing-resistant, key files are not used in a cryptographically secure way and the integrity of volume headers is not properly protected.\u201d\n\nConcluding:\n\n\u201cOur general conclusion is that TrueCrypt is safer than previous examinations suggest,\u201d wrote the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt professor Eric Bodden. \u201cI would say that the TrueCrypt code base is probably alright for the most parts.\u201d \u201cThe flaws we found were minor, and similar flaws can occur also in any other implementation of cryptographic functions. In that sense TrueCrypt seems not better or worse than its alternatives.\u201d \u201cCode quality could be improved, though, as there are some places that call for a refactoring and certainly for better documentation. But generally the software does what it was designed for.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Truecrypt, security audit)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitlocker", "topic_name": "BitLocker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/truecrypt", "topic_name": "TrueCrypt"}]}, {"news_name": "DHS Information Security Program, Dozens secret databases vulnerable to hack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42149/security/dhs-information-security-assessment.html", "title": "DHS Information Security Program, Dozens secret databases vulnerable to hack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 22, 2015", "body": "The story I\u2019m about to tell you is staggering, the US Department of Homeland Security is running dozens of unpatched and vulnerable databases, a number of them contained information rated as \u201csecret\u201d and even \u201ctop secret.\u201d\n\nThe discovery emerged from the \u201cEvaluation of DHS\u2019 Information Security Program for Fiscal Year 2015\u201d conducted on the department\u2019s IT infrastructure by the US Government.\n\nThe audit of the DHS Information Security found serious security issues in the Government systems, including 136 systems that had expired \u201cauthorities to operate,\u201d a circumstance that implies the stop of maintenance activities. The principal problem discovered by the inspectors is that a number of systems, despite are still operative and under maintenance have no up-to-date security patches, leaving them open to cyber attacks.\n\nOf the 136 systems, 17 were containing information classified as \u201csecret\u201d or \u201ctop secret.\u201d\n\nGiving a deep look at the report on the DHS Information Security Program, it is possible to note that the Coast Guard runs 26 vulnerable databases, followed by FEMA with 25, Customs and Border Protection with 14, and the DHS\u2019 headquarters with 11.\n\n\n\nAlthough Secret Services have only two vulnerable databases, they have failed other targets.\nIt implemented proper security checks just for 75 percent of its secret or top secret databases, and just 58 per cent of its non-secret databases. The DHS targets are 100 per cent and 75 per cent respectively. The experts discovered several security issues affecting the majority of assessed systems, including PCs, databases and also browsers.\n\nThe assessments conducted to evaluate the DHS Information Security Program, revealed several deficiencies in the systems analyzed, for example, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 workstations which were missing security patches for the principal software.\n\n\u201cWe found additional vulnerabilities regarding Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, and Oracle Java software on the Windows 7 workstations,\u201d the department\u2019s inspector general noted in a 66-page report. \u201cIf exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized access to DHS data.\u201d\n\nThe inspectors have found many other security issues in the DHS Information Security Program, including weak passwords, websites susceptible to cross-site and/or cross-frame vulnerabilities and poor security settings.\n\nThe Government environments suffer bureaucratic obstacles in bug fixing and patch management, it could take more than a year to fix a leak from the moment it is reported.\n\nThe results of the evaluation confirm that improvements have been made but there are a lot of serious issues that have to be urgently addressed.\n\n\u201cWhile improvements have been made, the Department must ensure compliance with information security requirements in other areas. For example, DHS does not include its classified system information as part of its monthly information security scorecard or its FISMA submission to OMB. In addition, USCG is not reporting its PIV data to the Department, which is a contradiction to the Under Secretary for Management\u2019s guidance that requires Components to submit this information to the Department.5 In addition, we identified deficiencies with DHS\u2019 enterprise management systems, including inaccurate or incomplete data.\u201d\n\nThe report also provides a set of recommendations to solve the security issued emerged after the assessment.\n\nThe DHS has 90 days to fix the issues, two of which have been already solved.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DHS Information Security Program, vulnerable databases)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bug-fixing", "topic_name": "bug fixing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/databases", "topic_name": "databases"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/patch-management", "topic_name": "patch management"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/secret-services", "topic_name": "secret services"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "88 percent of company networks vulnerable to privileged account hacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41896/cyber-crime/company-networks-hacking.html", "title": "88 percent of company networks vulnerable to privileged account hacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 11, 2015", "body": "Bad news for network administrators, according to the security company CyberArk, 88 percent of networks are susceptible to privileged account hacks.\n\nThe report published by CyberArk entitled \u201cAnalyzing Real-World Exposure to Windows Credential Theft Attacks\u201d reveals that corporate Windows networks are most of the times poorly configured and expose credentials for privileged user accounts.

FireEye linked the group to the cyber espionage campaign \u201cOperation Saffron Rose\u201c, the experts at iSIGHT Partners discovered the group was using a network of fake accounts on principal social media to spy on US officials and political staff worldwide,  the NEWSCASTER network. Again, the experts from ClearSky uncovered the Thamar Reservoir operation that is targeting entities in the Middle East, meanwhile researchers at Trend Micro in March a new hacking campaign dubbed Operation Woolen GoldFish likely run by a threat actor group Rocket Kitten.\n\nThe Rocket Kitten group is very active and despite the numerous investigations of security firms it is continuing to conduct cyber espionage operations by using different tools in their arsenal for each hacking campaign.\n\nThe Rocket Kitten hackers are now in the headlines thanks to a new report published by the Check Point security firm. Check Point was investigating a phishing attack against one of its customers when discovered a server used by the Rocket Kitten group.\n\nAccording to the report \u201cRocket Kitten: A Campaign with 9 Lives,\u201d the hackers used a common XAMPP web server that was poorly configured, allowing the investigators to gain root access without authentication.\n\nThe experts at Check Point discovered that more than 1,800 victims were already successfully targeted by Rocket Kitten, their information was stored in the database present on the server.\n\nThe analysis of the logs from the phishing server revealed the most visitors came from Saudi Arabia (18%), the United States (17%), Iran (16%), the Netherlands (8%) and Israel (5%).\n\n\u201cThis list was analyzed to confirm a strong alignment with nation-state political interests, with specific victims known as adversarial or of intelligence value to Iran.\u201d states the report.\n\n\n\nIt is curious to note that nearly 26 percent of visitors provided their credentials.\n\nEach victim was associated with a particular Rocket Kitten operator, in one case a single operator harvested details of nearly 700 victims. Another operator phished 522 users as part of a campaign targeting human rights activists, company executives and ministry officials in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cLooking at user names, we can spot some potentially Persian names or aliases such as merah, kaveh, ahzab or amirhosein.

Naturally, digital certificates are becoming a precious commodity in the underground ecosystem, many operators in the black markets started this lucrative business.\n\nA few weeks ago experts at IBM Security X-Force  observed the offer of certificates in the Dark Web with a model of sale they called CaaS (Certificates as a service). Cybercriminals would use the Dark Web for selling high-grade code certificates -which they have obtained from trusted certificate authorities- to anyone that is interested in purchasing them.\n\nThe sale of code signing certificates has increased considerably over the past few months, a trend confirmed also by a recent research analysis conducted by  the threat intelligence firm InfoArmor.\n\nThe research has given rise to a case in which a hacker tricked a legitimate certificate authority into issuing digital certificates for malware before offering a cyber-espionage tool called GovRAT.\n\nGovRAT a hacking platform that allows the malware creation, it comes bundled with digital certificates for code signing. The same digital certificates were initially offered for sale on the black marketplace TheRealDeal Market hosted on the Tor network. GovRAT was offered for sale at 1.25 Bitcoin, but experts observed the creator is now selling it privately.\n\n\n\nThe GovRAT tool digitally signs malicious code with code-signing tools such as Microsoft SignTool, WinTrust, and Authenticode technology. The experts consider that final customer for GovRAT are APT groups targeting political, diplomatic and military employees of more than 15 governments worldwide.\n\nThe strains of malware analyzed by the researchers at InfoArmor were signed individually with different digital certificates.\n\nInfoArmor reported also that seven banks, some in the US, and 30 defence contractors have also been targeted by the GovRAT.  It has been estimated that more than 100 organizations have been hit by malware created by the GovRAT platform since early 2014.\n\nWhich is the price for code-signing digital certificates?\n\nExperts at InfoArmor found the precious commodities on many underground black markets, they are offered for sale at a price between $600-$900 depending on the CA that issued them. It is quite easy to find code-signing digital certificates issued by Comodo, GoDaddy and Thawte. It is clear that digital certificates could be revoked by the CA, but as explained by numerous sellers the event is rare and often companies are very slow in invalidating them.\n\n\u201c[The buyers are] blackhats (mostly state-sponsored), malware developers,\u201d Andrew Komarov, CIO at InfoArmor, told El Reg. \u201cIt is pretty professional audience, as typical script kiddies and cybercriminals don\u2019t need such stuff. It is used in APTs, organised for targeted and stealth attacks. The appearance of such services on the blackmarket allow [hackers] to perform them much more easily, rather like Stuxnet.\u201d \u201cIt is a pretty specific niche of modern underground market,\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t be very big, as the number of certificates is pretty limited, and it is not easy to buy them, but according to our statistics, the number of such services is significantly growing.\u201d\n\nStolen or fake certificates are a prerogative of state-sponsored attacks, they were used in numerous offensives including the Stuxnet and the Sony hack, the experts explained that cyber criminals are gaining digital certificates through resellers.\n\n\u201cBad actors buy digital certificates through resellers, where the due diligence of customers is pretty poor,\u201d Komarov explained. \u201cThey provide fake names, or fake information about the author and purpose on why they need this certificate, and receive it. After they have received such certificates, they trade it on the blackmarket for malware developers, allowing them to create signed malware for further APT in several minutes.\u201d\n\nInfoArmor reported the case of certs4you.org, a website offering malware-signing-as-a-service with prepared digital certificates.    One such service ran from a website called certs4you.org before the domain was suspended.\n\nLet me suggest reading the report on GovRAT published by InfoArmor.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 GovRAT, code-signing digital certificates)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-markets", "topic_name": "black markets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/caas", "topic_name": "CaaS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certificates-as-a-service", "topic_name": "Certificates as a service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/govrat", "topic_name": "GovRAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-signing-as-a-service", "topic_name": "malware-signing-as-a-service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/underground", "topic_name": "underground"}]}, {"news_name": "74% organizations think they will be hit by an APT in the near future", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41325/cyber-crime/isaca-apt-report-2015.html", "title": "74% organizations think they will be hit by an APT in the near future\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 22, 2015", "body": "A new report published by the ISACA organization that surveyed more than 660 cyber security professionals reveals that more than one in four organizations (28%) have already suffered an APT attack.\n\n\n\nAccording to the experts, the BYOD is increasing the APT risks and the large use of mobile devices is dramatically increasing the surface of attack of the companies.\n\nAnother element of concern are the third-party relationships that could be exploited by attackers to hit the companies.

Early efforts began with phishing, then evolved to spear phishing, and proceeded on to whaling, which often included an attachment or a link that contained malware or an exploit. However, over the past three years APTs have moved on to the Internet as the main attack vector (e.g., web sites, social media and mobile applications)\u201d states the report.\n\nThe report highlights the increasing use of social media and mobile apps to spread the infection.\n\nThe report also revealed a positive evolution in the approach to cyber security of the organizations, the most important sign is the commitment of executives. 62 percent of interviewed confirmed that their organizational senior management is becoming more sensitive to cybersecurity issues.\n\nThis improvement can also be attributed to the increased level of awareness of APTs, probably due to the numerous APT attacks uncovered by security firms in the recent years.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Businesses Using Millions of insecure SHA-1 Certificates", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41271/digital-id/sha-1-certificates-hack.html", "title": "Businesses Using Millions of insecure SHA-1 Certificates\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 21, 2015", "body": "Businesses Using Millions of Flawed Certificates, the news is shocking and refers the adoption of SHA-1 certificates, despite the algorithm is considered no more secure.\n\nMany big businesses, including firms like Deloitte, are still using SHA-1 certificates, despite the fact that SHA-1 is known to be ineffective.\n\nAccording to experts at Netcraft,  the number of SHA-1 certificates issued this year is 120,000, but most worrying is that nearly a million of surveyed SSL certificates October SSL were signed with a process relying on the SHA-1.\n\n\u201cNearly a million SSL certificates found in Netcraft\u2019s October SSL Survey were signed with the potentially vulnerable SHA-1 hashing algorithm, and some certificate authorities are continuing to issue more. Google Chrome already regards these certificates as insecure, resulting in more warning signals than if the sites had been served over a completely unencrypted HTTP connection.\u201d states Netcraft.\n\n\n\nA recent research dubbed SHAppening aimed to demonstrate how to cause a full SHA-1 collision within 49-78 days by using a 512-GPU cluster.\n\nDo you think that is not easy to have this computational capability?\n\nWrong, an attacker can rent the equivalent processing capability on Amazon\u2019s EC2 cloud computing service, an operation that would cost only $75,000 to $120,000. The demonstration provided by Netcraft is alarming and it reinforces to accelerate the migration that is estimated to be completed by 2017.\n\n\u201cRenting the equivalent processing time on Amazon\u2019s EC2 cloud computing service would cost only $75k-$120k, which is an order of magnitude less than earlier estimates. The researchers point out that this represents an important alarm signal, and that the industry\u2019s plans to move away from SHA-1 by 2017 might not be fast enough.\u201d states  Netcraft.\n\nWhat does it mean for end-users?\n\nA group of well-funded attackers, let\u2019s think about state-sponsored hackers or an international cyber crime ring, could impersonate an SSL site that uses a trusted SHA-1 certificate.\n\nAnother dangerous scenario could be observed when browsers still accepting SHA-1 signatures, in this case even after the adoption of SHA-2 certificates the SSL sites remain at risk. If the attackers are able to compromise an intermediate CA certificate signed with SHA-1, they could generate valid certificates for any domains.\n\n\u201cSome certificate authorities were hit by an unexpected pitfall after migrating to SHA-2, after failing to use new names for their SHA-2 signed intermediate certificates. SSLMate, an SSL certificate vendor, published two examples of how Google Chrome could erroneously suggest that a site was affirmatively insecure for serving a SHA-1 certificate, even when the full certificate chain actually used the SHA-2 hashing algorithm. This undesirable behaviour was caused by caching in the cryptographic libraries used by Chrome (CryptoAPI on Windows, and NSS on Linux).\u201d\n\nIt is time to migrate to SHA-2 and SHA-3, the unique hash algorithms approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the generation of digital signatures, but beware because only SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 algorithms are allowed by the CA/Browser Forum\u2019s Baseline Requirements of publicly-trusted certificates.\n\nAs I have already written, Microsoft announced in 2013, its intention to force the use of the SHA2 algorithm in code signing and SSL certificates from 2014. In September 2014 Google and Mozilla announced that their browsers would stop accepting SHA1-based certificates after January 1, 2017.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SHA-1 Certificates, digital signature)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-signature", "topic_name": "Digital signature"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hashing", "topic_name": "hashing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sha-1-certificates", "topic_name": "SHA-1 Certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sha-2", "topic_name": "SHA-2"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sha-3", "topic_name": "SHA-3"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl", "topic_name": "SSL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "The number of Governments using the FinFisher Spyware is increased", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41169/hacking/finfisher-spyware-new-customers.html", "title": "The number of Governments using the FinFisher Spyware is increased\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 18, 2015", "body": "Researchers at Citizen Lab have been monitoring the use of surveillance tools like FinFisher over the past years reporting its use by totalitarian governments.\n\nThe researchers tracked the physical locations of servers belonging to the control infrastructure used by the Germany-based FinFisher GmbH.\n\nThe infrastructure aims to cover the operation and the identity of the attackers, each FinFisher customer use master server dubbed \u201cFinSpy Master\u201d and multiple relays, the FinSpy Relays, that act as command and control (C&C) servers.\n\nThe FinFisher spyware, once infected the target machine, communicates with the relay servers, which act as a link to the master server.\n\n\n\nThe experts at the Citizen Lab used the Zmap tool to reveal the existence of 135 servers (FinSpy Masters and Relays). As explained by the experts the master servers are usually deployed on the customer\u2019s meanwhile proxy servers could be located elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe employed zmap to scan the entire IPv4 Internet (/0) several times since the end of December 2014 and throughout 2015, using a new FinFisher server fingerprint that we devised by analyzing FinFisher samples.  Our scans yielded 135 servers matching our fingerprint, which we believe are a mix of FinSpy Masters and FinSpy Relays.\u201d states the report published by Citizen Lab.\n\nIt is curious to note that the analysis of the Relay servers used to protect the identity of the Master, allowed the researchers at the Citizen Lab to find the locations of the Masters.\n\n\n \n\nIf someone tries to connect the IP address of a FinSpy Relay with a common browser, he is usually presented with a decoy page, often Google.com or Yahoo.com.\n\nThe researchers discovered that if the decoy page is Google, running a query for \u201cmy ip address\u201d the search engine will display the real IP address of the FinSpy Master.\n\n\u201cWe found some variation in the decoy pages used by FinFisher servers that we detected, though the bulk used either www.google.com or www.yahoo.com. Peculiarly, FinSpy Relays appear to return decoy pages fetched by their FinSpy Master, rather than directly fetching the decoy pages themselves.  Thus, in many cases, the pages returned by the FinSpy Relays contain location data apparently about the FinSpy Master (e.g., certain Google and Yahoo pages embed the requester\u2019s IP address or localized weather), which can reveal the location of FinSpy Masters.\u201d continues the report.\n\nIn the case of the Yahoo decoy page, Citizen Lab used an alternative method to obtain the FinSpy Master location, in this case, in fact, the web page\u2019s source code contains location data because Yahoo uses it to display customized weather information and news on the homepage.\n\nThe experts highlighted that the number of servers returning decoy pages has decreased over time, the researchers identified FinFisher users in 32 countries. Last analysis conducted by the organization allowed it to identify customers in 16 countries, the newly discovered countries are Angola, Egypt, Gabon, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and Venezuela.\n\nIn some cases, the experts were able to trace the identified IP addresses to specific government offices.\n\n\n\nThe systems of FinFisher were hacked last year and hackers disclosed 40 GB of data of FinFisher government spyware.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  FinFisher, FinSpy Spyware)  \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/finfisher", "topic_name": "FinFisher"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/finspy", "topic_name": "FinSpy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gamma-international", "topic_name": "Gamma International"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spyware", "topic_name": "spyware"}]}, {"news_name": "88% of Android devices vulnerable due to slow patch management", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41128/hacking/android-vulnerable-patch-management.html", "title": "88% of Android devices vulnerable due to slow patch management\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 16, 2015", "body": "New Android vulnerabilities are discovered every day, but it looks like that, some Android vendors are very slow in applying the necessary patch to fix the security issues. Some Android vendors are only fixing vulnerabilities once a year, this is the shocking revelation of a new study made by Daniel R Thomas, Alastair R Beresford, and Andrew Rice from the Cambridge University.\n\n\n\nThe trio proved 20400 devices and found out that 87.7% if the devices contain at least one big vulnerability, ready to be exploited.\n\nIn the Security Metrics for the Android Ecosystem paper, the experts explained the vulnerabilities (11) (i.e. dynamic link loading and injection) could let malware hijacking traffic, bricking mobile devices, replacing apps, and stealing user credentials.\n\n\u201cThe security of Android depends on the timely delivery of updates to x critical vulnerabilities. Unfortunately few devices receive prompt updates, with an overall average of 1.26 updates per year, leaving devices un-patched for long periods. We showed that the bottleneck for the delivery of updates in the Android ecosystem rests with the manufacturers, who fail to provide updates to x critical vulnerabilities. This arises in part because the market for Android security today is like the market for lemons: there is information asymmetry between the manufacturer, who knows whether the device is currently secure and will receive updates, and the consumer, who does not. Consequently there is little incentive for manufacturers to provide updates.\u201d states the experts.\n\nOne good think that they proposed, is the creation metric that can be used by users and regulators to check the security risk related with the Android vendors. Below the metric used in the study:\n\n\n\nThe study also highlights that Nexus is the vendor that most of all constantly update its products.\n\nSince the study was made in UK, they were only able to evaluate mobile carriers in that country, showing that O2 US is the best in pushing over-the-air security fixes, coming after T-mobile and Orange.\n\n\n\nThe patching architecture includes network operator, device manufactures, hardware developers, Google, and open source projects.\n\n\n\nThe criticality of the patch management is known for years, and it\u2019s not getting better, there are too many organizations in the middle before the patches arrive the end user, one solution could be that every patch is applied by Google to every device, and not being controlled by the mobile provider like it happens nowadays.

The term Cybercrime-as-a-Service refers the practice in the cyber criminal ecosystem to provide product and services for use by other criminals. In September 2014, a report from Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the 2014 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (iOCTA) report, revealed the diffusion of the business model in the underground communities and highlighted that barriers to entry in cybercrime ring are being lowered even if criminal gangs have no specific technical skills.\n\nFor example, criminals can rent a botnet of machines for their illegal activities, instead to infect thousands of machines worldwide. These malicious infrastructures are built with a few requirements that make them suitable for the criminals, including User-friendly Command and Control infrastructure and sophisticated evasion techniques.\n\n\u201cLike any unregulated, efficient economy, the cybercrime ecosystem has quickly evolved to deliver many tools and services to anyone aspiring to criminal behavior,\u201d said Raj Samani, CTO for Intel Security EMEA. \u201cThis \u2018cybercrime-as-a-service\u2019 marketplace has been a primary driver for the explosion in the size, frequency and severity of cyber attacks. The same can be said for the proliferation of business models established to sell stolen data and make cybercrime pay.\u201d\n\nStolen Payment card data is one of the most traded commodities in the underground. According experts at McAfee, a basic offering includes a software-generated, valid number that combines a primary account number (PAN), an expiration date and a CVV2 number.\n\nIn line with the information provided by other reports, prices rise when sellers include also additional information with the stolen card data. \u201cFullzinfo\u201d includes bank account ID number, date of birth, victim\u2019s billing address, PIN number, social security number, and other information like parent\u2019s maiden name.\n\n\u201cA criminal in possession of the digital equivalent of the physical card can make purchases or withdrawals until the victim contacts the card issuer and challenge the charges,\u201d continued Samani. \u201cProvide that criminal with extensive personal information which can be used to \u2018verify\u2019 the identity of a card holder, or worse yet allow the thief to access the account and change the information, and the potential for extensive financial harm goes up dramatically for the individual.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe prices of  compromised online payment service accounts mainly depend by the account balance as reported in the following table.\n\n\n\nVery interesting also the offer for Bank login credentials on the Dark Web, the experts discovered that banking login credentials and services related to accounts with a $2,200 balance are selling for $190. Bank login credentials are very precious because are normally used to stealthily transferring funds to U.S. banks, their value ranged from $500 for a $6,000 account balance, to $1,200 for a $20,000 account balance.\n\nQuite in line the offer for the United Kingdom transfers ranged from $700 for a $10,000 account balance, to $900 for a $16,000 account balance.\n\nIn the dark web, it is possible to acquire online premium content services, including online video streaming and premium comic book services. Same price samples are\n\nLess traded goods include some specific categories of online services, such as login credentials to hotel loyalty programs and online auction accounts, a major hotel brand loyalty account with 100,000 points for sale for $20, and an online auction community account with high reputation marks priced at $1,400.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Dark Web, stolen data)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking-account", "topic_name": "banking account"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/credit-card", "topic_name": "credit card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime-as-a-service", "topic_name": "Cybercrime-as-a-Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-market", "topic_name": "Dark market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stolen-data", "topic_name": "stolen data"}]}, {"news_name": "The rise of the Japanese Cybercrime Underground", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41001/cyber-crime/japanese-cybercrime-underground.html", "title": "The rise of the Japanese Cybercrime Underground\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 13, 2015", "body": "Cybercrime underground is a growing and prolific industry that knows no crisis as demonstrated by the numerous reports issued by principal security companies and law enforcement.\n\nIn the past we have analyzed criminal most prolific criminal underground, Russian, Chinese and Brazilian communities have been dissected by the experts at Trend Micro that provided detailed information on the criminal activities in these ecosystems and the offer of the principal criminal rings.\n\nNow Researchers at Trend Micro\u2019s Forward Looking Threat Research team have issued a new report titled \u201cThe Japanese Underground,\u201d on the Japan\u2019s Cybercrime Underground, a criminal online community that is growing in a significant way despite it has a still highly stealthy underground economy.\n\nAccording to the Japan\u2019s National Police Agency cybercriminal activities until March 2015 increased 40% over the previous year.  On June 2015, the Japan\u2019s Pension Service suffered a significant data breach that exposed more than one million users\u2019 records.\n\nWe have discovered that Russian underground is specialized in hacking and payment card frauds, the Chinese cybercrime underground is specialized in mobile frauds meanwhile the Brazilian underground is more focused on Banking malware.\n\nWhat about the Japan\u2019s Cybercrime Underground?\n\nThe researchers consider Japan cybercriminal rings still newbies, due to the nation\u2019s strict criminal laws Japanese criminals don\u2019t write malware due to due to the severe penalties against such activities.\n\nThe experts noticed that Japanese Cybercrime Underground is very active in the illegal buying and selling of counterfeit passports, drugs, weapons, stolen credit card data, phone number databases, hacking advice and child pornography. For example, a US passport, which is normally offered for $5,000-$6,000 on other black markets, can be acquired on the Japanese market for just $1,000.\n\n\n\nDespite the victims of the Japanese cyber criminals are mainly located in the country, the increasing interest in DDoS tools/services and ransomware would indicate that the actors are looking beyond national borders to expand their gains.\n\nJapanese players in the criminal underground exploit secured bulletin boards, virtual PO boxes and secret jargon. The principal payment methods are Amazon gift cards and Sony PlayStation Store codes. In one case the experts discovered a Japanese BBS called Tor 2 Channel displaying in homepage a warning that it had been seized by the FBI, Europol, and the US Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In reality, the BBS is active and users can access it by clicking on one of the national flag icons on that page.\n\n \u201cThey\u2019re building a greater foundation for gilded thieves in Japan,\u201d says Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer for Trend Micro. \u201cThese cybercrime forums operate under heavier security than do many of their counterparts in other nations, he says. \u201cOther [nations\u2019 cybercriminals] are starting to retrofit operational security. You\u2019re seeing them [Japanese cybercriminals] build it from the ground up,\u201d\u201dTheir number one focus is stealth, remaining covert in their operations and obfuscating their activities.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, online bank frauds account for $24 million in losses, meanwhile the overall cost of online fraud to Japanese banks was $13 million in the first half of this year.\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, the Japanes banks are a privileged target for cyber criminals, numerous banking malware hit the customers of Japanese financial institutions last year. The last in order of time is Shifu, a new sophisticated malware that has been used to target the customers of more than a dozen Japanese banks.\n\nIn the following image are reported selling prices for the Japanese criminal underground and the selling prices for the same products in the other criminal communities.\n\nA stolen Japanese credit card verified by Visa is offered for $60, much more than UK and US cards which cost only $7-8. Prices for PayPal credentials is quite the same in other countries, approximately $1-2 per record.\n\n\n\nJapan was one of the countries that suffered the greatest number of attacks based on the Angler exploit kit. On September 2015, 3,000 High-Profile Japanese websites were hit by a Massive Malvertising Campaign.\n\nThreat actors mainly use watering hole attacks to infect victims\u2019 machines.\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nThe experts have no doubts, bad actors in the Japan\u2019s criminal underground will start the development of their own malware.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s far too much talent\u201d for them to not create their own tools, said Kellermann. \u201cThis is in line with the cultural manifestation of a lot of people in a society disaffected with the government.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Japanese criminal underground, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/angler-exploit-kit", "topic_name": "Angler exploit kit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/criminal-underground", "topic_name": "criminal underground"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/japan", "topic_name": "Japan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/watering-hole", "topic_name": "watering hole"}]}, {"news_name": "MEF \u2013 Annual Report 2015 \u2013 Payment card frauds", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40990/cyber-crime/mef-report-2015-payment-card-frauds.html", "title": "MEF \u2013 Annual Report 2015 \u2013 Payment card frauds\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 13, 2015", "body": "This year I\u2019m among the experts who worked on the MEF \u2013 Annual Report on Payment Card Frauds No. 5/2015, it has been an honor and a pleasure to be able to contribute to a so interesting document full of detailed data on the phenomena of payment card frauds. The document focus on payment card frauds (unrecognized transactions) issued in Italy and used everywhere.\n\nTransactions not recognized\n\nIn 2014, with reference to cards issued in Italy, the number of the unrecognized transactions (fraud) has increased in absolute terms (0.0118% to 0.0131%), meanwhile their value has decreased respect the overall amount of value of payments (from 0.0195% to 0.0189%). In 2014 total payments genuine, both in value and in number, increased by 4% and 6%\n\nThe value of fraud increased by 5%, while the number rose by 20%, with a reduction in the average value of individual transactions (from 177 \u20ac to 151 \u20ac). Since this is a trend already seen in 2013, it is possible to envisage a new criminal modus operandi that prefers fragmentation and multiplication of transactions to circumvent the thresholds of attention of both issuers and institutions of the users.\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the series 2009-2014 describes a phenomenon under control, but, looking at the last two years, it is possible to notice a significant growth in the number of fraudulent transactions and an increasing role of the Internet as an emerging context of the implementation of fraud.\n\nIn terms of payment channels exploited for fraudulent activities the Internet is characterized by a growing trend, meanwhile POS and ATM withdrawals are decreasing.

In December the security firm Cylance released a detailed report on the hacking Operation Cleaver that was run by state-sponsored hackers linked to the Iran. The Iranian hackers targeted critical infrastructure worldwide, ten of which are located in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe Cleaver group is once again in the headlines, the hacking crew has created a network of at least 25 well-developed LinkedIn profiles to manage a social engineering campaign that is targeting entities the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhile tracking a suspected Iran-based threat group known as Threat Group-2889 (TG-2889), Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit\u2122 (CTU) researchers uncovered a network of fake LinkedIn profiles. These convincing profiles form a self-referenced network of seemingly established LinkedIn users. CTU researchers assess with high confidence the purpose of this network is to target potential victims through social engineering.\u201d states a blog post published by the Dell\u2019s Counter Threat Unit. The experts labelled the Cleaver group TG-2889.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of the legitimate LinkedIn accounts associated with the fake accounts belong to individuals in the Middle East, and CTU researchers assess with medium confidence that these individuals are likely targets of TG-2889.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts speculate that the Cleaver group has been created by the Iranian Government in in the wake of the Stuxnet attack against the nuclear facility in Natanz.\n\nThe list of targets identified by the researchers at Cylance is very long and includes at least one military entity in the US by name, the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and organizations in several industries such as energy and utilities. The previous report also revealed that airports, principal airlines, government agencies, transportation companies, telecommunications operators, defense contractors and educational institutions are among the targeted institutions.\n\nThe experts revealed that during the period of observation, the threat actors have rapidly improved their cyber capabilities.\n\nNow the Cleaver is exploiting the popular professional social network LinkedIn for intelligence gathering activities, the group used six so-called Leader profiles that have more than 500 profile connections and a number of Supporter personas what are less developed than for Leader personas.\n\nThe leader profiles were used by the threat actors to conduct spear phishing attacks or to redirect users to malicious websites hosting exploit kits.\n\nThe experts at Dell\u2019s Counter Threat Unit who investigated the case, discovered that the fake profiles used by the Cleaver hacking crew claim individuals are employees at companies including defence contractor Northrop Grumman, Malaysia\u2019s RHB Bank, US tech firm TeleDyne and South Korean holding firm Doosan.\n\nThe researchers conducting OSIT researchers discovered that \u201cthe Leader profiles\u201d were fraudulent, hackers used the same profile images for multiple identities across numerous websites. The hackers also copied the summary section in LinkedIn profiles from legitimate LinkedIn profile, meanwhile the employment history matches a sample r\u00e9sum\u00e9 downloaded from a recruitment website. Hackers also used job advertisements from Teledyne and ExxonMobil companies and legitimate job posting from a Malaysian bank in order to create a trustable job description.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cleaver hackers have created a network of credible professional enforced by the use of the endorsements mechanism.\n\nThe Supporter personas appears to be to provide LinkedIn skills endorsements for Leader profiles as it is visible in the following graph.\n\nThe researchers also spotted a novel technique, two Leader profiles appear to be duplicates and while CTU experts were analyzing the profiles, the Cleaver actors altered two of the Leader LinkedIn accounts by replacing profile name and photograph with a new identity.\n\n\u201cThe level of detail in the profiles suggests that the threat actors invested substantial time and effort into creating and maintaining these personas,\u201d states the report published by Dell. \u201cFive of the leader personas claim to be recruitment consultants, which would provide a pretext for contacting targets.\u201d\n\nThe exploitation of social network for cyber espionage is not new, in September security researchers have uncovered a group of fake recruiting accounts on LinkedIn used for intelligence gathering about security experts.\n\nA few months ago, researchers from iSIGHT Partners uncovered a group of Iranian hackers who was using more than a dozen fake profiles to infiltrate social networking websites with cyber espionage purpose.\n\n\u201cThese credible personas then connected, linked, followed, and \u201cfriended\u201d target victims, giving them access to information on location, activities, and relationships from updates and other common content,\u201d iSIGHT Partners explained.\n\nIranian spies used a network of fake accounts (NEWSCASTER network) on principal social media to spy on US officials and political staff worldwide, as reported in the analysis published by iSIGHTPartners.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 LinkedIn, intelligence)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cleaver", "topic_name": "Cleaver"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linkedin", "topic_name": "LinkedIn"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "The Angler Exploit Kit Exposed: Making $60 Million Annually by Delivering Ransomware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40797/cyber-crime/angler-exploit-kit-report.html", "title": "The Angler Exploit Kit Exposed: Making $60 Million Annually by Delivering Ransomware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 7, 2015", "body": "The Cisco Talos Group has performed in-depth research on the threat actors behind the Angler Exploit Kit, and even had behind-the-scenes access, allowing statistical information as well as Angler\u2019s inner-workings to be examined.\n\nNote that any metrics / statistical information presented throughout this article were determined via the analysis of a data set stemming from a few months earlier; July, 2015.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe Angler EK infrastructure follows what Cisco has determined to be a \u201cproxy/server\u201d configuration. Angler is not simply a single Web Application or just a single, physical server; rather, the Angler architecture includes several different components that both complement each other and provide redundancy.\n\nExploit Server: The instance examined by Cisco utilized a single \u201cexploit server\u201d that was responsible for actually delivering the malicious traffic through a chain of several proxy servers of varying locations. The exploit server runs on the Linux operating system and leverages the NGINX Web Server.\nProxy Server: The proxy server is the system that directly interacts with the users; while the exploit server contains the payloads, it does not directly interact with the user. Instead, it delivers the payload to the target through several proxy servers. The use of proxy servers protects the exploit server from being discovered.\nHealth Monitoring Server: The third core component of Angler\u2019s successful operation is a health monitoring server. This server conducts routine \u201chealth checks\u201d allowing for the gathering of statistical information (victim geolocation, success/failed compromise rate, etc.). This server essentially verifies that the operation is running smoothly.\n\n\n\nThe use of a single exploit server that never directly interacts with users allows the Angler group to utilize a single server to manage their exploits with a low rate of being discovered. Serving the malicious payload through a series of proxy servers is the evasive technique utilized to protect the exploit server.\n\nTalos gained an inside view of one of the health monitoring servers utilized by an Angler Exploit Kit instance active throughout the month of July 2015. This single server was seen monitoring 147 proxy servers, allegedly generating approximately $3 million in revenue over the span of that single month of July.\nAdditionally, Talos has determined that this single Angler instance is (or was) responsible for half of all Angler activity that they observed and is likely generating more than $30 million annually. Furthermore, this revenue was generated by the distribution of Ransomware.\n\nThe primary Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that Talos observed during their analysis were determined to be Limestone Networks and Hetzner. An example of the threat actors\u2019 activities performed while developing their Angler infrastructure, based on information provided by Limestone Networks, can be summarized as follows:\n\nExploit Breakdown and Malware Payloads\n\nA breakdown of the exploits delivered by the Angler instance examined by Talos in July 2015 is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe malware payloads delivered by this instance of Angler were primarily ransomware; More than 60% of compromised devices were infected with ransomware. Specifically, the CryptoWall 3.0 and TeslaCrypt 2.0 ransomware variants. Additionally, Angler was also found to be serving the Bedep Trojan Downloader, Ad-Fraud (or Click-Fraud) Trojans, as well as various other keyloggers and varying types of Trojans.\n\nTalos estimates that the examined instance of Angler successfully compromised 40% of the hosts that interacted with it.\nThe Key to Angler\u2019s Success:\n\nAngler\u2019s high rate-of-compromise is due to the low detection rate of the exploit payloads being served. Talos estimates that in July 2015, approximately 3,000 unique hashes were found to be related to exploits delivered by the kit.\nTalos submitted this set of hashes to VirusTotal, and discovered that only 6% of these hashes existed in the VirusTotal\u2019s database. Of this small subset of detected hashes, the majority had relatively low detection rates; most of which were detected by less than 10 Anti-Virus engines.\n\nTalos determined that Angler\u2019s primary targets were users browsing the Web with the Internet Explorer 11 browser, running either the Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 operating system. In theory, throughout the single month of July, Angler may have interacted with more than 13 million unique IP addresses.\n\nAngler\u2019s Revenue Explained\n\nThe average life span of a server associated with Angler is 1 day. The below statistics reflect the July 2015 dataset analyzed by Talos:\n\n90,000 Targeted Victims Per Day\n9,000 Exploits Served Per Day\n3,600 (40%) Systems Successfully Compromised\n2,232 (62%) Angler Infections Delivered Ransomware\n2.9% (Based on USCert via Symantec) Ransoms Paid Daily\n$300 Average Ransom Demanded\n147 Total Redirection Servers\n64.73 Ransoms Paid Daily\n$19,419.00 Daily Ransom Revenue Per Server\n$95,153.10 Gross Daily Ransom Revenue\n$2,854,593.00 Gross Monthly Ransom Revenue\n$34,225,116.00 Gross Annual Ransom Revenue\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCisco Deals a Huge Blow to the Angler Group\n\nCisco has worked with Limestone Networks, the primary ISP found to be hosting the Angler Exploit Kit, to eliminate the threat actors\u2019 affiliated servers from their network. The actions carried out by Cisco to mitigate this threat from the primary ISP utilized by Angler (allegedly generating approximately $30M of the approximately $60M total annual revenue) likely resulted in a huge financial blow to the miscreants behind Angler. Cisco stated that further actions were being taken to further disrupt Angler\u2019s operations; more can be read on the Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence website.\n\nEnjoy the Report!\n\nAbout the Author Michael Fratello\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Angler Exploit Kit, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Civil nuclear facilities worldwide at risk of cyber attack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40773/cyber-crime/civil-nuclear-facilities-security.html", "title": "Civil nuclear facilities worldwide at risk of cyber attack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 6, 2015", "body": "Civil nuclear facilities worldwide are privileged targets for cyber attacks, according to a new report published this week by the Chatham House.\n\nThe Stuxnet attack that targeted Iranian nuclear facilities demonstrated the risks for cyberattacks, for the first time a threat from the cyberspace could cause real damages in the real world.\n\nThe 18-month study analyzes cybersecurity at civil nuclear facilities, the survey is conducted interviewing 30 industry practitioners, academics and policymakers from the U.K., Canada, the U.S., Ukraine, Russia,  France, Germany and Japan.\n\n\n\nAccording to the study conducted by Chatham House, the nuclear industry is falling behind other industries when facing cyber security.\n\n\u201cThe nuclear industry is beginning \u2013 but struggling \u2013 to come to grips with this new, insidious threat,\u201d said Patricia Lewis, research director of Chatham House\u2019s international security programme.\n\nHowever the threat to nuclear facilities is evolving, it is becoming even more digital and it is exploiting new attack vectors.\n\n\u201cCyber criminals, state-sponsored hackers and terrorists were all increasing their online activity, it said, meaning that the risk of a significant net-based attack was \u201cever present\u201d. Such an attack on a nuclear plant, even if small-scale or unlikely, needed to be taken seriously because of the harm that would follow if radiation were released.\u201d states the BBC.\n\nNuclear facilities worldwide have reached a high level of physical security and safety, but are still too exposed to the cyber threats despite the important steps taken recently by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nAt the first international conference organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency in June, Yukiya Amano, director of the IAEA, said both random and targeted attacks were being directed at nuclear plants.\n\n\u201cStaff responsible for nuclear security should know how to repel cyber-attacks and to limit the damage if systems are actually penetrated,\u201d Amano said in a keynote\n\nThe digital component of civil nuclear facilities worldwide is growing even more enlarging the surface of attack of this critical infrastructure. The core of civil nuclear facilities is represented by SCADA systems and industrial control systems (ICSs), but most of them are affected by numerous vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to cause serious damage.\n\nUnfortunately, many experts consider the threat of a major cyber attack at low risk because critical components in nuclear facilities are air gapped (i.e. isolated from the Internet), but Chatham House confirmed that this is a wrong.\n\n\u201cHowever, it said, this so-called \u201cair gap\u201d between the public internet and nuclear systems was easy to breach with \u201cnothing more than a flash drive\u201d. It noted that the destructive Stuxnet computer virus infected Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities via this route.\u201d continues the BBC.\n\nThe study has found that in many nuclear facilities the systems are accessible via virtual private networks (VPN), but some cases operators might not be aware of their existence.\n\nWhen dealing technical challenges, the Chatham House study names the \u201cinsecurity by design\u201d of industrial control systems, highlighting the difficulties in patching vulnerable systems. A patch could cause serious compatibility issues and in the worst scenarios the deployment could result in downtime and compromise the operation of the entire facility. vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cThe nuclear industry as a whole needs to develop a more robust ambition to take the initiative in cyberspace and to fund the promotion and fostering of a culture of cyber security, determining investment priorities and ensuring that sufficient and sustained funding is allocated to effective responses to the challenge. It also needs to establish an international cyber security risk management strategy and encourage the free flow of information between all stakeholders,\u201d Chatham House said in its report. \u201cThis will require the industry to develop appropriate mechanisms and coordinated plans of action to address the technical shortfalls identified, as well as to find the right balance between regulation and personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nOne of the principal problems approaching cyber security of  nuclear facilities is the risk assessment, it is often inadequate and results in the wrong evaluation of expenditure in defense measures against cyber threats. It is crucial to be able to accurately assess and measure the risk in order to have the commitment of executives.\n\nIt is not easy to disclose an incident, in many cases the threats go undetected for a long period of time, in other cases they will never be uncovered. The perception of the risks related to a major cyber attack is low, the hack of an ISC system is wrongly considered a rare event.\n\nAccording to the study of Chatham House, the lack of cyber security policies, procedures and training makes the situation worse, the operators at nuclear facilities are not prepared to detect and respond cyber attacks.\n\nEnjoy the Report!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 civil nuclear facilities, cyber security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ics", "topic_name": "ICS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nuclear-facilitie", "topic_name": "nuclear facilitie"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/risk-assessment", "topic_name": "Risk assessment"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "IT Security in SMEs: Guidelines published by UNICRI", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40707/cyber-crime/unicri-report-security-sme.html", "title": "IT Security in SMEs: Guidelines published by UNICRI\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 4, 2015", "body": "UNICRI (United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute) published in September 2015 a new study about the IT security of Italian small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This research is focused on the first semester of 2015 and constitutes the first update following the release of the study entitled \u201cCybercrime and the risks for the economy and enterprises at the European Union and Italian levels\u201d, which was published in December 2014 also by UNICRI.\n\nIT security for SMEs represents one of the most pressing challenges for both the economies of Italy and Europe. SMEs make up 99.8% of European and 99.9% of Italian enterprises, respectively. In the European Union (EU), 86.8 million people are employed within this sector making SMEs the backbone of the Italian and European economies. While at the same time, they also represent a major point of weakness in terms of security.\n\nSMEs are a very attractive target for cyber criminals; nevertheless, decision makers working in these enterprises still often underestimate the threat posed by cybercrime. No matter the nature of an SME\u2019s business, every company is seen as a lucrative target. Various types of information, be it intellectual property, commercial data and contact lists, personal data, account credentials, and more can be sold on the black market to individuals intent on committing fraud, spreading malware and facilitating other crimes. At the corporate level, damage is not only caused via a simple, one-off or indiscriminate attack. Instead, many attacks have long-term consequences. We are now witnessing an increase in targeted attacks that have the aim of appropriating sensitive data, deleting data altogether, or stealing copyrighted material.\n\nCyber crime is of a stronger nature and more widespread than one might imagine. In fact, most cyber attacks are still not being detected and/or reported. Losses due to cyber crime for an individual company can reach up to several million euros. Due to large-scale cyber attacks in 2014, approximately one billion records were compromised \u2013 affecting, on average, one in every three Internet users. Many of these records were totally unencrypted and thus easy to exploit.\n\nThe number of ransomware attacks is more than doubled in 2014 \u2013 rising from an estimated 4.1 million attacks in 2013, to 8.8 million in 2014. From a psychological point of view, ransomware represents a very profitable form of attack because if a victim has not performed regular backups of their data, they are normally willing to pay the ransom in order to be allowed to retrieve it.\n\nAbout mobile, Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s Motive Security Labs has estimated that more than 16 million mobile devices around the world have been infected with malware for the purpose of carrying out industrial and personnel espionage, to steal information and to attack companies, private, banks and government. In 2014 alone, mobile device infections increased by 25% (an increase of 5% compared to 2013).\n\nThe presence of money or data which can be stolen, and the ease with which violating a target can take place, are the main factors that cyber criminals consider when carrying out their activities. Unfortunately, SMEs meet both these requirements. Nowadays, digital information security and proper use of the web and computer tools must be considered a priority by each individual citizen, and especially by companies. In this scenario it is necessary to put in place a number of proactive measures to increase awareness in the field.\n\nConsidering the growing trend regarding this type of threat, it is more important than ever to develop efficient preventative security systems.\n\nIn the event of a security breach, many companies do not even realize they have been attacked. Moreover, when devising a cyber security strategy, enterprises often do not know what can be done in order to protect themselves from cyber threats, and erroneously believe that defensive actions are expensive and solely technical in nature.\n\nA framework for assistance in the implementation of IT security systems is a major aspect that is lacking in the Italian SME sector. Technical elements, such as antivirus software and firewalls, etc. are in use, but the formulation of a structured policy needs to be taken into account in order to build a base that can be adapted and re-implemented over time according to the evolution of cyber threats. In response to this environment and the analysis of existing gaps, a suggested plan of action has been the creation of a framework of comprehensive, identifiable guidelines that are adaptable to the various types of SMEs present within Italy.\n\nAccordingly a set of guidelines was drafted, and subsequently submitted to and validated by IT security experts from leading companies, such as Fastweb, IBM, Kaspersky and Microsoft. Additionally, the guidelines were also reviewed by three IT managers from three different enterprises who were interviewed within the previous study on SMEs. Cyber crime poses a severe risk to all types of enterprises present throughout Italy. Preventing these risks requires implementing initiatives based on both education and awareness. Action in this field is not only required on behalf of SMEs, but also needs to be taken into account at the national level.\n\n\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cybercrime , UNICRI)\n\nGuidelines for IT Security in SMEs[3]\n\n[1] Why SMEs are an attractive target for cyber criminals and what they can do about it, by Neil Ford, 02-03-2015, in <http://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/why-smes-are-an-attractive-target-for-cyber-criminals-and-what-they-can-do-about-it/> (retrieved 21-05-2015)\n\n[2] Motive Security Labs malware report \u2013 H2 2014, Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s Motive Security Labs, in <https://resources.alcatel-lucent.com/asset/184652> (retrieved 23-03-2015)\n\n[3] These Guidelines have been formulated thanks to the advice put forth by Dr. Daniele De Nicol\u00f2, and they have been validated by Fastweb, IBM, Kaspersky, Microsoft and IT Manager by Lucart, Lucense and Tagetik.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sme", "topic_name": "SME"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/unicri", "topic_name": "Unicri"}]}, {"news_name": "Tracking Hacker Forums with Traffic Analysis", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40529/cyber-crime/tracking-hacker-forums.html", "title": "Tracking Hacker Forums with Traffic Analysis\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 28, 2015", "body": "Hacker forums still exist, hacking communities are with good shape and growing.

At the other end of the spectrum, only 10% of transport firms globally have reported a cyber attack in the past 12 months and just 27% perceive it as a threat.\u201d states Grant Thornton.\n\nOrganizations in Europe and North America are privileged targets for hackers, but thanks to a major awareness of cyber threats the estimated loss of business revenues was lower in the EU ($62.3bn) and North America ($61.3bn) than APAC ($81.3bn).\n\n\n\nA successful cyber attack will have a significant impact on the organization with an estimated cost of around 1.2% of business revenues.\n\n\u201cCyber attacks are an increasingly significant danger for business. Not just cost in a financial sense, but serious reputational damage can be inflicted if attacks undermine customer confidence: just ask Ashley Madison. Despite this, nearly half of firms still lack a strategy to deal with the cyber threat.\u201d said Paul Jacobs, Global Leader of Cyber Security at Grant Thornton.\n\n\u201cBusinesses cannot afford to be behind the curve on this threat. Cyber attacks can strike without warning and sometimes without the victim being immediately aware. The pressure from customers and clients cannot be ignored. In this digital age, rigorous security and privacy is expected. If this cannot be guaranteed the ultimate risk is they will simply go elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe principal problem in my opinion is represented by the lack of security strategy in many organizations, only 52% of those surveyed confirmed to have a strategy in place.\n\nThe companies lack a strong commitment by the higher management in cyber security and the lack of a proper security posture expose its business to serious risks.\n\nThe businesses the most of all are implementing a cyber security strategy are client/customer demand (44%).\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cyber attack cost, cyber security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/economic-impact", "topic_name": "economic impact"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/grant-thornton-international", "topic_name": "Grant Thornton International"}]}, {"news_name": "Data breaches, stolen data and their sale in the Dark Web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40404/cyber-crime/data-breaches-deep-web.html", "title": "Data breaches, stolen data and their sale in the Dark Web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 24, 2015", "body": "Trend Micro published a report that explains the dynamics triggered by data breaches, following data from the incidents to their offer in the Dark Web.\n\nStolen data is a precious commodity in the criminal ecosystem, and in particular in the Deep Web. The great number of data breaches that security firms frequently discover are fueling the underground market of an impressive amount of users\u2019 data.\n\nLet\u2019s think to the recent attacks suffered by Ashley Madison, OPM and Hacking Team that impacted millions of users, their accounts and intellectual property were compromised by even more sophisticated hacks.\n\nAs usual experts at Trend Micro are a source of inspiration for me, like me, they constantly monitor the evolution of the criminal underground giving us an interesting point of view of the activities of the principal crime rings.\n\nThe last report entitled \u201cFollow the Data: Dissecting Data Breaches and Debunking the Myths\u201d focuses on the data breaches and the dynamic triggered by such kind of events.\n\nThe experts integrated their analysis with data from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC)\u2019s Data Breaches database, they discovered hacking or malware account for 25 percent of data breaches in Q1 2015. Other causes are insiders, physical skimming devices and the loss or theft of devices (i.e. Mobile devices, flash drives).\n\n\n\nData breaches are phenomena really complex to analyze, it is not easy to promptly discover the root causes neither to predict the medium and long-term effects on the victims.\n\nSome data breaches are caused by threat actors intentionally, others are the result of an unintended disclosure, typically personnel mistakes or negligence.\n\nThe statistics on the data breaches confirm that the number of incidents that exposed credit and debit card data has increased 169% in the past five years. It is interesting to note that the value of information in the underground market is rapidly changing, while the prices for credit and debit card, bank account, and personally identifiable information (PII) dropping due to oversupply, the value of compromised Uber, online gaming and PayPal accounts are rising. PII is the data most likely stolen followed by financial data.\n\nAnalyzing the data breaches per industry, it is possible to note that Healthcare it the most affected by data breaches, followed by government, and retail.\n\nThe report follows the entire life cycle of the data breaches, from the intrusion to the offer of the stolen data on the Dark Web.\n\nThe researchers investigated on the prices of commodities in the black markets hosted in the Tor Network, US accounts of mobile operators can be purchased for as little as $14 each, but the underground offer much more, including Amazon, eBay, Facebook,  PayPal, Netflix,  and Uber accounts.\n\n\n\nThe offer is very articulated and multiple factors contribute to the final price of the commodity, for example PayPal and eBay accounts which have a few months or years of transaction history go up to $300 each.\n\nBank account offered for a price ranging from $200 and $500 per account, depending on the balance and the account history.\n\nAs anticipated the disconcerting finding of the research is related to the value of personally identifiable information (full address, a date of birth, a Social Security number, and other PII), each record is sold for $1.\n\nAs already reported by other reports, document scans of passports, driver\u2019s licenses and utility bills, are becoming even more popular, many sellers in the black markets include in their offer also this kind of information that could dramatically improve the efficiency of fraud schema.\n\nDocument scans are available for purchase from $10 to $35 per document.\n\nI don\u2019t want to tell you more.

Some send a child\u2019s location data to parents and issue an alert when a child searches keywords such as \u2018suicide\u2019, \u2018pregnancy\u2019 and \u2018bully\u2019 or receives messages with those words\u201d, reports AP\n\nThe researchers discovered that attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to take over the users\u2019 accounts and access other sensitive information.\n\n\n\nMore than half a million South Koreans use the Smart Sheriff child monitoring app to monitor their children.\n\nCitizen Lab reported the security issued to the company that develops the child monitoring app,  the Korean Mobile Internet Business Association (MOIBA), in early August. The company fixed some of the problems reported, but it is not clear which ones have been fixed to date.\n\nThe Citizen Lab agreed a timeline with the MOIBA, but it isn\u2019t providing any update on its bug fixing activity.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Smart Sheriff app was written without any security in mind. The connected API services are architectured and implemented in similarly horrendous ways, allowing trivial exposure of passwords and other highly sensitive user data,\u201d reads the report issued by the German pen testing service Cure53.\n\n\u201cGiven the level of vulnerability this app exposes, combined with the extremely high numbers of its users, it needs to be considered that at least some of the issues published in this report must have started to be actively exploited by now.\u201d\n\nThe Smart Sheriff app fails to encrypt any parents and child\u2019s data, dates of birth, gender, and telephone numbers along mobile device information could be easily  intercepted by an attacker sharing the same network. Smart Sheriff sends information to its own servers in plain text, violating also the Korean law.\n\nThe app doesn\u2019t authenticate requests it receives, an attacker could impersonate the Safe Sheriff servers, and inject malicious code into smartphone using the child monitoring app.\n\n\u201cTheir servers fail to meet common security standards,\u201d Citizen Lab writes, \u201cThe deployment is based on obsolete and insecure protocols that are vulnerable to attacks that could lead to the interception and impersonation of MOIBA\u2019s servers.\u201d\n\n\u201cCombinations of the identified vulnerabilities could lead to mass compromise of accounts or service disruption. An attacker with the resources to run a high volume of queries against Smart Sheriff could potentially identify all of Smart Sheriff\u2019s users, and then use the vulnerabilities we identified to systematically disrupt all subscribers\u2019 devices or the service itself,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nIt is absurd that a country technological advanced like the South Korea has promoted an app that totally lack of security by design, especially when dealing with online child protection.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 child monitoring app, Smart Sheriff)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/child-abuses", "topic_name": "child abuses"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/child-monitoring-app", "topic_name": "child monitoring app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/citizen-lab", "topic_name": "Citizen Lab"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/moiba", "topic_name": "MOIBA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pornography", "topic_name": "pornography"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smart-sheriff", "topic_name": "Smart Sheriff"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}]}, {"news_name": "Security issues in DHS systems potentially exposes confidential data at risk", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40207/security/dhs-audit-by-oig.html", "title": "Security issues in DHS systems potentially exposes confidential data at risk\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 17, 2015", "body": "Among the missions assigned to the DHS there is the coordination of activities related to the prevention, mitigation and recovery from cyber incidents, the Department also oversees the IT security of the US Government.\n\nThe DHS is supported in these critical activities by three agencies: the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), and United States Secret Service (USSS).\n\nThe intense collaboration between the agencies is crucial to ensure the Homeland Security.\n\n\n\nAfter this premise, let me show you the results of a report released on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG). The audit , conducted  by the OIG, called for improved coordination between DHS agencies in order to meet cyber threats in order to avoid serious cyber incidents.\n\nAccording to the report \u201cDHS Can Strengthen Its Cyber Mission Coordination Efforts \u201d published by the OIG, DHS and above components have taken significant steps to improve the information sharing and respond to the cyber attacks in an effective way.\n\nHowever, the OIG discovered several security related a lack of coordination with existing policies and the organization of a Department-wide Cyber Training Program.\n\nWithout developing the department-wide training program, internal staff is not able to perform correctly their assigned incident response duties or investigative responsibilities in the event of a cyber incident.\n\n\u201cDespite these positive steps, the Department can take additional actions to improve its cyber mission coordination.

All the targeted organizations manage information of interest for the Russian government, in April 2014 researchers at F-Secure analyzed a number of documents referring political issues like the crisis in the Ukraine or NATO informative in the attempt to circumvent the victims. F-Secure reported, for example, the existence of a bogus document signed by Ruslan Demchenko, the First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe source code analyzed by F-Secure contains a number of Russian-language artifacts, in one case the researchers found also an error message that support the attribution.

The company was trying to discover the sources for journalist\u2019s stories, but Vodafone denies any \u201cimproper behaviour\u201d.\n\nThe journalist is Natalie O\u2019Brien and in 2011 she published a series of stories related serious security issues in the Siebel data system used by the Vodafone.\n\nO\u2019Brien reported that Vodafone\u2019s Siebel data system was available online and easily accessible through generic passwords that were being shared around the company and publicly.\n\nThe journalists reported that the Vodafone system was vulnerable to cyber attacks, exposing customer data, including home addresses, drivers\u2019 licenses and credit card details, to criminal rings.\n\nIn response, after the publishing of the story, a Vodafone employee accessed her phone (O\u2019Brien was Vodafone customer) call and text message records in order to discover its sources and the alleged company whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a creepy nauseating experience to know that someone has been trawling through your mobile phone account looking at all your call records and private text messages.\u201d O\u2019Brien wrote on the Sun-Herald. \n\n\u201cThe invasion of privacy is devasting. It plays with your mind. What was in those texts? Who were they to? What did they see? What did they do with the information?\u201d \n\n\n\nThe journalist was disconcerted by the events, the alleged flaws in the Vodafone system and the hack have to be reported to the Information and Privacy Commissioner and the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\n\n\u201cThe shock and anger is only compounded knowing it was because I was doing my job that I was targeted and it was my own telco that was doing it to me. Since when did telling the truth become the wrong thing to do?\u201d\n\nAccording to internal Vodafone email, reported by the Australian, the Giant was aware of the serious security breaches and of consequences for hacking the journalist\u2019s communications and data.\n\n\u201cThe head of fraud management and investigations for Vodafone Group, Colin Yates, wrote to then global corporate security director Richard Knowlton that there was a \u201chuge risk\u201d to the company if the hacking of O\u2019Brien\u2019s phone \u201cgets into the public domain\u201d.\u201d reported the Guardian. \n\n\u201cIf the issue relating to breaching the reporter\u2019s privacy by searching her private call records and text messages gets into the public domain, this could have \u00adserious consequences given it is a breach of the Australian Telecommunications Act,\u201d Yates wrote.\n\n\u201cAnd would certainly des\u00adtroy all of the work done by VHA [Vodafone Hutchison Australia] over the past months to try and restore their reputation.\u201d\n\nVodafone denies any allegations of improper behaviour and confirms it provided all the necessary support to the Privacy Commissioner\u2019s investigation.\n\n[Vodafone] \u201cstrongly denies any allegations of improper behaviour. VHA takes its legal and corporate responsibilities very seriously\u201d. states the company in an official statement.\n\n\u201cOver the past four years, VHA has invested heavily in the security of its IT systems. The company has very strict controls and processes around the privacy of customer information, and has appointed a dedicated privacy officer. The privacy of our customers and protection of their information is our highest priority and we take this responsibility very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe deny that Vodafone Hutchison Australia made any incorrect statements to the Privacy Commissioner or any other authorities.\u201d\n\nVodafone confirmed it became aware of the hacking of O\u2019Brien\u2019s phone in June 2012.\n\n\u201cVodafone Hutchison Australia immediately commissioned an investigation by one of Australia\u2019s top accounting firms. The investigation found there was no evidence VHA management had instructed the employee to access the messages and that VHA staff were fully aware of their legal obligations in relation to customer information.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Vodafone was cited by privacy advocates.\n\nIn June 2014, Vodafone issued the \u201cLaw Enforcement Disclosure Report\u201c that revealed the existence of secret wires that allow state surveillance. The document  describes the support provided by the company to many governments for lawful interception for some of its 400 million customers.\n\nIn November 2013, Vodafone Iceland suffered a major data breach that exposed 70000 user personal information. A a group of hackers disclosed a compressed 61.7MB rar file that contained a collection of files including one titled users.sql that appears to contain the 77,000 Vodafone user accounts. The file includes usernames, social security numbers, encrypted passwords as many other encrypted information.\n\nAnother file, MySQL file greind.sql appears to contain a small log of sms history that is dated 2011 as well as a sms logger.\n\n\n\nThe hack of the Fairfax journalist\u2019s phone represents a serious threat for the user privacy, let\u2019s wait for further information of the investigation of Australian authorities.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Vodafone, hacking)\n\n// <![CDATA[\n(function(){var h=this,aa=function(a){var b=typeof

carried out at least 114 DDoS attacks with an average peak bandwidth of around 13.34 Gbps on its customers since April 2015.\n\nThe DD4BC group attempted to extort money from financial companies and other business by threatening to hit them with DDoS attacks that could interfere with their operations.\n\nIn one case, the DDoS attack flooded the target with over 56.2 Gbps of traffic, in June the run at least 8 DDoS attacks that had peak bandwidths of more than 23 Gbps.\n\n\u201cFrom June through July 2015, the attacks increased from low-level to more than 20 Gbps in some cases. The group would then demand a Bitcoin ransom to protect the company from a larger DDoS attack designed to make its website inaccessible.\u201d states a report published today.\n\nThe DD4BC group targeted Financial services in 58 percent of the DDoS attacks, banks and credit unions in 35 percent of the attacks, currency exchanges in 13 percent while the rest were payment processing firms.\n\n\n\nThe experts are following the DD4BC group since September 2014, every attack carried by the DD4BC group was preceded by emails from the crooks that have attempted to extort money from the victims. The criminals request their victims the payment of a specific ransom amount in Bitcoins to stop the DDoS attack.\n\nAkamai published samples of the extortion emails, the DD4BC group demanded ransom ranging from 25 Bitcoins to 50 Bitcoins ($6,000 and $12,000 at current currency exchange rates).\n\n\u201cYour site is going under attack unless you pay 25 Bitcoin,\u201d one email stated. \u201cPlease note that it will not be easy to mitigate our attack, because our current UDP flood power is 400-500 Gbps, so don\u2019t even bother.\u201d\n\nThe attackers promise never to threaten the victim twice if they will pay the ransom.\n\n\u201cWe do bad things, but we keep our word.\u201d\n\nIn the case victims ignore the first message they will receive a subsequent email to warn them against ignoring the ransom demand.\n\n\u201cAnd you are ignoring us. Probably because you don\u2019t want to pay extortionists. And you believe that after sometime we will give up. But we never give up,\u201d the follow-up messages read.\n\nThe DD4BC group is considered very dangerous by Akamai, as explained by Lisa Beegle, manager at Akamai\u2019s Prolexic Security Engineering & Research Team (PLXsert).\n\n\u201cThis group has definitely followed through\u201d Beegle says. \u201cIf an organization gets a note [from DD4BC], they should take it seriously,\u201d\n\nAkamai analyzed the \u201cfire\u201d capability of the DD4BC group, the experts speculate that the average organization has a 10 Gbps pipeline for this reason they exclude crooks  have the ability to launch the 400 to 500 Gbps attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DD4BC group, DDoS)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/akamai", "topic_name": "Akamai"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dd4bc-group", "topic_name": "DD4BC group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/extortion", "topic_name": "extortion"}]}, {"news_name": "Turla APT Group Abusing Satellite Internet Links", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40008/cyber-crime/turla-apt-abusing-satellite.html", "title": "Turla APT Group Abusing Satellite Internet Links\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 10, 2015", "body": "According to a new analysis published by the experts at Kaspersky Lab reported that the popular Turla APT group exploited poorly secured satellite infrastructure to hide command-and-control operations.\n\nTurla APT was active in the last decade, security experts consider it a state-sponsored group of Russian hackers involved in long-running espionage campaigns.\n\nThe Turla APT hit more than 500 victims in 45 different countries worldwide, government agencies, military and diplomatic entities are privileged targets of the group.\n\n\n\nThe exploitation of satellite-based Internet connections offers some important advantages, such as making it difficult to identify the threat actors and the location of the C&C server.\n\nAnother advantage for the usage of hijacked downstream-only links is the low cost, nearly $1,000 a year, the bad actors use them to control the infected machine.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s valuable because the true location and hardware of the C&C server cannot be easily determined or physically seized. Satellite-based Internet receivers can be located anywhere within the area covered by a satellite, and this is generally quite large. The method used by the Turla group to hijack the downstream links is highly anonymous and does not require a valid satellite Internet subscription.\n\nKaspersky explained that Turla APT used to hijack satellite DVB-S (digital video broadcasting satellite) links, in a way similar to the one presented at Black Hat in 2010. This technique requires minimal equipment including a satellite dish, a low-noise block downconverter, a dedicated DVB-S tuner on a PCIe card made by TBS Technologies, and a Linux PC.\n\n\u201cThe TBS card is particularly well-suited to this task because it has dedicated Linux kernel drivers and supports a function known as a brute-force scan which allows wide frequency ranges to be tested for interesting signals,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cOf course, other PCI or PCIe cards might work as well, while, in general the USB-based cards are relatively poor and should be avoided.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the disadvantage comes from the fact that satellite-based Internet is slow and can be unstable.\u201d states the reports.\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky speculates that the Turla APT group, like other APTs, turn to satellite-based Internet links for C&C for mainly to avoid botnet takedowns by law enforcement and ISPs.\n\n\n\nAs explained in the report, both the legitimate users and attackers use satellite communications pointing satellite dishes point to the specific satellite that is broadcasting the traffic. The principal problem when dealing with satellite communications is that packets are unencrypted allowing attackers to abuse communication channels.\n\n\u201cOnce an IP address that is routed through the satellite\u2019s downstream link is identified, the attackers start listening for packets coming from the internet to this specific IP,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cWhen such a packet is identified, for instance a TCP/IP SYN packet, they identify the source and spoof a reply packet (e.g. SYN ACK) back to the source using a conventional Internet line.\u201d\n\nThe experts also highlighted that due to slow links, firewalls are recommended and used to simply DROP packets to closed ports instead sending back a RST or FIN packet to the source. This circumstance is exploited by attackers.\n\n\n\nThe Turla APT has been abusing DVB-S (digital video broadcasting satellite) Internet providers in the Middle East and Africa, because their satellite beams do not cover Europe or Asia, far from the prying eyes of security firms that could uncover their operations.\n\nThe use of satellite links to control botnet is not an exclusive of the Turla APT, researchers observed other APTs and security firms relying on satellites to manage their malware such as Rocket Kitten, Xumuxu, and the Italian Hacking Team.\n\nEnjoy the report!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013Turla APT, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satellite", "topic_name": "Satellite"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/turla", "topic_name": "Turla"}]}, {"news_name": "Israel is the main source of cyber attacks on Iran", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40004/intelligence/iran-cyber-security.html", "title": "Israel is the main source of cyber attacks on Iran\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 9, 2015", "body": "According to a recent report, more than 10,000 Internet security attacks are detected by cyber security experts in Iran every day, a country that is spending a significant effort to improve its cyber capabilities.\n\nIn March 2015, The British Business Insider published an interesting post on the Iranian cyber capabilities, according to the experts the Government of Teheran is improving expertise in the cyber domain faster than experts \u2018would have ever imagined,\u2019 increasing cyber-security spending 12-fold since 2013.\n\n\n\nToday Iran ranks 19th in terms of cyber security on a global scale, the country has accomplished only 39 percent of a target 53 percent of its Information Security Management System (ISMS) and 20 percent of a target 100 percent for launching a national Security Operation Center SOC.\n\nThe situation presented by the Iranian experts is worrying, according to the cyber security experts of the country. The country is a privileged target of foreign spies and hackers, despite the significant commitment to cyber security of the Government of Teheran, the national infrastructure still suffers the foreign offensive.\n\nAccording to the Iranian authorities, the Stuxnet attack in September 2013 infected more that 30,000 machines completely changing the perception of cyber threat of the central Government.\n\nThe last attack in order of time attributed by the Iranian authorities to state-sponsored hackers relied on the Dino malware, a malicious agent that targeted most systems of the country.\n\nIn July, ESET published a detailed analysis of the Dino malware, the ESET researcher Joan Calvet has detected a single sample of Dino in the wild that was used in an attempt to infect a target in Iran in 2013.\n\n\u201cDino is so hard to find because the group behind the Animal Farm is really good at targeting people precisely, and we basically miss a lot of their samples,\u201d Calvet told\n\nDino is a modular malware, a number of components allow it to carry out several tasks for cyber espionage operations.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t surprise that most cyber-attacks against Iran are launched from Israel as explained by the IT Minister Mahmoud Vaezi.\n\n\u201cIT Minister Mahmoud Vaezi has said most of cyber-attacks against Iran are launched from Israel. According to Vaezi, a number of Western and Arab countries rank behind Israel in launching cyber-attacks on Iran.\u201d reported the Trend News Agency.\n\nBehnaz Arya, director of the Cyberspace Security Exchange Department of the Tehran Computer Guild, explained that budget assigned to research and development is not adequate to meet requirements of the country and to reach the goal established by the government cyber strategy.\n\nAccording to Arya, the lack of awareness at the organizational level is the principal cause for critical security issues for the posture of the country in the cyberspace.\n\nHossein Samimi, director of the Technological Development at the Ministry of IT, explained that despite banking systems are the critical infrastructure of the county, In Iran banking facilities given to the cyber security section last year comprised 19.5 percent of the entire facilities given to IT companies.\n\nI was personally convinced that the Iranian Government will continue to grow in term of cyber security, reaching the goals of confirming itself as one of the most dangerous countries in the cyberspace.\n\nLet me close with a consideration \u2026. 10,000 Internet security attacks per day are probably the tip of the iceberg, numerous APT campaigns are still going undetected.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013Iran, cyber security)\n\n[adrotate banner=\u201d13\u2033\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dino", "topic_name": "Dino"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/soc", "topic_name": "SOC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "MassVet finds unknown malicious apps in app stores in 10 Sec", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39762/malware/massvet-android-scan.html", "title": "MassVet finds unknown malicious apps in app stores in 10 Sec\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 1, 2015", "body": "A group of University researchers has created a new method for detecting malicious apps running on an Android devices called MassVet. MassVet doesn\u2019t use the old method of signatures scanning, instead it compares legitimate Android frameworks to establish those that are malicious.\n\nThe architecture behind MassVet can be seen below:\n\n\n\nThe authors argue that MassVet is able to identify a malicious app in less than 10 seconds and with a low probability of false positives:\n\n \u201d Unlike existing detection mechanisms, which often utilize heavyweight program analysis techniques, our approach simply compares a submitted app with all those already on a market, focusing on the difference between those sharing a similar UI structure (indicating a possible repackaging relation), and the commonality among those seemingly unrelated. Once public libraries and other legitimate code reuse are removed, such diff/common program components become highly suspicious. This analysis is made scalable by its simple, static nature and the feature projection techniques that enable a cloud-based, fast search for view/code differences and similarities.\u201d wrote the researchers in the paper they published.\n\nThe researchers argue that this new method can help do find a Zero-day malware, but criticized Google for only ban a player that releases malicious payload, and not blocking a malicious payload, what leads to other people reusing the malicious payload:\n\n\u201cAnother interesting finding is that we saw that some of these developers uploaded the same or similar malicious apps again after they were removed. Actually, among the 2125 reappeared apps, 604 confirmed malware (28.4 percent) showed up in the Play Store unchanged, with the same MD5 and same names. Further, those developers also published 829 apps with the same malicious code (as that of the malware) but under different names. The fact that the apps with known malicious payloads still got slipped in suggests that Google might not pay adequate attention to even known malware.\u201d\n\nThe MassVet implements a comparison algorithm, but on top of that uses a difference and similarities comparison mechanism, which allows it to be more efficient and \u201csmart.\u201d\n\n\n\nMassVet analyzed around 1.2 million apps deployed in 33 Android apps stores discovering 127.429 malicious apps, 30.552 are hosted in Google Play.\n\nThe disconcerting aspect of the story is that many of these apps weren\u2019t recognized by common antivirus solutions available in the market.\n\n\u201cWe observed that most scanners react slowly to the emergence of new malware. For all 91,648 malicious apps confirmed by VirusTotal, only 4.1% were alarmed by at least 25 out of 54 scanners it hosts. The results are present in Figure 7. This finding also demonstrates the capability of MassVet to capture new malicious content missed by most commercial scanners. \u201c\n\n\n\nProjects like this one, are important and help the security community in discovering quickly the malicious apps that are deployed in app stores.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to paper published by the researchers.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 MassVet, Android)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mass-vetting", "topic_name": "Mass Vetting"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/massvet", "topic_name": "MassVet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "Report: How Iranian hackers attempt to takeover your Gmail", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39690/cyber-crime/iranian-hackers-gmail.html", "title": "Report: How Iranian hackers attempt to takeover your Gmail\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 30, 2015", "body": "According to a report published by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs, Iranian hackers have elaborated a sophisticated phishing scheme to circumvent security measures that defend Gmail accounts.\n\nThe attack scheme is not new, it was used by hackers in targeted attacks on financial institutions in the past.\n\nThe Iranian hackers used phone and email to bypass Google\u2019s two-factor authentication system and take over the victim\u2019s Gmail account.\n\n\u201cThis report describes an elaborate phishing campaign against targets in Iran\u2019s diaspora, and at least one Western activist. The ongoing attacks attempt to circumvent the extra protections conferred by two-factor authentication in Gmail, and rely heavily on phone-call based phishing and \u201creal time\u201d login attempts by the attackers. Most of the attacks begin with a phone call from a UK phone number, with attackers speaking in either English or Farsi.\u201d states the authors of the report.\n\n\u201cIt may be that, as a growing number of potential targets have begun using two-factor authentication on their email accounts out of a concern for their security, politically motivated attackers are borrowing from a playbook that financial criminals have written over the past decade,\u201d state the authors of the report.\n\nThe attacks appear to be politically motivated, according to the senior research fellow at the Citizen Lab, John Scott-Railton, the list of targets includes a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Iranian activists.\n\nAccording to security researchers, the Iranian government has increased its cyber capabilities in a significant way in the last years, for this reason US intelligence consider the country one of the most dangerous threats alongside with Russia, China and North Korea.\n\nAccording to  the research firm Small Media, Iran increased cyber-security spending 12-fold since President Hassan Rouhani gained power in 2013. I suggest you to give a look to the report released by experts at Small Media. Vowing to ramp up the country\u2019s cyber capabilities, Rouhani has given the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) an annual cybersecurity budget of roughly $19.8 million.\n\nThe recently observed attacks on Gmail accounts start with text messages that pretend to be sent from Google. The messages warn users that of unauthorized access to their Gmail accounts.\n\n\n\nThen the attackers would send a fake \u201cpassword-reset\u201d email that redirect victims to bogus \u201cpassword reset page,\u201d in reality the password reset pages are used to collect the victim\u2019s password.\n\nThe attack is called \u201creal time\u201d attack, it attempts to phish both the user password and the 2FA one-time code used by Google.  The reset pages simulate the Gmail 2-step login process to the victim. The attacker uses the victim\u2019s input, to login in real time to Gmail.  The attacker\u2019s login attempt triggers Google to send a genuine 2FA code to the victim, which inserts it in the fraudulent page too. At this point, the attack bypasses the 2FA implemented by Google.\n\nThe attackers also use the phone to carry out the attack, in this second attack scenario the victims receive a phone call regarding a fake business proposal. The proposal would be sent to the target\u2019s Gmail account with a fake Google Drive link that would display victims a bogus Gmail login page implementing a classic phishing scheme.\n\n\u201cEntering text into the login page and clicking on \u201cView Document\u201d yields a fake 2FA authentication page.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn some attacks, the attackers tried to deceive victims by pretending to Reuters journalists who wanted to arrange an interview.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of exposure to such attacks I always suggest to enable two-factor authentication for every online service that implements it.\n\nExperts suggest that an easy way to discover the fake password reset pages is to check the URL searching for the https:// prefix, unfortunately I remind you that this isn\u2019t a complete defense against phishing attacks because this kind of offensive is also exploiting HTTPs connections.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Gmail, Iran)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gmail", "topic_name": "Gmail"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/two-factor-authentication", "topic_name": "two-factor authentication"}]}, {"news_name": "Symantec discovered 49 New Modules of the Regin espionage platform", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39647/cyber-crime/symantec-49-new-regin-modules.html", "title": "Symantec discovered 49 New Modules of the Regin espionage platform\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 28, 2015", "body": "In November 2014, security experts at Symantec have uncovered the backdoor Regin, a highly advanced spying tool used in cyber espionage campaigns against governments and infrastructure operators. \n\nThe Regin malware has been around since at least 2008,that most Regin infections were observed in Russia (28%) and Saudi Arabia (24%), but other attacks were spotted in Iran, Ireland, India, Afghanistan, Austria, Belgium,  Mexico, and Pakistan.\n\nThe Regin platform has a modular structure that allows its operators to add new malicious components that implement new functionalities according to the target to attack.\n\nRegin is considered by many researchers the most sophisticated espionage tools discovered to date, it implements a six-stage architecture as reported in the following image.\n\n\n\nThe Regin is structured into six stages, each of which is encrypted, except for the first one, which is used to launch the initial loader. The execution of the first stage triggers a domino chain in which at each step the stage is decrypted and executed, and that in turn decrypts the successive stage, and so on.\n\n\n\nPart of the intelligence community has linked the Regin malware to the Five Eyes alliance, experts found alleged referenced to the super spyware in a number of presentations leaked by Edward Snowden and according to malware researchers it has been used in targeted attacks against government agencies in the EU and the Belgian telecoms company Belgacom.\n\nNow Symantec revealed that its researchers have uncovered 49 new modules, the total number of components discovered since the initial discovery is 75.\n\n\u201cAs outlined in an updated technical whitepaper, Symantec has found 49 new modules, bringing the total number of Regin modules uncovered to 75. This remains an incomplete list. A number of other Regin payloads are known to exist since some modules analyzed contain references to them.\u201d states a blog post published by Symantec.\n\nThe newly discovered modules can be used for espionage purposes, they implement logging, keylogging, impersonation functionalities and other exfiltration methods.\n\nThe analysis of these modules led the experts to speculate that many other modules belonging the Regin platform exist.\n\nThe researchers at Symantec revealed that Regin has an extensive command and control (C&C) infrastructure that relies on peer-to-peer (P2P) communications between infected machines.\n\n\u201cSymantec has found an extensive command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure supporting Regin infections. The attackers have devised a complex system for communication with C&C servers, in which traffic is relayed through a network of Regin-infected computers. Compromised computers can act as a proxy for other infected computers and peer-to-peer (P2P) communications are used.\u201d states the post. \u201cThis P2P capability allows the attackers to maintain deep access to critical assets within compromised organizations and mask core infrastructure belonging to the group. Traffic between nodes can be configured to match expected protocols based on where the nodes are placed on a network, adding a further degree of stealth to communications.\u201d\n\nThe experts highlighted the existence of a custom-built remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism that enables the attackers to remotely install, update, and configure modules.\n\n\u201cThe RPC mechanism allows for procedure calls to be made locally and across the network of Regin-infected computers. Operators can directly call any procedure on the Regin network to remotely control, install, or update modules, or change module configuration by replacing EVFS files.\u201d\n\nThe most interesting aspect of the new findings it that threat actors is still operating the Regin platform upgrading its powerful espionage spyware.\n\n\u201cDespite the threat\u2019s exposure last year, it is unlikely that the group behind this malware has ceased operations,\u201d reported Symantec. \u201cIts track record and available resources mean it is probable that the group will re-equip itself with a new threat or upgrade Regin in a bid to evade detection.

Table 1 lists all the anonymous marketplaces for which we have data. We scraped 35 different marketplaces a total of 1,908 times yielding a dataset of 3.2 TB in size. The total number of pages obtained from each scrape ranged from 27 to 331,691 pages and performing each scrape took anywhere from minutes up to five days. The sheer size of the data corpus we are considering, as well as other challenging factors (e.g., hidden service latency and poor marketplace availability) led us to devise a custom web scraping framework built on top of Scrapy [3] and Tor [16], which we discuss first. We then highlight how we decide to parse (or ignore) marketplaces, before touching on validation techniques we use to ensure soundness of our analysis.\u201d explained the researchers in the paper.\n\n\n\nThe author considered feedbacks left by sellers a significant element for the analysis of every transaction, some dark marketplaces make leaving these reviews mandatory, a useful information to estimate the overall amount of money resulting from the sales.\n\n\u201cWhile we can not directly measure the money being transacted from buyers to sellers, or packages being shipped from vendors to customers, we do make frequent observations of product feedback left for particular item listings on the marketplaces,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThey found that before Operation Onymous, major dark marketplaces such as Silk Road 2, Agora, Evolution, Hydra and Pandora raked from $300,000 to $500,000 a day on average, with the peak going up to $650,000.\n\n\u201cAt its height, I think Silk Road 2 was probably the most successful one. In February 2014 it was clearing around $400,000 [a day],\u201d Christin told Motherboard in a phone interview.\n\nDespite the figures are significant, the majority of vendors on the dark marketplaces wasn\u2019t getting rich. The study confirmed the resilience of the online black marketplace ecosystem to the action of law enforcement.\n\nA number of products were common to the various black marketplaces including cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine and related products that consistently account for about 70% of all sales. Analyzing the vendors, the researchers discovered that some of them was highly specialized and focused on a single product, other offered a large number of different products.\n\n\u201cWe also discover that vendor population has long-tail characteristics: while a few vendors are (or were) highly successful, the vast majority of vendors grossed less than $10,000\u201d states the experts \u201cAbout 70 percent of all sellers never managed to sell more than $1,000 worth of products,\u201d the study reads. \n\nThe data related the volume per vendor shows that 18 percent made between $1,000 and $10,000, and only two percent cracked the $100,000 mark.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout 70% of all sellers never managed to sell more than $1,000 worth of products. Another 18% of sellers were observed to sell between $1,000 and $10,000 but only about 2% of vendors managed to sell more than $100,000.\u201d continues the study.\n\nThirty-five sellers were selling over $1 million worth of product, and the top one percent of vendors made up over half of all the volume transacted.\n\n\u201cIn fact, 35 sellers were observed selling over $1,000,000 worth of product and the top 1% most successful vendors were responsible for 51.5% of all the volume transacted. Some of these sellers, like \u201cSuperTrips\u201d (or to a lesser extent, \u201cNod\u201d) from Silk Road, have been arrested, and numbers released in connection with these arrests are consistent with our findings\u201d.\n\nThere are no doubts, online dark marketplaces are efficient facilitators for the sale of drugs that will continue to generate millions of dollars of revenue.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 dark marketplaces, Deep Web)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-marketplaces", "topic_name": "dark marketplaces"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-web", "topic_name": "Deep Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drugs", "topic_name": "Drugs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-onymous", "topic_name": "Operation Onymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/silk-road", "topic_name": "Silk Road"}]}, {"news_name": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 21 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39233/cyber-crime/security-affairs-newsletter-21.html", "title": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 21 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 9, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again thank you!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Newsletter, SecurityAffairs)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}]}, {"news_name": "Hackers are targeting Gas Tanks worldwide", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39190/hacking/hacking-gas-tanks-worldwide.html", "title": "Hackers are targeting Gas Tanks worldwide\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 7, 2015", "body": "Security researchers at Trend Micro, Kyle Wilhoit and Stephen Hilt have discovered a number of cyber attacks attempting to hack and shut down gas tanks.\n\nThe researchers have set up honeypots to study the cyber attacks against vulnerable gas tank monitoring systems.\n\n\u201cWe found that GasPot (gas monitoring honeypot) systems deployed in the US were deemed most attractive by attackers.

It is interesting to note that watering holes used by the hackers include a whitelist to run surgical attacks by ensuring that only staff from a target organisation are infected remaining under the radar for a long time.\n\nAnother peculiarity of the Panda Emissary group is the use of custom Microsoft Exchange backdoors and credential logger.

The experts have analyzed a number of cloud storage services including Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and Microsoft OneDrive.\n\nThe report shows how hackers exploit common file synchronization services for command and control (C&C) communications, remote access, data exfiltration and endpoint hacking by reconfiguring them.\n\nThe disconcerting consideration made the expert at Imperva is that attackers can gain access to file synchronization accounts without compromising victim\u2019s credentials.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the fundamentals, synchronization services of cloud storage services work in a simple as effective way, when users add a file to the local repository on their device, the content of the repository is automatically synchronized with the central hub of the service provider.\n\nTo improve the user experience, the applications don\u2019t require users to enter their account credentials each time the synchronization is performed, the service providers compensate with a transparent authentication mechanism that relies on a synchronization token.\n\nThe authentication token is usually stored in a file, a registry, or the Windows Credential Manager on the user\u2019s device, but obviously something is not working as it should!\n\n\n\nThe experts explained that even if the tokens are encrypted on the local device, hackers can easily access and decrypt them to synchronize any device with the victim\u2019s account.\n\nThe researchers have developed a tool to run Man-in-the-Cloud attacks through the manipulation of synchronization tokens, they explained that the tool can be delivered to the victim via phishing or drive-by download attacks.\n\nMan-in-the-Cloud attacks are easy to run, in some cases attacks can maintain access to the compromised account installing a backdoor, the access will be granted even after victims change their password.\n\nThe expert noticed that in the case of Dropbox, the authentication tokens not change even if the password is changed, meanwhile Google Drive revokes all tokens and requires users to re-authenticate each device using account credentials following a password reset.\n\nMan-in-the-Cloud attacks are particularly difficult to track because the malicious code is typically not left running on the targeted machine and data traffic to/from the cloud architecture normally doesn\u2019t raise any suspicion.\n\nAccording to Imperva, threat actors are already running Man-in-the-Cloud attack in the wild, last year expert at Blue Coat uncovered the Inception Operation and recently researchers at FireEye described the HAMMERTOSS attacks that involved the use of Twitter and GitHub for C&C communications, and cloud storage services for data exfiltration.\n\nLet me suggest the reading the Imperva\u2019s Hacker Intelligence Initiative report on Man-in-the-Cloud attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Man-in-the-Cloud, cloud)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Interpol is training Police officers to fight crime on the Darknet", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39096/cyber-crime/interpol-darknet-training.html", "title": "Interpol is training Police officers to fight crime on the Darknet\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 4, 2015", "body": "Cybercrime becomes even more sophisticated and explores new technologies for its illegal activities.

APT29 tries to undermine the detection of the malware by adding layers of obfuscation and mimicking the behavior of legitimate users. HAMMERTOSS uses Twitter, GitHub, and cloud storage services to relay commands and extract data from compromised networks.\u201d states the report from FireEye.\n\nThe hackers include the command for Hammertoss instances in a tweet containing a URL and a hashtag. The URL leads to an image on a different server that contains data hidden through a steganographic technique.\n\n\n\nThe hashtag is used to encode the file size of the image and a few characters that should be added to the decryption key stored within Hammertoss in order to allow the extraction of the hidden data.\n\n\u201cThe HAMMERTOSS backdoor generates and looks for a different Twitter handle each day. It uses an algorithm to generate the daily handle, such as \u201c234Bob234\u201d, before attempting to visit the corresponding Twitter page. If the threat group has not registered that day\u2019s handle, HAMMERTOSS will wait until the next day and look for a different handle\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe experts noticed that APT 29 adopted several techniques to remain under the radar, for example Hammertoss is usually only active during the normal working day for infected organization, in this way the malicious traffic results quite difficult to detect.\n\nThe experts attributed Hammertoss to Russian hackers because it appears to be active during normal working hours in Moscow. The APT 29 did not work on Russian holidays.\n\nWho are the targets of the APT 29 hacking campaigns?\n\nExperts from FireEye speculate that APT 29 is primarily focused on compromising government organizations and collecting geopolitical information related to Russia, a circumstance that lead them to believe that it is a state-sponsored group.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we believe they are in some way associated with the Russian government or working with Russia,\u201d concludes the report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT 29,  state-sponsored hackers)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt-29", "topic_name": "APT 29"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Advertising hijacking made by Invisible rogue mobile apps are wasting petabytes of data a day", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38885/cyber-crime/mobile-advertising-hijacking.html", "title": "Advertising hijacking made by Invisible rogue mobile apps are wasting petabytes of data a day\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 27, 2015", "body": "Mobile Malware is growing and crooks are targeting the advertising industry with malicious codes able to redirect users to ad pages, this practice is known as Advertising hijacking. These \u201crogue mobile apps\u201d are wasting petabytes of data a day, and some researchers estimated that the phenomena are inflicting US$1 billion in damages this year.\n\nIt has been estimated that 5000 malicious mobile applications (IOS + Android) are presenting ads, with the scheme of hiding the ad and reload it without the user\u2019s knowledge, even if the users is not using the mobile application, generating revenues for fraudsters. This scheme is effective mainly because it simulates the human interaction.\n\nMike Andrews, Antoni Kolev, David Sendroff, and Matt Vella, researchers from New York outfit Forensiq explained that the \u201crogue mobile apps\u201d are generating 20 ads per minute (700 per hour), a legitimate app that serves some ads generates one ad every 1 minute.\n\nSo many ads are generating much traffic per day in mobile devices, and it\u2019s affecting around 15% of the apps in the market.\n\n \u201cFraudulent apps were observed selling traffic through most major ad exchanges and networks.

According to the investigators, the fraudsters diverted potentially millions of dollars in payments from over 2000 victims worldwide.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cAn Inside Look into the World of Nigerian Scammers,\u201d reveals the TTPs of a small group composed of at least four criminals living in Africa.\n\nThe experts discovered a unique C&C server behind the operation of the gang, the fraudsters always used the MWI exploit kit to forge malicious documents used by the gang to infect victims with keyloggers like HawkEye and KeyBase.\n\n\u201cThe cybercriminals behind this operation are located in Nigeria and are using malware as a component of their fraud scams. The group adopted the Microsoft Word Intruder (MWI) exploit kit 2 as one of its primary methods. It uses MWI to infect victims with HawkEye\u2014a commercial keylogger that has become well known due to its high rate of infection success across multiple industries 3\u2014and another keylogger called KeyBase.\u201d states the report.\n\nThe report revealed that the number of victims is 2328 across 54 countries, the majority are in India (45%), Indonesia (19%) and Vietnam (17%).\n\n\n\nAccording to the experts at FireEye the choice is not casual, the document used in the scam appear more credible to non-native English speakers in the Asian countries, the fraudsters also targeted individuals in those countries where they have bank accounts or can easily transfer money into said accounts.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen scammers search Google for email listings of trade show participants and suppliers or distributors of various goods. The scammers extract email addresses from these pages using email scraping tools. Of particular interest to them are email addresses from free email service providers\u201d states the report.\u201dThere are a few possible reasons for them to target free email accounts: n Fewer obstacles to spoof the email addresses. The scammers would not have to register a domain and set up an email server. A free email account might indicate that the user is not technically savvy or is a small business.\u201d\n\nThe report also revealed that hackers have poor technical skills so they search for help on the dark net.\n\n\u201cTo obtain exploits, crypters, infostealers and remote access tools (RATS), they access forums to inquire and search for malicious software\u2026We have observed several instances of the scammers interacting with tool providers. As these interactions show, the scammers are heavily reliant on third-party malicious tool developers to create and maintain their tools. They rely on these third-party tool providers to furnish them with documentation or tutorials on the tools, to create stealthy exploits, and to troubleshoot issues.\u201d\n\nThe way the fraudsters operate is simple as effective, once they have infected victim\u2019s machine, they monitor the keylog files for email accounts dealing with purchase transactions.\n\nOnce the criminals intercept a transaction they\u2019ll log into the victim account to impersonate him and they\u2019ll ask buyers to send the payment to an account they own.\n\nThey then instruct the money mule about the new transaction to manage.\n\nIn one case, the experts at FireEye observed one single transaction worth $1m.\n\n\u201cWith this single transaction, the scammer is slated to collect over $1 million. We believe that they launder their money through a few strategies such as buying gold and luxury items, or mixing the money they have obtained through these scams with money collected legitimately.\u201d states the report.\n\n\n\nIn order to avoid being victims of 419 scammers there are a few rules that could mitigate the exposure to fraudsters including the adoption of two-factor authentication for online accounts, never open attachments in unsolicited emails, pay attention to the source of emails, and always contact the buyer through another channel, for example on phone, before any transaction.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 419 scammers, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/419-scammers", "topic_name": "419 scammers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-net", "topic_name": "dark net"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/keylogger", "topic_name": "keylogger"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}]}, {"news_name": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 19 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38868/cyber-crime/security-affairs-newsletter-round-19-best-of-the-week-from-best-sources.html", "title": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 19 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 26, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again thank you!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Newsletter, SecurityAffairs)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/newsletter", "topic_name": "Newsletter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "All Smartwatches on the market are vulnerable to attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38837/hacking/smartwatches-hp-study.html", "title": "All Smartwatches on the market are vulnerable to attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 25, 2015", "body": "Today we talk about a great passion of mine, watches.

Babar was used to spy on several Iranian nuclear research institutes and universities, but it was used also to monitor activities of European financial institutions. The name Babar is reported in one of the documents leaked by Snowden, the secret slides produced by the Canadian intelligence agency linked Babar to the French Government.\n\n\n\nAlso the Casper malware was used by the hackers to compromise target systems, spy on them and drop other advanced persistent malware.\n\nNow, a researcher has found and analyzed a new member of the so-called \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d dubbed Dino which was detected for the first time in March 2014 when a French publication released Snowden\u2019s slides describing a campaign dubbed \u201cOperation Snowglobe.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral security firms, including ESET, Cyphort and G DATA, have analyzed in details the malware belonging the Animal Farm APT.\n\nThe connection between those pieces of malware and the group described in CSE slides has been convincingly established, for example by Paul Rascagn\u00e8res (G Data).\n\nThe arsenal of the Animal Farm includes Babar, EvilBunny, and Casper, but the list is long and NBot, Tafacalou (TFC / Transporter) and Dino are other malicious code used by the APT.\n\nESET published a detailed analysis of the Dino malware, the ESET researcher Joan Calvet has detected a single sample of Dino in the wild that was used in an attempt to infect a target in Iran in 2013.\n\n\u201cDino is so hard to find because the group behind the Animal Farm is really good at targeting people precisely, and we basically miss a lot of their samples,\u201d Calvet told\n\nDino is a modular malware, a number of components allow it to carry out several tasks, the agent is able to execute commands sent by C2C servers and Windows batch commands.\n\nThe malware is also able to search for specific files, upload files to the command and control (C&C) server, and download further files from the control architecture. The experts noticed that Dino can also schedule commands to be executed at a specified time, it is also able to kill processes and uninstall the malicious code from the infected system by avoiding to leave traces of its presence.\n\nExperts at Kaspersky explained that the Tafacalou malware is used by the Animal Farm APT to serve further sophisticated spyware like Babar and Dino.\n\nThe researchers discovered several similarities between the code of the Dino malware and other threats from the Animal Farm malware families. The experts highlighted that the developers of these malware families are French speakers.\n\n\u201cDino\u2019s binary contains a resource whose language code value is 1036. The original purpose of this language code is to allow developers to provide resources (menus, icons, version information\u2026) for different locations in the world in the corresponding language. Interestingly, when a developer does not manually specify the language code, the compiler sets it to the language of the developer\u2019s machine. So, which language corresponds to the value 1036, or 0x40c in hexadecimal? French (France).\u201d states the report published by the ESET.\n\nAnother anomaly discovered by researchers is the presence in the file path of the word \u201carithmetique,\u201d which is French for \u201carithmetic.\u201darithmetique,\u201d which is French for \u201carithmetic.\u201d\n\nExperts at ESET explained that the Dino malware, differently for other codes used by the Animal Farm APT, doesn\u2019t implement sophisticated anti-analysis techniques.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013Dino Malware, Animal Farm)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/animal-farm", "topic_name": "Animal Farm"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dino", "topic_name": "Dino"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/french-intelligence", "topic_name": "French Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 15 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38151/cyber-crime/security-affairs-newsletter-15.html", "title": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 15 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 28, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again thank you!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Newsletter, SecurityAffairs)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/newsletter", "topic_name": "Newsletter"}]}, {"news_name": "SEC investigates FIN4 hackers who target publicly traded firms", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/38118/cyber-crime/sec-investigates-fin4-hackers.html", "title": "SEC investigates FIN4 hackers who target publicly traded firms\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 26, 2015", "body": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched an investigation on the activities related to a hacking crew targeting executives at publicly traded firms.\n\nAccording to the Reuters, the SEC has contacted at least 8 public companies to gather information about the recent breaches that affected their organizations.\n\n\u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission has asked at least eight listed companies to provide details of their data breaches, one of the people said.

In simple words, Booters mean providers of botnet-for-hire service online \u2013 and they are in large numbers now on the deep market.\n\nDDos-for-hire costs only about $38 an hour on average, you can consider it more like smashing a whole elephant with an ant \u2013 considering the cost and size of damage it can do to the victim. No surprise, almost 40% network-layered attacks among all that happen are backed by these botnets. These attacks are subscription based, just like any other typical service being offered online, and anybody can launch several DDoS attacks on their target for just a dozens of dollars each month.\n\nNow, this surely can be played out in a way that we can\u2019t expect. Let\u2019s take the 17 year old Idaho teen case where an attack on the state\u2019s largest school (where teen studied, too) was launched. The attack continued for more than a week and of course, caused terrible issues to the concerning folks. The students working on school\u2019s standard achievement tests, lost their work completely, it also prevented teachers to get paid as the payroll system was blocked.\n\nAs being mentioned above, taking such attack\u2019s technique into consideration, these attacks are short-lived, but that pretty much suggest the impact of DDoS-for-hire attacks if continued. Yet, it\u2019s been reported that over 20% of network-layer attacks taking place online last for up to five days.\n\nIncapsula noted, \u201cOn one hand we observed long, complex, multiphase assaults that resemble advanced persistent threats (APT)\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese employ different methods and can last days, weeks and even months at time. On the other hand, we also noted a preponderance of rudimentary single-vector attacks usually lasting no longer than 30 minutes.\u201d he added. \n\nLarge scale attacks aren\u2019t that much common, and 253 Gbps was the biggest network attack being mitigated by Incapsula all through this last quarter. The report found that more than 56% among all of the network layer threats are driven by UDP flood attacks. Interesting, 8% our of these are SSDP-DDoS attacks that get launched from IOT (Internet of Things) devices.\n\n\n\nAnother interesting thing worth noting here is, the use of search engine impersonator-bots has been abandoned by the botnet operators. It declined from 57% according to figures from year 2014 to only 0.9% currently.\n\nThe report also suggests that attackers tend to hit back again and again onto the victims, and normally, an attack is launched again after 2 months. In almost 30% of the cases, the targets are hit even once every week. Overall, what we can learn from the research is the great threat that DDoS events are posing to the online businesses. Don\u2019t go far, only an hour of downtime can be enough to stress out a working business we believe.\n\nIncapsula noted, \u201cThe real-world cost of an unmitigated attack is $40,000 per hour\u201d. Adding further, \u201cImplications reach far beyond lost revenues to include loss of consumer trust, data theft, intellectual property loss, and more.\n\n\n\nToday, with a substantial percentage of attacks lasting for days, and half of all targets being repeatedly hit, a worst-case scenario entails losses of hundreds of thousands\u2014if not millions\u2014of dollars.\u201d\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

Each of these three e-commerce giants suffered over 20,000 phishing attacks against their respective services and brands. Together, these top three were the targets of nearly 54 percent of the world\u2019s phishing attacks. The next seven brands were targeted for a combined 23 percent of all phishing attacks \u2014 meaning the top 10 targets accounted for over three quarters of all phishing attacks observed worldwide. The number of times that the targets were attacked follows a long tail. Half of the targets were attacked four or fewer times during the six-month period (up from three times in 1H2014). One hundred and fifty-eight targets were attacked only once each in the period.\u201d\n\nOther interesting trends highlighted in the Global Phishing Survey 2H2014 report are:\n\n\n\nThat proves that \u201cThese show criminals seeking the credentials of consumers in places where consumers may least expect it. Phishers target wide-ranging targets for several reasons. One is to perform credit card theft, and hitting new targets may lull consumers into a false sense of security. The phishers can also monetize stolen data through reshipping fraud, a tactic that remains popular. Phishers also steal usernames and passwords from one site in order to try those credential on other sites. Many consumers re-use usernames and passwords, and this poor habit can be costly. If a site is getting phished for the first time, it may have been targeted by a more sophisticated phisher, who had the skill to design a new phishing template.\u201d\n\nYou can check the full Global Phishing Survey 2H2014 report here:\n\nhttp://apwg.org/download/document/245/APWG_Global_Phishing_Report_2H_2014.pdf\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APWG Global Phishing Survey 2H2014 ,  phishing)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anti-phishing-working-group", "topic_name": "Anti-Phishing Working Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apwg", "topic_name": "APWG"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/h2-2014", "topic_name": "H2 2014"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 11 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37373/cyber-crime/security-affairs-newsletter-11.html", "title": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 11 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 31, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again thank you!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Newsletter, SecurityAffairs)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/newsletter", "topic_name": "Newsletter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Ponemon Institute \u2013 Cost of data breach reaches record levels", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37259/security/ponemon-cost-data-breach.html", "title": "Ponemon Institute \u2013 Cost of data breach reaches record levels\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 28, 2015", "body": "Every year, I propose you the findings of the report published by the Ponemon Institute related the evolution of the cost of a data breach, a very interesting study that provides an economic approach to the concept of \u201cdata breach\u201d, which is essential every time you will have to speak about cyber security to the company executives. This year the researchers at the Ponemon Institute have analyzed results of 350 companies in 11 countries, every company surveyed had suffered a breach over the past year.\n\nAccording to the report just released by IBM and the Ponemon Institute, the per-record cost of a data breach reached $154 this year, which represents a maximum value that is up 12 percent from last year ($145).\n\nAs already observed in the previous editions of the study, data breach costs varied dramatically by geography and by industry, the US had the highest per-record cost ($217), followed by Germany ($211).\n\n\n\nThe health care industry suffered the highest costs that were estimated at an average of $363 per record, a data that doesn\u2019t surprise the experts due to the higher value of medical records respect credit card data.\n\n\n\nA set of complete health insurance credentials sold for $20 on the underground markets in 2013 \u2014 10 to 20 times the price of a U.S. credit card number with a security code, according to Dell.\n\nCaleb Barlow, vice president at IBM Security, explained that data in a medical record have a much longer shelf life than that of a credit card number.\n\n\u201cWith credit cards, the time frame from the breach to mitigation is very short,\u201d Barlow explained. \u201cBut the health care record can be used to establish access in perpetuity,\u201d \u201cit can be used to establish credit or steal your identity ten or fifteen years from now,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce this information is out there, you can\u2019t get the genie back in the bottle.\u201d\n\nAnother alarming result of the Ponemon report is the average total cost of a single data breach which it jumped $3.79 million thus registering an increase of 23 percent.\n\nThe analysis of the cost of a data breach reveals that \u201cLoss of business\u201d was a significant part of the total cost of a data breach.\n\nThe study analyzed also other factors that could influence the cost of a data breach, such as the availability of an incident response team that could help to promptly mitigate the incident and reduce per-record cost by $12.60. Other factors are the adoption of encryption mechanisms (cost reduction by $12), employee training (cost reduction by $8) and CISO leadership (cost reduction by $5.60).\n\n\u201cCompanies that have thought about this ahead of time, that had their board involved, that had insurance protection, that had practiced what they would do, they had a much lower cost per breach,\u201d said Barlow. \u201cThis is really compelling. We have tangible evidence that those who were doing that had a much lower costs. You don\u2019t have days to respond \u2014 you don\u2019t even have hours. You have minutes to get your act together.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, factors that increased costs was the involvement of a third party in the cause of a breach ($16 per record), the outsourcing ($4.50 per record) and the loss or theft of company devices ($9 per record).\n\n\n\nThe cost of a data breach increases with the time necessary to mitigate the incident, on average, it took respondents 256 days to spot a breach caused by a threat actor  and 82 days to contain it.\n\nBelow there are the key findings of the Ponemon report:\n\nEnjoy the report, it is full of interesting data.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Cost of data breach, cyber security)\n\n \n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Linux-based Moose worm turns routers into social network bots", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37245/hacking/linux-moose-worm-hit-soho.html", "title": "Linux-based Moose worm turns routers into social network bots\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 27, 2015", "body": "ESET released a study about a new malware known as Moose worm that is compromising devices that have a weak or default credentials.

Once it [finds] a good username and password combination, the malware will fetch commands from a command and control server that will complete the infection by downloading an executable tailored to the infected platform and executing it.\u201d\n\nHow to prevent your router from getting infected by Moose worm?\n\nI think that malware like the Moose worm can become a serious threat for IoT devices, since all smart objects are always online and connected to peers.\n\nIt\u2019s also important that router/device vendors give more importance to the security of their equipment ( as I said and other articles).\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Moose worm, SOHO devices)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/eset", "topic_name": "Eset"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/moose-worm", "topic_name": "Moose worm"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/routers", "topic_name": "routers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/soho-devices", "topic_name": "SOHO devices"}]}, {"news_name": "Frustrating Revelations about Zero-Day Threats and Their Lack of Detection for 2 Whole Months", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37195/malware/zero-day-lack-of-detection.html", "title": "Frustrating Revelations about Zero-Day Threats and Their Lack of Detection for 2 Whole Months\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 26, 2015", "body": "Symantec and the recently published Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR) have made a truly frustrating revelation as to the time period, in which zero-day threats remain undetected. Whereas in 2013 this time period has been less than four days, it seems that the time now has multiplied by a lot.  Indeed, such vulnerabilities remain unresolved for about 59 days and this is really shocking news to grasp. The software companies involved in the patching of these vulnerabilities had to spend a lot of time and nearly reached two whole months until they were able to deal with the threat effectively.\n\n\n\nThe hackers and the ones pulling off the attack were greatly benefited by the time period that was significantly longer than expected and they exploited the vulnerabilities to a huge extent (like in the example of Heartbleed Bug). One thing that has drawn great attention to this specific report is the acknowledgement that such attacks have been astonishingly precise and to the point, as they required fewer emails and they resulted in more significant breaches. Other problems that emerged included the use of a compromised email to reach other, more important business emails, as well as the creation of customized attack software upon the penetration to the targeted system for further access and flexibility.\n\nAlongside email scams and targets, nowadays hackers have also focused on mobile devices and social media. These are two new and profitable options for them, which they are not willing to give up that easily. In order for both businesses and individuals to remain protected in such a hostile environment, it makes total sense that the proper knowledge and the right tools are set into motion. Let\u2019s have a look at what you ought to pay attention to, so as to get the maximum benefits out of the web and minimize, if not eliminate the threats deriving from zero-day vulnerabilities:\n\nGiven the severity of the problems that a lot of businesses and individuals have to tackle with regarding Internet Security, you should structure a strategy that highlights the dangers and that suggests solutions.

the recent string of high-profile cyberattacks plaguing companies worldwide, the retail industry is still behind on cybersecurity standards, according to new reports published by Arbor Networks and the Ponemon Institute.\n\nResearchers disclosed it takes retailers on average, 197 days to identify if the company has been breached by a potential threat and took companies an additional 39 days to properly mitigate it. In addition, Arbor Networks released information on financial service organizations, reporting it took roughly 98 days to identify the breach and another 26 days to contain it.\n\n\n\nAccording to the firm, retailers often identify breaches due to \u201ca gut feeling.\u201d Further research identified 23 percent of breached retailers used forensic evidence, 21 percent used attack signatures,\n\nwhile 16 percent had used threat intelligence that had been shared by industry experts. Though a vast majority of retailers, some 38 percent, said they simply had a gut feeling. The same survey in the finance industry revealed 34% identify breaches based on forensic evidence, 23% signatures, 25% public/known threats, with a staggering 20% stated the same gut feeling.\n\nReports also reveal retailers and finance industries spent roughly 22 percent of their security budget on \u201ccyber kill chain activities,\u201d where companies mitigate a threat before it occurs, ranging anywhere from nabbing the attackers first steps or just before their inevitable goal.\n\nRetailers and financial industry experts shared the same fear in securing information, noting their companies lacked confidence in their ability to identify threats. Only 58 percent of financial organizations said their security teams had been effective at identifying and eradicating advanced threats. Retailers scored a similar number, with just over half being effective while the other half said their team was not.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the reasons you see them looking at more people-based\u201d solutions, says Arabella Hallawell, vice president of corporate strategy at Arbor Networks.\n\nSecurity experts believe companies are veering away from previous signature-based threat models and are moving to hire industry experts with vast knowledge in cybersecurity\n\n. Though industry experts are in short supply, retailers on average have around 11 employees responding to security alerts,  while financial organizations have roughly 19 employees\u2019.\n\nAs seen with recent breaches of massive retailers and financial organizations, it can take some companies, such as Target, only a few weeks to identify a security breach, where it could take numerous high-profile financial institutions over a year and a half to identify security breaches.\n\nSecurity breaches pose an extreme threat to any industry, but retail and financial organizations are used by millions and have the largest public target on their back.

These injectors get their victims in different ways, and the report mention that was found 50870 Chrome extensions and 34000 software applications with unwanted ad injectors. The experts reported that the highest concentration of injection on global scale was observed in South America, South Asia, and South East Asia.\n\n\u201cUpwards of 30% of these packages were outright malicious and simultaneously stole account credentials, hijacked search queries, and reported a user\u2019s activity to third parties for tracking,\u201d \u201cIn total, we found 5.1% of page views on Windows and 3.4% of page views on Mac that showed tell-tale signs of ad injection software.\u201d said Kurt Thomas. \u201cNext, this software is distributed by a network of affiliates that work to drive as many installs as possible via tactics like: marketing, bundling applications with popular downloads, outright malware distribution, and large social advertising campaigns,\u201d \u201cAffiliates are paid a commission whenever a user clicks on an injected ad.

The group behind Operation Pawn is allegedly linked to government of Russia, and has been operating since 2007. The main targets of this hacking group include defence industry, military, government organizations and the media firms.\n\nFeike Hacquebord, Trend Micro\u2019s senior threat researcher blogged, \u201cThe first quarter of 2015 has seen a great deal of activity from the group\u201d. He further added, \u201cMost notably this involved setting up dozens of exploit URLs and a dozen new command-and-control (C&C) servers targeting NATO members and governments in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe group makes use of three different types of strategies to launch the attack on targets. One among those three is, spear-phishing where emails having malicious MS office docs laced alongside the Sofacy/SEDNIT malware\n\nare sent to the target. Another strategy being used works as sending phishing emails out that redirects users to the fake OWA (Microsoft Outlook Web Access) login pages. Third way with which they attack on target is, infecting Polish government legitimate sites which then leads victims to aforementioned malware.\n\nFeike Hacquebord stated in his blog post that, \u201cIn a slightly different modus operandi from the usual, we observed Pawn Storm attackers sending out specially-crafted emails designed to trick users into clicking on a malicious link,\u201d.  Adding things further to it, a paragraph from him blog post reads as,\n\n\u201cIn one case, the subject of the spam e-mail is the Southern Gas Corridor that the European Union initiated to become less dependent on Russian Gas. Other e-mails have similar geopolitical subjects, for example the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the Open Skies Consultative Commission of the OSCE.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen certain criteria are met the fake news site may respond with a message that an HTML5 plugin has to be installed to view the contents of the site,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe add-on in question turns out to be a version of X-Agent or Fysbis spyware if you\u2019re a Linux user, and Sednit if you\u2019re running Windows.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome reports even state that, White House is one of the organizations that got attacked by the group. On Jan 26, attackers also targeted three very popular Youtube Bloggers making use of phishing attacks on Gmail \u2013 states the report being issued by Trend Micro.\n\nFeike Hacquebord also blogged, \u201cThis is a classic island hopping technique, in which attackers focus their efforts not on the actual target but on companies or people that might interact with that target, but which may have weaker security in place\u201d.  The Trend Micro researcher added further, \u201cIn a similar way, a well-known military correspondent for a large US newspaper was hit via his personal email address in December 2014, probably leaking his credentials. Later that month Operation Pawn Storm attacked around 55 employees of the same newspaper on their corporate accounts.\u201d\n\nThe group also targeted iOS based devices to infect users with their malware, just recently!\n\nFeike Hacquebord added, \u201cOrganizations must remain on high alert for these kinds of attack, as Operation Pawn Storm hackers go to great lengths to make their emails appear legitimate,\u201d\n\nWhat Trend Micro suggested in their blog post is worth taking into serious consideration.

They are comparable to a complex network in which each system runs its software component that could be compromised exactly like the information exchanged by the parts. Many investigators revealed that an attacker with a deep knowledge of the plane\u2019s system could intentionally cause serious problems with its normal operation.\n\n\u201cThe experts said that if the cabin systems connect to the cockpit avionics systems (e.g., share the same physical wiring harness or router) and use the same networking platform, in this case IP, a user could subvert the firewall and access the cockpit avionics system from the cabin,\u201d\n\nBy the fact that nowadays everyone uses smartphones/tablets, things got even worse,\n\n\u201cThe presence of personal smartphones and tablets in the cockpit increases the risk of a system\u2019s being compromised by trusted insiders, both malicious and non-malicious, if these devices have the capability to transmit information to aircraft avionics systems,\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne cybersecurity expert noted that a virus or malware planted in websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attacker to access the IP-connected onboard information system through their infected machines.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe can agree that until now we haven\u2019t seen any attack to an aircraft coming from \u201coutside\u201d of \u201cinside\u201d, but the real threat exists we there is the need to avoid this, to never happen.\n\nIn 2013, a security consultant Hugo Teso was able to prove the point, and demonstrated how from smartphone he exploited the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast navigation system, as well the plane\u2019s Flight Management System.\n\n\n\nAfter this demonstration of the used method, the vulnerability was patched. The report also says that the FAA is taking steps to have better cyber security policies, for that a group of experts are working together and it\u2019s expected to have a draft in Sep2015 that will provide a guide to how restructure the IT infrastructure.\n\nConcluding, I think that there are yet some steps to be done until we can feel safer when entering and traveling in an airplane and cyber security should be a vector of investment, where there is the need to create more strict regulations, certification standards, proprietary technologies, etc. etc., but all needs time.\n\nI look forward seeing what improvements will be done in the industry in the next years, for the flight safety and cyber security of in-board systems.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Flight, hacking, GAO)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gao", "topic_name": "GAO"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/government-accountability-office", "topic_name": "Government Accountability Office"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hugo-teso", "topic_name": "Hugo Teso"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wi-fi", "topic_name": "Wi-Fi"}]}, {"news_name": "Criminal crew Hellsing strikes back after attack by a rival APT group", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36002/cyber-crime/hellsing-apt-on-apt-attack.html", "title": "Criminal crew Hellsing strikes back after attack by a rival APT group\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 15, 2015", "body": "What happens when an APT group running a cyber espionage campaign target a second distinct APT group?\n\nThe events occurred last year, when a group involved in a cyber espionage campaign dubbed Hellsing sent a spear phishing email to a rival hacking team, the Naikon APT, which is one of the Asian largest APT gangs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe email in this case originates from a government email \u2026 and is directed to the Naikon attackers. They decided to strike back at the attacker, a spy-on-spy sort of move,\u201d explained Costin Raiu, head of Kaspersky\u2019s global research and analysis team. \u201cThey [Hellsing] are interested in infecting other APTs and learning about their operations,\u201d \n\nNaikon ATP has been active for several years, its operations targeted entities in various industries including governments and the military. The hacking crew targeted diplomats, law enforcement, and aviation authorities in many Asian countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Indonesia.\n\nThe singular discovered was made by experts at Kaspersky Team that provided a detailed analysis of the attack. The Hellsing APT attached a payload used to serve a powerful malware that infects the victim\u2019s PC.\n\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab explained that Hellsing surgically selected about 20 organizations, limiting its operation to the US, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and India. The name Hellsing comes from the project title left by a developer in a malicious source code used by the hacking team.\n\n\n\nExperts at Kaspersky consider very singular the circumstance and believe that it could be the beginning of a new dangerous trend in the criminal ecosystem, they defined the activities as the APT-on-APT attacks.\n\n\u201cThe targeting of the Naikon group by the Hellsing APT is perhaps the most interesting part. In the past, we\u2019ve seen APT groups accidentally hitting each other while stealing address books from victims and then mass-mailing everyone on each of these lists. But, considering the timing and origin of the attack, the current case seems more likely to be an APT-on-APT attack.\u201d reports the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\nThe battle between the two APT groups began last February when Naikon run a spear phishing campaign on a number of adversaries, including the Hellsing. On the other end, the Hellsing group once discovered the malicious campaign and its source started its counteroffensive.\n\nIn March 2014, a few weeks after Naikon targeting other APT groups, including the Hellsing APT, the team launched a spear phishing campaign on most of the countries involved in the search for the disappeared Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. The campaign targeted a wide range of entities, including institutions with access to information related to the disappearance of MH370.\n\nThe analysis of the command and control infrastructure revealed that Hellsing has ties to fellow other groups, including PlayfulDragon, Mirage, Vixen Panda, Cycldek and Goblin Panda.\n\nI suggest you carefully read this report that details an operation that is considered the first APT-on-APT attack that has been witnessed by the experts.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  APT, Hellsing)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt-on-apt", "topic_name": "APT-on-APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hellsing", "topic_name": "Hellsing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370", "topic_name": "Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/naikon", "topic_name": "Naikon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Dell report revealed attacks on SCADA system are doubled", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35967/hacking/dell-attacks-on-scada-doubled.html", "title": "Dell report revealed attacks on SCADA system are doubled\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 15, 2015", "body": "The new Dell Annual Threat Report revealed that the number of attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems doubled in 2014 respect the previous year.

Vowing to ramp up the country\u2019s cyber capabilities, Rouhani has given the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) an annual cybersecurity budget of roughly $19.8 million.\n\n\u201cVowing to ramp up the country\u2019s cyber capabilities, Rouhani has given the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) an annual cybersecurity budget of roughly $19.8 million.\u201d states the Business Insider.\n\n\n\nIran is training a new generation of cyber soldiers, According to a report released in 2013 by the Middle East Media Research Institute, by November 2010, the Basij Cyber Council had trained 1,500 cyber-warriors who, according to IRGC commander Hossein Hamedani, \u201chave assumed their duties and will in the future carry out many operations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Business Insider, experts have assisted to an escalation of the Iranian Investment after the discovery of the Stuxnet virus, a cyber weapon designed to cause serious damage to Iranian nuclear program.\n\nBy analyzing the problem in the future perspective, I personally consider more dangerous the Iranian cyber capabilities than its nuclear program. Cyber weapons could be destructive exactly like conventional weapons by their use presents numerous advantage, first of all the difficult attribution in the case of attack.\n\nAnother element of concern of the Iranian cyber growth is the alleged support received by the Russia, a country considered one of the most active in the Information Warfare.\n\n\u201cRussia has probably helped Iran a lot in stepping up its cyber capabilities in the event of a conflict with NATO,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cIf they [the Iranians] want to topple the US\u2019 financial sector, or cripple the military\u2019s ability to communicate, they can do that.\u201d cybersecurity expert David Kennedy, founder of information security firm TrustedSec, told to the Business Insider.\n\nA fundamental distinction between hacking campaign run by Iranian state-sponsored hackers and their Chinese and Russian peers, it that Iran cyber units mainly operated to sabotage and destroy targets, while Russia and Chiana are more focused in cyber espionage motivated by competitive advantage or monetary gain.\n\nExactly like Chinese Government, also the Iranian authorities sustain programs to bring young people to the doctrine of hacking. The cyber security expert Jeff Bardin, of the greatest experts in cyber-jihad and with deep knowledge of the military operations conducted by states in the Middle East, told to the Business insider that Iran promote hacking culture through its top technological university.\n\n\u201cAt the Sharif University of Technology, which is like the MIT of Iran, students are participating in cyber \u2018capture-the-flag\u2019 games to hone their hacking skills,\u201d said Jeff Bardin, chief intelligence officer of cyber intelligence firm Treadstone 71. \u201cThey compete to see who can find security holes and break through servers\u2019 encryptions and firewalls the fastest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all highly institutionalized,\u201d Bardin said. \u201cThe irony is that, after looking at some of the professors\u2019 resumes, you\u2019ll see that most of these cyber experts teaching students how to hack were initially trained in the US or UK.\u201d\n\nThe Government of Teheran also offers students internships with popular Iranian hacker groups, sustaining their participation in the programs of national cyber defense.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Iran,  Information Warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Reading the Secunia Vulnerability Review 2015", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35386/hacking/secunia-vulnerability-review-2015.html", "title": "Reading the Secunia Vulnerability Review 2015\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 27, 2015", "body": "Secunia has recently released its annual study of trends in software vulnerabilities, an interesting report that highlights the impact of the presence of flaws in common software and provide useful details on the way bad actors exploited it. According data provided by the Security firm Secunia, the number of  Web browser vulnerabilities and zero-day exploited by hackers worldwide in 2014 is increased in a significant way.\n\nDespite the prompt response of the security community and software vendors, which were able to early identify the threat and provide the necessary patch. Secunia revealed that more than 83 percent of 15,435 vulnerabilities present in 3,870 applications was fixed by vendors when a flaw was publicly disclosed, a positive trend that reveals a marked improvement compared to the past.\n\n\u201cThe absolute number of vulnerabilities detected was 15,435, discovered in 3,870 applications from 500 vendors. The number shows a 55% increase in the five year trend, and a 18% increase from 2013 to 2014. Since 2013, the number of vendors behind the vulnerable products has decreased by 11% and the amount of vulnerable products has increased by 22%.\u201d states the report published by Secunia.\n\n\n\nThe number of Zero-day flaws exploited by threat actors worldwide stepped up from 14 in 2013 to 25 in 2015, a significant increase that worries security experts because the exploitation of this type of vulnerabilities resets the effectiveness of the main defense systems. Another concerning data is the number vulnerabilities affecting Web browser software that increased to 1,035 in 2014, up from 728 the prior year.\n\nThe study confirmed the efficiency of the research community that succeeded into addressing the vulnerability limiting the exposure of users to the exploitation of the flaw.\n\n\u201cThe most likely explanation is that researchers are continuing to coordinate their vulnerability reports with vendors and their vulnerability programs, resulting in immediate availability of patches for the majority of cases,\u201d continues the report.\n\nBy analyzing data related to patch management, the experts discovered that if a patch wasn\u2019t available on the day a flaw was publicly disclosed, the time for its release lengthens, the percentage of products that had a patch ready a month after a flaw was disclosed only rose to 84.3 percent.\n\n\u201c30 days after day of disclosure, 84.3% of vulnerabilities have a patch available, indicating that if a patch is not available on the first day, the vendor does not prioritize patching the vulnerability\u201d reads Secunia.\n\nVery interesting a detailed analysis of the exploitation of PDF reader software which is a very common attack method due to its diffusion. According to data presented in the report the number of vulnerabilities discovered in Adobe Reader in 2014 is 43.\n\nThe report also analyzed the vulnerabilities discovered in open-source software that represented a serious security issue last year, we all have in mind the effects of the disclosure of the Heartbleed flaw. The use of open source applications and libraries is widespread, in the majority of cases they are bundled in a variety of commercial products and solutions, for this reason it must be carefully addressed.\n\n\u201cOrganizations should not presume to be able to predict which vendors are dependable and quick to react when vulnerabilities are discovered in products bundled with open-source libraries,\u201d Secunia said.\n\nLet me suggest to read the report, I\u2019m sure you will find it interesting.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Secunia,  vulnetabilities)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe", "topic_name": "Adobe"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/heartbleed", "topic_name": "Heartbleed"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/open-source", "topic_name": "open source"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/secunia", "topic_name": "Secunia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerabilities", "topic_name": "vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "IBM X-Force reported a billion data records leaked in 2014", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35076/security/billion-data-records-leaked-2014.html", "title": "IBM X-Force reported a billion data records leaked in 2014\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 19, 2015", "body": "Unfortunately, 2014 was one of the worst years and the reason of that was that a lot if viruses and attempts of violation of online privacy.

In fact, the researchers have stated that:\n\n\u201cBased on pure volume, the total number of records breached in 2014 was nearly 25 percent higher than in 2013,\u201d They have also added that: \u201cA prime example was the public disclosure of sensitive photos stored on a cloud service.

Researchers discovered that the industries that were mostly violated were computer services, retailers and the government. Of course, the country with the most incidents in comparison to other large countries is none other than the United States of America.\n\nIf you make some advanced search on the web, you will find out that the ransomware attacks were the most common ones as they were used in order to have as a target DDoS attacks. Another really famous kind of financial malware is called Citadel and it is used in order to be able to collect any kind of information consider to be important apart from financial clues. With the use of the specific malware the people who use it they have as a target petrochemical sellers, suppliers and password management software. Another thing that the specific study proved is the fact that the devices that were most harmed in were certainly mobile phones. This was done due to the fact of the appearance of so many different kinds of applications and of course due to the fact that the app developers do not update them in order to be absolutely safe for their users.\n\nAll of the above are certainly strong clues that should make you think of the way in which you use your saved personal information. So, it is really easy to understand that personal data must remain personal and the only way to achieve that is to be careful and use the perfect security services that will help you to surf the web and feel safe and secure while you are doing it. So, do not waste any more valuable time and find now the security service that suits you the most.

The principal problems discovered were the exposure of sensitive data, suspicious security actions and anomalous application management (installing/unistalling mobile apps), device monitoring.\n\nExperts at Veracode discovered the following problems related to the 14,000 unsafe applications discovered:\n\n\u201cThe findings demonstrate that enterprises typically have lots of unsafe applications installed on their employees\u2019 devices. For example, an application is deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d if it has access to SIM card data such as geo-location, call history, SMS message logs and device IDs, or if it sends sensitive information to suspicious overseas locations for no apparent reason.\u201d said Phil Neray, VP of Enterprise Security Strategy at Veracode.\n\nAs correctly Neray highlight, the presence of unsafe applications on mobile devices exposes company data to serious risk of data breach. Attacker could take advantage of such applications to run targeted attacks against enterprises.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many ways in which cyberattackers can leverage risky apps. For example, they can be used to spy on employees with access to confidential information \u2014 by tracking the employee\u2019s location, recording their phone calls and developing a profile of their social connections \u2014 in order to steal corporate intellectual property or profit from trading on insider information. They can also be used to steal banking credentials or insert aggressive adware. And nation-states can use them to track high-profile individuals,\u201d Neray added.\n\nThe problem of security for mobile devices is serious, the number of attacks targeting these infrastructures is constantly increasing, cyber criminals and state-sponsored hackers represents a serious menace for mobile users. Insecure applications represent an entry point for attackers and the presence of so large number of vulnerable apps in enterprises enlarges in significant way the surface of attack of the organizations.\n\n\u201cThrough 2015, more than 75 percent of mobile applications will fail basic security tests.\u201d reported Gartner.\n\nThe data collected by Veracode give a disconcerting picture of actual security mobile security landscape.

Security researchers at Kaspersky Lab revealed that the capabilities of the Equation Group surpass anything known in terms of sophistication of hacking techniques, the researchers dubbed the hacking team the Equation Group because of their attitude in the use of encryption algorithms and obfuscation methods.\n\nBased on the information related to the numerous cyber espionage campaigns analyzed by the experts at Kaspersky over the years, the experts hypothesized the involvement of a government.\n\n\u201cThe EquationDrug case demonstrates an interesting trend that we have been seeing while analyzing supposedly nation-state cyberattack tools: a growth in code sophistication,\u201d explained the Kaspersky experts. \u201cIt is clear that nation-state attackers are looking for better stability, invisibility, reliability and universality in their cyberespionage tools.\u201d\n\nPart of the security community considers the National Security Agency (NSA) could be linked to the Equation Group, though Kaspersky never pointed the finger at the US intelligence.\n\nThe Equation APT group seems to be active since 2001, perhaps as far back as 1996, this means that it has developed over the years the cyber capabilities to avoid detection.\n\nVery interesting the use of the firmware implants to maintain never-ending persistence on a targeted system.\n\n\u201cThe Equation Group also had access to zero-days before they were used by operators behind Stuxnet and Flame campaigns. According to the researchers at Kaspersky Lab, on seven exploits used by the Equation Group in their malware and exploit kit, at least four of them were used as zero-days. For example, the experts mentioned a malicious code dubbed Fanny, which was used by the Equation Group in 2008 when it exploited two zero-days, later introduced into the Stuxnet variants detected in June 2009 and March 2010. This is proof that the hacking team had access to previously unknown flaws before any other group of hackers.\u201d I wrote in a comparative analysis between hacking tools developed by the Equation Group and NSA Tao unit.\n\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab are still investigating on this APT and released a new deeper analysis of the older attack platform used by the Equation group.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the consideration that bad actor behind the Equation Group has developed a complete hacking platform, dubbed EquationDrug, that\u2019s able to produce selective agents to target specific platforms, process manipulation of targets, drivers and library loading and traffic hijacking.\n\n\n\nThe EquationDrug is the predecessor of another powerful hacking platform used by the Equation Group, the GrayFish. It cannot be used for OS after the Windows XP/2003.\n\nThe experts discovered that EquationDrug allowed the deployment at least of 116 different modules that implements sophisticated cyberespionage functions ranging from data exfiltration to target monitoring. Kaspersky experts analyzed 30 different modules, among the capabilities implemented by the EquationDrug there were system-level functions, data exfiltration modules for specific targets,\n\n\u201cThe architecture of the whole framework resembles a mini-operating system with kernel-mode and user-mode components carefully interacting with each other via a custom message-passing interface. The platform includes a set of drivers, a platform core (orchestrator) and a number of plugins,\u201d Kaspersky researchers wrote in a report. \u201cEvery plugin has a unique ID and version number that defines a set of functions it can provide. Some of the plugins depend on others and might not work unless dependencies are resolved.\u201d\n\nThe experts at Kaspersky Lab analyzed code artifacts and timestamps related to the EquationDrug, they speculate that coders are native English speakers that worked a Monday through Friday 9-5 work week in the UTC-3 or UTC-4 time zone.\n\nThe report includes the technical analysis for the 30 modules of the EquationDrug platform, you cannot miss it.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Equation Group, EquationDrug)\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Identity Fraud Cost US Consumers $16 billion in 2014, less than in 2013", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/34449/cyber-crime/javelin-study-2015-identity-fraud.html", "title": "Identity Fraud Cost US Consumers $16 billion in 2014, less than in 2013\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 5, 2015", "body": "Last year we observed a significant number of data breaches that cause the exposure of a huge quantity of information in the criminal ecosystem.

In this specific case, the cost of DDoS attacks ranged from $2 per hour for one to four hours to $1,000 for a month-long attack, the report notes.\n\nRecent analysis observed a dramatic increase of so-called hit and run attacks, a series of short bursts of high volume attacks, having a limited duration, and are arranged periodically.\n\nHit and Run DDoS attacks are in nature \u201con demand attack\u201c, the attackers limit the duration of the offensives to avoid the intervention of defense mechanisms, the typical DDoS defense solution works well for long DDoS attack, but their response time is too long to face with short DDoS.\n\n\u201cOne of the more high-profile advertising efforts for a DDoS service in 2014 came from the DDoS group Lizard Squad,\u201d according to the Verisign\u2019s Distributed Denial of Service Trends report. \u201cSince August 2014, the group has claimed responsibility for attacks against multiple online gaming services, including those for Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation Network (PSN) and Microsoft Inc.\u2019s Xbox Live.
