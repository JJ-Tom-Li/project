When Ancestry.com notifies its users of a potential security breach it sounds worse than most.\n\nAncestry.com is a company with millions of customers that use their online tools to research their family tree. The company also hosts servers for RootsWeb, a free, community-driven collection of genealogy tools and discussion forums. On December 20th, 2017, Troy Hunt, of HaveIBeenPwned.com, notified the Ancestry.com security team of an unsecured file on a RootsWeb server containing \u201cemail addresses/username and password combinations as well as usernames from a RootsWeb.com server\u201d, and a quick and detailed investigation ensued.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ancestry.com\u2019s blog post detailing the incident, the security team reviewed the file identified by Hunt, and determined that it does contain login details for 300,000 accounts although they describe, \u201cthe majority of the information was old.\u201d They continued their investigation and determined that of the 300,000 accounts, 55,000 had been reused by users on both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. Most of the 55,000 were \u201cfrom free trial, or currently unused accounts,\u201d but 7,000 login credentials were in use by active Ancestry.com users. Ancestry.com supports millions of users so this breach represents less than 1% of their users, however, they still took the potential impacts seriously and acted accordingly.\n\nThe internal investigation points to the RootsWeb surname list information service which Ancestry.com retired earlier this year. \u201cWe believe the intrusion was limited to the RootsWeb surname list, where someone was able to create the file of older RootsWeb usernames and passwords as a direct result of how part of this open community was set up, an issue we are working to rectify\u201d, according to the blog post by Ancestry.com CISO, Tony Blackman.\n\nHe continued with, \u201cWe have no reason to believe that any Ancestry systems were compromised. Further, we have not seen any activity indicating the compromise of any individual Ancestry accounts.\u201d According to Ancestry, the RootsWeb servers do not host any credit card or social insurance numbers so the potential impact of this breach appears to be minimized.\n\nThe RootsWeb website is currently offline while the Ancestry teams complete their investigation, make the appropriate configuration changes and \u201censure all data is saved and preserved to the best of [their] ability.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Ancestry has locked the 55,000 accounts found in the exposed file, requiring users to change their passwords the next time they attempt to log on. They sent emails to all 55,000 email addresses advising them of the incident and recommended actions, and commit to \u201cworking with regulators and law enforcement where appropriate.\u201d\n\nTo summarize, the Ancestry.com security team responded quickly when notified of a potential breach, determined the potential scope and impact, took swift action to minimize damages, notified impacted users, clearly and publicly described the event. Troy Hunt\u2019s tweet describes it best, \u201cAnother data breach from years ago, this time from @Ancestry\u2019s services.

The man could face up to 87 months in jail for the first charge and 24 months for the identity theft charges.\n\n\u201cThese threats are even more insidious when cybercriminals such as Baratov are employed by foreign government agencies acting outside the rule of law.\u201d  US Attorney Brian Stretch said.\n\nBaratov has also agreed to pay restitution to the affected Yahoo users and a fine up to $2,250,000 (at $250,000 per count).\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 2014 Yahoo hack, DoJ)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/2014-yahoo-data-breach", "topic_name": "2014 Yahoo data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/doj", "topic_name": "DoJ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fsb", "topic_name": "FSB"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-breach", "topic_name": "security breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahoo", "topic_name": "Yahoo"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahoo-hack", "topic_name": "Yahoo hack"}]}, {"news_name": "Top Secret US Army and NSA documents left exposed on Amazon S3 bucket", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66135/breaking-news/us-army-nsa-data-leak.html", "title": "Top Secret US Army and NSA documents left exposed on Amazon S3 bucket\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 28, 2017", "body": "A couple of weeks ago sensitive data from the US Army\u2019s CENTCOM and PACOM divisions was exposed on an unsecured Amazon S3 bucket, experts from the security firm UpGuard found terabytes of US military social media surveillance.\n\nNow the same team from UpGuard have discovered another S3 bucket containing documents from INSCOM, that is a joint US Army and NSA agency involved in intelligence, security, and information operations.\n\nThe S3 server contained a small number of files and folders, three of which were available for the download.\n\n\u201cCritical data belonging to the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), a joint US Army and National Security Agency (NSA) Defense Department command tasked with gathering intelligence for US military and political leaders, leaked onto the public internet, exposing internal data and virtual systems used for classified communications to anyone with an internet connection.\u201d reads the blog post published by UpGuard.\n\n\u201cSet to allow anyone entering the URL to see the exposed bucket\u2019s contents, the repository, located at the AWS subdomain \u201cinscom,\u201d contained 47 viewable files and folders in the main repository, three of which were also downloadable. \u201c\n\nOne of the files was an image of a virtual machine in Oracle Virtual Appliance (.ova) format.

In 2014, hackers accessed 500 million accounts in a separate security breach.\n\nAttackers accessed names, birth dates, phone numbers, security questions, backup email addresses and passwords of Yahoo, a gift for hackers that could use the same data to access any other account owned by Yahoo users that share same credentials.  Unfortunately, the hashed passwords were protected with a weak algorithm that was very easy to crack.\n\nThe 2013 Yahoo hack influenced the deal to acquire Yahoo in June and had a significant impact on the price of the acquisition., it\u2019s very strange that the real extent of the incident was disclosed only now.\n\n\u201cThat investigators did not discover the full extent of the 2013 incident before Verizon closed the deal to acquire Yahoo in June was surprising to outside cybersecurity analysts.\u201d reported The New York Time.\n\nAccording to Verizon, the support of outside forensic experts allowed it to discover that every single account was exposed in the 2013 Yahoo hack.\n\n\u201cSubsequent to Yahoo\u2019s acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft. While this is not a new security issue, Yahoo is sending email notifications to the additional affected user accounts. The investigation indicates that the user account information that was stolen did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. The company is continuing to work closely with law enforcement.\u201d Verizon said in a statement issued on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOur investment in Yahoo is allowing that team to continue to take significant steps to enhance their security, as well as benefit from Verizon\u2019s experience and resources,\u201d\n\nOn August, a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe began offering Yahoo\u2019s data for sale on the Dark Web.  According to security firm InfoArmor, the Yahoo database was sold for $300,000 on the dark web.\n\nUnfortunately, at least three different buyers, including two \u201cprominent spammers\u201d paid the hacker to gain the entire database and likely use it in espionage activities.\n\n\u201cBut last August, a geographically dispersed hacking collective based in Eastern Europe quietly began offering the whole database for sale, according to Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer at InfoArmor, an Arizona cybersecurity firm, who monitors the dark corners of the internet inhabited by criminals, spies and spammers.\u201d reported the New York Times.  \u201cThree buyers \u2014 two known spammers and an entity that appeared more interested in espionage \u2014 paid about $300,000 each for a complete copy of the database, he said.\u201d\n\n\n\nYahoo still considers the breaches in 2014 and 2013 as unrelated events.\n\nIt is still unclear who is behind the attack, security experts attributed the 2013 Yahoo hack to a Russian APT group.\n\n\u201cIn March, the Department of Justice charged four men, including two Russian intelligence officers, with the 2014 breach. Investigators said the Russian government used stolen Yahoo data to spy on a range of targets in the United States, including White House and military officials, bank executives and even a gambling regulator in Nevada, according to anindictment.\u201d added The New York Time.\n\n\u201cThe stolen data was also used to spy on Russian government officials and business executives, federal prosecutors said. What made that theft particularly egregious, Justice Department officials said, was that the two intelligence officers who were indicted had worked for an arm of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., that is charged with helping foreign intelligence agencies track cybercriminals.\u201d\n\nOnce again let me suggest Yahoo users reset their passwords and change security questions as soon as possible on every website, including ones for which they used the same Yahoo credentials.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 2013 Yahoo hack, data breach)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/verizon", "topic_name": "Verizon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahoo", "topic_name": "Yahoo"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahoo-hack", "topic_name": "Yahoo hack"}]}, {"news_name": "Equifax hack affected 145.5 million individuals, 2.5M more than originally stated", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63772/hacking/equifax-hack-145-5m-affected.html", "title": "Equifax hack affected 145.5 million individuals, 2.5M more than originally stated\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 3, 2017", "body": "Earlier this week, Equifax announced that additional 2.5 million U.S. consumers were exposed as a result of the massive data breach that affected the company in September.

access to IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information.\n\n\u201cThe Guardian understands Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email

The presence of this data in an S3 bucket bearing MCS\u2019s name appears to further corroborate the Viacom group\u2019s mission of moving its infrastructure onto Amazon Web Services\u2019 cloud.\u201d states Vichery.\n\nThe Amazon AWS S3 contained the passwords and manifests for Viacom\u2019s servers, as well as the access key and private key for the corporation\u2019s AWS account. Some of the data was encrypted using GPG, but the disconcerting news is that the bucket also contained the related decryption keys.\n\n\u201cWhile the exposure has since been closed, following UpGuard\u2019s notification to Viacom, this incident highlights the potentially enormous cost such data leaks can evince upon even the largest and most sophisticated organizations. Exposed in this incident were nothing less than the master controls needed to harness the power of a digital media empire and turn it towards nefarious aims.\u201d added Vickery.\n\n\u201cThe leaked Viacom data is remarkably potent and of great significance, an important reminder that cloud leaks need not be large in disk size to be devastating; when it comes to data exposures, quality can be as vital as quantity,\u201d \n\n\n\nVickery was disconcerting by its discovery and highlighted the risks faced by the organization.\n\n\u201cPerhaps most damaging among the exposed data are Viacom\u2019s secret cloud keys, an exposure that, in the most damaging circumstances, could put the international media conglomerate\u2019s cloud-based servers in the hands of hackers,\u201d says Vickery.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of the Viacom leak reveals nothing less than this: the keys to a media kingdom were left publicly accessible on the internet, completely compromising the integrity of Viacom\u2019s digital infrastructure.\u201d\n\nViacom sent the following statement to Vickery\n\n\u201cOnce Viacom became aware that information on a server \u2013 including technical information, but no employee or customer information \u2013 was publicly accessible, we rectified the issue. We have analyzed the data in question and determined there was no material impact.\u201d\n\nThe Viacom case is just the latest in order of time of Amazon S3 buckets found unsecured online.\n\nEarlier September, researchers from cybersecurity company UpGuard have discovered thousands of files containing personal data on former US military, intelligence, and government workers have allegedly been exposed online for months.\n\nOn August, Vickery discovered more than 1.8 million voter records belonging to Americans have been accidentally leaked online by a US voting machine supplier for dozens of US states.\n\nIn June, Vickery discovered that a top defense contractor left tens of thousands sensitive Pentagon documents on Amazon Server Without any protection in places.\n\nChris Vickery discovered many other clamorous cases of open database exposed on the Internet.

The information held by Equifax is highly sensitive, especially for US citizens, where personal and financial information including SSN (Social Security Numbers), and credit card data were stolen by the attackers. There is the possibility that over 44 million records in the UK and Canada may also be affected.\n\nWhat might be news to you that this breach happened in May this year with the attackers being undetected by Equifax security teams until July 29th. Initial indications point towards the attacker(s) exploiting a vulnerability in Apache Struts, giving them access to a vast amount of information. What has not been fully confirmed by Equifax is whether the core database which includes credit file reports has also been compromised by the attackers.\n\n\n\nSo why is this the new gold standard for \u201chow not to do Incident Response\u201d?\n\nThere are very many ways Equifax could have handled this breach better, probably more than I can fit into a 700-word article, however, I will try to address the main points here.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting, and also disastrous for Equifax is that the business knew about a significant breach in their informational systems, for almost 2 months, before publicly announcing the incident. Now, this alone would be enough to damage any potential empathy from their customers, if they came out with we are a victim too angle.\n\nHowever, Equifax performed the Incident Response cardinal sin, they protected their own interests before those of their customers they clearly let down, with key shareholders dumping their stock before publicly announcing the breach!\n\nThe fact Equifax had put their interests first (or created that perception), this meant that a potential \u201cwe\u2019re a victim too\u201d card from a crisis communications perspective was no longer a viable option, consequentially the business created a mob and made themselves a bigger target from hacktivism groups.\n\nWhen Equifax came out with a message about the breach in security, they created a website in August ironically called Equifaxsecurity2017.com to drive customers to, mainly to check whether their details were included in the incident and some advice on what they should do.\n\n\n\nIn principle this is a good idea, the reality is that it looked like a phishing website especially the Trustedidpremier.com site where customers could check whether they had been affected by the breach. Both causing confusion from customers who at which point were already in a heightened sense of paranoia.\n\n\n\nWhat Equifax should have done, is notify all their customer by post and have clear and concise message on what the affected customers should do, and most importantly how Equifax is going to protect and compensate their customers on their main website! They had almost 2 months to prepare, so there are no excuses really.\n\nWhen in a heightened state of security it\u2019s easy to focus on the incident in hand, in fact, most breaches I\u2019ve personally investigated have quickly led to a follow-up breach because everyone is busy trying to work out how they got breached in the first place\u2026 all hands to the pump lead to a blinkered approach were obvious holes are missed.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for Equifax, a site in Argentina was taken offline due to another potential breach in security or security configuration issue with the site having and admin username and admin password. With the press hot on the heels on anything related to Equifax, the business cannot afford another mistake, especially relating to PII or credit card information.\n\n\n\nHow not to undertake IR like Equifax\n\nEquifax could have turned this incident into an opportunity to control the narrative of this breach, but short-sighted strategy and what on the outside seems to be a very immature incident response and crisis communication process has led to the media controlling the message.\n\nWhen facing into the abyss of a major incident what should you be doing?\n\nIf you work in these areas you should be in a stronger position if you are faced with the perfect storm of incidents.\n\nFinally, remember the incident isn\u2019t over until it really is over!\n\n\n\nAbout the author: Stuart Peck, Director of Cyber Security Strategy, ZeroDayLab\nFrom a background of threat intelligence, social engineering, and incident response, Stuart Pecks heads up Cyber Security Strategy for ZeroDayLab.

Data of approximately 400,000 customers in Italy is assumed to have been impacted during these two periods. No data, such as passwords allowing access to customer accounts or allowing for unauthorised transactions, has been affected, whilst some other personal data and IBAN numbers might have been accessed.\u201d\n\nThe financial institution confirmed that a first security breach occurred in late 2016, between September and October, while the second violation was detected between June and July 2017.\n\nData of approximately 400,000 Italian customers might have been exposed, according to Unicredit it doesn\u2019t include financial data or passwords.\n\nThe company confirmed to have discovered and fixed the breach, an investigation is still ongoing.\n\nItaly\u2019s largest bank UniCredit is pictured in downtown Milan September 12, 2013.

Let\u2019s think of a phishing message including a link to a clone of the legitimate bank website. The bogus website could trick victims into providing the login credentials and also the 2FA code, then the attacker can impersonate the victim and make transactions on his behalf.\n\nThere is also the concrete risk that crooks will offer stolen data on black marketplaces allowing hackers to use them in many fraud scheme.\n\nEven if stolen data doesn\u2019t include email addresses, it is quite easy for hackers to use retrieve them from data dumps from other data breaches once the name of a bank customer is exposed.\n\nAnother disconcerting aspect of the UniCredit bank breach is the fact that the attack started several months ago and was disclosed only now?\n\nThis means that companies face severe difficulties in detecting fraudulent activities and raises the debate on the level of security for the entire supply chain. Once again, hackers targeted a subcontractor or a partner to violate the security of a biggest organization.\n\nLet me close suggesting Unicredit users stay vigilant on their bank accounts, reporting any suspicious activity.

In a post I have published on the Infosec Institute I have summarized what has happened in the last weeks and what has been disclosed by the organization.\n\nBelow the list of previous batches published by Wikileaks:\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks, the AfterMidnight malware framework allows CIA operators to dynamically load and execute malicious payload on a target system.\n\nThe principal payload is disguised as a self-persisting Windows Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file and executes small payloads dubbed \u201cGremlins\u201d that are able to subvert the functionality of targeted software, gather target\u2019s information, or providing services for other gremlins.\n\n\u201c\u2018Gremlin\u2019 is the term for an AM payload that is meant to run hidden on target and either:\n\n\n\nThe documents include the AfterMidnight user guide, below the description provided by the manual for the malware platform:\n\n\u201cAfterMidnight is a DLL that self-persists as a Windows Service DLL and provides secure execution of \u201cGremlins\u201d via a HTTPS based LP. Once installed on a target machine AM will call back to a configured LP on a configurable schedule, checking to see if there is a new plan for it to execute.\u201d reads the user guide.\u201dIf there is, it downloads and stores all needed components before loading all new gremlins in memory. All local storage is encrypted with an \u201cLP\u201d key that is not stored on the client. If AM is unable to contact the LP it will be unable to execute any payload.\u201d\n\nThe local storage used by the AfterMidnight is encrypted with a key which is not stored on the target machine.\n\nCIA operators can schedule a custom task using a custom script language included in a special module \u201cAlphaGremlin.\u201d\n\nThe second Malware Framework, so-called Assassin, is described with the following statement by Wikipedia.\n\n\u201c\u201dAssassin\u201d is a similar kind of malware; it is an automated implant that provides a simple collection platform on remote computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. Once the tool is installed on the target, the implant is run within a Windows service process. \u201cAssassin\u201d (just like \u201cAfterMidnight\u201d) will then periodically beacon to its configured listening post(s) to request tasking and deliver results.\u201d states WikiLeaks. \u201cCommunication occurs over one or more transport protocols as configured before or during deployment. The \u201cAssassin\u201d C2 (Command and Control) and LP (Listening Post) subsystems are referred to collectively as\u201d The Gibson\u201d and allow operators to perform specific tasks on an infected target.\u201d\n\nOnce infected a target machine, Assassin runs the implant within a Windows service process to allow CIA operators to perform malicious tasks.\n\nAccording to the user guide, the four components of the Assassin malware framework are:\n\nStay Tuned\u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 AfterMidnight malware platform, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) titled \u201cInformation Security Practices of Aadhaar (or lack thereof): A documentation of public availability of Aadhaar Numbers with sensitive personal financial information\u201c\n\nThe report highlighted the high security implemented by the Aahdaar itself, rather warn of possible data leaks caused by other government agencies accessing the system.\n\nThe research paper focus on four government-operated projects: Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme; Chandranna Bima; the National Social Assistance Program; and an Andhra Pradesh portal of Daily \u201cOnline Payment Reports under NREGA\u201d maintained by the National Informatics Centre.\n\n\n\nThe CIS examined numerous databases used by

built into it\u2026 But the area we are working on is enforcement,\u201d Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Union Electronics and Information Technology Ministry, told The Hindu.\n\n\u201cPeople are not

The affected properties include the InterContinental San Francisco and Holiday Inn Resort \u2013 Aruba, the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile.\n\n\n\nOn Friday the company published on its website a credit card breach notification informing it customers that a second breach occurred at select hotels between Sept. 29 and Dec. 29 last year.\n\n\u201cMany IHG-branded locations are independently owned and operated franchises, and certain of these franchisee operated locations in the Americas were made aware by payment card networks of patterns of unauthorized charges occurring on payment cards after they were legitimately used at their locations.

Although there is no evidence of unauthorized access to payment card data after December 29, 2016, confirmation that the malware was eradicated did not occur until the properties were investigated in February and March 2017. \u201c\n\nThe company highlighted that there\u2019s no evidence payment card data was accessed after that some payment systems have been compromised with a malware.\n\nThe malware that infected the systems at the InterContinental Hotels Group was able to siphon credit card data from track in the magnetic strip (i.e. customers\u2019 card number, expiration date, and internal verification code).\n\n\u201cThe malware searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the affected hotel server.

First, we will discuss the main question on everybody\u2019s mind \u2013 how are encrypted services like ProtonMail impacted, and what insights did we gain into the strategies of state-backed attackers.\n\nImmediately after the news broke, stories began circulating, along the lines of \u201cSignal/Whatsapp encryption broken!\u201d, fueled in part by Tweets put out by Wikileaks. This was followed predictably by online chatter speculating into whether or not ProtonMail had been cracked.\n\n\n\nWe can state quite equivocally that there is nothing in the leaked CIA files which indicates any sort of crack of ProtonMail\u2019s encryption. And despite claims to the contrary, there is also no evidence that Signal/Whatsapp end-to-end encryption has been breached. Here\u2019s what we do know:\n\nOver the past three years, the CIA has put together a formidable arsenal of cyberweapons specially designed to gain surveillance capabilities over end-user devices such as mobile phones and laptop/desktop computers. These advanced malwares enable the CIA to record actions such as keystrokes on a mobile device, allowing them to conduct surveillance without breaking encryption. Through this technique, US intelligence agencies can gain access to data before they have been encrypted. This is in fact the only way to achieve data access, because cracking the cryptography used in advanced secure communication services such as ProtonMail and Signal is still impractical with current technology.\n\nIn other words, the core cryptographic algorithms and techniques used by ProtonMail and other encrypted services remain secure. The exploitation of user endpoints (mobile phones, personal computers, etc) is actually not a new technique, but one that has existed since the first malware was created. This unfortunately is not something that cryptography is designed to defend against, as encryption by itself cannot guarantee the security of end-user devices. What the CIA files dumped by Wikileaks do reveal however, is a monumental shift in strategy since the last disclosure of this kind was made by Edward Snowden in 2013.\n\nProtonMail is tool that is used by millions of people around the world to ensure email communications security. In addition to ordinary people and businesses, ProtonMail is also used by journalists, activists, and dissidents, who often require protection from government surveillance for their personal safety. Because of these factors, we make it our business to carefully study and understand state adversaries in order to better protect our userbase.\n\nThe Wikileaks CIA files is therefore, a comprehensive update into state cyberwarfare strategies since Snowden gave us the first edition. In fact, the trends that the files reveal are arguably global, since it is highly probable that other major players in this space (Russia, China, UK, Israel, etc) will have independently reached the same conclusions regarding overall strategy.\n\nSome of the most interesting revelations from the Snowden leaks was the extent in which the NSA actively sought out information from the US tech giants, either with consent, or even without consent. This made a lot of sense, because the biggest global databases of sensitive personal data does not belong to the NSA, but actually to companies like Google and Facebook, who have already shown ample willingness to exploit such data for profit, sometimes via unscrupulous means.\n\nSince 2013 however, the world has changed. Consumer and business awareness of online privacy and security is at an all time high, and more and more people around the world are increasingly choosing more secure services which respect privacy. Today, end-to-end encryption has gone mainstream, and services such as ProtonMail and Whatsapp boast millions of regular people as users. The use of end-to-end encryption means services such as ProtonMail are not actually able to decrypt user data. Even if we wanted to compromise user data, we do not have the technical means to decrypt the user emails. Furthermore, even if an attacker breached ProtonMail servers, all the emails stored on our servers are encrypted, so an attacker also would not be able to read user emails.\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the leaked CIA documents that as the world has changed, stated-backed cyberattackers have also evolved. As we describe below, the varied leaked files are tied together by a common thread \u2013 an almost singular focus on producing malware to attack end-user devices. This is a logical response to the rise of end-to-end encrypted services such as ProtonMail. Services such as ProtonMail have significantly raised the barrier for obtaining data directly from the service provider, and many services are now based outside of the United States, beyond the reach of legal coercion. As such, it has now become easier, and more productive to directly hack individual users.\n\nThis opens up a terrifying new narrative where government spies are actively deploying viruses and trojans against their own citizens, joining the ranks of common cybercriminals. While this is by no means good news for privacy rights worldwide, it is in some ways, a win for privacy tech, because governments are having to shift away from mass surveillance and towards more targeted surveillance. In short, services such as ProtonMail are doing exactly what they were designed to do, which is raising barriers to large scale mass surveillance.\n\nOur initial analysis into the Wikileaks CIA documents can be found below.

It is the first part in a series of leaks titled Year Zero.\n\nOrigin: CIA\u2019s Center for Cyber Intelligence unit in Langley, Virginia USA\n\nVolume: 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments. According to Wikileaks, the entire archive of CIA material consists of several hundred million lines of computer code. Estimated to bigger than the Snowden leaks (unconfirmed).\n\nDates of documents: from the time Snowden left the intelligence community till 2016. 2013-2016.\n\nIntention: the source of the information told WikiLeaks in a statement that they wish to initiate a public debate about the \u201csecurity, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons.\u201d\n\nHow is it different from the Snowden leaks: Snowden leaks exposed the NSA and its techniques of blanket surveillance on citizens and governments around the world. Vault7, on the other hand, exposes the CIA and what technologies it uses in cyber warfare against foreign governments as well as against targeted individuals.\n\nAs we are examining the documents, we have identified that the leak concerns the CIA and what cyber weapons it uses. Over the next weeks we will continue to verify and update the information. Below is what we know so far about the programs used by the CIA, legality of the operations, and what this means for your privacy and security.\n\nWeeping Angel \u2013 It is a program that transforms the microphones of smart TVs into surveillance tools. By manipulating the hardware, CIA hackers are able to turn on people\u2019s smart TVs and listen to users\u2019 conversations. In effect, Weeping Angel transforms smart TVs into bugs.\n\nOur team quickly drew parallels between Weeping Angel and other surveillance tools described by Snowden. Weeping Angel is a technique that bears close resemblance to Nosey Smurf, a tool used by UK\u2019s GCHQ to turn on a phone\u2019s microphone and use it for audio surveillance. While Tracker Smurf \u2013 is a geo-location tool that offers a more accurate method of locating a phone and its carrier than using triangulation.\n\nZero day \u2013 Refers to a general type of vulnerability used by the CIA against any adversary\u2019s device. WikiLeaks reports that Zero Day has been primarily used against companies in industrial espionage. In 2013, Snowden, also, revealed that the NSA was committing industrial espionage against Brazilian, Russian and European oil companies, banks, airlines and trade delegations. According to Vault7, the program produced over \u201ca thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other \u201cweaponized\u201d malware.\u201d\n\nHive is a multi-platform CIA malware suite that can be specifically utilized against states. \u201cThe project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants.\u201d\n\nThere are many parallels between Hive and Zero Day and the 2010 Stuxnet virus that attacked and infected the Iranian Nuclear program. Although no state took responsibility for the attack in 2010, Stuxnet has been linked by political pundits to American and Israeli surveillance and intelligence agencies due to its degree of sophistication.\n\nVault7 also reveals that the CIA has developed advanced capabilities for hacking mobile phones. The leaks show that the agency developed and used its tool to primarily control mobile phones and then extract data from them.\n\nCIA\u2019s Mobile Development Branch produces malware to pull data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. MDB also targets Android OS which is a much popular system than iOS and is the default operating system for the majority of smartphones including Sony, Samsung and Google Pixel. \u201cYear Zero\u201d shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 \u201cweaponized\u201d Android \u201czero days\u201d which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors.\n\nWe were alarmed by the discovery of a tool that allows the CIA to potentially frame foreign governments for its cyber warfare acts. It works as follows. Imagine that each government or a hacking group has its own signature move or malicious software or a combination of both that it uses to attack its targets. After a while, whenever an attack occurs, it can be linked to to group based on that fingerprint.\n\nWikiLeaks reports that a program ran by its Remote Devices Branch called UMBRAGE \u201ccollects and stores an extensive library of attack techniques\u201d. According to Vault7, amassed techniques include those that are frequently used by Russia. \n\nSome of the techniques currently at CIA\u2019s disposal via UMBRAGE include: keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques.\n\nVault7 reveals that the CIA has also produced rules on how its malware should be hidden when deployed to avoid any fingerprints leading back to the US or the agency.\n\nPreliminary findings reveal that the CIA had known about and enhanced the dissemination of these tools. In fact, according to WikiLeaks, the agency wanted the programs to be legal so that agents or CIA sponsored hackers can operate with full impunity.\n\nAccording to Vault7, if \u2018CIA software was classified then officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. As a result- \u201cthe CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified\u201d. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber \u2018arms\u2019 manufactures and computer hackers can freely \u201cpirate\u201d these \u2018weapons\u2019 if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secret.\n\nWhile we are still mapping the dangers of such findings and capabilities, some conclusions are clear.\n\nBy using Hive and Zero Day, the US can wage a cyber attack against a nation state while purposefully leaving behind a trace that leads to another state. As governments around the world migrate their infrastructure control to cyber space \u2013 any cyber attack can have a devastating effect if targeted against hospitals, power plants or telecommunications providers.\n\nWhen the CIA undermines a service or a device, it creates the backdoor that can be abused by other parties. With the agency\u2019s newly revealed tools, everything people do or say around their phones and TV\u2019s can create a very revealing and intimate picture of people\u2019s lives.\n\nI reached Andy Yen, Proton Mail CEO, for a comment.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Protonmail, Vault7)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vault7", "topic_name": "Vault7"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wikileaks", "topic_name": "Wikileaks"}]}, {"news_name": "WikiLeaks releases documents detailing CIA hacking tools and capabilities", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56958/intelligence/wikileaks-cia-hacking-tools.html", "title": "WikiLeaks releases documents detailing CIA hacking tools and capabilities\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 7, 2017", "body": "WikiLeaks announced on Tuesday that it has obtained thousands of files allegedly originating from a high-security network of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nThe huge trove of data, called \u201cVault 7,\u201d exposed the hacking capabilities of the US Intelligence Agency and its internal infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe first full part of the series, \u201cYear Zero\u201d, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA\u2019s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina.\u201d reads the announcement issued by WikiLeaks by Wikileaks.\n\n\u201cRecently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized \u201czero day\u201d exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wikileaks, the precious archive appears to have been circulated among former US government experts and contractors in an unauthorized manner.

Not so bad \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe River City Media company used many illegal hacking techniques to target send spam messages to as many users as possible.\n\nOne of these techniques is the Slowloris attack, a method that is used to paralyze a web server rather than subvert it in this manner.\n\n\u201cPurposely throttling your own machinery to amass open connections on someone else\u2019s server is a type of Slowloris attack [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)]. The twist here is that the spammer is not trying to completely disable the receiving server, he is only temporarily stressing the resources in order to overwhelm and force the processing of bulk email.\u201d Vickery explained in a blog post.\n\nVickery defined illegal the hacking activity of the RCM due to the presence of scripts and logs enumerating the groups\u2019 many missions to probe and exploit vulnerable mail servers. The leaked backusp include chat log in which personnel at the company admit and describe the adoption of hacking methods.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn that screenshot, a RCM co-conspirator describes a technique in which the spammer seeks to open as many connections as possible between themselves and a Gmail server. This is done by purposefully configuring your own machine to send response packets extremely slowly, and in a fragmented manner, while constantly requesting more connections.\u201d\n\nThe expert has shared details of RSM\u2019s operations with other parties, including Microsoft, Apple, Salted Hash, Spamhaus and of course law enforcement.\n\nTo block the activity of the group, Spamhaus announced the blacklisting of the entire infrastructure used by the RCM from its Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) database.

Aadhaar system has the capability to inquire into any instance of misuse of biometrics and identity theft and initiate action.\u201d\n\nAnother hypothesis on the possible origin of the huge trove of data is China which the only other country with a so big archive (1.37bn identities is China). Which brings us to other candidates, namely:\n\nGiving a look at the private sector, a limited number of companies have databases with a similar dimension.\n\nFacebook, WhatsApp, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, the Chinese WeChat and the Tencent platforms IM QQ and social network Qzone.\n\nEl Reg also speculated the involvement of a data harvesting company.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Oracle, Salesforce and Wayin have colossal databases of individuals and businesses they sell to marketers and others, and claim to have hundreds of millions of records.

It\u2019s not unusual to find garbage, corrupt data, mislabeled data or just crazy non-conforming data\u2026but the format of the data this time was confusing enough that I spent some time trying to debug what had gone wrong, wondering if it was a bug in my code. In fact, the data was bizarre enough that some colleagues around the Project Zero office even got intrigued.\u201d Ormandy wrote in a security advisory. \u201cWe fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major cloudflare-hosted sites from other users. Once we understood what we were seeing and the implications, we immediately stopped and contacted cloudflare security.\u201d\n\nCloudflare have been leaking customer HTTPS sessions for months. Uber, 1Password, FitBit, OKCupid, etc. https://t.co/wjwE4M3Pbk\n\n\u2014 Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) February 23, 2017\n\n\n\nThe Cloudbleed security issue in Cloudflare servers has a significant impact on numerous major organizations, including Uber, Fitbit, 1Password, and OKCupid. Cloudbleed also affects mobile apps, because, they are developed using the same backends as browsers for content delivery and HTTPS (SSL/TLS) termination.\n\n\u201cLast Friday, Tavis Ormandy from Google\u2019s Project Zero contacted Cloudflare to report a security problem with our edge servers. He was seeing corrupted web pages being returned by some HTTP requests run through Cloudflare.\u201d reads a blog post published by Cloudflare\u2019s CTO, John Graham-Cumming\n\n\u201cIt turned out that in some unusual circumstances, which I\u2019ll detail below, our edge servers were running past the end of a buffer and returning memory that contained private information such as HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data. And some of that data had been cached by search engines.\u201d\n\n\n\nGoogle has started removing cached copies of the leaked data, unfortunately, the same information is still stored in the servers of many other search engines that are accessible to everyone.\n\nCloudflare promptly responded to the incident, the company disabled the following features on its infrastructure because they leverage the broken HTML parser chain that is the root cause of the issue:\n\nThe root cause of Cloudbleed was that \u201creaching the end of a buffer was checked using the equality operator and a pointer was able to step past the end of the buffer.\u201d \u201cHad the check been done using >= instead of == jumping over the buffer end would have been caught,\u201d explained Cumming.\n\nThe Cloudbleed issue dates back September 22, 2016, when the problem begun for the company. The greatest period of impact was between February 13 and February 18 with almost one in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests via Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage, (roughly 0.00003% of requests).\n\n\u201cThe bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines. We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence.\u201d continues the post published by Cloudflare. \u201cThe greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage (that\u2019s about 0.00003% of requests).\u201d\n\nIt is very curious the fact that Cloudflare pointed Ormandy to the company bug bounty programme, offering the expert a reward of a t-shirt instead of financial compensation.\n\nWe cannot exclude that a threat actor discovering the Cloudbleed flaw may have been actively exploiting it, but at the time I was writing there is no evidence of such kind of attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cloudbleed , hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloudbleed", "topic_name": "Cloudbleed"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloudflare", "topic_name": "CloudFlare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-leak", "topic_name": "data leak"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Yahoo notifies users hackers are forging \u201ccookies\u201d to take over their accounts", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56321/breaking-news/yahoo-breach-notifications.html", "title": "Yahoo notifies users hackers are forging \u201ccookies\u201d to take over their accounts\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 16, 2017", "body": "Yahoo confirmed it was notifying some users of sophisticated cyber attacks aimed to compromise their accounts.\n\nThe hackers are adopting hacking methods to forge \u201ccookies\u201d or files used in the authentication process, instead of stealing their passwords.\n\nThe IT giant disclosed the alarming data in response to the massive data breach disclosed last year that created serious problems for the company.\n\nYahoo has sent the notifications to \u201ca reasonably final list\u201d of users that were potentially affected, the message sent via email reads:\n\n\u201cwe believe a forged cookie may have been used in 2015 or 2016 to access your account.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we have previously disclosed, our outside forensic experts have been investigating the creation of forged cookies that could have enabled an intruder to access our users\u2019 accounts without a password,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has identified user accounts for which we believe forged cookies were taken or used.\u201d\n\nThe attackers forged cookies that \u201ccould allow an intruder to access users\u2019 accounts without a password,\u201d said the email to users.

Media speculated the involvement of state-sponsored hacked.\n\n\n\nIn October, a former company executive revealed the number of affected user accounts in the Yahoo data breach may be between 1 Billion and 3 Billion.\n\nIn December Yahoo admitted crooks have stolen details of more than a billion user accounts. In 2013, hackers broke into the systems of Yahoo and accessed one billion user accounts containing names, addresses, phone numbers, and hashed passwords easy to crack. The passwords were protected with MD5 hashing algorithm that is easy to crack, the leaked data also include some encrypted and cleartext security questions and answers have been compromised too.\n\nThe data breaches suffered by Yahoo had an impact on the sale of the company to telecom giant Verizon for $4.8 billion. Initially, Verizon requested a discount of 1 Billion of the price, now it seems that the two companies had agreed to discount the price by $250 million to $300 million following disclosure of the data breach.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cybercrime, data breach)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahoo", "topic_name": "Yahoo"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/yahoo-data-breach", "topic_name": "Yahoo Data Breach"}]}, {"news_name": "Russian hacker Rasputin breaches over 60 Universities and Government Agencies", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56312/hacking/russian-hacker-rasputin-attacks.html", "title": "Russian hacker Rasputin breaches over 60 Universities and Government Agencies\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 15, 2017", "body": "According to the threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, a Russian-speaking black hat hacker, known as \u2018Rasputin\u2018, hacked systems of more than 60 universities and U.S. Government agencies.\n\n\n\nWe met Rasputin in December 2016, when he was offering for sale stolen login credentials for a U.S. agency that tests and certifies voting equipment, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC). Rasputin uses to exploit SQL injection flaws to gain access to sensitive information that he can sell on cybercrime marketplaces.\n\nRasputin uses SQL injection vulnerabilities to compromise target systems and steal sensitive information that he offers for sale cybercrime black markets.\n\nRecord Future has been following Rasputin since 2015, according to the security firm he may also have tried to sell details about the SQL injection to a broker working on behalf of a Middle Eastern government.\n\nBased on Rasputin\u2019s historical criminal forum activity, the experts exclude he is sponsored by a foreign government.\n\nResearchers at Recorded Future identified many of the Rasputins\u2019 victims, including ten universities in the United Kingdom, over two dozen universities in the United States, and many US government agencies.\n\nThe hacker breached the systems of government agencies includes local, state and federal organizations. The list of victims includes the Postal Regulatory Commission, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThere are plenty of free tools that can be used to find and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities, including Havij, Ashiyane SQL Scanner, SQL Exploiter Pro, SQLI Hunter, SQL Inject Me, SQLmap and SQLSentinel.Rasputin has been using a SQL injection tool that he developed himself.\n\nRasputin doesn\u2019t use free SQL injection scanners, he has been using a SQL injection tool that he developed himself instead.\n\n\u201cFinancial profits motivate actors like Rasputin, who have technical skills to create their own tools to outperform the competition in both identifying and exploiting vulnerable databases. \u201d reads the analysis published by Recorded Future.\n\nExperts from Recorded Future highlighted that while the level of awareness of SQL injection vulnerabilities is high, the organizations lack basic secure coding practices.\n\nRecorded Future pointed out that addressing these types of flaws can often be costly, for this reason companies use to postpone the fixing activities until the budget is available, but sometimes it is too late.\n\n\u201cSQLi vulnerabilities are simple to prevent through coding best practices.

The advances of defenders have been the result of the superiority of attackers in:\n\nMalware remains the principal cyber-threat in 2016, the number of samples reached ca. 600 million per quarter, mobile malware (reaches a growth of ca. 150%) and ransomware have monopolized the threat landscape. Web based attacks and web application attacks follow malware in the Top 15, no change has been observed respecting 2015.\n\nWeb based attacks include malicious URLs, compromised domains, browser exploits and drive-by attacks.\n\n\u201cWeb based attacks are those that use web components as an attack surface. As web components we understand parts of the web infrastructure, such as web servers, web clients (browsers) content management systems (CMS) and browser extensions\u201d states the report.\n\nThe category of web application attacks includes classic techniques like cross-site scripting and SQL-injection (SQLi) that anyway continues to be a privileged attack vector of threat actors.  In the fourth place there are the Botnets, these infrastructures are an essential component for a large number of cyber attacks.\n\nThe DDoS attacks reached the fourth place, it is the result of extortion activities and the availability in the criminal underground of DDoS-for-hire services that offer to wannabe hackers all the necessary to launch powerful attack.\n\n\n\nThe report also provides an interesting analysis of top threat actors observed in 2016, Cyber-criminals, insiders, cyber spies, hacktivists, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists and script kiddies operate with different techniques, but in many cases the observed an overlap of their TTPs caused by the evolution of the crime-as-service model.\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 also associated the various threat to the above threat agents, an interesting exercize that allowed us to better profile the attackers.\n\n\n\nBased on the material ENISA\u2019s experts collected, the report provided our conclusions for policy makers, businesses, and research.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the cyber-threat landscape is receiving significant high-level attention: it is on the agenda of politicians in the biggest industrial countries.

Nearly 17 percent of users are safeguarding their accounts with \u201c123456.\u201d What really perplexed us is that so many website operators are not enforcing password security best practices.\u201d states the report published by Keeper Security. \u201cWe scoured 10 million passwords that became public through data breaches that happened in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe bad news is that the list of most popular passwords hasn\u2019t changed over the years.\n\n\u201cThe list of most frequently used passwords has changed little over the past few years. That means that user education has limits.\u201d continues the study.\n\nThis aspect highlights the lack of a security policy that contemplates also the use of strong passwords and enforces it. Four of the top 10 passwords on the list are composed of just six characters or shorter, it\u2019s very easy to brute force them it the system is not properly protected.\n\n\u201ctoday\u2019s brute-force cracking software and hardware can unscramble those passwords in seconds. Website operators that permit such flimsy protection are either reckless or lazy.\u201d\n\nThe list also includes passwords like \u201c1q2w3e4r\u201d and \u201c123qwe,\u201d it is likely that some users attempt to use unpredictable patterns to generate strong passwords. Unfortunately dictionary-based password crackers include these variations.\n\nThe last point emerged from the report is that email providers don\u2019t correcly monitor the use of their services made by botnet used for spam.\n\n\u201cSecurity expert Graham Cluley believes that the presence of seemingly random passwords such as \u201c18atcskd2w\u201d and \u201c3rjs1la7qe\u201d on the list indicates that bots use these codes over and over when they set up dummy accounts on public email services for spam and phishing attacks.\u201d states the report.\n\n\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 authentication, data breach)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/passwords", "topic_name": "passwords"}]}, {"news_name": "Israeli mobile phone data extraction company Cellebrite was hacked", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55295/data-breach/cellebrite-hacked.html", "title": "Israeli mobile phone data extraction company Cellebrite was hacked\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 13, 2017", "body": "An irony of fate, the Israeli mobile phone data extraction company Cellebrite was hacked.

Other well-known brands have been impacted by this group but the data stolen from them is not currently available for sale or validation in the underground, as of the writing of this report.\u201d states a blog post published by InfoArmor.\n\nExperts from InfoArmor confirmed that the first hacker who offered for sale the huge trove of data is a threat actor nicknamed \u201ctessa88,\u201d he acted as a proxy between the actual bad actors.\n\nThe presence of tessa88 as a mediator allowed the hackers who breached the company to mask their identity.\n\n\u201ctessa88, registered on several underground communities, was the first to mention that Yahoo account credentials were available for sale.

Unless I\u2019m missing a fundamental piece of the workflow (and I\u2019m certainly open to suggestions on what this might be), it looks like accountability almost certainly lies with one of these two parties.\u201d\n\nHunt contacted both companies for a comment that denied any incident after forensic investigations.\n\nIf you want to check if your data are included in the dump , visit the breach notification service website managed by Hunt, the popular https://haveibeenpwned.com/.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Financial Records, Data Breach)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Over 33 Million QIP.ru accounts hacked compromised in an old data breach", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51118/data-breach/qip-data-breach.html", "title": "Over 33 Million QIP.ru accounts hacked compromised in an old data breach\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 9, 2016", "body": "Once again we are here to discuss a data breach, the victim is the Russian instant messaging service Quiet Internet Pager (QIP.ru.).

The precious data were stored in an unprotected server exposed online.\n\nThe database containing US voters \u2019 data was discovered on December 20th, Vickery provided all the details about his disconcerting discovery to DataBreaches.net. The archive includes over 191 Million Americans\u2019 personal identifying information (PII).\n\nVickery also found his own information in the database containing 300GB of voters\u2019 data.\n\n\u201cMy immediate reaction was disbelief,\u201d Vickery said. \u201cI needed to know if this was real, so I quickly located the Texas records and ran a search for my own name.

Data could be used in spear phishing attacks or any other scam scheme.\n\nIn April 2016, Vickery discovered on Amazon\u2019s AWS online a 132 GB database containing 93.4 million Mexican voter records.

These predictions go back several years and seemingly each year, attention to the healthcare sector has been minimal at best, but we may finally have hit an inflection point in 2016.\n\nThe healthcare sector is a labyrinth of governance and compliance with risk mitigations squarely focused on the privacy of patient data.  We in the industry have accepted the norm that \u201csecurity is not convenient\u201d but for those in the healthcare industry, inconvenience can have a catastrophic impact on a hospital, including the loss of a patient\u2019s life.  Besides patient records, there\u2019s a multitude of other services critical to patient health and wellbeing wrapped by an intricate web of cutting-edge and legacy technologies making it perhaps the most challenging environment to secure.  This may explain the rise in attacks against healthcare providers in the last six months.\n\nAccording to an article on fastcompany.com\u2019s website, complete medical records are selling for US$60 apiece on the dark web compared to stolen credit card selling for about US$3 bucks a piece on the high end. According to the article, one hacker claimed to have over a million full medical records of individuals. Although the individual\u2019s claims were not verified, it should come as no surprise.  Sadly, it may be a more dire situation than we know.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Brookings Institute, since 2009, the medical information of more than 155 million.  The report delves into a number of statistics that really punctuate the problem showing the number of incidents sharply increasing in late 2014 and continuing its ascent upward each year.  The report also outlines other unique significant challenges citing the large volumes of data being for long period of time much of it stored digitally.  This, coupled with the explosion of spending on technologies to handle digital health records, many hospitals are doing what they can to keep their heads above water deploying new technologies that have been mandated upon them rather than a phased approach commensurate with staffing levels.\n\nIt\u2019s not just core network services causing concern.  ICS-CERT recently released an advisory identifying numerous vulnerabilities in Philips Xper-IM Connect systems running Windows XP.   Xper-IM is an automated software composition tool that provides physio- monitoring capabilities along with reporting, scheduling, inventory, and data management.\n\nAccording to the advisory, the breakdown of vulnerabilities by CVSA scores are as follows:\n\nThough mitigating the vulnerability may be as simple as upgrading off of Windows XP, the fact that XP is still out in the wild may be further evidence that the healthcare industry is falling behind in protecting itself from cyber criminals.\n\nIn January of this year, Melbourne\u2019s largest hospital network was significantly impacted when a computer virus affected the hospitals Windows XP systems disrupting meal delivery and pathology results. Manual workarounds such as fax machines were utilized as a contingency but the use of those devices only compounds the issues of patient privacy.  It\u2019s those types of disruptions that really jeopardize the patient privacy and even safety.  It\u2019s hard to determine how many medical devices and critical services in the healthcare industry are still running Windows XP in their environments, but it is likely a number many would shudder to think about.\n\nIt is likely healthcare breaches will continue to grow upward.  Funding and prioritization of initiatives are only the tip of the iceberg for healthcare institutions looking to secure their networks.  Even on a solid footing, the sector will be confronted with a shortage of talent to carry out even the best-intended plans.  In the meantime, patients, often unaware of the risk associated with their medical care, have to become better informed about how to protect their health records and personal identity in the event their information finds itself on the dark web up for sale to the highest bidder.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

I personally consider useful for companies to operate a bounty program, a flaw reported by white hat hacker could allow any firm to save million of dollar losses resulting from a data breach.\n\n \n\nUPDATE July 10th, 2016\n\nI reached the Security Researcher at the Cylance SPEAR Team Brian Wallace (@botnet_hunter) for a comment:\n\n\u201cAs a security researcher and an Amazon customer, I had a natural curiosity about the supposed breach. Upon inspecting the data, I found that the data did not match expectations of normal user data. The email addresses for the user accounts all appear to match the same format. The format consists of the first initial, then last name followed by a random sequence of letter and numbers. Additionally, all of the email addresses resided on only gmail.com, yahoo.com, or hotmail.com. Seeing that, I counted up the occurrences of each domain used, and found that of the three domains, each one showed up roughly one third of the time. This is not what one would expect to see in a data dump, but this is what one would expect to see if these three domains were picked at random 83,899 times. Given this evidence that the data was generated, I continued to look for further evidence that the information was not representative of legitimate users.\n\nThe data provides values for the \u201clast IP\u201d of the user, presumably representing the IP address of the user the last time they logged in. Upon inspecting the IP addresses, I found that a large majority of the IP addresses belong to ColoCrossing, a company which provides datacenters as a service. While it is likely that some Amazon users may be connecting from datacenters, one would expect that these would be the vast minority, and not the majority.\n\nWhen inspecting the \u201cuser_agent\u201d field, presumably the User Agent field provided by the web browser of the user the last time they logged in, I found this also did not represent legitimate user behavior. Similarly to the email domains, it appears that these user agents were picked from a short list at random, as the counts of each user agent were roughly equal. Normally, one would expect to some popular browsers, some unpopular browsers, and far more than 22 different user agents.\n\nThe passwords listed in the data are also not representative of legitimate users. All passwords appear to consist of random upper case letters and numbers, with no words and no occurrences of popular passwords. One may assume that some users may randomly generate passwords, but it is exceedingly unlikely that all 83,899 users generated passwords in the same way.\n\nI have not tested any of these user accounts on Amazon.com as that could potentially incur legal risk.\n\nBased on this evidence, I believe the data released is not representative of actual Amazon users, but instead this information was generated. It is not clear whether this information was generated by the individual who released the information, or if it was generated by a third party, and that information was then obtained by the individual who released it.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 hacking, data breach)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/0x2taylor", "topic_name": "0x2Taylor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/amazon", "topic_name": "Amazon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "PoS systems infected in 1 in 20 Wendy\u2019s stores, credit card exposed", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49162/data-breach/wendys-breach.html", "title": "PoS systems infected in 1 in 20 Wendy\u2019s stores, credit card exposed\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 8, 2016", "body": "The hack suffered by Wendy\u2019s fast-food chain was bigger than thought and exposed sensitive information, including credit card data.\n\nRoughly one on three Wendy\u2019s burger was hacked, a malware has infected PoS systems.

On Monday, CERT-Bund, Germany\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team for federal agencies, released a warning that corporate executives may be being targeted with malicious emails using information likely gained by hackers as a result of the 2012 breach.\n\nCERT-Bund released a screenshot via its twitter feed, of an email containing a fake invoice targeting a business executive at an undisclosed organization.\n\n.@certbund Namen und Unternehmenspositionen in den Mails sind nach unseren Stichproben konsistent mit \u00f6ffentlichen LinkedIn-Profilen.\n\n\u2014 CERT-Bund (@certbund) 6 giugno 2016\n\n\n\nAn examination of the increased in spear-phishing attempts is consistent with credentials leaked in the 2012 LinkedIn breach, according to CERT-Bund.  Johannes Ullrich, of the SANS Internet Storm Center, confirmed reports of users receiving emails that match the same pattern reported by CERT-Bund.\n\n\n\nThe increased malicious activity comes on the heels of a recent discovery of a Russian hacker going by \u201cPeace\u201d selling 117 million email and password combinations, a staggering number more than the 6.5 million originally reported, for five bitcoins, or about US$2,300.  Clearly, nothing peaceful is coming from this latest disclosure.\n\nAccording to Netherland\u2019s based Fox-IT, hackers behind these spear-phishing attempts are able to craft very personalized emails using the target\u2019s first name, last name, role, and company name to deliver a malicious Word document.\n\nWhen an unsuspecting victim opens the attached Word document, the document appears to be scrambled and instructs the victim to launch a Macro to unscramble the document.  Unfortunately, the Macro reached out to a likely infected website and quietly downloads the Zeus Panda banking Trojan on the victim\u2019s machine.\n\nPanda Banker has many similarities to the now infamous Zeus banking Trojan. The source code was linked several years ago and has resulted in the development of several banking Trojans that have plagued the financial sector over the past year.  Panda Banker uses fast flux DNS to protect its infrastructure from a coordinated takedown from law enforcement, such as happened to the DRIDEX malware in 2015.\n\nPanda Banker has another capability in common with Zeus and that its use of automatic transfer systems (ATSs).  Like the Zeus and SpyEye malwares, Panda Banker leverages ATSs in conjunction with Webinject files as an additional tool to steal a victim\u2019s personal banking information.  Webinject files are JavaScript and HTML code in a text file that allows a hacker to inject specific code into a victim\u2019s browser.  This allows the hacker to tailor their attacks through the use of pop-ups to get a victim to reveal their credentials for a specific website.\n\nThe underground hacking forums are littered with developers that leverage ATS for Webinjects.  According to TrendMicro\u2019s report in 2012, ATS creators were actively selling generic ATSs targeting European banks that could be modified for a fee.   This, along with a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d in the business world in the form of easily acquired LinkedIn credentials, has created a unique and most likely profitable opportunity for hackers.\n\nIt is likely that attacks resulting from the LinkedIn breach are going to continue to plague many executives across the globe, particularly in regions where the hackers are comfortable working in such as Europe and North America; however, countries with emerging markets with immature security practices are likely to targets as well, particularly Brazil where the 2016 Summer Olympics will likely draw many corporate sponsors to a single location.  Kaspersky Labs has reported that South America suffered from more than 400 million cyber related incidents in 2015 alone.\n\nSo where does that leave LinkedIn?  Hard to say. The company is still urging that users enable its two-factor authentication (TFA) but compliance with that edict may be hard to get user buy-in particularly, when users dislike friction caused by security.  For LinkedIn, it\u2019s a hard choice. Do you mandate TFA for all users and lose market share, or do security practitioners continue to warn the C-Suite of \u201ccaveat emptor,\u201d that what may be a good way to stay connected with your peers, LinkedIn also serves as a one-stop-shop for hackers eyeing on who to make you their latest victim.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

Neither do we have any information that would suggest that there is a security hole in TeamViewer. Therefore it it is important to stress there are no TeamViewer hackers, but rather data thieves that will steal information from other sources. It is critical to make sure attention is not diverted from the real issue.\u201d states the official note released by TeamViewer.\n\nI believe that the explanation provided by the company is plausible due to the recent major breaches, including the one suffered by MySpace and LinkedIn\n\n\u201cTeamViewer is safe to use, because TeamViewer has proper security measures in place including end-to-end encryption to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, anti-brute-force means, and more.\u201d continues TeamViewer,\n\nTeamViewer urges its users to adopt a strong, unique passwords and enable the two-factor authentication on their accounts. Wait a moment, but I told you before that users reported alleged hack even when the 2FA was enabled.\n\nAnother mysterious circumstance is a service outage suffered by TeamViewer on Wednesday, an incident that someone linked to an alleged cyber attack.\n\nStay Tuned \u2026\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

The social networking site that caters to professionals and their social peer groups suffered and breach of nearly 6.5 million users.  The attack was attributed to Russian hackers who were soliciting help with the decryption of the stolen credentials through crowd-sourcing efforts, according to some news reports.  In response, LinkedIn quickly patched its applications and apologized for the problems.\n\nFast forward to today where a hacker going by the name of \u201cPeace\u201d was discovered trying to sell 117 million LinkedIn credentials, some 110.5 million more accounts than reporting in the 2012 attack, for the price of 5 bitcoin, equivalent to US$2250.\n\nBreaches compromising user accounts in the millions are becoming more and more frequent and LinkedIn latest problems are just one in a long line of reported breaches but this latest breach also has revealed that end user education is either failing miserably, or end users simply do not care about protecting their personal information.\n\nAccording to the security research firm Kore Logic, an analysis of some 177.5 million unsalted SHA1 password hashes contained on 61.82 million unique hashes indicating 115.68 million passwords were duplicates.[1]  Of course, the usual suspected passwords were discovered such as 123456, which according to Kore Logic\u2019s analysis has been used 1.135 million times!  In fact, several combinations of the 123 convention round out the top ten most used passwords including 123456789, 12345678, and the very clever 1234567.  111111, Linkedin, and password also appear on the list.\n\nLinkedIn has urged its users to enable two-factor authentication for their accounts but it is unlikely, considering the blatantly obvious disregard for even basic password security such as choosing complex passwords, the message will be taken seriously.   As a result of this latest release of information, if proven authentic, it is likely that users will see an increase in other attacks where email and passwords can be used to gain access to accounts other than LinkedIn, such as web-based email services and other personal accounts.\n\n\n\nBut this latest release of LinkedIn credentials foreshadows another headache for the security community.  Over the past year or so, reports have surfaced through the security community that hackers have been targeting LinkedIn users to gain access to specific communities of interest, those groups of people with special skills and unique insights into all sorts of industries such as the Nordic SCADA Security group, a region of the world that has seen an increased number of attacks on critical infrastructure.  For those threat actors looking for reconnaissance opportunities specific to that region of the world, they may only need to put up the 5 BTC to the hacker Peace to get access to a treasure of information.\n\nUltimately, the single-factor password schemes are no different than the old skeleton keys of yesteryear \u2013 designed only to keep the honest people out.   Maybe the solution to the never ending garbage password paradigm lies in mandated two-factor authentication, though I\u2019m not big on adding the burden of cost to a service that is essentially free if you choose not to buy a premium membership.  For LinkedIn, a site that caters specifically to professionals, perhaps two-factor authentication should be an \u201copt-out\u201d option rather than an \u201copt-in\u201d kind of nice to have, strongly suggested feature.  As professionals, we should know better, but as Kore Logic is revealing, professionals don\u2019t like the friction of added security online any less than they do in business networks.  Until the password succumbs to its long, anguishing death, and perhaps eventual death we\u2019ll be having this conversation again and again.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

The data stored in folders, includes banking information such as: QNB user profiles, photographs, phone numbers, payment card details, email and physical addresses, banking information, payment card details, email addresses and passwords of clients. Some of the names are said to be linked to government organizations, including intelligence agencies, in Qatar and other countries. One of the folders contained information on media company \u2018Al Jazeera\u2019.\n\nQatar National Bank claims some of the leaked information was pulled from \u201cnon-QNB sources\u201d. According to the bank, \u201cwhile some of the data recently released in the public domain may be accurate, much of it was constructed and contains a mixture of information from the attack as well as other non-QNB sources, such as personal data from social media channels,\u201d it\u2019s statement read.  The statement goes further to say, \u201cwe believe the nature of this incident is fundamentally an attempted attack on QNB Group\u2019s reputation and not specifically targeted at our customers,\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll our customers\u2019 accounts are secure, and as always, we encourage customers to be vigilant, taking the usual precautions of frequently changing their usernames and passwords through QNB Group internet banking.\u201d\n\nQatar National Bank (QNB) was established in 1964 as the country\u2019s first Qatari-owned commercial bank.

Though the bank was able to recover some of the money, but $81 million that were transferred to the Philippines remain missing.\n\nExperts at BAE Systems, a renowned British defense, security and aerospace firm revealed a while ago that the Bangladesh central bank cyber-attackers seem to have deployed custom-made malware which enabled them to channel fraudulent transfers without being spotted.\n\nThe aforementioned incidents underscore the global proliferation of cyber-attacks and the need for organizations to ramp up their cybersecurity measures.

Web based attacks include malicious URLs, compromised domains, browser exploits and drive-by attacks.\n\nThe category of web application attacks includes classic techniques like cross-site scripting and SQL-injection (SQLi).  In the fourth place there are the Botnets, these infrastructures an essential component for a large number of cyber attacks, but in the last year law enforcement has coordinated a significant number of takedowns against many malicious architectures.\n\nIn 2015, the number of DDoS attacks continues to increase, the attacks increased with the volume and also their average duration has increased.\n\nGiving a look at the table below, we can verify that in 2015 the spam decreased once again, despite it still represents a valid vector to spread malware malicious links.\n\n\u201cSpam is in a declining trend since some years now, its importance in the malicious arsenal remained at least almost equal: new methods of \u201cweaponization\u201d of this threat make it a serious threat.

Affinity Gaming, has questioned the way Trustwave conducted their investigation, where they failed to block the intrusion that resulted in the theft of credit card data, and for letting the thieves to maintain their foothold even during the period Trustwave was doing its investigation.\n\nThis is relevant news because this is one of the first cases where a client sued a cyber security firm for lack of quality in its investigation. The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court in Nevada.\n\nThe casino operator hired the security firm at the end of 2013, to assess and clean up its computers.\n\nThe cyber criminals were able to get more than 300.000 credit cards belonging to all the clients of the Affinity Gaming company.\n\nAt the time, the report made by Trustwave in January 2014 indicated that the source of the data breach has been identified, and the malware responsible for the breach was found and contained.\n\nThe problem was that a year later, the casino operator got a second breach, where more payment cards were stolen, a circumstance that raised suspicious from Affinity Gaming side.\n\n\n\nTo investigate the second incident, the Affinity Gaming hired Mandiant, the experts of the firm discovered that the malware detected by Trustwave wasn\u2019t fully removed.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in the December 2015 claims:\n\n\u201cHiring a firm with the proper data breach response expertise, such as Trustwave held itself out to be, was of paramount importance for Affinity Gaming\u2026Affinity isn\u2019t an IT security firm and lacks the level of expertise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect to the apparent data breach, Affinity Gaming was wholly dependent on and subordinate in terms of its understanding, knowledge, and capabilities, to Trustwave, relying on [it] to diagnose, investigate, and prescribe appropriate measures to address.\u201d\n\n\u201cMandiant\u2019s forthright and thorough investigation concluded that Trustwave\u2019s representations were untrue, and Trustwave\u2019s prior work was woefully inadequate. In reality, Trustwave lied when it claimed that its so-called investigation would diagnose and help remedy the data breach when it represented that the data breach was \u201ccontained,\u201d and when it claimed that the recommendations it was offering would address the data breach. Trustwave\u2026failed to identify the means by which the attacker had breached Affinity Gaming\u2019s data security. Thus, Trustwave could not in good faith have made the foregoing representations to Affinity Gaming.\u201d\n\nThe casino operator is demanding an amount of $100,000 in damages to Trustwave.\n\nOn the other side, Trustwave\u2019 spokesperson told to the Financial Times that nothing they have conducted the investigation in the correct way.\n\n\u201cWe dispute and disagree with the allegations in the lawsuit and we will defend ourselves vigorously in court.\u201d.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Affinity Gaming, data breach)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/las-vegas-casino", "topic_name": "Las Vegas Casino"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smart-card", "topic_name": "smart card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trustwave", "topic_name": "Trustwave"}]}, {"news_name": "Canada \u2013 Military data found in hard drive at the recycling depot", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43641/intelligence/hard-drive-military-data.html", "title": "Canada \u2013 Military data found in hard drive at the recycling depot\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 16, 2016", "body": "According to the Canadian CBC, a man named Pete Stevens has found a 30-gigabyte hard drive at a recycling depot in Halifax.

Shoppers can feel confident using credit or debit cards at any of our store locations.\u201d\n\nHowever, yesterday the popular security expert Brian Krebs reported that his sources in the banking industry had detected a pattern of fraud on cards used at America\u2019s Thrift Stores, this means that crooks are already managing the stolen data for fraudulent activities.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, several banking sources say they have seen a pattern of fraud on cards all used at America\u2019s Thrift Stores locations indicating that thieves have been able to use the data stolen from the compromised point-of-sale devices to counterfeit new cards.\u201d said Krebs.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 America\u2019s Thrift Stores, data breach)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach-americas-thrift-stores", "topic_name": "data breach America's Thrift Stores"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pos", "topic_name": "POS"}]}, {"news_name": "The Dow Jones firm confirmed data breach of 3,500 Users", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40910/cyber-crime/down-jones-data-breach.html", "title": "The Dow Jones firm confirmed data breach of 3,500 Users\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 11, 2015", "body": "At the end of the last week, the CEO of Dow Jones & Co disclosed a data breach affecting 3,500 people in a letter to customers.\n\nDow Jones is a media company owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp which owns the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe incident appears similar to one recently affected the Online stock brokerage Scottrade last week which impacted 4.6 million investors.\n\nPart of a news headline announcing that News Corp. has offered to buy Dow Jones for $60 a share is displayed on an electronic \u201czipper\u201d under the Dow Jones logo in Times Square in New York on Tuesday, May 1, 2007.

The breach was designed to stay below the radar of the company\u2019s IT and security teams, using a bot infection to smuggle data out of the organisation.\n\nAccording to statements released by Anthem, the first signs of the attack came in the middle of last week, when an IT administrator noticed a database query was being run using his identifier code when he had not initiated it.  The company determined that an attack had occurred, informed the FBI and hired an external security consultant to investigate.\n\n\n\nInvestigators reported that customized malware was used to infiltrate Anthem\u2019s networks and steal data.  The exact malware type was not disclosed but is reported to be a variant of a known family of hacking tools.  However, an independent security consultancy reports that the attack may have been started up to three months earlier.  The consultancy said that it noticed \u2018botnet type activity\u2019 at Anthem affiliate companies back in November 2014.\n\nThis would not be surprising, as long-term bot activity is commonplace in enterprises.  Check Point\u2019s 2014 Security Report, based on monitored events at over 10,000 organisations worldwide, found that at least one bot was detected in 73% of companies, up from 63% the year before.  77% of bots were active for over four weeks and typically communicated with their \u2018command & control\u2019 every three minutes.\n\nBots are able to avoid detection because their developers use obfuscation tools to enable them to bypass traditional signature-based antimalware solutions.  As such, threat emulation, also known as sandboxing, should be used as an additional layer of defence to stop bots before they can infect networks.  Anti-bot solutions should also be deployed to help discover bots, and prevent further breaches by blocking their communications.\n\nIt\u2019s also important that organisations segment their networks, separating each segment with layers of security to prevent bot infections spreading widely.  Segmentation can contain infections in one area of the network, mitigating the risks of the infection accessing and breaching sensitive data in other network segments.\n\nWith these three preventative approaches, companies can dramatically reduce their exposure to the type of slow, stealthy bot attack that appears to have struck Anthem, and avoid being the victim of such a large-scale breach.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nArticle written by the Check Point staff\n\n\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Anthem, Data Breach)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anthem", "topic_name": "Anthem"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/check-point", "topic_name": "Check Point"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/personal-data", "topic_name": "personal data"}]}, {"news_name": "Target retailer investigating data breach involving 40M card accounts", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/20605/cyber-crime/target-data-breach-40m-accounts.html", "title": "Target retailer investigating data breach involving 40M card accounts\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 20, 2013", "body": "Nearly 40 Million credit and debit card accounts belonging to customers of American retailing company Target may have been stolen during the traditional holiday shopping season.\n\nThe news has been provided by the company with a public statement published, all the users who have shopped at Target\u2019s stores during the Black Friday weekend are advised.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make you aware of unauthorized access to Target payment card data. The unauthorized access may impact guests who made credit or debit card purchases in our U.S. stores from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15, 2013.\u201d \u201d Additionally, Target alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately after we discovered and confirmed the unauthorized access, and we are putting our full resources behind these efforts.\u201d states the advisory.\n\nAt risk are all those customers who made purchases by swiping their cards at terminals in the stores of the Target company during the above period.\n\nCredit and debit card numbers are precious commodities sold in the underground, numerous black markets offer them to criminal gangs that need to prepare bogus cards for scams.\n\nJust to provide you an idea of the value of a similar information I report the price list from the study proposed by security experts Stewart from Dell SecureWorks and independent researcher David Shearhave who explored online underground marketplace for stolen data.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAs usual, the excellent Brian Krebs of KrebsOnSecurity produced a detailed description of the events clarifying that the possible victims of the alleged data breach don\u2019t include online shoppers.\n\nTarget hasn\u2019t provided further information on the incident, but anyway it has reassured its customers announcing that it has fixed the issue that caused the problem and credit card account holders can continue shopping.\n\nKrebOnSecurity remarked that it\u2019s not clear how many card thieves may have stolen in the breach, but sources from two major card issuers said they have so far been notified by one of the credit card associations regarding more than one million of cards total from both issuers that were thought to have been compromised in the breach.\n\n\u201cA third source at a data breach investigation firm said it appears that \u201cwhen all is said and done, this one will put its mark up there with some of the largest retail breaches to date.\u201d \u201d reported Brian Krebs.\n\nThis period of the year is very profitable for cyber criminals due to the intensification of shopping activities, due this reason it is necessary to adopt all necessary measures to stay secure.\n\nAs suggested in the statement issued by Target it is necessary to \u201cremain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports\u201d , to early discover ongoing illegal activities.\n\nIf users discover any suspicious activity on their accounts it is indispensable to immediately report to law enforcement and financial institutions.\n\nIn the specific case, it is suggested to the customers of Target to contact the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) or law enforcement to report incidents of identity theft\n\n\u201cTo learn more, you can go to the FTC\u2019s Web site, at www.consumer.gov/idtheft, or call the FTC, at (877) IDTHEFT (438-4338) or write to Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Response Center, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20580.\u201d\n\nJust for curiosity it is interesting to highlight that company\u2019s stock was down more than 2 percent in afternoon trading.\n\nThe breach appears comparable to the one occurred in 2007 to TJ Maxx parent TJX Companies when sensitive data on 45.7 million credit card accounts was harvested from compromised systems within the retailer\u2019s network.\n\nThe TJX company spent years rebuilding its reputation and total damage was estimated to be more than  $256m.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Target, data breach)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/credit-card", "topic_name": "credit card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breach", "topic_name": "data breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/database-breached", "topic_name": "Database Breached"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fraud", "topic_name": "fraud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shopping-season", "topic_name": "shopping season"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/target", "topic_name": "Target"}]}]}]
