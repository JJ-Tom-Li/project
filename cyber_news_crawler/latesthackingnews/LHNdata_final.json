As part of the inauguration CYBERUK security conference, National Cyber Security Center, NCSC, launched a new framework yesterday which comprises of 6 levels.The levels start from a minor individual attack and led all the way up to a huge catastrophic attack on the infrastructure of United Kingdom. Once the attack is identified, the NCSC\u2019s team will use the new framework to not only classify the attack but will also use the appropriate resources and deal with the attack based on its strength.The NCSC director of operations, Paul Chichester says that, \u201cThis new joint approach, developed in partnership with UK law enforcement, will strengthen the UK\u2019s ability to respond to the significant, growing and diverse cyber threats we face. The new system will offer an improved framework for dealing with incidents, especially as GDPR and the NIS Directive come into force shortly.\u201dThe categories of the attack range from one to six and are based upon the impact and the strength.During an attack such as level 6, NCSC will lead the response directly and will not only provide on-site support but will also provide remote analysis of the attack, The highest level of attack is level 1 and is a \u201cNational cyber emergency\u201d- this type of attack will disrupt infrastructures such as the power grid, hospitals, utilities and according to NCSC head Ciaran Martin- UK will face such an attack sooner or later.Ciaran Martin claims that the consequences of a category one attack will include \u201csevere economic or social consequences or to loss of life.\u201dThe framework made by the NCSC is as follows:Defined as: A cyber-attack which causes sustained disruption of UK essential services or affects UK national security, leading to severe economic or social consequences or to loss of life.Who Responds? : Immediate, rapid and coordinated cross-government response. Strategic leadership from Ministers / Cabinet Office (COBR), tactical cross-government coordination by NCSC, working closely with Law EnforcementWhat Do They Do: Coordinated on-site presence for evidence gathering, forensic acquisition and support.

There were many other videos too that were defaced.Who Are The Hackers?The group behind the hack calls itself as Prosox and Kuroi\u2019sh. They changed the official Vevo\u2019s image with a gang of masked individuals carrying guns (an image from Casa De Papel, a Netflix show).Reports say that the account was pretty easy to hack as there was no proper security on this account, including a lack of two-factor authorization. This is because most corporate accounts do not use such security as it can make it difficult to run a page.Which Other Music Videos Were Compromised?Following the removal of Despacito, there was a chain of defacing music videos which included a few of Shakira\u2019s music videos, and videos from other singers including Drake, Selena Gomez, Key Perry and even Taylor Swift.

People over the age of 60 are increasingly vulnerable to online scams according to Santander and so they decided to take the over 60s back to school and launched a SAS, Scam Avoidance School to help older people avoid scams and handle this cyber terror.Santander carried out a research amongst people in this age group to figure out what scares them the most when it comes to fraud attacks and scams. They even took help from the expert Dr. Paul Seager who is a Psychology Professor at Lancashire University.This Scam Avoidance School has been designed especially for people over 60s and was rolled out across all of the Santander\u2019s 806 branches last month and asked their staff to deliver which led to \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of people over the age of 60 to book for this course.The lessons SAS School give require interactive studies and even a handout that the people can take away. The handout covers the tricks that scammers use to attract people towards them and the handout even tells them how to spot an email or a text that might be a con. These lessons even cover cashpoint fraud and contactless fraud that the research proved was the main concern for people over 60s.Former Strictly Come Dancing Head Judge, Len Goodman age 73 was the first graduate of Santanders SAS. He not only wanted to do all that he can for people over the age of 60 but he also wanted them to recognize the tricks scammers use. Len Goodman was the first to sign up to this School and had a personal experience of fraud as well, when his daughter-in-law lost \u00a316,000 to these scammers.Santanders research revealed that 64% of people over the age of 60 are worried about the threat of fraud and 53% of people above the age of 60 have been targeted by these scammers. What makes these older people highly susceptible is that they were vulnerable due to a disability or illness (74%), some are financially unaware (54%) and some are left on their own (37%).Those who had fallen into the scam admitted to being ill at the time and Age UK figures shows that those who got defrauded are 2.5 times more likely to either go into residential care or die within a year.The head of fraud strategy at Santander UK, Chris Ainsley commented saying that, \u201c\u201cOur SAS has been developed to address the fact that more needs to be done to help older people who may be vulnerable to falling victim to fraudsters and scammers.

A few hours after, the videos were changed back to their original state.All the artists targeted by the hacker run their YouTube account via Vevo, a multinational video-hosting service established in 2009.

A threat researcher Nick Biasini who works at Cisco\u2019s Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group said in a blog published on Tuesday that \u201cThere have been several incidents in multiple countries which includes some specifically targeting critical infrastructure and have involved the misuse of the Smart Install Protocol.\u201dHe further added saying that as a result of this hacking they are now taking an active stance and are urging customers once again about the \u201celevated risk and available remediation paths\u201d on the Cisco router.On Saturday evening, Cisco claimed that those postings were a tool to help their clients identify the vulnerabilities and learn how to repel a cyber-attack. Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, Iran\u2019s IT Minister posted a picture on twitters which contained the US Flag and the hacker messages and added saying that it is still not clear who carried out the attack.Azari-Jahromi claims that the attack mainly affected India, Europe and the United States as reported by the state.

She even noticed that many of the files on her desktop had been renamed with \u201cimsorry\u201d and \u201cweapologize\u201d extensions.Amanda immediately called the citys chief information security officer to report this unusual problem and left a message. The next call she made was to the help desk and they left her on hold for a while. Amanda soon realized that she wasn\u2019t the only one in the office with this computer problem.These computer problems were all part of a very sophisticated \u201cransomware\u201d cyber-attack on the City of Atlanta. This cyber-attack lasted for two weeks and has yet to be resolved completely. During that time of 2 weeks the metropolis struggled to recover the encrypted data from the employees computers and to restore the services on the municipal Web site.The cyber-criminals at first gave the city only a week to pay a fine of $51,000 in crypto-currency bitcoin to get the key for decrypting their data. This deadline came and went last week however several services still remain offline. Since the website are still knocked off this suggests that the city did not pay the required ransom and when the City Officials were contacted by Scientific American, they refuse to comment.The Department of Watershed Management is still not able to accept online payments for water or sewage bills or any calls; neither can the Department of Finance issue any business licenses through their web page. Even the Atlanta Municipal Court is not able to process any ticket payments online as well as in person due to this outage and they had to reschedule their hearings.According to Anne Torres, Atlanta\u2019s director of communications, Atlanta city took down two of their online services voluntarily for security measures and these services are the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport\u2019 Wi-Fi network and also the took down the ability to process service requests through the citys 311 Web page portal. Both have been restored on Tuesday Morning with the Wi-Fi back on.The ransomeware that attacked Atlanta is called SamSam and like all other malicious virus it enters the computer networks through a software that has not been updated. As soon as the hackers find any vulnerability in a certain network they use the malware to encrypt files and then demand money to unlock the encrypted files.Jake Williams the founder of computer security firm, Rendition Infose says that, \u201cThe SamSam ransomware used to attack Atlanta is interesting because it gets into a network and spreads to multiple computers before locking them up.\u201d He further added saying that the victim then has a greater incentive to pay a large amount of money as ransom to gain back the control of their network and locked computers.SamSam has been the most successful ransomware up till now and has managed to pull $850,000 in ransom money.Source: GIZMODO"}, {"title": "Third Largest Data Breach In Finland", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News"], "authur": "Michael Wight", "date": "April 10, 2018", "body": "More than 130,000 of Finland residents login and passwords got compromised by hackers recently.

US intelligence officials spoke to the Washington Post anonymously and claimed that the Russian agents attacked around 300 computers that were being used by the Olympics Authorities.These Russian agents managed to hack routers and even distributed a new malicious virus leading up to and during the Olympics opening ceremony which was held in Pyeongchang, South Korea.Earlier in the month of February, Olympic officials confirmed that the Games were attacked by cyber-criminals during the opening of the ceremony on February 9th. This cyber-attack resulted in the official Pyeongchang site to go offline and the Wi-Fi networks in the stadium were also disrupted which led to Internet Protocol Televisions (IPTVs) to not work at the Main Press Center.The officials refused to let the public know who was behind this cyber-attack. The cyber security researchers at Cisco\u2019s Talos, CrowdStrike and FireEye have identified this malware as the Olympic Destroyer and they believe that its main aim was to destroy targeted systems and wipe any file on the shared network drives. It also caused the website to shut down for over 2 hours which left many attendees unable to get a ticket for the ceremony.Security experts believe that this attack was carried out to embarrass the organizers and ruin their event instead of stealing data. When speaking to The Post, two US officials claim that Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU, is behind this attack and that the Russians infiltrated 300 computers which had data regarding the Olympics. They also added saying that the GRU made the attack seem like it was carried out by North Korea and their hackers by using North Korean IP address. They said that this tactic is known as the \u2018false-flag operation\u2019.It is still not clear whether the Russians wanted to disrupt the opening ceremony or steal the data. The hackers who did this dirty work are believed to be working for GRU and are the same experts who carried out the NoyPetya cyber-attack. The NoyPetya attack of 2017, took down a large number of computers in Ukraine.Officials believe that this Olympic attack was carried out in retaliation due to the decision made by the International Olympic Committee to ban Russia from the games. This decision was made over the alleged state-sponsored doping scandal. Some Russian athletes did compete in this game but were under a neutral flag as the \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201dUS officials were worried about the closing ceremony of the winter Olympic back then and claimed that they were watching it closely and will help the Koreans as they request it.Prior to the Games, Russia has denied any hand in the Cyber-attacks that targeted the event and tried to disrupt it. The Russian ministry told Reuters at that time, \u201cWe know that Western media are planning pseudo-investigations on the theme of \u2018Russian fingerprints\u2019 in hacking attacks on information resources related to the hosting of the Winter Olympic Games in the Republic of Korea.

The truly paranoid ones freak out about their microphones, some even try to open up their computers and cell phones to try and disable the audio component from their devices so that their device cannot be hijacked and taken over by hacker.A group of Israeli researchers took control of the \u2018spy-versus-spy delusions\u2019 dilemma and introduced a malware that may be able to convert your headphones into a makeshift microphone that will start to record your conversations.\nThe group of Israelis belonging to Israels Ben Gurion University produced a concept code as a piece of proof called \u201cSpeake(a)r\u201d and this was designed to exhibit how hackers will find a way to stealthily hijack your device to record audio and the worst part is that these hackers will be able to record your conversations even when you remove or disable your microphones.This preliminary malware changes the speakers in the ear buds of the headphones and uses it as a microphone. This further leads to converting the vibrations into electromagnetic signals. This allows the cyber-criminals to capture the audio very clearly even from across the room.The research leader of the group from Ben Gurions, Mordechai Guri says that, \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about the vulnerability in privacy. Even if your microphones are removed from your computer- your headphones can help record conversations.\u201dIt comes as no surprise that ear buds can be used as a microphone as well and you can watch many YouTube videos that demonstrate this procedure. The malware which still has no name; used the RealTek audio codec chips and using this chip the Ben Gurion researchers silently repurposed the computers output channel to an input channel. This altering of the channels allowed the malware to record audio even with the headphones plugged into an output only jack.The headphones can be hacked in such a way that they will allow you to record the conversations even without the presence of a microphone channel. The researchers further said that the RealTek chips are incredibly common due to which the attack can work on any desktop computer whether it is based on an iOS or Windows.These eavesdropping attack mostly matter to those who have been cyber-robbed before and have fallen down the hole of obsessive security measures. But in this modern age there are many techniques that can help you get rid of the laptops microphone by putting a tape over it as demonstrated by Mark Zuckerburg and you can even remove the internal mic from your phone. However, Guri claims that none of these techniques can defeat the malware.Until then, paranoiacs must take note and know that if a determined hacker is out to hear your conversations then removal surgery will not work; you will have to unplug the cheap headphones and throw them away.Sources: Independent "}, {"title": "LAPD Twitter Account Was Hacked", "topics": ["Did you know ?", "Hacking News", "News", "Tech"], "authur": "Arslan Butt", "date": "April 5, 2018", "body": "The hacker gained access in to their twitter account to proclaim that the members of the LAPD police force are \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d.

Uber somehow managed to cover up the loss of their information for over a year but here is what we know about this hacking up till now.The ride-hailing company was hacked in such a way that the customer and drivers information was stolen from its system in this security breach. Uber confirmed that they have paid their hackers $100,000 to delete the stolen data and to keep this mess away from public eyes as reported by Bloomberg.Uber\u2019s Chief Executive, Dara Khosrowshahi claimed in a statement \u201cNone of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,\u201d while acknowledging the breach and trying to cover it up. He also said that \u201cWhile I can\u2019t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes.\u201dThese hackers only stole personal data which included their names, email addresses, phone addresses and the name and license number of over 600,000 drivers in the United States. However, highly sensitive information such as credit card numbers, bank account number, birth dates, social security numbers and data location were not compromised and are still secure with the company.Khoswrowshahi also exclaimed that the downloaded and stolen data has been destroyed to provide assurance to their customers and their company has increased their security as well. The company\u2019s failure to notify the affected individuals and regulators has made Uber take some serious steps which included the firing of their two employees that were responsible for the response in 2016.Joe Sullivan Uber\u2019s Chief security officer was one of the employees who left the company as reported by Bloomberg. Chris Hoofnagle from Berkeley Center of Law and Technology agrees that the company\u2019s refusal to unveiling the hacking was an unprofessional move and he says that \u201cTo have direct liability under security breach notification status is to not give notice.\u201dAccording to the Californian State Law, companies are required to notify the resident of the states regarding any breach of their encrypted information and the company must also inform the attorney general if over 500 residents have been affected in any breach or chaos of such kind.An Uber driver from Pittsburgh, Robert Hudge says that \u201cThe hack and the cover-up is typical Uber only caring about themselves\u201d and he said this because he has still not heard from the company and he found out about this breach through the media.

However, this plan was forced to close down on June 19 Monday due to the ransom ware that was discovered on Sunday, June 18.  The production has continued up to today but the data breach left a lasting effect.A spokesperson from Reuters that the virus not only attacked networks in Japan but also in North America, China, Europe and other regions. These regions tried very hard to secure their systems in Mid-May when it was on its peak but still these efforts weren\u2019t enough to stop it.The WannaCry virus found a weak spot in the Sayama plants operational system. The plant was using Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 operating system and the virus used a backdoor to enter the systems and seize it. At first it looked as if the Sayama Plant was the only Honda production facility that was affected but Renault and Nissan were affected in a similar way by WannaCry last month.This caused their production to be stopped forcefully in Britain, India, France and other countries.  Securities have warned these companies that after this attack other iterations of viruses could come in as well. However these plants were not the only thing affected by WannaCry; this virus even affected the traffic camera\u2019s in Australia.The Victoria Police confirmed that the virus wreaked 55 traffic cameras as well as speed cameras that were operated by a third-party, Redflex. The police claimed in a statement that the virus has been detected however the camera system was affected. The police decided to look into the incidents identified by speed and red light camera throughout the time in question. The integrity of the camera system was not affected.The security officials from UK claim that WannaCry ransom ware has ties with a hacking group in North Korea. According to BBC\u2019s report they believe that this attack was launched by a group called Lazarus. This group is strongly connected to North Korea and this is not the first time Lazarus has been connected with ransom ware.Symantex says that it is sure that WannaCry ransom ware is connected to Lazarus. Lazarus is also the cybercrime organization that is responsible for the hack in Sony Pictures and that stole millions of dollars from the Central Bank in Bangladesh.

This online researcher, going by the name of Elliot Alderson showed that the app has very poor security and further claimed that it is super easy to get the password of the database of the app.He claimed that Aadhaar saves your biometric settings in a local database and you can enter in it using a password that you can guess. Aadhaar is in actual fact becoming de facto essential with more and more people trying to link it with banks and phone accounts. The UIDAI officials in Chandigarh were very shocked on this data being accessed and immediately took up the matter with technical consultants.So in short, everyone\u2019s personal information is at a great risk and the only way to stop this from happening is to cause more precautionary measures and better hacking protection.Sources: IndiaTimes."}, {"title": "150 Million MyFitnessPal Users have been hacked", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News", "Uncategorized"], "authur": "Harikrishna Mekala", "date": "March 31, 2018", "body": "According to Under Armour Inc\u2019s statement on Thursday, data of 150 Million users have been hacked.

However, Mathy Vanhoef, an academic researcher from the University of Leuven, believes that the brute-force security in WPA3 will be resolved by switching to a new key exchange protocol called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), or Dragonfly.A few months ago, Vanhoef discovered a serious weakness in the four-way handshake of the WPA2 protocol, which is used by customers who know a Wi-Fi network\u2019s pre-shared key (password) to negotiate an encryption key with the access point.

The moment I noticed the departure board announce that my flight was going to be delayed, I immediately thought, \u201cwhat am I going to do here for four hours?\u201d. As I headed down the hall to the terminal along with dozens of other passengers, almost all of the shops and restaurants in the departures lounge had closed.I asked a passenger sitting across from me, how the free Wi-Fi option measures up. \u201cIs it any good?\u201d He replied in a heavy British accent. \u201cLet me put it like this: I wouldn\u2019t be relying on it if I wanted to do serious work.\u201d Nonetheless, who would pay for premium, when free is available? I thought to myself.So, I came up with an idea! Why not check it out myself, through a little experiment, how many travellers would pay for premium Wi-Fi and how secure is a public network, when internet users exchange sensitive information, credit card number, confidential documents possibly. Man in the middle attack was my plan of attack. This specific method works on the basis of the attacker secretly relaying/ altering the communication between two parties (internet provider and the user), who believe they are directly communicating with each other.One example of man-in-the-middle attacks, in which the attacker makes independent internet hot spot connections with the victim and relays messages between them to make them believe they are connected directly over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. Anyone can imagine that relevant messages passing between the victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point, can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle. That was the plan in my case.First of all, I cloned Heathrows\u2019 \u201cAccess the Internet\u201d site, changing a few things on the welcome screen of the page such as, increase the price from 4 pounds to 8 pounds, reduce free internet time from four hours to 1 hour, . Then I had to implement the payment integration form, allowing potential victims to easily process their credit cards. I simply used my phone as a hot-spot, changed the SSID name to make it similar to the free one the airport emitted in the area and sat back to wait for the first person to join the \u201cfree network\u201d.It took no less than half an hour for someone to connect on my hot-spot and use the standard Wi-Fi free. I had to randomly disconnect few of the active connections on my personal hotspot just to avoid overcharging my phone bill. After one hour, I had my first visitor willing to pay for premium Wi-Fi network and, as simple as that, I had compromised the first credit card. This fake, private hot-spot emitted for at least three hours and gathered approximately 18 credit cards from unsuspecting travellers.  And that was it. Afterwards I dropped the connection and erased the data from my computer.It\u2019s kind of scary how easily I could get the credit card number in a solid format ready for any payment on the web or even sell it in the dark web. A self-described hacker affiliated with the Anonymous post on random darknet site: it is simpler and quicker to buy credit card numbers from villains who hack computers, set up phoney online stores selling non-existent goods at bargain prices, \u201cscan\u201d the numbers from ATMs, rather steal them at restaurants or official documents.It is important to remember how easily someone can create a counterfeit hot-spot and gain access to valuable information.  Care must be taken to avoid using public Wi-Fi on your phone, tablet or computer to check your email, your bank account balance, or any other site that contains or requires your personal data. In most cases, using Internet security software could save you from a lot of trouble, however this case is a little different.The main purpose of this article is to educate and create awareness for users which is relatively easy to do in a public Wi-Fi hotspot environment.

Fortunately, users that downloaded the fake app didn\u2019t experience much trouble. The app was designed to bombard the user with ads to download other apps, the legitimacy of those apps is unknown but also being investigated.This latest Google Play store breach has made headlines due to the hackers using the new tactic that allowed them to mask the app as being offered by the original developer of WhatsApp. It doesn\u2019t ask for too many permissions so those who downloaded it don\u2019t have too much to worry about.There are several steps you can take in order to protect yourself from similar attacks such as this one.

The private information is not sent using quantum workers at all. Instead, physicists use quantum means to send a code called a one-time pad that is used to encrypt the initial message. The encrypted message is then sent over an average telecommunications carrier and decoded in the usual way. The method is called quantum key distribution.Computer scientists know that an information encoded using a one-time pad package be broken. So the security comes from the knowledge to send the one-time pad with perfect privacy, which is what this suggestion guarantees.And that raises an intriguing question. If it\u2019s possible to send the one-time pad securely using quantum workers, why not just send the primary message that way?Today, Wei Zhang at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a few friends say they have done just this. The new method is called quantum secure direct communication, and the Chinese team has used it completed 500 meters of fiber-optic cable for the first time.The reason scientists have relied on one-time pads in the past is simple. At issue is whether a communication has been overheard. Physicists can check this because quantum bits cannot be measured without consuming the information they contain.So when photons are transmitted, if they arrive in the same state they were sent in, a listener cannot have extracted the data they contain. But if they arrive in a different state, that is clear evidence that the data has leaked into the background and the message is not secure.In practice, physicists can be sure that a data is secure as long as this leakage is below some sharp threshold.The difficulty is that the leakage becomes possible only after it has occurred.

They never even know that they were successfully scammed until they are notified of an unpaid invoice by the other, actual business.There are tons of different ways to suffer a cyber attack and the professionals are working tirelessly to combat the crimes. Australian authorities have formed numerous task forces over the years that are dedicated to cyber security.

The discovery occurred while the Israelite hackers were successfully hacking Kaspersky, a popular internet security software. If this isn\u2019t confusing enough for you, just wait because the tale only goes deeper.At first glance, it would seem Kaspersky was a victim in this cyber scandal but that is so far from the suspected truth. Instead, Kaspersky was possibly actively playing the most evil of all the roles: helping American spies, who are directly employed by the U.S. Federal government, to use their system to spy on the users themselves.That\u2019s right: the very software meant to protect you and your privacy was said to be allowing government entities to illegally spy on those using the software. Or at least that is what it seems to look like. Several official statements from all parties have denied any wrongdoing including Kaspersky as they continue to claim their innocence in the matter.While this event originally occurred in 2015, for one reason or another, has only just now surfaced in the public forum for us \u201cregular\u201d folks to read about. Nothing about hacking, spying or government entities and their questionable tactics is new including the smokescreens surrounding them every time a new story surfaces.Between all of the twists and turns, denials and statements, we are left with having to judge the event for ourselves. But, of course, it would be wise to accept the fact early on that a straight answer will never be given, not to the general public at least. In the end, our need for a trusted internet security provider is absolutely necessary and for that trust to be compromised is nothing short of terrifying. We need to seriously strengthen our security online in the upcoming months in order to avoid the threats that lurk online.

There was a leader, transporter, scout, and key cutter. Court documents allege that all the thefts were carried out in the same way. First, a scout would find a Jeep Wrangler and surreptitiously obtain the vehicle identification number (VIN) from the dashboard or elsewhere on the body of the jeep. Next, the thief would use specially cut keys to steal the vehicle and hand it off to the transporter, whose job it was to get back across the border.\u201dIn conclusion to the arrest of 3 of the gang members and the later released details, Jeep is revising its authentication code system.

According to Stamper, it\u2019s actually the opposite.For starters, EternalRocks is far more sneaky than WannaCry\u2019s SMB worm component. Once it infects a victims, the worm uses a two-stage installation process, with a delayed second stage.During the first stage, EternalRocks gain a foothold on an infected host, downloads the Tor client, and beacons its C&C server, located on a .onion domain, the Dark Web.Additionally, EternalRocks also uses files with identical name to the ones used by WannaCry\u2019s SMB worm, in another attempt to fool security researchers into misclassifying it.But unlike WannaCry, EternalRocks does not include a kill switch domains, the Achille\u2019s heel that security researchers used to stop the WannaCry outbreak.After the initial dormancy period expire and the C&C server responds, EternalRocks goes into the second stage of its installation process procedure and downloads a second stage malwares component in the form of an archive named shadowbrokers.zip.Because of its broader exploit arsenals, the lack of a kill switch domain, and because of its initial dormancy, EternalRocks could pose a serious threat to computer with vulnerable SMB ports exposed to the Internet, if its author would ever decide to weaponize the worms with ransomware, a banking trojan, RATs, or anything else.At first glance, the worm seem to be an experiment, or a malware author performing tests and fine-tuning a future threats.This, however, does not mean EternalRocks is harmless. Computer infected with this worm are controllable via C&C server command and the worm\u2019s owner could leverage this hidden communications channel to send new malwares to the computers previously infected by EternalRocks.Furthermore, DOUBLEPULSAR, an NSA implants with backdoor features, remains running on PCs infected with EternalRocks.

The devices are powered by an embedded operating system and they run a web server.Thousands of these systems are easily accessible from the Internet, allowing attackers to hijack them by replacing their firmware with a malicious version.The attack scenario developed and demonstrated by Applied Risk starts with the attacker scanning the Web for potential targets.

The researcher said most of these systems lack any authentication mechanism, allowing easy access.The expert believes an attacker could identify widely used devices and concentrate on targeting those. Once the target has been identified, the attacker first needs to acquire the device and conduct hardware debugging on it to determine how it works. The general attack process is the same for all devices, but the exploit needs to be customized for each specific product.It took Applied Risk three months of analyzing ports, using various hardware hacking techniques, firmware dumping, and reverse engineering to determine how each device works and how it can be attacked.source: securityweek"}, {"title": "About 40% of Ransomware Victims Pay Up to Unlock Their Devices", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "April 27, 2017", "body": "About 40% of ransomware victims pay to get their devices unlocked as more and more people get affected by such schemes.According to a new research from cybersecurity firm Trustlook, it\u2019s not just businesses that are threatened by ransomware, but also random, regular Internet users.

Instead, it simply closes some ports to keep the infected devices away from Mirai and similar threats.Called Hajime to keep the naming scheme in line with Mirai (they mean \u201cbeginning\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d in Japanese, respectively), the worm managed to build a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet, but researchers aren\u2019t sure about its purpose right now. Symantec said recently that a white hat hacker could have created the malware, but suggested that the botnet could be easily repurposed for nefarious operations.What\u2019s certain, however, is that Hajime\u2019s author continues to update the code, as recently made changes were seen in the attack module. At the moment, the worm supports three different attack methods: TR-069 exploitation, Telnet default password attack, and Arris cable modem password of the day attack. The TR-069 exploit was implemented only recently, Kaspersky reveals.TR-069 (Technical Report 069), a standard published by the Broadband Forum, is used by ISPs to manage modems remotely via TCP port 7547 (some devices use port 5555). By abusing the TR-069 NewNTPServer feature, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable devices. Late last year, the TR-069 attack was used to crash nearly 1 million modems from Deutsche Telekom.According to Kaspersky, Hajime attacks any device on the Internet with the exception of several networks, and its author recently improved the architecture detection logic. Thus, after passing the authentication stage, the malware reads the first 52 bytes of the victim\u2019s echo binary (information about architecture and operating system is in the first 20 bytes), and then compares the echo ELF header against a predefined array, so as to fetch the correct Hajime-downloader binary.On the other hand, despite Hajime being able to attack any device, the authors focused on some specific brands/devices, as the worm uses only specific username-password combinations to brute-force its way into vulnerable devices. The threat uses one combination or the other based on words contained in the welcome message when opening a telnet session.source: securityweek"}, {"title": "Cybersecurity Threat Highlighted in the Wonga breach", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "April 26, 2017", "body": "Recently payday lender Wonga suffered a monumental data breach with personal details from hundreds of thousands of accounts likely to have been illegally accessed.

The two hackers were able to hack it well enough to display their name on it.The two hackers, Samuel Gro\u00df and Niklas Baumstark, were able to breach the Touch Bar at the hacking event titled Pwn2Own at the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver. They managed to pull this off by harnessing the capabilities of a few bugs that allowed them to root access of the macOS through its Safari web browser. To show just how good they were, the two displayed a message \u201cpwned by niklasb and saelo\u201d on the MacBook Pro\u2019s Touch Bar.While this may be alarming to users, there is no reason to worry. In fact, this event is held to bring together ethical hackers (or white hat hackers) who discover security flaws in IoT and computing devices. The manufacturers of these devices then get details about these flaws to fix them before cybercriminals get their hand on them.In the case of Mac OS touch bar, the two white hat hackers were awarded $28,000. However, the organisers of the event referred to their hack as \u2018partial\u2019 and stated that \u201cIn a partial win, Samuel Gro\u00df and Niklas Baumstark earn some style points by leaving a special message on Mac\u2019s touch bar. They used a use-after-free (UAF) in Safari combined with three logic bugs and a null pointer dereference to exploit Safari and elevate to root in macOS.\u201d"}, {"title": "Google\u2019s Android bug bounty remains Untouched", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "April 1, 2017", "body": "The Google\u2019s Project Zero security team did not receive even a single valid submission in their US$350,000 (A$458,000) bug bounty prize for finding zero-day flaws.The submission period for Google\u2019s Project Zero is six-month and it now came to an end.

Instead, it stays dormant for four hours, allowing the phone to work as it regularly does, and even app will work just like it is supposed to.After four hours, the app prompts the users to add a device administrator, which allows the app to change the screen unlock password, lock the screen, monitor screen-unlock attempts and set lock-screen password expiration time. Of course, this sounds very suspicious so the users might very well tap \u201ccancel.\u201dEven if that happens, the prompt will appear again quickly, preventing the user from taking any another action or even uninstalling the app. If the user gives in and agrees to give the app admin powers, the ransom note will appear on the screen.

Shamir along with Ben Nassi and Yuval Elovici have now published a detailed research paper on the attack method.Many experiments conducted by these experts show that attacker can send a bunch of commands to a piece of malware present on an isolated machine just by pointing a light source at a connected flatbed scanner which has its lid open from outside the building which is housing the device.This malware can be programmed to start scans at a specified date and time when attacker starts sending these commands. The researchers have pointed out that only the first scan date should be set as the subsequent dates can be supplied with each attack.These commands are transmitted in the form of pulses from a laser or any other different light source because a 0 bit is sent when it\u2019s off and 1 bit is transmitted when the light source is on. The light source can be an invisible infrared laser or a visible laser, this makes the attack stealthier.The laser attack works if there is a clear line of sight from the outside of the building to the scanner.

This vulnerability is actually a combination of two bugs, Fenske told Thursday.One main problem stems from the fact that they are using a static value to sign the Ruby on Rails session secret for the console. This secret value is supposed to be a randomly generated one per-machine value which is used to sign the cookie, not a static one.GitHub has acknowledged on Tuesday that this static secret was only supposed to be used for their testing and development, but \u201can unrelated change of the file permissions prevented the intended session secret from being used.\u201d\u201cFor testing purposes, they have replaced it with a static value and just forgot to change it back,\u201d Fenske told.

Marshal, a library that converts collections of Ruby objects into a byte stream, has a method, .load, that can return the result of converted serialised data.By knowing this secret, any attacker could have forged a cookie, deserialized by the Marshal.load, and would have tricked GitHub into running whatever code he wanted.Source: Threatpost"}, {"title": "Microsoft Edge Is The Most Hacked Browser At Pwn2Own 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "March 20, 2017", "body": "The popular Pwn2Own 2017 hacking contest, which has celebrated its 10th anniversary, came to an end of their three days session in which various security teams have hacked away many browsers and operating systems.

This is the biggest bounty that is currently on the platform because AgileBits wants to prove a point \u2013 that it takes security seriously.Of course, that is how it should be given how 1Password is a popular password manager, keeping all the user login credentials in the same place. If that is cracked, it could pose a very serious security problem to all of its users.\u201cWe owe it to our customers to do everything in our power to keep them and their information secure. This means using the ingenuity of real people to help us continually improve the security of 1Password. It was important to us to demonstrate how seriously we take this contribution and have increased the prize to prove it,\u201d AgileBits\u2019 Jeff Shiner told Tom\u2019s Hardware.So how does all this all work? The bug bounty specifies a specific account which white hats will have to breach to get the bad poetry file in it. Of course, most of the users would not be facing an attack like the one normal on their account, but it is a good test for the service.

It is also worth noting that it is the first major malware which adopted the new code injection technique called \u2018AtomBombing\u2019.The AtomBombing was explained by researchers at enSilo back in October 2016. It is named so, because of the main use of it is Windows\u2019 atom tables; read/writable stores of data which can be used by multiple applications. The Malicious code can also be written to atom tables, and then it is retrieved and injected into an executable memory space.The process mentioned above does not require any exploit against Windows since it just makes use of a feature provided by the Windows. Finally, it is just a new code injection technique which is likely to by-pass the existing AV and NGAV detections.Dridex 4 was found by the IBM X-Force in the early February.

And secondly is that for 55% of the enterprises, \u201cpractical and hands-on experience is most important qualification for a cyber security candidate.\u201d Since a candidate cannot get any experience without getting a position, new candidates for open cyber security jobs need more help with other \u2018qualifications\u2019.CompTIA has announced a new security qualification: named CSA+. It sits in between Security+, and CASP.The CSA+ focuses on skills which are required for the use of threat detection tools, interpretation of results and data analysis to identify vulnerabilities, threats and risks. It certifies a proficiency in data-driven security.\u201cBy placing a greater emphasis on data analytics, we can get a real-time, holistic view of the behaviour of the network, its users and the devices to identify the potential vulnerabilities and then strengthen them before an actual intrusion happens,\u201d explained CompTIA\u2019s senior director for products, James Stanger.This is perhaps the most critical area of the overall cyber security skills gap, and one that is growing faster than most. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states, \u201cEmployment of information security analysts is projected to grow 18 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand for information security analysts is expected to be very high, as these analysts will be needed to create innovative solutions to prevent hackers from stealing critical information or causing problems for computer networks.\u201d\u201cData analytics is the key,\u201d says Jim Lucari, the senior manager of certification at the HP Enterprise. \u201cEverybody in the technology should have this CSA+.

At the RSA Conference last week, Google shared some insight on the threats which target corporate inboxes and how these numbers compare to other types of accounts.The data which is collected so far this year shows that a normal corporate email account is 6.2 times more likely to receive a phishing email, 4.3 times more likely to receive malware, and nearly 0.4 times more likely to receive a spam compared to personal inboxes.While corporate accounts seem to be favourite targets for attackers, when it comes to spam and non-profit, phishing, education and government organisations are even more likely to see malware attacks compared to businesses.The IT, entertainment and housing sectors are most targeted in spam campaigns, but when it comes to phishing attacks, they are more likely to be aimed at the finance and insurance sector. coming to malware attacks, real estate was by far the most targeted sector.The sheer volume of phishing attempts depends on the location; for instance, in Japan, the financial sector receives a lot more phishing emails than in the United Kingdom and the United States. Google has also noticed that the IT industry in Brazil is roughly twice as many phishing attempts than in the U.S. and the U.K.Japan and India are the countries with the most spammed inboxes, and the U.S., Germany and France are the largest spammers. In the first part of 2017, the highest percentage of phishing emails were sent to accounts in Japan, followed at a distance by Brazil, Canada and the United States.Google\u2019s experts pointed out that targets are selected based on several criteria, including size, type of organisation, the sector of activity, and location (country).

Basically, this feature is turned off, but anyone with the physical access to a network that has a Netgear router can easily exploit it locally. A general example of this scenario is a caf\u00e9 with public WiFi or some other place which offers a relatively similar feature.We know that most people choose to reuse their passwords. So, once an attacker gains the admin password, he can check all the devices that are connected in that network and try to access them with the same password(which might actually work considering how many network admins do not take security seriously).Kenin also pointed out that, by using the existing malware along with ever so popular Mirai botnet can change all the infected devices into bots.

After infection, the Trojan moves itself from the current location to the %TEMP% folder.On the infected machine, Dridex leverages the Windows default recovery disc executable recdisc.exe to load an impersonated SPP.dll and bypass the UAC protection on Windows 7. It does so because the platform automatically elevates the program, along with other applications white-listed for auto-elevation. Dridex leverages this feature to execute two commands on the computer.In order to bypass this UAC, Dridex created a directory in Windows\\System32\\6886, and then copies legitimate binary from Windows\\System32\\recdisc.exe to the Windows\\System32\\6886\\. Next, it copies itself to %APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp as a tmp file, and then moves itself to Windows\\System32\\6886\\SPP.dll. Then the malware deletes wu*.exe and po*.dll from Windows\\System32, after doing which it executes the recdisc.exe and then loads itself as impersonated SPP.dll with admin privileges.

VPNs encrypt data that is shared by you online and hence, provide you full security of the information. But contrary to this popular belief, not all the VPNs are so reliable and secure. Research conducted by the Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and UC Berkley University of South Wales and found that nearly 38% of all the Android VPN apps in the play store are infected with malware; making this blind trust of these apps a not so trustable move.The research teams studied around 234 VPN apps that were uploaded on Google Play Store and a startling one-third were identified to be tracking users via malware. There were apps which carried out malvertising campaigns while 18% of them didn\u2019t encrypt internet data as promised. 8 out of 10 apps requested permission to access sensitive data such as text messages and user account credentials. This proves that the primary function such VPN apps are required to perform, which is to ensure the protection of user data, is not being performed by the available apps at all. The fact cannot be overlooked that these VPN apps are used by hundreds and thousands of users across the globe. The top ten worst VPNs as finalized by the research team include these apps: 1.

The first time an attack happened was during the summer season. The hotel had to pay a ransom then too before the hackers released control over the system. It seems, however, that the first time this happened, hackers left a backdoor in the system which they used again for later attacks.It cost the hotel thousands of Euros to fix, money they did not get back from the insurance company since the hackers can\u2019t be found.The last successful attack, the one that took place in the opening weekend for the winter season, a time when mountain hotels are notoriously booked, made managers pay a ransom of \u20ac1,500, or roughly $1,600. With so many guests to think about, they chose to give in to hackers yet again, which left the police unable to help.Following each paid ransom, the key registry system was unlocked, along with all the other computers, putting everything back together.Thankfully, after being hit three times, the hotel finally changed things in order to reject the attack.

That puts them at very high risk as hack of one of the accounts means their online presence is pretty much messed up. One very good example for this is Yahoo data breach in which 1 billion people had their account data exposed. If you are one of those who used the same passwords elsewhere, expect those accounts gone.One-quarter of those who are interviewed have admitted that the passwords they use are very weak than they like, but they are the way they are because they are easy to remember.However, nearly half of Americans believe that their personal information is not secure now than it was five years ago. This is in-direct correlation with fact that Americans lack the faith in various private and public institutions to protect their data for them. Of course, many data breaches that have affected online companies in past few years have not helped much in restoring the faith in them.The survey goes deeper into the issue and unveils that 64% of US adults have been impacted by different types of data theft. For instance, 41% discovered fraudulent charges on their credit cards, while 35% have been notified that some information had been compromised.

Looks like Brian Krebs has been working hard to find the creator of Mirai botnet that has become a huge online security threat by compromising a huge number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and creating a series of infected botnets.Krebs started investigating to find the identity of the person after his website went down for four straight days due to a massive attack with up to 665 Gbps data traffic. Kerbs wanted to find out who that was and who is responsible for the attack. There are many more attacks on high-profile organisations including DynDNS. According to the Krebs, his analysed \u201chundreds of hours of research\u201d as he was \u201cdesperately seeking the missing link between seemingly unrelated people and events.\u201dHe stated that the majority of DDoS attacks were launched to make quick money. For example, a company which offers DDoS protection may want to launch DDoS attacks on certain targets so that they get will be convinced about the dangers of not taking their service and then hire them for DDoS protection.In his opinion, the very same thing happened to his website and many other big websites such as Deutsche Telekom and French hosting service provider OVH that were attacked with Mirai malware by the use of hundreds and thousands of botnets in 2016.Now the most important revelation; Who was behind the attack on Krebs website?As per Krebs research, Protraf Solutions owner Paras Jha is responsible for recent attacks involving Mirai botnets, including the attack on his website krebsOnSecurity.

Activists and journalists who like to keep their information secret usually choose ProtonMail.Last month, the co-founder of ProtonMail Dr Andy Yen announced that they would start allowing the users to access their mails directly using the Tor network. This move is taken to counteract against the steps taken by the governments around the world to reduce the user\u2019s privacy.Dr Yen also said that they are proactively working to prevent the inevitable censorship in many countries. Further explaining why they choose Tor, he said, \u201cTor provides a way to circumvent certain Internet blocks so improving our compatibility with Tor is a natural first step.\u201dThis action sure looks like it is taken in a right direction considering the recent government actions to curb the public\u2019s access to encrypted platforms and secure internet usage. Like the Egyptian government blocked encrypted chat platforms and application Signals and the UK government approved the Investigatory Powers Bill which aims to track the activities of the web browsers.We should note that ProtonMail consulted Roger Dingledine, the developer and President of Tor Project before they made their onion site. This is why the dependence upon the Tor in security email exchange is not avoidable. With their recent step, the Swiss company is now the world\u2019s largest encrypted service provider offering Tor support.According to Shari Steele, the executive director of Tor Project, \u201cTor is an invaluable tool for protecting online freedom and guarding against state surveillance and censorship.

It was dubbed by the Apple Inc., as Fruitfly while the Malwarebytes named it as Quimitchin, the name is inspired by Aztec spies. The newly identified malware can spy on biomedical research centres. It was speculated that this malicious code is active for many years only to be detected now.This malicious code was recently discovered by Malwarebytes after one of the IT administrators in there identified a strange pattern of incoming network traffic from one of the compromised Macs. Reportedly, the malware was designed to compromise the webcam and capture screenshots of Mac machine and simulate mouse clicks and key presses. Apart from all these features, it can also perform the regular malware function of providing the hacker or attacker with the ability to remotely control the machine.According to a blog post from a researcher Thomas Reed at the Malwarebytes, both Apple and Malwarebytes are yet to discovered how this malware is being distributed. What they have managed to find so far is that it is based made using some old-school coding techniques, which are so old that they date back to 2001 when the Mac OS X was launched.The most disturbing aspect is that Fruitfly also contains Linux shell commands and when Reed tried to run the malware on Linux machine, it worked \u201cjust fine\u201d and only the Mac-specific code didn\u2019t run. This means, the malware developers didn\u2019t know much about the Mac system and they used old documentation for its development.\u201cThe presence of Linux shell commands in the original script suggests that there may be a variant of this malware that is expressly designed to run on Linux, perhaps even with a Linux executable in place of the Mach-O executable. However, we have not found such a sample,\u201d noted Reed.

A total of 36.6 million records were exposed last year, well below the 169 million records exposed in 2015. Partly the big year-over-year increase is due to better reporting and partly the jump is due to determined efforts by hackers and crooks to steal, or more recently hold for ransom, user data.The leading type of attacks for the eighth consecutive year were hacking/skimming/phishing attacks, accounting for 55.5% of all data breaches. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), much of the increase came from what are known as CEO spear-fishing attacks that fool corporate executives into revealing confidential employee records.ITRC chairman and founder Adam Levin noted:More than half of the breaches reported by the ITRC included the skeleton key to our lives: the Social Security number. This trend, which has accelerated since 2015\u2014 when just four breaches exposed over 120 million Social Security numbers to state-sponsored hackers and cyber criminals\u2014 represents the point of no return for millions of Americans. While credit and debit card numbers can be changed, SSNs cannot. Therefore, monitoring and damage control become even more important than ever before.The final tally on 2016 data breaches shows the following breakdown of the 1,093 breaches by category and records exposed. The medical care sector led all sectors in the number of records compromised in 2016, with 34.4% (376) of all data breaches last year. The number of records exposed in these breaches topped 15.9 million, or about 43.6% of the 2016 total. The government sector suffered 72 data breaches last year, representing about 37.9% of the total number of records exposed and 6.6% of the incidents. Over 13.8 million records were compromised in this sector in 2016. The business sector accounted for more than 5.6 million exposed records in 495 incidents. That represents 45.3% of the incidents, and 15.5% of the exposed records during 2016. The number of banking breaches totaled 52 for the year and involved about 72,000 records, some 4.8% of the total number of breaches and about 0.2% of the records exposed. The educational sector saw 98 data breaches in 2016. The sector accounts for 9% of all breaches for the year and more than 1 million exposed records, about 2.9% of the year\u2019s total.Since beginning to track data breaches in 2005, ITRC has counted 6,789 breaches through December 13, 2016, involving more than 886 million records.Source: 247wallst"}, {"title": "You Can Be Hacked If You Use This Browser Settings", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "January 20, 2017", "body": "If you do a lot of shopping online, taking advantage of your browser\u2019s auto-fill setting may seem like a smart choice.

Besides messages for fund transfers, the SWIFT system is also used to communicate trade documents. Thus, a cyber-criminal who generates fake LC may attempt to place it with an offshore bank for finance.

Now all these allegations are shot down by WhatsApp, which called the allegations false.On last Friday, news outlet from The Guardian reported that a cryptography researcher found a backdoor in WhatsApp\u2019s messaging service which could \u201callow Facebook and others to intercept and read the encrypted messages.\u201dIn a short statement, WhatsApp said the claim was not true:\u201cWhatsApp does not give governments a \u2018backdoor\u2019 into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor. The design decision referenced in The Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks. WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design, and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report.\u201dThe Guardian report included the research by Tobias Boelter who is a cryptography and security researcher at University of California, Berkeley. Last April, Tobias took these findings to WhatsApp and published a report that what he posted could be either a backdoor or a flaw in WhatsApp\u2019s messaging platform. Tobias Boelter later said The Guardian that the \u201cbackdoor\u201d gave WhatsApp ability to read messages because of the way the company has implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol. Reporters quoted Kirstie Ball, co-director and founder of the Centre for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy who verified Boelter\u2019s research and stated the \u201cbackdoor\u201d made WhatsApp an \u201can extremely insecure platform.\u201dThe Guardian explains Boelter\u2019s alleged backdoor like this:WhatsApp\u2019s end-to-end encryption relies on the generation of unique security keys, using the acclaimed Signal protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems, that are traded and verified between users to guarantee communications are secure and cannot be intercepted by a middleman. However, WhatsApp has the ability to force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users, unbeknown to the sender and recipient of the messages, and to make the sender re-encrypt messages with new keys and send them again for any messages that have not been marked as delivered.The recipient is not made aware of this change in encryption, while the sender is only notified if they have opted-in to encryption warnings in settings, and only after the messages have been re-sent. This re-encryption and rebroadcasting effectively allows WhatsApp to intercept and read users\u2019 messages.

Airtel Zambia had reported to the police on April 8, 2016 that it had lost more than US $24,000 in phone call re-routing between January and March 2016.\nThe ideal situation is that Airtel bills the other mobile service provider making an international call for using its network and part of the charge is paid to the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA).However, the court heard that Chiti had procured more than 1,000 simcards from an Airtel agent and inserted them into the prohibited simbox which is also known as simfarm machine to hide international calls received on Airtel network. This meant that Airtel could not bill the other networks as the international calls were disguised as domestic calls. Police investigations led to the arrest of Mary Mupeta a sales agent who had sold more than 1,000 simcards to Chiti.Officers also recovered one simbox in Mukobeko area which was not operational but all the electronic gadgets including his personal laptop were taken to ZICTA for examination.In mitigation, Chiti, the father of two, begged for the court\u2019s leniency, saying he regretted his action and that he had recently lost his mother.\nMagistrate Mubita said she had taken into consideration the mitigation and sentenced him accordingly.Mupeta, the sales agent who had sold the simcards to Chiti was also recently fined K2,000 after pleading guilty to unauthorized access to interception of or interference with data.Source: times.co.zm"}, {"title": "Two Men Arrested For Drug Dealing On Dark Web", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "January 12, 2017", "body": "We all know that the Dark Web has become a source for malicious activities and crimes.

With more businesses reliant on storing information in the cloud, the report predicts that cloud breaches will increase. This is the result of more sensitive data being stored in the cloud and hackers\u2019 growing interest in obtaining stored information deemed valuable to them.According to the report, there will be continued conflicts surrounding speed, efficiency and cost that are pitted against control, visibility and security.Credential theft will be the initial focus of cyber attacks, according to the report, as people and their passwords \u201cremain the biggest weakness throughout most technologies for the foreseeable future.\u201dThe McAfee report outlined how hackers will attack, explaining the current north-south attack pattern, which is a way to move up or down systems to gain access through a system vulnerability, will continue to be used. In addition, hackers will explore east-west attacks, meaning they will try to jump from machine to machine or between the cloud and a server. Multiple organizations within a cloud service provider will be targeted. In addition, the growth of the Internet of Things devices will cause vulnerability in cloud security models. According to the report, \u201cattackers, including for-hire attackers, will use clouds for scale, speed and anonymity.\u201dThere is a significant threat of IoT attacks; however, the financial gains from such attacks are not completely known. The report predicts ransomware will migrate to this area of cyber security vulnerability. Consumer privacy will be impacted negatively by IoT, according to the report. In addition, the lack of appropriate security of these devices will likely lead to cyber criminals using IoT devices as a gateway to more comprehensive attacks on intellectual property and infrastructure disruption.Another significant area of concern, are the aggregation points where data is collected within IoT systems. Hackers could get a big payday by attacking the data storage for all of the information derived from a particular company\u2019s IoT device, the report stated.Medical devices continue to be targeted as hackers seek medical data.Despite the risk, IoT adoption will remain high, the report stated, the result of its benefits outweighing its disadvantages.As hackers continue to get creative in obtaining cyber data, security vendors and IoT providers will be working to develop better security controls through new encryption options, device control systems and behavioral monitoring.Source: claimsjournal.com"}, {"title": "Netflix Users Falling For Credit Card Phishing Scam", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "January 11, 2017", "body": "Daredevil hackers are targeting Netflix users with a new phishing attack that attempts to break bad with their credit card details.

Information on unintentional data leaks, external hacks, misplaced documents or devices, insider attacks, and other similar incidents are also included in these reports.Data included in the reports was gathered from various industries, including financial, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, education, hospitality, and more. Each entry is marked as an electronic (cyber) compromise or not.A quick look at the 2016 Data Breach Report (PDF) shows that hundreds of such incidents have been reported last year, and that tens of thousands of Massachusetts residents were affected. Some 33,000 were impacted by the malware attack that hit Eddie Bauer stores, for example, while the Omni Hotels incident impacted only 1,000.

About 50 of these bugs are addressed as Elevation of privilege flaws.Since the process has been going over the past several months, the security bulletin of January is split in two. This makes it easy for the manufacturers to sort out the patches: while the 2017-01-05 security patch level addressed 72 bugs affecting drivers and other ODM software, the 2017-01-01 security patch level resolved 23 issues which affect various Android components.Among these 22 vulnerabilities mentioned above with a Critical severity rating, a Remote code execution flaw was resolved in Mediaserver. This is one of the Android components that are most impacted. From the time Google kicked off the monthly patch program in 2015 summer, several Critical issues are found in Mediaserver. The list starts with the ever so popular Stagefright, and followed by a second Stagefright vulnerability a few months later.The remaining 21 Critical flaws patched this month include Elevation of privilege issues affecting the kernel memory subsystem, Qualcomm bootloader, kernel file system, NVIDIA GPU driver, MediaTek driver, Qualcomm GPU driver, and Qualcomm video driver. Three other Critical vulnerabilities were patched in various Qualcomm components, Google\u2019s advisory reveals.While only one of the 23 vulnerabilities addressed in the 2017-01-01 security patch level was rated Critical, 14 of them were rated High severity. These included Remote code execution bugs in c-ares and Framesequence; Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in  Audioserver, Framework APIs, libnl, and Mediaserver; an Information disclosure vulnerability in External Storage Provider; and Denial of service flaws in Mediaserver, core networking, and Telephony.Eight of the bugs resolved by this security patch level were Medium risk: an Elevation of privilege vulnerability in Contacts, two Information disclosure vulnerabilities in Mediaserver, and five Information disclosure issues in Audioserver."}, {"title": "Hacker Hijacked MongoDB Databases For Ransom", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "January 4, 2017", "body": "An unknown hacker is trying to monetize on MongoDB databases that are exposed to the Internet by hijacking them and then demanding a ransom for the data, revealed the security researcher Victor Gevers.This hacker goes by the online handle Harak1r1.

Be Careful. -Researchers", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "January 2, 2017", "body": "Researchers have warned that the lack of enough security measures in the travel booking systems exposes the passenger\u2019s personal information and thus allows the attackers to steal tickets and info about the passengers.At the 33rd Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg of Germany, security researchers Nemanja NIkodijevic and Karsten Nohl from Security Research Labs explained in detail about the vulnerability that is affecting the major travel booking systems. He demonstrated them how easy it is to exploit these popular services.His analysis is focused on Global Distribution Systems (GDS), that serve as a central point for service providers (e.g. hotels, airlines, travel agencies) to manage reservations. The records that are stored by these systems, which are called passenger name records (PNR), can include information like name, ticket data, contact information, passport number, itinerary, date of birth and even payment information. The world\u2019s top GDS providers are Sabre, Amadeus and Travelport.One of the main problems, according to Nohl and Nikodijevic, is these airlines, travel agencies and third-party service providers often use to authenticate users is based on passenger\u2019s last name.This code typically contains a 6-digit alphanumeric string. This is embedded in the barcode found on boarding pass and it can also be printed in clear text on the baggage tags. Since some users share pictures of their boarding pass on some social media websites, it is not a difficult task for fraudsters and cybercriminals to obtain these codes.Another problem that is given a lot interest is the fact that these authenticators can also be obtained using brute force as some web services have neglected to implement limiting the rate mechanisms. In some cases, GDS providers exclude certain characters (e.g. \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d might be excluded as they can be confused with \u201cO\u201d and \u201cI\u201d) or they assign booking codes sequentially, making brute-force attacks even more efficient.Once a traveler\u2019s booking code is obtained, an attacker can gain access to personal information and abuse it for various purposes, including phishing and social engineering attacks. In the case of airline passengers, malicious actors could also steal flights and divert frequent flyer miles to their own account.

Due to this, the TV is completely bricked due to its limited number of ports and functionality compared to Android device.The only thing that we can do with the TV now is to flash a new firmware, for which we are left with only one option that is to use the firmware provided by LG. Ironically, LG is not willing to help the user remove the ransomware from his TV unless he pays.

The weakness, exploitable by submitting specially crafted input through contact and registration forms, can allow an attacker to completely take over the targeted web application.PHPMailer developers attempted to patch the vulnerability (CVE-2016-10033) with the release of version 5.2.18. However, Golunski determined that the fix could be bypassed. The new flaw (CVE-2016-10045) was patched on December 28 with the release of version 5.2.20.In the meantime, the researcher found the same security hole in the SwiftMailer library (CVE-2016-10074). SwiftMailer developers included a fix for the vulnerability in version 5.4.5, released on December 29, but it may not be complete either.Researcher Paul Buonopane believes that CVE-2016-10033, CVE-2016-10045 and CVE-2016-10074 are just the tips of the iceberg as they are caused by PHP design flaws that could expose many applications.The issues, according to Buonopane, revolve around the lack of proper input sanitization, particularly related to the PHP functions escapeshellarg and escapeshellcmd. escapeshellcmd is designed to escape characters that might be used to trick a shell command into executing arbitrary commands, while escapeshellarg escapes a string that will be used as a shell argument.Buonopane has pointed out that the escapeshellarg function is incomplete and escapeshellcmd was never meant to sanitise user input, which leaves room for abuse. The expert said PHP developers have known about some of the issues surrounding the problematic functions for several years.\u201cThe underlying vulnerability is really a design flaw and will take many years to fix. That cannot begin without the active participation of the greater PHP community,\u201d Buonopane said.Both PHPMailer and SwiftMailer are very popular. PHPMailer is used by projects such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla, while the SwiftMailer library is leveraged by PHP frameworks such as Yii2, Laravel and Symfony.

This is the first time the malicious cyber activity, which the US calls GRIZZLY STEPPE, has been officially attributed to a specific hacking group.As expected, U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday announced several retaliatory actions against Moscow, imposing sanctions on two intelligence agencies, expelling 35 diplomats and denying access to two Russian compounds inside the United States.In October this year, the US government officially accused Russia of involvement in the cyber-attacks against US political organisations, saying that some states had seen scanning and probing activity originating from servers operated by a Russian company, but no attribution was made at the time. The report (PDF) not only makes an attribution but also provides recommended mitigations and suggested actions to take in response to indicators provided.The JAR reveals that two different actors participated in the intrusion into a U.S. political party, one in the summer of 2015, namely Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 29, and the other in spring 2016, namely APT28. The former is also known as Cozy Bear, or CozyDuke, while the latter is referred to as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Sofacy, Sednit and Tsar Team.This falls in line with what intelligence firm CrowdStrike revealed in June, after assisting the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the U.S. Democratic Party, to investigate cyber-attacks against its network. Later during summer, two security firms uncovered evidence that Fancy Bear breached the U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as well.Both Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear were previously linked to attacks against US government organisations and other governments worldwide. Their attack methods include spearphishing to deliver malicious droppers to the victims\u2019 computers or the use of short URLs upon the creation of domains closely resembling those of targeted organisations.\u201cOnce APT28 and APT29 have access to victims, both groups exfiltrate and analyse information to gain intelligence value.

The Bitcoin address to which victims are told to send the ransom has so far not made any transactions.Atch pointed out that the same RSA public key is used for all samples, which means that a user who receives a decryptor will likely be able to decrypt files for all victims.According to CyberX, the malware requires elevated privileges and registers itself as a service. The threat terminates various processes, but it avoids critical system processes and ones associated with anti-malware applications, likely to avoid disrupting the system and triggering detection by security products.

The archive is attached to an email and the password to open it is included in the email body. Most recently, the method was used to distribute the Gerber ransomware (the campaign also dropped the Ursnif banking Trojan).Recently, phishers decided to adopt the technique and adapt it to their needs in an attempt to steal banking data. However, instead of an Office document, this attack uses an HTML attachment that has been password-protected.As expected, the email message is personalised with the recipient\u2019s name, as well as with what supposedly represents the first digits of their credit card account number. However, since these digits are standardised, this apparent personalization is only meant to create a sense of legitimacy for the carefully crafted emails without requiring actual knowledge of a potential victim\u2019s actual card number.Furthermore, the spam emails use stolen branding and social engineering tactics to create a sense of urgency and trick the user into giving away their credit card information: recipients are told they need to update their security information for their \u201cnew chip card.\u201dThe HTML attachment used in this campaign was found to be XOR-encoded to make dynamic analysis more difficult. According to Proofpoint, the password protection is implemented with the help of JavaScript. A script named pah.js is used to decrypt the XOR-encoded HTML when the user enters the password.As soon as the user enters the password provided in the email body and the HTML attachment is decrypted, a fairly typical credit card phishing template complete with stolen branding is displayed. The same as in credential phishing attacks performed via HTTP POST, users are required to enter their credentials in the form.The use of a password-protected attachment is meant not only to make detection and analysis more difficult but also to convince users that the email is legitimate. The fact that the password is included in the email body also adds to this sense of legitimacy, in addition to making it easy for the recipients to open the attachment.source: security week"}, {"title": "Steam Down After Hackers Phantom Squad Initiated DDoS Attack", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "December 23, 2016", "body": "Steam is used by more than 123million gamers, is suffering from a \u201cmajor DDoS attack\u201d by a group of hackers named Phanton Squad, who previously have claimed responsibility for taking down PSN and Xbox Live, claimed repsonsibility for the attack on Twitter.They said they had initiated a \u201cmajor DDoS attack\u201d on the platform \u2013 but shortly afterwards the Twitter account was deactivated.Last month Phantom Squad also claimed responsibility for an attack which caused it to go offline for several minutes.It raises fears that hacking groups could try to launch major DDoS attacks on other gaming services over the Christmas weekend.Currently steam is running as of writing this article."}, {"title": "Marvel and Captain America Twitter Accounts Hacked by OurMine", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "December 23, 2016", "body": "\u200bAfter hacking the official Twitter account of NetFlix, OurMine managed to breach some other accounts as well, including those belonging to Marvel and the NFL.While it\u2019s not exactly clear how the hacking group managed to break into so many accounts at a time, OurMine did no harm and only laughed at the weak security systems of the impacted companies.\u201cHey, It\u2019s OurMine, don\u2019t worry, we are just testing your security, contact us to tell you more about your security,\u201d one such tweet posted from the NFL account read.

The group is believed to be responsible for many high-profile attacks, including recent operations aimed at the U.S. Democratic Party, government organisations in Turkey and Germany, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).CrowdStrike believes Fancy Bear is likely tied to GRU, the foreign military intelligence agency of Russia\u2019s Armed Forces, and the company\u2019s recent findings reinforce this theory.This summer, the company\u2019s analysts came across an Android application package (APK) file named \u201c\u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk.\u201d The file contained Russian-language artefacts and its name referenced the D-30, a Russian-made 122 mm towed howitzer that first entered service in the 1960s.The D-30 is still used by the Ukrainian military and, in 2013, artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk created an Android app designed to help personnel reduce the time to fire the gun from minutes to under 15 seconds. According to its developer, the application has roughly 9,000 users.According to CrowdStrike, Fancy Bear took the legitimate Android app and bundled it with an Android variant of X-Agent, a piece of malware that has been used by the threat actor in attacks aimed at high-value targets, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC).The malicious version of the app was distributed on Ukrainian military forums from late 2014 through 2016. Experts believe the legitimate program had been mainly distributed through social media, not via the Google Play store.The Android variant of the X-Agent malware appears to be designed for strategic purposes as it does not cause any damage to the infected device and it does not interfere with the operation of the original app. X-Agent is capable of accessing contact information, SMS messages, call logs and Internet data.\u201cCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential ability to map out a unit\u2019s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans, and even triangulate their approximate location.

CCO was previously a product of CliQr Technologies, which Cisco acquired earlier this year.According to Cisco, an unauthenticated attacker can remotely install malicious Docker containers with high privileges by exploiting a flaw (CVE-2016-9223) in the Docker Engine configuration.The security hole, discovered during the resolution of support cases, exists due to a misconfiguration that makes the Docker Engine management port reachable from the outside. An attacker can exploit this weakness to load Docker containers with arbitrary privileges, including root, on the affected CCO system.A CCO installation is vulnerable if TCP port 2375 is open and bound to the 0.0.0.0 local IP address, which is the default configuration. Users can check if they are affected by using the netstat -ant | grep 2375 command.Cisco\u2019s Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) said it was aware of a limited number of cases where this vulnerability had been exploited publicly. Organisations can check if their installations have been compromised by using the docker images command and checking the list of containers for anything suspicious.\u201cBecause this vulnerability may allow access to the Cisco CCO software with root privileges, an additional indicator of compromise may be present depending on the goal of the malicious actor,\u201d Cisco said.The vulnerability has been addressed with the release of CCO 4.6.2.

The new malicious program is looking to infect both embedded devices and servers that have an open SSH port by preying on their weak credentials, with the purpose of building a large botnet.The attack method is similar to that observed with Mirai, the Internet of Things botnet that became famous recently after infecting devices in 164 countries: the Trojan searches for poorly-secured devices, infects them, then uses them to spread further. According to ESET, the new threat starts the scan from a small list of IPs, but then incrementally expands the search to more targets.Rakos is written in the Go language and has a binary compressed with the standard UPX tool.The Trojan was observed loading its configuration via standard input (stdin) in YAML format. This configuration file includes various information, including a list of command and control (C&C) servers, the credentials that are used to brute-force devices, and internal parameters.Next, the malware starts a local HTTP server, which allows future versions to kill running instances regardless of their name, and which also attempts to parse a URL query for various parameters. Additionally, the malware creates a web server listening on all interfaces, which is listening to a randomly chosen TCP port (ranging from 20,000 to 60,000).When a remote request is sent to the device via this port, a response containing the IP address is received, researchers say. The malware also sends an initial HTTP request containing important information about the victim device to the C&C server.Interestingly, the researchers noticed that a previous version of the Trojan also scanned for the SMTP service, but that the feature was disabled in the current build, most likely because it is still under development.While analyzing the backdoor\u2019s capabilities, the security researchers discovered that it is also capable of updating the configuration file from a specific C&C location, as well as upgrading itself. Moreover, because it sends information such as the device\u2019s IP address, username, and password, it basically provides the attacker with complete control over the infected device.The botnet wasn\u2019t observed being yet capable of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or spam spreading, but researchers believe that it might receive such functionality, considering the level of control over the infected device it provides the attackers with. source: securityweek"}, {"title": "This New Malware Drains All The Cash From ATMs", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "December 21, 2016", "body": "A newly discovered family of malware targeting ATMs (automated teller machines) has been designed with the sole purpose of emptying cash from the safes of the self-serve machines, Trend Micro security researchers warn.Dubbed Alice, the malware is the most stripped down ATM threat seen to date. The malware has no information stealing capabilities and can\u2019t even be controlled via the ATM\u2019s numeric keypad. Initially discovered in November 2016, Alice is believed to have been around since 2014, and Trend Micro says that it is only the eighth ATM malware family seen to date, although such threats have been around for over nine years.Use of the malware requires physical access to an ATM, and Trend Micro suggests that it has been designed for money mules to steal all the money available in an attacked cash machine, something that malware such as GreenDispenser was seen doing last year.Unlike that piece of malware, however, the new threat doesn\u2019t connect to the ATM\u2019s PIN pad and can also be used via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), although Trend Micro says that there\u2019s no evidence of such use as of now.Malware analysis revealed that Alice (the name was included in the version information of the binary) was packed with a commercial, off-the-shelf packer/obfuscator called VMProtect, which prevents execution inside debuggers. Further, the malware checks its environment before execution and terminates itself if it determines it isn\u2019t running on an ATM (it checks for a couple of registry keys and also requires specific DLLs to be installed on the system).When running on a machine, Alice writes two files in the root directory, namely an empty 5 MB+ sized file called xfs_supp.sys and an error logfile called TRCERR.LOG. Next, it connects to the CurrencyDispenser1 peripheral, which is the dispenser device in the XFS environment and, if a correct PIN is provided, it displays information on the various cassettes with money loaded inside the machine.Because the malware only connects to the CurrencyDispenser1 peripheral and doesn\u2019t attempt to use the machine\u2019s PIN pad, the researchers believe that the attackers physically open the ATM and infect it via USB or CD-ROM. Moreover, they suggest that the actors connect a keyboard to the machine\u2019s mainboard and operate the malware through it.The security researchers discovered that Alice supports three commands, each issued via specific PINs: one to drop a file for uninstallation, another to exit the program and run the uninstallation/cleanup routine, and a third to open the \u201coperator panel.\u201d This panel is where information on the cash available inside the ATM is displayed.source: securityweek"}, {"title": "Google Released an Open Source Pentesting Tool Called Project Wycheproof", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "December 21, 2016", "body": "Google this week announced the availability of Project Wycheproof, an open source tool designed for finding known vulnerabilities in popular cryptographic software libraries.Developed in Java due to its common cryptographic interface, Project Wycheproof includes tests for the most popular crypto algorithms, including AES-EAX, AES-GCM, DH, DHIES, DSA, ECDH, ECDSA, ECIES and RSA.

But all that could be hosted on the page was a video ad.With faked domain registrations, they were able to trick algorithms that decided where the most profitable ads would go into buying their fraudulent web space. Those algorithms typically make bids for ad space most suitable for the advertisement\u2019s intended audience, with the auction complete in milliseconds. But AFK13 were able to game the system so their space was purchased over big-name brands.AFK13 then invested heavily in a bot farm, taking up space in data centers so they could fire faked traffic from more than 570,000 bots at those ads, thereby driving revenue thanks to the pay per click system they exploited.As part of what White Ops called the Methbot campaign, those bots \u201cwatched\u201d as many as 300 million video ads a day, with an average payout of $13.04 per thousand faked views. And the fraudsters had their bot army replicate the actions of real people, with faked clicks, mouse movements and social network login information.It\u2019s unclear where the Russian link comes from.

This feature was added to Mirai Botnet #14 which has infected morethan 3 million devices by the end of November.In late November, a Mirai variant managed to hijack 900,000 routers from German ISP Deutsche Telekom using port 7547. Soon after, the same malware attack was confirmed to have also hit around 100,000 UK TalkTalk and Post Office ISP users. The attacks were revealed to leverage the TR-064 vulnerability, which can be used to steal WiFi network keys in addition to recruiting the router into a botnet.Researchers with the China-based Network Security Research Lab at Qihoo 360, who managed to crack the Mirai DGA, said last week that multiple Mirai samples were using the functionality and that they were leveraging three different top-level domains (TLDs) for that.In a new post, the security researchers reveal that newly observed Mirai samples dropped the initial seed series and adopted a new one. Thus, new domains that matched the Mirai DGA algorithm but no longer featured the previous seed series were detected.The new domains were said to belong to new Mirai variants because layer 2 (L2) domain had the same 12-character length, a-y only, and because all TLDs for these domains were fixed to .online, one of the TLDs observed in the previous samples. What\u2019s more, the botnet operators exercised a strict time control over the creation of the domain, to ensure that the overlapping window was very short.The researchers managed to brute-force the new DGA as well, and they even provided a list of the domains the Mirai samples will supposedly use before the end of the year. However, they also noted that at least one of the already generated domains wasn\u2019t registered.According to a report from BleepingComputer, however, there\u2019s a clear explanation of why that happened: Mirai is moving to Tor (The Onion Router) domains because they are far more difficult to shut down.

Apple was notified about the flaw in mid-August and patched it earlier this month with the release of MacOS 10.12.2.FileVault 2 is a full-disk encryption program that uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key to preventing unauthorised access to the information on the startup disk. Frisk has demonstrated that an attacker with physical access to a locked or sleeping MacBook can retrieve the FileVault 2 password in clear text by connecting a special device to the targeted system\u2019s Thunderbolt port.According to the expert, these attacks are possible due to two vulnerabilities. One of them is related to the fact that while direct memory access (DMA) attack protections are enabled by default once MacOS has started, these protections are not active before the operating system has booted. This allows an attacker to read and write memory from a MacBook by connecting a Thunderbolt device.Since the FileVault 2 password is stored in cleartext in memory at predictable locations, software running on the Thunderbolt device can retrieve the password from memory before it is overwritten. The attacker must gain access to a locked or sleeping MacBook, connect the Thunderbolt device and reboot the computer. The attack does not work if the targeted MacBook has been shut down as the password is no longer available in memory. The device that can be used to carry out such an attack has been dubbed PCILeech, and its source code and hardware requirements have been made available by Frisk. The expert said he tested the attack on multiple MacBook and MacBook Air computers with Thunderbolt 2 ports.

Yahoo only recently uncovered the hack and disclosed it last week.The timing of the attack might seem like bad luck, but the weakness of MD5 had been known by hackers and security experts for more than a decade. MD5 can be cracked more easily than other so-called \u201chashing\u201d algorithms, which are mathematical functions that convert data into seemingly random character strings.In 2008, five years before Yahoo took action, Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute issued a public warning to security professionals through a US government-funded vulnerability alert system: MD5 \u201cshould be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.\u201dYahoo\u2019s failure to move away from MD5 in a timely fashion was an example of problems in Yahoo\u2019s security operations as it grappled with business challenges, according to five former employees and some outside security experts.

It was targeting the users of Australia, the U.K., New Zealand and Germany. Since it was first discovered, this malware is found to be capable of launching redirection attacks.In the countries which the malware is already operating, the activity is increased. Also the operations of the malware are expanded to Asian countries also. This malware won\u2019t be the last one to reach Singapore, Dyre, Dridex, Neverquest and Tinba malware will follow the TrickBot and attack the users.The main reason for which Singapore attracts cybercriminals is because organisations there also communicate in English, even if this is primarily a Chinese-speaking country. Thus, the cybercriminals don\u2019t need to invest too much when it comes to adapting their spam and tools to the new location.TrickBot was designed to focus on business accounts, corporate and commercial banking, and wealth management across all targeted banks.

Previously, the malware featured redirections for only 35% of the target URLs.Unlike TrickBot, other Trojans are reducing their redirection attacks or completely removing them, IBM says.

The memo, from CIA Director John Brennan, read as follows:Earlier this week, I met separately with (Director) FBI James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election.The three of us also agree that our organizations, along with others, need to focus on completing the thorough review of this issue that has been directed by President Obama and which is being led by the DNI.The CIA\u2019s investigation found that Russian government hackers had a clear goal of helping Trump win the election. These cyber attacks weren\u2019t attempts to tamper with election results, but rather the hackers stole data from both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee, but only the latter\u2019s was made public.The full details of the CIA\u2019s report are of course classified, but when it first made news, some Republican lawmakers tried to argue that the FBI wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree with the assessment.

This is possible because the Linux GStreamer media playback framework offers support for the playback of SNES music files by emulating the SNES CPU and audio processor.The library that makes all this possible is Game_Music_Emu, which works in C and C++ and is very easy to use.The core emulation logic of the faulty Sony SPC700 processor contains at least two vulnerabilities: a missing X register value clamp for the MOV (X)+,An instruction; and a missing SP register value clamp for the RET1 instruction. By cascading the first vulnerability, the Evans managed to achieve reliable exploitation, with all of the technical details published on his blog.For the exploit to work and the drive-by to be successful, the user has to visit a malicious webpage, where audio files encoded in the SPC music format but saved with the .flac and .mp3 extensions are located.The files can be used to load and run the attacker\u2019s code with the same privileges as those of the current user. Depending on the privileges the user has, the exploit could result in the theft of personal data, including photos, videos, or documents, as well as data stored in the browser.To offer a glimpse of the exploit, the security researcher also published two videos, showing the vulnerability being leveraged in both Fedora 25 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Evans also made available the files needed to test the exploit and decided to offer a glimpse at different exploitation contexts in the second clip, although the same exploit file is used for all of them.\u201cThe strong reliability of this exploit makes it work inside Fedora\u2019s tracker-extract process, which has highly variable heap state,\u201d the researcher says.The impact on Linux distributions is mixed, with Ubuntu being impacted the most, as the faulty code is installed and present on the attack surface by default, though the user needs to select the \u2018mp3\u2019 option during install. On Fedora, the attack surface is limited, because gstreamer1-plugins-bad is split into multiple packages, and only gstreamer1-plugins-bad-freeis installed by default.However, the general lack of sandboxing contributes to the severity of the issue. \u201cI think we inhabit the world where media parsing sandboxes should be mandatory these days. There\u2019s hope: some of my other recent disclosures appear to have motivated a sandbox for Gnome\u2019s tracker,\u201d the researcher explains.A few weeks ago, Evans detailed another Linux exploit leveraging Nintendo Entertainment System, one that leveraged a vulnerability and a separate logic error in the gstreamer 0.10.x player. The two issues would result in the bypass of 64-bit ASLR, DEP, but the exploit would work only on very old Linux distributions."}, {"title": "Russian Hackers Seized Control of Pentagon Email System", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "December 17, 2016", "body": "An unclassified email system used by the Pentagon was compromised by Russian hackers in 2015, forcing security teams to take the entire network down in order to fix the breach.Martin Dempsey, who was at that time Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told CBS that he was informed of the breach by the Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Mike Rogers, revealing that in approximately one hour, hackers seized control of the entire email system.However, Dempsey explains that the email service was used by staff of the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Chiefs staff, which involves some 3,500 military officers and civilians who work for the chairman, and included only unclassified emails that \u201chad no real intelligence value.\u201dAccording to Dempsey, hackers managed to obtain passwords and electronic signatures that he personally used to access the network, so taking the entire system offline was the only way to deal with the problem.As for the identity of the hackers, the United States officials believed they were Russians who were trying to fight back at the Pentagon after the US issued economic sanctions against their country for the conflict in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea.The attack was launched with compromised severs from a West Coast university, which were used to send a total of 30,000 emails. Four of them were eventually forwarded to Joint Chiefs of Staff employees and included malicious files that infected computers when executed. At least one of them was opened by an employee and eventually compromised the system before spreading across the entire network.The Pentagon had to replace both hardware and software following the attack and this required approximately two weeks, Dempsey revealed in the interview.Obviously, the Pentagon hasn\u2019t provided any statement on this, but given the fact that the information comes from the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there\u2019s a good chance that everything is accurate.

In particular  accusations are on the APT28 (Fancy Bear) hacking group which is thought to be linked to the Russian government.Some cyber experts in Germany suggest that, even the recent attack on Deutsche Telekom routers is also a part of Russia\u2019s plan, but there is no proof to show the same. Last year\u2019s attack against the German parliament, and attacks against German politicians in August, are also blamed on Russia. Speaking earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel commented, \u201cSuch cyber-attacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them.\u201dNow both the heads of the German foreign intelligence agency (BND), Bruno Kahl, and the domestic intelligence agency (BfV), Hans-Georg Maassen, have warned about increasing Russian cyber activity in Germany.Last week Kahl told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, \u201cThere are findings that cyber-attacks take place which have no other meaning than to create political uncertainty. There is a kind of pressure on public discourse and on democracy, which is unacceptable.\u201d He added that there are indications of Russian involvement. \u201cAttribution to a state actor is technically difficult, but there is some evidence that it is at least tolerated or desired by the state.\u201dYesterday, however, a statement issued by the BfV was more forthright. \u201cSince the start of the Ukraine crisis,\u201d it started, \u201cwe have seen a significant increase in Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns in Germany.\u201d It warns of a broad spectrum of instruments and \u201can enormous use of financial resources on Russia\u2019s part\u201d designed to strengthen extremist groups in order to shape political discourse in Germany.The statement names APT28 as using a campaign that is often executed as \u2018false flags\u2019. \u201cThis approach represents a previously unseen methodology in campaigns that are controlled by Russia.\u201d Note however, that many experts believe that the attack against French television company TV5  was also a \u2018false flag\u2019: in reality APT28 pretending to be ISIS.The statement goes on to say, \u201cSpear-phishing against political parties and parliamentary groups have increased dramatically. They are attributed to the APT28 campaign, which was also responsible for the DNC hack. APT28 successfully exfiltrated data from the German Bundestag in 2015.\u201dMaassen describes the method and motivation behind the APT28 campaign. \u201cPropaganda, disinformation, cyber-attacks, cyber espionage and cyber sabotage are part of hybrid threats against western democracies.\u201d He points to social networks as the new way for people to share and consume information, adding that it provides the perfect entry point for disinformation and campaigns designed to reshape public opinion.He also warns of an \u201cincrease in cyber espionage within the political arena\u201d. Government officials, members of the Bundestag, and party workers all face a potential threat. \u201cStolen information could be used in the election campaign to discredit German politicians.\u201dThe political theory is that Russia will benefit from a weakened European Union \u2014 already wounded by Brexit.

Mail vulnerability that could have been exploited simply by getting the targeted user to open a specially crafted email.Nearly one year ago, Jouko Pynn\u00f6nen of Finland-based software company Klikki Oy discovered a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web version of the Yahoo! Mail service that could have allowed an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code hidden in emails.The researcher said the flaw could have been used to forward the victim\u2019s emails, change their account settings and even create an email worm that attached itself to all outgoing emails.The vulnerability, which earned Pynn\u00f6nen $10,000, existed due to Yahoo\u2019s failure to properly sanitise code in HTML emails.The expert recently decided to take another look at Yahoo\u2019s Mail service and discovered a similar flaw, but this time it was related to code inserted when a certain type of content is attached to an email.The \u201cShare files from cloud providers\u201d attachment option allows users to attach files from their cloud storage accounts, such as Dropbox or Google Drive. While analysing the code inserted into an email when this option was used, Pynnonen noticed some HTML attributes named data-* (e.g. data-URL, data-category, data-embed-URL). Further analysis showed that these attributes are also used when a YouTube video is added to an email.The researcher found a way to abuse these attributes in YouTube video attachments to get arbitrary JavaScript code executed. There was no need for the user to click on a link or open an attachment \u2013 the code would get executed as soon as the email was opened.Similar to the flaw discovered one year ago, this security hole could have been exploited to steal a user\u2019s emails and create a worm that spreads by attaching itself to outgoing emails, the expert said.Pynn\u00f6nen told SecurityWeek that he did not get a chance to test the attack method using the Google Drive and Dropbox attachment options. Yahoo was informed about the vulnerability on November 12 and fixed it by the end of November.Yahoo awarded the expert a $10,000 bounty for the flaw.

This uses Word documents that contain malicious macros and it is abusing PowerShell for a fileless infection.This malware is being distributed by TA530, who is an actor already known to be involved in very highly personalised campaigns. The August distribution campaign, researchers say, was targeting customer service and managerial staff at retailers in an attempt to steal sensitive documents and credentials from the compromised machines.To ensure successful infection, the actor used subject lines for the emails to reference to issues pertaining to alleged purchases from the targeted company\u2019s website. These emails were targeted at employees who could supposedly help resolve the problems, which made it likely that they would open the attached documents, which supposedly contained detailed information about the issue.However, as soon as the recipient opened the document, they would be prompted to enable the macros, which in turn would launch a PowerShell command to download and install the August stealer on the machine. The malicious payload is downloaded from a remote site as a PowerShell byte array, along with a few lines of code to deobfuscate the array through a XOR operation.The security researchers noticed that the macros used in this campaign are similar to those used in a campaign delivering the Ursnif banking Trojan. They are meant to add sandbox evasion capabilities to the distribution attempt by performing checks such as Maxmind, task counts, task names, and recent file counts.The August stealer was written in .NET and its authors used Confuser to obfuscate it. By looking at the source code from a particular sample, Proofpoint researchers determined that the threat can steal and upload files with specified extensions to a command and control (C&C) server, can steal .rdp and wallet.dat files, and can also steal cryptocurrency wallets including Electrum and Bither, in addition to being able to determine whether security tools such as Wireshark and Fiddler are installed on the machine.Additionally, the malware can grab credentials from FTP applications (such as SmartFTP, FileZilla, TotalCommander, WinSCP, and CoreFTP) and messenger apps (Pidgin, PSI, LiveMessenger, and others); can collect cookies and passwords from Firefox, Chrome, Thunderbird, and Outlook; can communicate the hardware ID, OS name, and victim\u2019s username to the C&C server; and can encrypt network data via base64 encoding, character replacement, adding a random key (passed to server encoded in the User-Agent field), and reversing the strings.\u201cAugust could be used to steal credentials and files in a wide range of scenarios. The malware itself is obfuscated while the macro used in these distribution campaigns employs a number of evasion techniques and a fileless approach to load the malware via PowerShell. All of these factors increase the difficulty of detection, both at the gateway and the endpoint,\u201d Proofpoint researchers say.Because cybercriminals are using increasingly sophisticated and personalised email lures, organisations are advised to use email gateways that can detect macros with sandbox evasion built-in. They should also consider educating their employees on emails that do not initially look suspicious, but which could carry malware."}, {"title": "Microsoft Officially Announced the Minimum PC Specs Required to Run Windows 10 VR", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "December 8, 2016", "body": "Microsoft is betting big on virtual reality with Windows 10, and the company is trying to bring this experience to all users of its latest operating system, so the firm is working with partners to launch VR headsets on the market at very affordable prices.At WinHEC today, Redmond finally confirmed the minimum PC requirements for Windows 10 VR, after all, these details got leaked a few weeks back.And what\u2019s important is that the majority of computers running Windows 10 should be able to cope with VR requirements as well because what they need is an Intel Core i5 processor, integrated Intel HD graphics card, 8 GB of RAM, and 100 GB of storage (you can see all specifications at the end of the article).The specs aren\u2019t overwhelming and are exactly the same with the ones we\u2019ve seen before, and it\u2019s very clear that Microsoft is trying to make the VR experience to as many users as possible.Also at WinHEC, Microsoft announced that starting February next year, developers would get access to Windows 10 VR headsets, as the company is pushing hard for this new effort to be ready when the Creators Update goes live.The new Windows 10 OS update is expected in March, and The Verge writes that Microsoft\u2019s goal is to make these VR headsets available for developers at the Game Developers Conference in Francisco before they debut publicly.

It was assumed that the UK victims were the outer ripples of the primary attack; and this was confirmed by a subsequent report that quoted the Mirai developer as apologizing for the effect on the Post Office. The UK disruption was apparently an accident and not done intentionally.This version of events is now questioned by the findings of Pen Test Partners. Senior consultant Andrew Tierney reported Friday that the effect on TalkTalk routers was different to the effect on Deutsche Telekom routers. \u201cWe can\u2019t see what is causing the claimed ISP outages for TalkTalk and the Post Office reported in the press. It shouldn\u2019t stop the router routing, and as of yet, the bots haven\u2019t taken part in any attacks.\u201dPen Test Partners concluded, \u201cWhilst the spread and purpose of the bot net is similar to Mirai, there are enough differences with this variant that it should really get a new name.\u201dIn a subsequent post on Saturday, Tierney seems to have named the second worm \u2018Annie\u2019.\u201cThe TR-064 security hole that was reported this week is really nasty,\u201d he reported. \u201cThe worm that exploits this is being referred to as \u2018Annie\u2019. Attackers appear to have cottoned on to the fact that the TR-064 vulnerability can be used for more than just recruiting the router into a botnet.\u201d The additional purpose, he suggested, is to steal the router\u2019s WiFi network key. Worryingly, he also claims that the fix pushed out by TalkTalk will most likely not solve the problem.Following the incident, TalkTalk published its solution: customers should switch off affected routers and leave them for 20 minutes while they update with new software. \u201cAfter 20 minutes try and access the internet again, if you\u2019ve changed your wireless details then you\u2019ll need to use the wireless network name and password on the back of the router.\u201dBut Tierney sees a problem with this: it won\u2019t work as a fix. \u201cNearly all customers never change their Wi-Fi key from that written on the router. Why would they? I\u2019ll bet many don\u2019t even realize they can.\u201d So what happens is that Annie steals the key, and \u201cthe TalkTalk fix simply resets the router, to the exact same keys that have already been stolen!!\u201dHaving acquired the WiFi key, a hacker can listen in to communications and infect the network with additional malware. He would need to be in close physical proximity to the router (outside, perhaps in a closely parked vehicle); but, added Tierney, \u201cif you know the SSID (also stolen using the Annie worm) you can use databases such as https://wigle.net to find your victim\u2019s house.\u201d His solution is that TalkTalk \u201cshould be REPLACING all customers routers urgently;\u201d possibly as many as 55,000.TalkTalk itself is not currently keen to do so. A spokeswoman told the BBC that the number of infected routers had been \u201cnothing in that order of magnitude\u201d. She added, \u201cOur security team does not believe there is any greater risk that a customer\u2019s wi-fi can be used or accessed without their permission as a result of this.\u201dDr. Steven Murdoch from University College London suggested something in between the two positions. \u201cIt\u2019s possible [the perpetrators of Annie] are just security researchers, but also reasonably possible that they are actually criminals that intend to exploit this information.\u201d He doesn\u2019t believe that TalkTalk needs necessarily recall all the routers: \u201cThe hardware is fine, what needs to be replaced is the wi-fi password.\u201dHe does, however, admit that this is difficult. \u201cIf TalkTalk does this online or over the phone, that leaves the customers open to phishing attacks, where a scammer says: \u2018As you heard on the news you need to change your password, please do these things\u2026'\u201dTalkTalk remains adamant that even the password change is unnecessary.

One of the compromised sites, known as a watering hole, belonged to a major public service organisation in Taiwan.When users accessed this website\u2019s registration page, an iframe injected into the footer loaded an exploit landing page. The Internet Explorer vulnerability leveraged by this exploit, tracked as CVE-2016-0189, was fixed by Microsoft in May, but it had been seen in targeted attacks against users in South Korea before a patch was made available.A few weeks after Microsoft resolved the flaw, researchers published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. The PoC code was used by cybercriminals to integrate the security hole into several exploit kits.The same PoC code has been used in the CNACOM campaign, but the payload has been invoked through an Internet Explorer sandbox escape flaw tracked as CVE-2015-0016.In the CNACOM attacks, the exploit code collects information from the device, including its IP address. If the victim uses Internet Explorer and the IP address is known to belong to the Taiwanese government, the exploit delivers a variant of the malware dubbed Ixeshe.Ixeshe has been around since at least 2009 and it has been observed in attacks aimed at East Asian governments and electronics manufacturers, including in Taiwan. The malware was also linked to the attacks launched in 2012 against The New York Times.The group behind Ixeshe, also known as APT12, Numbered Panda and DynCalc, is believed to be operating out of China.According to Zscaler, the Ixeshe variant spotted in the recent Taiwan attacks is different from older versions as the campaign codes it uses are embedded into the malware, which could indicate that the threat relies on a more centralised tracking system.Zscaler is not the only security firm to monitor China-linked attacks aimed at Taiwan\u2019s government.

What\u2019s more, the researchers explain that reverse-engineering the protocols is highly feasible even for attackers with limited knowledge and resources and without physical access to devices.The research was conducted on the latest generation of a widely used ICD, which uses a long-range RF channel (from two to five meters) for communication, using a black-box approach and inexpensive Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment. While analyzing the protocols, the security researchers discovered weaknesses in them and in their implementations, and they also managed to conduct several attacks against the vulnerable devices.These attacks, which include replay and spoofing, can put patients\u2019 safety at risk, especially since they can be performed without being in close proximity to the patient. The security researchers suggest that the discovered issues affect at least 10 types of ICDs currently on the market and say that manufacturers have been contacted before the publication of the paper.The researchers started their analysis with an attempt to intercept the wireless transmissions between the device programmer and the ICD, and focused on reverse-engineering the proprietary protocol used to communicate over the long-range channel. Next, they looked into ways to activate the ICD before carrying out attacks and discovered several ways to bypass the current activation procedure.After fully reverse-engineering the proprietary protocol, the researchers focused on discovering vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit, and revealed that active and passive software radio-based attacks such as privacy, DoS, and spoofing and replay attacks are possible. They also say that adversaries might not even need to be in the proximity of the vulnerable devices because sophisticated equipment and directional antennas could allow them to extend the attack distance by several orders of magnitude."}, {"title": "India \u2013 22 Year Old Indian Hacks PM Narendra Modi\u2019s App", "topics": ["Hacking News", "Vulnerabilities"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "December 4, 2016", "body": "According to a report by Your Story, a 22 year-old hacker Javed Khatri claimed that he was able to hack PM Narendra Modi app which is separate from the official app and is available on Android, iOS and Windows.Javed Khatri in an email to Your Story, said, \u201cI am able to access private data of any user on the app. The data includes phone number, email, name, location, interests, last seen etc.\u201d\u201cI successfully managed to extract the personal phone numbers and email ids of ministers like Smriti Irani.

The purpose of both of these is to help developers to locate the bugs in their code which might eventually lead to breaches. Even though the purpose of both of these organisations works for the same cause, one is a paid service while the other is free; one is proprietary while the other is open source.Google has described the OSS-Fuzz as \u2018continuous fuzzing for open source software\u2019. According to the development team in Google\u2019s Testing Blog, \u201cOSS-Fuzz\u2019s goal, is to make common software infrastructure more secure and stable by combining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable distributed execution. OSS-Fuzz combines various fuzzing engines (initially, libFuzzer) with Sanitizers (initially, AddressSanitizer) and provides a massively distributed execution environment powered by ClusterFuzz.\u201dIt fills a gap left by Project Springfield. Since the fuzzing field offered by the Microsoft is a commercial product, it can only be used by the customers willing to pay and afford it. This does not exclude open source developers as they love open source software, but it is noticeable that it is specifically marketed to business customers: suitable for testing in-house software, software acquired through M&A, and even third-party software being considered for purchase.Google notes that \u201cOpen source software is the backbone of the many apps, sites, services, and networked things that make up \u2018the internet\u2019\u2026  An example is the FreeType library, which is used on over a billion devices to display text (and which might even be rendering the characters you are reading now).\u201d It is important that such software is bug-free and secure. \u201cRecently the FreeType fuzzier found a new heap buffer overflow only a few hours after the source change.\u201dThe \u2018continuous\u2019 nature of the service solves another problem: open source software may have multiple maintainers applying software changes almost on an ongoing basis. \u201cOSS-Fuzz automatically notified the maintainer, who fixed the bug\u201d announced Google; \u201cthen OSS-Fuzz automatically confirmed the fix.

According to Zimperium, vulnerabilities in AirDroid allows an attacker to exploit the built-in features and use them against the app users.The main issue that the security researchers pointed is that AirDroid uses insecure communication channels. This means that the app\u2019s millions of users are exposed to a MitM attack and other kinds of attacks.There is also a high risk of information leak along with remote hijacking of update APKs which could result in remote code execution.While analysing AirDroid, the security researchers discovered that the communication channels employed to send authentication data to the statistics server are insecure. While the requests are encrypted with the Data Encryption Standard (DES) symmetric-key block cipher in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, the encryption key is hardcoded inside the application, meaning that the attacker knows it.Armed with these details, an actor on the same network with the target device could execute MitM attacks to grab authentication credentials from the very first HTTP request the application performs, and can then impersonate the user for further requests, Zimperium\u2019s Simone Margaritelli explains.\u201cThis HTTP request can be decrypted at runtime using the 890jklms key hardcoded inside the application and the authentication fields parsed from the resulting JSON. Having this information, the attacker can now impersonate the victim\u2019s device and perform various HTTP or HTTPS requests on its behalf to the AirDroid API endpoints,\u201d the researcher notes.An attacker could craft a payload encrypted in DES with the same exact key to trick the server into spewing user information, which will result in the email and password hash being exposed.

Changing passwords frequently has been often described as bad practice, especially because doing this repeatedly can eventually lead to users turning to easy-to-remember passwords that can be quickly compromised by hackers.Furthermore, it\u2019s been proved that corporations forcing their employees to change their passwords on a frequent basis are actually more exposed because of the same reasons: workers end up using simpler passwords that are easier to remember, and this can\u2019t lead to anything good.Security experts have questioned FBI\u2019s tweets, and one of those who recommended exactly the opposite is Per Thorsheim, who founded his own password conference to discuss the importance of passwords.In a statement for Motherboard, Thorsheim explained that changing passwords frequently is a thing that you shouldn\u2019t do and there are other ways to remain secure online.\u201cI am surprised and sad to see that the FBI continues to give out bad advice when solid academic research, numerous organisations, corporations and the US government themselves have said for at least half a year now that frequently changing your passwords is a bad idea,\u201d he said.\u201cWhile I don\u2019t know who at the FBI is in control of their Twitter account, the people behind it do not seem to be in control of current best practices.

This is absolutely mandatory and it\u2019s a confirmation that if you care about your security and don\u2019t download suspicious files, it\u2019s pretty hard to get hacked.In order to trick Tesla owners into downloading the app, hackers used a simple incentive such as a free burger. They created a free and open Wi-Fi hotspot in the proximity of a Tesla charging station and advertised the app on connected phones, claiming that owners can receive a free burger if they install it.Supposing the Tesla owner install this malicious app, hackers can then connect to the phone and prepare the hijack. Promon says that the Tesla companion app is granted an OAuth token when connecting the Tesla server with a username and password.\u201cThe first time the user logs into the Tesla app, the token is obtained and then stored in cleartext in a file in the app\u2019s sandbox folder. When the app is restarted, the token is read and used for subsequent requests,\u201d the security researchers explain.The next step is to reset this token, which in turn would prompt users to input the username and password for the app once again. To do this, attackers only have to remove the token completely, so when Tesla owners provide the username and password, hackers can intercept the data and use it to authenticate in the app.What comes next is not hard to imagine. With hackers getting full access to the Tesla companion app, they can locate the car and even enable the keyless driving functionality that makes it possible to drive it without a key.What\u2019s also important to note is that this isn\u2019t a vulnerability in Tesla cars themselves, but a glitch in mobile apps that could be used by attackers to steal the vehicles. Researchers explain that this only shows the risks of having objects controlled by smartphone apps, and recommend users to update their systems and apps and to always, but always, avoid downloading apps coming from untrusted sources.+Source: Softpedia"}, {"title": "Use This Web-based Tool to Check if Your Network is Exposed to Malware", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "November 24, 2016", "body": "Users can now check whether their network is exposed to Mirai, one of the most prolific botnets to have targeted Internet of Things (IoT) devices this year.The botnet was initially detailed in early September, but it became more popular in early October when its author released the source code online. The malware, designed to harness the power of insecure IoT devices to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, had been previously used in massive incidents targeting Brian Krebs\u2019 blog and hosting provider OVH.With the primary purpose of IoT botnets being DDoS attacks, it\u2019s no wonder that Akamai said that Mirai wasn\u2019t alone in the 665 gigabits per second (Gbps) attempt to take down Krebs. However, security researchers reported that Mirai was increasingly used in DDoS incidents following the source code leak.One such Mirai attack targeted DNS provider Dyn and disrupted popular websites such as Twitter, Etsy, GitHub, Soundcloud, PagerDuty, Spotify, Shopify, Airbnb, Intercom and Heroku. With infected devices in 164 countries and the use of Internet protocols that aren\u2019t usually associated with DDoS attacks, such as STOMP floods, Mirai continues to wreak havoc.Because Mirai\u2019s success is fueled by the existence of IoT devices that aren\u2019t properly secured, it could be easily countered by simply changing the default credentials on vulnerable devices and by closing the Telnet port the botnet uses for infection. That, however, is an operation that users and network admins need to perform, but they might not always be aware of such an issue impacting them.To help users determine whether their network is exposed to Mirai or not, IoT Defense Inc., a startup company based in the Washington DC Metro area, launched a web scanner that does exactly that: it searches for opened TCP ports and informs users whether they are safe or not.The IoT Defense scanner was written using a combination of Python, Node JS and Jade frameworks and scans for nearly a dozen ports that botnets can exploit. Accessing and using the scanner is free and little instructions are needed, as it does all with a simple click of a button.The tool was designed to scan for ports such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet (both 23 and the alternative 2323), HTTP, HTTPS, Microsoft-SQL-Server, EtherNet/IP, Telnet (alternative), Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Web Proxy, and Apache Tomcat SSL (HTTPS).While not all of these ports are targeted by Mirai, a couple is, with the 2323 Telnet port being specifically attacked. The IoT botnet scans the Internet for exposed IoT devices such as routers, IP cameras, and DVRs, and, when it finds vulnerable devices, it attempts to log into them using a list of default login credentials.This, however, is a behaviour employed by other botnets as well. What\u2019s more, while disinfecting a device compromised by Mirai is very easy, because a simple reboot would suffice, keeping the malware away from that device is more complicated. Because of constant scans, vulnerable IoT products are re-infected within minutes.Device vendors are those who need to take action because users rarely do so T. Roy, CEO, IoT Defense, told SecurityWeek via email. They should add in-field auto-updates to their devices, should use per-device unique passwords (something that router manufacturers have already started implementing), and should not open up unnecessary ports.Because their incentives are not aligned with device vendors, it\u2019s clear that users might not be the ones to fix this issue. Users might not care \u2013 provided that they are aware of an issue \u2013 that their routers, IP cameras, or DVRs are used to DDoS websites and DNS providers. As long as the bandwidth usage doesn\u2019t affect them, they are not disadvantaged, and T. Roy believes that one solution would be for ISPs to impose bandwidth caps.A set of rules to impose stricter security of IoT devices would also be of help, and steps in this direction are already being taken, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publishing its Strategic Principles for Securing the Internet of Things. The document includes six non-binding principles designed to provide security across the design, manufacturing and deployment of connected devices.IoT Defense\u2019s CEO also notes that IoT vendors need to have a servicing model in place, to resolve vulnerabilities in their devices when they are discovered. Just as it happens with many other products, vendors would be given a window to resolve the found issues or face consequences. However, he isn\u2019t very optimistic about vendors actually taking the stance.\u201cAs of today, IoT device manufacturers have very little to show for security which always gets trumped by new features and time or market concerns. It is wishful thinking to expect device vendors to step up their game and make security and privacy key differentiators for their products,\u201d T. Roy said.Last year, Gartner said that the number of connected devices will grow above the 20 billion mark by 2020. Now, Juniper Research estimates that there will be 38.5 billion connected IoT devices by that year and that 70% of these units are expected to be non-consumer devices. Should the level of insecurity within these devices remain the same, the consequences will be dire for consumers, enterprises, and vendors alike.

What the researchers did  here is a little different, they managed to do what we said before and also using the output channel of the audio card for input signal and then recording sound.For this they used a malware called Speak(a)r, the security researchers turned headphones into microphones by converting vibrations in the air emitted by the sound (just like your voice) into electromagnetic signals. This makes it possible for the headphone to act as a regular microphone and detect pretty much any sound from across the room.The next step was to trick the output channel of the audio chip to become an input channel and thus allow the recording of sound. According to Wired, this was possible thanks to a feature that\u2019s available in the Realtek audio codec chip, making it possible for the malware to record audio.Realtek chips are being used on the majority of Windows and Mac systems these days, and security researchers claim that this leaves most of our computers vulnerable to such attacks.\u201cThis is the real vulnerability,\u201d says Mordechai Guri, the research lead of Ben Gurion\u2019s Cyber Security Research Labs. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes almost every computer today vulnerable to this type of attack.\u201d\u201cPeople don\u2019t think about this privacy vulnerability. Even if you remove your computer\u2019s microphone, if you use headphones you can be recorded.\u201dSo what can you do to remain protected? Not much, security researchers say, as their tests have shown that it\u2019s possible to record sound from as far as 20 feet away (that\u2019s about 6 meters) without you even knowing about it.Since the vulnerability exists in the Realtek chip, no software patch could fix it, and the only way to deal with this is to upgrade the hardware to prevent exploits in the future. But as far as the majority of systems currently out there and featuring these chips are concerned, there\u2019s not much you can do about it, other than removing the headphones every time you stop using them."}, {"title": "Researchers Found 57 Million Scans for Netis Router Backdoor", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "November 22, 2016", "body": "News of a backdoor in routers produced by China-based networking solutions provider Netis Systems might be of the past, but the vulnerability is part of the present: tens of millions of attempts to scan for the backdoor have been registered since August, Trend Micro researchers warn.Over two years ago, routers produced by Netis Systems, part of the Netcore Group, were revealed to be exposed by a backdoor that would provide an attacker with complete control over the device. The attacker only needed to know the router\u2019s external IP address and could gain access to it through the UDP port 53413, after which they could access the backdoor by entering a password hardcoded in the firmware.With full control over the affected devices, an attacker could modify settings to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks and could perform other nefarious activities as well, security researchers warned. What\u2019s more, the documentation attached to the routers didn\u2019t mention anything about the backdoor and how it could be used, researchers said at the time.Now, Trend Micro says that the backdoor continues to be used, based on data gathered by one of its TippingPoint Digital Vaccine (DV) filters. DV filter 32391, designed to check for any attempt to scan for this specific backdoor, shows a massive amount of backdoor communication attempts.The security firm\u2019s reporting dashboard known as ThreatLinQ has detected around 2.9 million hits since the filter was released in August of 2016, Trend Micro\u2019s Steve Povolny explains. He also underlines that these statistics are based on approximately 5% of customer filter hits, meaning that over 57 million events have been registered in the timeframe.The security researchers decided to analyse the pcaps from the TippingPoint devices and discovered that all of them are true positives. Thus, they decided to deepen their search and discovered a number of public exploit or scanning tools designed to leverage this backdoor functionality specifically.Povolny also notes that they detected nearly 50,000 events on a single IPS in the last week, and that most of them originated from the UK (40,000 hits). Most of the remainder hits came from China and North Korea, and the security researcher says that this data can be retrieved directly from the SMS dashboard.\u201cWhat this highlights is an active campaign of worldwide scanning across the IPv4 space, looking for Internet-accessible routers that respond to the backdoor probe. Given the length of this campaign and the sheer volume, not to mention the ease of exploitation, it\u2019s very likely that a large number of these routers are being compromised and used for nefarious purposes such as man-in-the-middle attacks,\u201d Povolny explains.Netis released a patch for the backdoor a while back, but flaws in implementation and the fact that the backdoor code itself has not been removed render impacted devices vulnerable still.Source: security week"}, {"title": "Social Security Numbers and Personal Information Stolen From Michigan State University", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "November 22, 2016", "body": "Hackers managed to break into a Michigan State University server, gaining access to a database that contained no less than 400,000 records and information concerning current and former students and employees.The University confirmed that the hack took place on November 13, and revealed that the database included names, social security numbers, and MSU identification numbers of faculty, staff, and students who were employed between 1970 and November 13, 2016.On the other hand, the University says that no passwords or financial, academic, contact, or health information was stored in the database that got hacked.Out of the total 400,000 records, 449 were accessed by the hackers, and the University administrators managed to take down the database \u201cwith 24 hours\u201d after detecting the breach.\u201cMSU\u2019s Information Technology team rapidly determined the cause and nature of the breach, and the MSU Police Department is working diligently with federal law enforcement partners to investigate the crime,\u201d the University says.\u201cThere is no evidence unauthorised individuals retrieved the other records; however, as a precaution, MSU is reaching out directly to all individuals who may be affected by this criminal act to offer free credit monitoring.\u201dFurthermore, the University warns that following the breach, some of the students or employees whose data was included in the hacked database might become the target of fraud and identity theft, and suspicious activity should be reported to police immediately.A previous Michigan State University hack was recorded on October 28, when Security Affairs reported that a young hacker managed to break into a database containing names, logins, phone numbers, emails published and encrypted passwords.

With Firefox Focus, Mozilla attempts to tackle these privacy threats by helping users easily erase traces of their browsing sessions from their iOS devices or block online trackers.The new application is expected to provide a fast, free, and easy-to-use browsing experience that will put users in control of how their online activities are tracked on their devices. By default, Firefox Focus will block ad, analytics, social and various other trackers that follow users on the web, all without having to change their privacy or cookie settings.On top of that, the new browser allows users to easily erase their browsing sessions, all with a tap of a button. When searching for information that could prove sensitive in certain situations, regardless of whether it involves engagement rings, flights, or specific merchandise, while also looking to leave no trace on the device, users will be able to erase the session by taping a prominent \u201cErase\u201d button conveniently placed directly on the screen, in the upper right-hand corner.\u201cBy putting the \u201cErase\u201d button front and centre, we offer users a simple path to healthy online behaviours \u2014 protecting their online freedom and taking greater control of their personal data.

Using the software, the computer is configured to prioritise the USB connection over wireless or Ethernet, so it begins sending unencrypted web traffic to PoisonTap.The device automatically collects HTTP authentication cookies and session data from the majority of websites, with the hacker explaining that the top one million websites in Alexa are currently supported. Two-factor authentication is bypassed as well, as PoisonTap looks for cookies and doesn\u2019t attempt to brute-force into the system or compromise login credentials.While this is worrying to say the least, Kamkar explains that the hacking device becomes useless if the computer doesn\u2019t have at least one tab running in a browser. Additionally, he says that computers with USB ports disabled, or put in hibernation mode, are also secure because this way all processes are suspended and the hacking device can no longer siphon data.In case you\u2019re wondering if things like antivirus solutions or stronger passwords can block PoisonTap, this isn\u2019t the case, as the hacking device doesn\u2019t rely in any way on brute-force attacks, so the length of your passwords doesn\u2019t make any difference.Furthermore, given the fact that it uses free software and a specially crafted backdoor, antivirus solutions won\u2019t detect it, leaving the computer fully vulnerable to attacks.The entire process is detailed in the video below and, as a general recommendation, make sure you close your browser before leaving the desktop (we know nobody does that, but this is the simplest thing we can all do to stay protected)."}, {"title": "Adobe Fined $1m For Failing To Protect It\u2019s Users Personal Information", "topics": ["Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "November 17, 2016", "body": "Adobe fined for the massive 2013 data breach that saw around 38 million user credentials stolen and leaked online.

Thus, if the Trojan doesn\u2019t receive instructions within 30 minutes, the connection is terminated.Once installed on a compromised system, the backdoor can execute a multitude of commands: send to the C&C server the quantity of messages transferred during the session; send a list with the contents of the specified folder; send a specified file or a folder with all its contents; delete a directory; delete a file; rename a folder; remove itself; launch a new copy of a process; and close the current session.Other operations supported by the malware include: establish backconnect and run sh; terminate backconnect; open the executable file of the process for writing; close the process file; create a file or folder; write the transmitted values to a file; obtain the names, permissions, sizes, and creation dates of files in the specified directory; set 777 privileges on the specified file.

The company\u2019s malware analysts say the trojan is spread in the form of an archived PDF, Microsoft Office, or OpenOffice file.The infection starts when users open the file. The trojan springs into action by copying itself to \u201c< HOME >/.gconf/apps/gnome-common/gnome-common\u201d and then opens a decoy document, hence his name of \u201cFakeFile.\u201dThe trojan also adds a shortcut to itself in the user\u2019s .profile and .bash_profile files, which allows it to gain boot persistence between PC reboots.Curiously, the trojan has a specific rule in its source code which prevents the infection routine from executing if the Linux distro is openSUSE.

To get a leg up on his competitors, who are also offering cloned Twitter apps, the author says that users can also run multiple accounts at the same time.Avast researchers say that this app, which also uses the official \u201cTwitter\u201d name, secretly logs username and password data entered inside the app\u2019s login field.The app works by starting a VPN connection to Twitter servers when the user starts the fake Twitter app. The VPN allows the app to retrieve Twitter content and bypass China\u2019s state-sanctioned firewall.Avast says that this app is not a pure clone of the official Twitter app, and as such, cannot support multiple accounts by default. To deliver on the promised behavior, the app also includes VirtualCore, an open-source framework that allows developers to create small virtual machines (sandboxes) in which to run another Android app.Both the original app and the VirtualCore-based instances include functions that record whatever the user types in his username and password field when setting up the app and its various accounts.The app then sends this data to the Android logcat service, from where the Dual Instance malware retrieves the username and passwords, and uploads them to a remote server."}, {"title": "ATM Card Hacks Under Control", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Hacking News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "October 20, 2016", "body": "According to Rajiv Anand, Executive Director of Axis Bank said that card hack case is under control currently.

Pre-compiled MBRFilter driver installers for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit platforms are also available for download.

To do this, he has to know the address space where an application executes code inside the computer\u2019s memory. This can be determined quite easily by analyzing the app\u2019s source code.This is where ASLR comes in, scrambling memory addresses and keeping an index. As such, if ASLR works properly, malware or exploit code executes in the wrong memory locations, leaving the computer unharmed.In a paper released this week, a team of computer science experts says they\u2019ve identified a problem with BTB, a cache system which keeps track of memory locations where previous data has been executed. CPUs use BTBs to speed up operations, and they work just like a browser cache speeds up commonly visited web pages.Researchers say that BTB is vulnerable to collision attacks, a term used to describe attacks that bombard the BTB with random data until they find the same data already stored in the buffer.This technique allows the researchers to recover data from the CPU\u2019s kernel that contains ASLR index tables, letting attackers know where a specific app\u2019s code executes so that they can fine-tune their exploits.

The exact number of affected customers is currently unknown.Amazon took a similar step of resetting user passwords in July when a hacker that goes on Twitter by the name of 0x2Taylor uploaded online a file with information on 80,000 Amazon Kindle users.Amazon denied it was hacked, which may be true since hackers can also collect login credentials using malware (password dumpers, infostealers, keyloggers), and don\u2019t have to necessarily breach Amazon\u2019s well-defended servers.This was not the case, though, as 0x2Taylor posted a screenshot of some of the leaked data, hours later, after saying that Amazon ignored him after reporting the security issue.According to those who managed to grab a copy of the leaked data before being taken down, the file included details such as a user\u2019s email, password, city, state, phone number, ZIP code, useragent string, IP address, and street address information.While for that specific incident the truth seemed to lean towards 0x2Taylor\u2019s side of events, Amazon should be happy that it\u2019s been plagued only by smaller-sized breaches, and not by mega breach events that expose details of hundreds of millions of users (cough, Yahoo, cough)."}, {"title": "58 Million User Records Stolen from Data Storage Provider", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News"], "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "October 12, 2016", "body": "An unsecured database has allowed at least one hacker to steal data from the servers of Modern Business Solutions (MBS), a company that provides data storage and database hosting solutions.The company has yet to provide an official statement to the press surrounding the incident, but they have secured the vulnerable database against external access.Responsible for the data breach is a hacker that goes on Twitter as 0x2Taylor. The hacker published the stolen data on his Twitter account on three different occasions after file hosting services kept removing the data from their servers.US cyber-security firm Risk Based Security (RSB) has analyzed the leaked data, and confirmed it came from a MongoDB database, and that it contained details on 58 million users.The stolen data includes details such as full names, IP addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, vehicle data, and occupations.In private conversations with 0x2Taylor, the hacker confirmed to RBS he downloaded the data from a MongoDB database left exposed online.In subsequent conversations, the hacker revealed that a friend had discovered the unprotected MongoDB database using Shodan and foolishly shared the IP online without informing the company first.RBS worked with a reporter from DataBreaches.net and notified the company about the breach.

The malware exploits those devices that rely on default, weak, or hard-coded credentials, and forces them to join giant botnets used in DDoS attacks.A message posted by the hacker who goes by the handle Anna-senpai said the increased attention on IoT-powered botnets in the days since the Krebs DDoS attack was the impetus for releasing the source code.

Wi-Fi signals were also previously used to read hand gestures and lip movements, so the accuracy of Wi-Fi signals is well established in scientific circles.By training a special computer algorithm, our program would be able to detect which key presses are for what keys, and eventually manage to recover text entered on the laptop, according to the team.In an environment with little movement and a slow-typing user, the system\u2019s accuracy was 97.5%.

These extensions were distributed via Facebook posts for all sorts of viral content. Users who clicked on the links were asked to install one of many Chrome extensions which were capable of many more malicious actions apart from hacking your Facebook account.All of these extensions had a similar name like involving the words \u201cviral\u201c, \u201cage\u201c, and \u201cverify\u201c, and were hosted on the Google Chrome Web Store, which helped users dispel any doubts they had about the extension\u2019s legitimacy. Researchers reported the IP addresses used to download the malicious script payload and the C&C servers to Digital Ocean, the company that was hosting the servers.Kjaer Explanation On These Extensions Kjaer explained that all these extensions requested intrusive permissions, such as the ability to \u201cRead and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d, which gives complete control of a user\u2019s visited sites. He added that the extensions contained only three files which executes in persistent mode, that is they couldn\u2019t be paused and executed from when the browser started until the user shut it off.There was no \u201cless than 18\u201d verification process and that the source code found inside this file only started a random timer after the user filled in their date of birth, and then showed \u201cLoading\u2026\u201d during the timer and \u201cDone!\u201d at the end, according to Kjaer.All the malicious activity could be found only in the third file. Because of Google\u2019s automated scans when submitting extensions to the Chrome Store it is not possible to include malicious code inside the extension so this third script would connect to a server and download another script, which it would later execute. By this method the hackers manage to bypass the Google\u2019s scan and upload their extensions.Basically the downloaded script would be able to make requests and receive instructions from a command and control (C&C) server. During Kjaer\u2019s experiment, the C&C server told his browser to access a Facebook URL that exposed his access token, a programmatic key to his Facebook account. Because of the \u201cRead and change all your data on the websites you visit\u201d permissions the user has granted the extension at installation, the crook was able to recover this access token.  As soon as their access token was stolen, the C&C server instructed the user\u2019s browser to give a Like to a Facebook Page Kjaer had never seen before.According to his calculation over 132,265 infected computers had installed the malicious Chrome extensions. He also informed Google, who removed the extensions from the Chrome Web Store and then blacklisted them, which means they were automatically uninstalled from all infected browsers.

Security firm Vectra discovered the vulnerability (CVE-2016-3238), this vulnerability affects all Windows versions ever released. This vulnerability was then fixed by Microsoft in MS16-087. The flaw could allow an attacker to install malware remotely on victim machine that can be used to view, modify or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights, according to MS16-087 bulletin by Microsoft.Usually in corporate networks admins allow printers to deliver the necessary drivers to workstations connected to the network. These drivers are silently installed without any user interaction and run under the SYSTEM user with all the available privileges.An attacker can replace these drivers on the printer with malicious files that allow them to execute any code they\u2019d like on the infected machine, according to Vectra researchers.Watering hole attacks are used to target businesses and organizations by infecting them with malware to gain access to the network. Like servers, several computers are also connected to printers in an effort to print documents as well as download drivers. So this flaw allows a hacker to execute watering hole attacks technically using printers.\u201cRather than infecting users individually, an attacker can effectively turn one printer into a watering hole that will infect every Windows device that touches it,\u201d said Vectra chief security officer Gunter Ollmann.This flaw (CVE-2016-3238) which is easy to execute and plus provides different ways of launch attacks making it more easy for the hackers also a huge number of users can be attacked.

According to the US Justice Department, Simeu sent out numerous targeted phishing emails between July 2011 and September 2014 to employees of various air travel firms.The emails were specifically sent to impersonate official communications, in order to trick the victims into opening fake websites and logging in with their official details. The hacker targeted those employees with access to GDS (Global Distribution System) network, which is generally used by air travel and tourism firms to access airline severs to buy or sell flight tickets.According to the US officials he obtained the GDS login credentials for two companies which includes one from Atlanta, Georgia, and another from Southlake, Texas. After logging into the GDS network he issued numerous airline tickets, which he either used for his personal travels or resold to customers in West Africa at a fraction of their real price.Simeu was arrested by the French police in September 2014 when attempting to use one of his own fraudulent air tickets to travel from Casablanca, Morocco, to Paris. The US finally extradited Simeu and the case is still being investigated by the FBI and the Justice Department.

The two researchers found one critical vulnerability in each board.The Boosted board works with an app, which controls two 1 kilowatt electronic motors, controlling them by a Bluetooth remote. The motor on board moves or stops when it receives the command from Bluetooth remote.Since the Bluetooth communication is not encrypted, attackers can easily hack into the skateboard system.According to Wired the two security researchers said that,\u201d Because the Bluetooth communication is not encrypted or authenticated, a nearby attacker can easily insert himself between the remote and the app, forcing the board to connect to his laptop. Once he achieves this, he can stop the skateboard abruptly, ejecting the rider, send a malicious exploit that causes the wheels to suddenly alter direction and go in reverse at top speed, or disable the brakes.

Qualys reckons the new attack, which works on TLS 1.2, is possible because while TLS has much stricter padding requirements than SSL 3 (which was the target for POODLE), \u201csome TLS implementations omit to check the padding structure after decryption\u201d.Not only that, but because the client is allowed to use TLS, there\u2019s no need for an attacker to try and force the target to fall back to SSL 3 (which, by the way, you should have eliminated entirely and forever from your network by now).Researchers at security firm Qualys says, \u201csome TLS implementations omit to check the padding structure after decryption.\u201d\n\u201cThe impact of this problem is similar to that of POODLE, with the attack being slightly easier to execute\u2013no need to downgrade modern clients down to SSL 3 first, TLS 1.2 will do just fine,\u201d Ivan Ristic, Qualys\u2019s director of application security research, wrote in a blog post titled POODLE bites TLS.\n\u201cThe main target are browsers, because the attacker must inject malicious JavaScript to initiate the attack. A successful attack will use about 256 requests to uncover one cookie character, or only 4096 requests for a 16-character cookie. This makes the attack quite practical.\u201dTill now, load balancers and similar devices which are used to handle the TLS connections sold by two different manufacturers, F5 Networks and A10 Networks, are found vulnerable to the attack.
