From smart cars to CCTV system or smart TV to sockets can be taken over by cyber criminals and use for malicious purposes. Now, it\u2019s time to add new models of AGA ovens to the list since they are operated with the help of smartphone application.AGA is a Swedish firm specializing in manufacturing high-ended heat storage cooker and stove that can cost more than \u00a310,000 and it has been available since 2012. Now, Ken Munro, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, who also happened to be a consumer of one of AGA\u2019s old model cookers was thinking to update his device to the one operated through the app. But he changed his mind when he found out vulnerabilities allowing hackers to turn the oven on/off without the owners\u2019 knowledge with the help of a text message.Related: Maybe Microwaves can be hacked but turn them into cameras? NahIn his blog post, Munro said that \u201cI wanted to know more about its security before spending extra on this option. We found that even Agas can be hacked. Seriously.\u201d According to him, the problem is the way the mobile app communicates with the cooker; even it does not connect to the Internet, an SMS is sent from the Aga\u2019s app to a SIM card embedded in the ovens.This is how it works: The user controls the on/off function via the app installed on their phone, and the app sends a text message to the oven turning it on or off. The researcher explained that this process could be easily hijacked, as hackers could send messages to the cooker that does not belong to them since the SMS messages are not authenticated by the cooker, nor is the sim card set up to send the messages validated on registration.While Munro detailed that the problem is not so much to turn the cooker ON in a dangerous capacity, but the issue is that the company is not taking the security situation seriously enough, as someone with bad intentions could easily find a list of all numbers associated with Aga cookers and control them. He has tried contacting the company numerous times, yet he got no answer but also got blocked by AGA on Twitter.To @AGA_Official PR agency: \"Do you deal with Aga PR?\"\r\r\"Yes\"\r\r \"Can you help me report a security flaw\"\r\r\"Ah, I can't help you with that\"\u2014 Ken Munro (@TheKenMunroShow) April 6, 2017As there is no encryption or a way to verify the communication between the cooker and its app, the researcher detected format between the two devices; these could be copied and be used to control the ovens remotely.\u201cYou probably know it takes hours for an Aga to heat up. Switch it off, annoy the hell out of people,\u201d said Munro. \u201cOne could also power up people\u2019s Agas when they\u2019re not looking, wasting electricity. They draw around 30 Amps in full heat-up mode, so if you could switch enough Agas on at once, one could cause power spikes. That\u2019s a bit fanciful though.\u201d Related: Waze Navigation App Vulnerable, Allow Hackers to Spy on UsersAs a researcher, he recommends AGA to replace this technology to one with a secure WI-FI communication. AGA\u2019s replied that a third-party provides their system and that they are looking into the problem. \u201cWe take such issues seriously and have raised them immediately with our service providers so that we can answer in detail the points raised.\u201dFinally got a call back from @aga_official \u2013 now to see if they will take the offending service down\u2026\u2014 Ken Munro (@TheKenMunroShow) April 12, 2017Pen Test Partners are the same guys who previously found critical vulnerabilities and hacked Samsung Refrigerator, Smart Dildos, Mitsubishi Outlander Hybrid Car, Internet Connected Sex Toys and Record Videos.

Now, hackers have developed a new way to figure out your smartphone\u2019s passcode. You might be thinking that they can do this by using sophisticated methods or tools, but no! This is where you are wrong.How does it work? A new study shows that hackers can simply determine your phone\u2019s passcode watching your phone\u2019s motion sensor \u2013 Cybersecurity researchers from the British Newcastle University showed that hackers could easily figure out the four digit PIN just by watching your hand\u2019s movement and the way the phone is titled.An experiment was conducted by the security researchers to support their claim, and the results were surprising. A neural network of data was used in the experiment and 70% of the times the team was able to determine the correct PIN in the very first try almost while the team cracked all the PINs within five tries.Dr. Maryam Mehrnezhad, a Research Fellow in the School of Computing Science explains that \u201cMost smartphones, tablets and other wearables are now equipped with a multitude of sensors, from the well-known GPS, camera, and microphone to instruments such as the gyroscope, proximity, NFC, and rotation sensors and accelerometer. But because mobile apps and websites don\u2019t need to ask permission to access most of them, malicious programs can covertly \u2018listen in\u2019 on your sensor data and use it to discover a wide range of sensitive information about you such as phone call timing, physical activities and even your touch actions, PINs and passwords.\u201dEven more trouble:Researchers also discovered that if a user opens a page on their smartphone or tablet which hosts one of these malicious codes and then open, for example, their online banking account without closing the previous tab, then they can spy on every personal detail they enter. In some cases, researchers also found that even if all the tabs are closed hackers can still spy on users even when the phone is locked. The hackers can do this because of a JavaScript exploit.Some reliefResearchers have told all the major tech companies about these security flaws. Apple and Firefox have already dealt with it, while other Tech giants are still figuring out a way to cope with these vulnerabilities. Apple released an iOS update earlier this month to address the way Safari browser on iPhone handles Javascript pop-ups.

As if earlier versions of the Adware weren\u2019t good enough, hackers have made some lethal modifications in the new samples, and it is looking even more dangerous than before.Researchers believe that the new modifications in \u201cEwind\u201d have made it much more than just an ordinary adware. As written in their blog post \u201cEwind is more than simply Adware. Ewind is, at very least, an actual Trojan \u2013 subverting genuine Android apps. The actor behind this activity can easily take full control of the victim device.\u201dWhen investigating multiple samples of the Ewind, researchers found that the Adware can do a lot of damage to its victim and could perform multiple tasks. On gaining the administrative rights, attackers can send several commands to the infected device including locking the screen, displaying different ads, preventing the uninstallation of the app, etc.Ewind can also be used to steal SMS and contacts of an infected device. The hackers can steal the sender\u2019s phone number and the SMS content, and it is likely that the feature can be used to bypass two-factor authentication.In case you are wondering how an adware can perform all the above-said function, here is the answer: -Ewind has a list of \u201cTargeted apps\u201d on it, and every time it spots a targeted app, the adware sends a signal to its command and control (C2) server, which then notify Ewind to execute the relevant command.Old School Trick: Hackers behind the adware are using an old school trick to promote Ewind. The trick involves disassembling a popular app of the play store, cloning it with a malicious code inside, and uploading it to third party stores to hunt unwitty users.Some of the popular cloned apps targeted by Ewind include GTA Vice City, AVG cleaner, Minecraft \u2013 Pocket Edition, Avast! Ransomware Removal, Vkontakte, and Opera Mobile.The security firm also found conclusive evidence suggesting that the culprits behind this vicious scheme are from Russia. However, they noticed something strange, something unusual. The hackers are not even sparing their countrymen; this has never happened before.The researchers further explained that \u201cUsually Russian actors avoid targeting Russian subjects.

After all, what are the chances that someone in the world has the same fingerprint, and will try to break into our smartphones, right? Well, things are about to change after the researchers from Michigan State University, and New York University have developed a \u2018masterprints\u2019 technique capable of fooling the fingerprint reader.The researchers have decided to expose the vulnerabilities in fingerprint scanners in the paper that was published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics & Security. In the paper, they claim to have created a set of the so-called \u201cmasterprints\u201d and were able to bypass the scanners in about 65% of the time.Related: Fingerprints are History \u2014 Brain Scans will be the Next-Gen PasswordsAs they claim, the prints were developed in a way that takes advantage of the sensors on most devices. The sensors in question have a flaw in design, and most of them are designed to only match partial scans, instead of every one of the ridges on your finger.Also, since there are often more than one fingerprints recorded on the device, there are also a lot more of parts that the master prints can copy and therefore fool the device. This is good news for hackers and spy agencies who had trouble cracking devices protected by fingerprint scanners, but a very, very bad news for those who use these scanners for their security.One of the authors of this study, NYU\u2019s Nasr Memon, has stated that \u201cThere\u2019s a much greater chance of falsely matching a partial print than a full one, and most devices rely only on partials for identification.\u201dHowever, the researchers have still only tried the master prints in computer simulations, so there\u2019s no reason to panic just yet. Despite this, Memon has stated that this kind of tech is improving and advancing at the very high pace and that shortly, hackers could potentially develop a glove with five different master prints, that would probably allow them to access more than half of the iPhones.Related: Fingerprints will tell cops if you are high on cocaineSo far, the Apple company has not yet responded to these findings. They have, however, left a comment on their website, in which they say that there\u2019s a 1 in 50,000 probability of a match when it comes to combining separate parts of fingerprints to fool the Touch ID system.Also, this is not the first time that the fingerprint scanners have been successfully bypassed.

Now, the Feds are working on dismantling Kelihos botnet used by Severa to conduct his large-scale cyber crimes.According to a press release from Department of Justice, an extensive effort to disrupt and dismantle the Kelihos botnet. Kenneth A.

The ability of botnets like Kelihos to be weaponized quickly for vast and varied types of harms is a dangerous and deep threat to all Americans, driving at the core of how we communicate, network, earn a living, and live our everyday lives.\u201dHe further added that \u201cOur success in disrupting the Kelihos botnet was the result of strong cooperation between private industry experts and law enforcement, and the use of innovative legal and technical tactics. The Department of Justice is committed to combatting cybercrime, no matter the size or sophistication of the scheme, and to punish those who are engaged in such crimes.\u201dThe Kelihos botnet, also known as Hlux, was first discovered around December 2010, infecting Windows devices and making them part of its operation including denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) and email spam, while its updated version came up with the ability to steal Bitcoin wallets and mine bitcoins on infected devices.

The bug allows attackers to send malicious document files to users and hackers have started sending out emails with fake Word documents which when downloaded and opened, start working in the background on downloading different kinds of malware and therefore spread the infection on victims device even further.This is not exactly a new practice that cyber criminals are using to get access, control, or infect their victims\u2019 devices, but what makes this attack different and special is that it doesn\u2019t rely on macros which mean that there\u2019ll be no warning of the malicious file. By using this method, an attacker is able to deal with most of the security systems, including Windows 10.Researchers from McAfee [1] and FireEye [2] have both discovered the flaw and the attacks. The companies have already contacted Microsoft and warned it about the possibility of an intrusion through the Word document. As far as it is known, Microsoft is currently working on finishing the patch that should be published on Tuesday.The exploit connects to a remote server (controlled by the attacker), downloads a file that contains HTML application content, and executes it as an .hta file. Because .hta is executable, the attacker gains full code execution on the victim\u2019s machine. Thus, this is a logical bug [that] gives the attackers the power to bypass any memory-based mitigations developed by Microsoft. The following is a part of the communications we captured:The successful exploit closes the bait Word document and pops up a fake one to show the victim. In the background, the malware has already been stealthily installed on the victim\u2019s system.The root cause of the zero-day vulnerability is related to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), an important feature of Office. (Check our Black Hat USA 2015 presentation in which we examine the attack surface of this feature.)The first appearance of this sort of attack was managed to be traced by researchers back to January 2017, and the issue seems to relate to the Windows Object Linking And Embedding function. This means that the application can combine the document with other content, for example, a sneaky little malware that can avoid detection and download even more malicious content, all that while working as a background process and staying undetected. It even creates and opens a new Microsoft Word file to replace itself after finishing its \u201cjob.\u201dThe researchers have also stated that the bug is present in all versions of Office, including the one from 2016 running on Windows 10.Until Microsoft fixes the issue, security companies have refused to disclose any further details or information about the bug or the attack, and have only admitted that the number of attacks performed is still unknown. This means that pretty much anyone can have an infected device, and the users should be extra careful when opening documents received via email, even if the sender is someone they know.For now, users are advised to block the Word RCE through their Windows registry by setting: Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Word\\Security\\FileBlock\\RtfFiles to 2 and OpenInProtectedView to 0.", "authur": "Ali Raza", "title": "Hackers are Exploiting New Microsoft Office Vulnerability to Drop Malware", "date": "April 10, 2017"}, {"topics": ["hacking", "internet", "security", "Technology", "USA"], "body": "You might know about hacking websites, traffic signboards or radio stations.

In these attacks, hacked bots are scanning the Internet in search of Linux-based routers and similar devices that aren\u2019t properly protected.Every device that can be connected to the Internet comes with a default password. The users are expected to change those default login credentials once they get their hands on the device. Those who don\u2019t are now becoming targets of the new wave of attacks. Once the scanning locates a target, it runs a series of debilitating commands to wipe every file on that device, corrupt its storage and sabotages its Internet connection.Security firm Radware\u2019s researchers have detected over 2,250 PDoS (Permanent Denial Of Service) attacks in only four days. Attacks were aimed at the group of devices that were made available in specially constructed \u201choneypots\u201d.These attacks are being conducted by two variations of botnets called BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2. BrickerBot.1\u2019s attacks were traced to multiple origins all over the world, and its attacks were simpler and stopped after some time, even though they were greater in numbers. BrickerBot.2 uses a cloaking technique and its origin cannot be traced. Its attacks are fewer in numbers but more complex and deal more damage. Both bots are designed to brick real life devices with faulty security.These attacks resemble those of Mirai, a special botnet whose purpose was to create an army of hacked IoT devices and use them to damage prominent websites through the large usage of DDoS attacks. But when it comes to BrickerBot, its purpose is still unclear.At first, Radware\u2019s researchers concluded that the point of these attacks was to take over the flawed devices so that they wouldn\u2019t be used by other hackers, but after the discovery of the second bot, this theory was abandoned, and it became clear that the only point of these attacks so far is to destroy everything that can be reached.When it comes to BrickerBot.1, it\u2019s known that most of its attacks were launched against the devices using BusyBox collection of Unix tools, and the most destruction by BrickerBot.1 was caused from targeting two types of flash storage \u2013 MultiMediaCard devices, and Memory Technology Device. Both are known to be used in Internet of Things devices. During the four days, BrickerBot.1 launched 1,895 attacks from all around the world.BrickerBot.2, on the other hand, is a lot stealthier and meaner. It was discovered in less than an hour after the discovery of the first one, and it targeted a wider variety of storage disks. It was also found on many devices that don\u2019t run BusyBox, and since it uses the Tor anonymity service, it\u2019s IP cannot be tracked back to its source. It targets devices with default passwords, and that limits its reach.In addition to corrupting the targeted devices, it also deletes all of the data found on it, removes the Internet gateway and causes other types of damage that make the device useless.Both bots are targeting devices with bad security, therefore, it\u2019s about time the cybercriminals behind these attacks will use these devices to carry a large DDoS attack.

One technique involved using an URL shortener service Bit.ly to disguise the original malicious links. The second strategy used to spread the malware was using fake news website.The motive behind these attacks was to steal credentials and spy on the victims. As per the research, hackers were targeting Educational institutes, Military organization and media companies from Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and the US.Details:SecureUpdate, a malware disguised as an Android update was designed to download malicious payloads into the victim\u2019s device while the Vamp was focused on stealing data from victims\u2019 smartphones including call recordings, contact information, and stealing other important documents.The malware designed to target Windows operating systemsKasperAgent and Micropsia were capable of downloading other payloads, executing arbitrary commands, stealing files, capturing a screenshot, logging keystrokes and much more. Essentially the hackers were interested in stealing credentials of the infected devices.The connection between the attacks:At first, no connection was established between the attacks since all the malware were different from each other. On close inspection, however, the security firms found a link. An email address (Adam.swift.2016@gmail[.]com). The Same email address was used to register infectious domains which eventually revealed that the attacks were linked after all.Researchers revealed that more than 200 samples of the Windows malware and at least 17 samples of Android malware were discovered which means that potential victims of this malware could be numerous.

It was found attacking iPhone devices in August 2016. Pegasus uses three iOS system\u2019s zero-day vulnerabilities, which at that time were not identified.Now, Google and Lookout cyber security firm have discovered the presence of an Android version of Pegasus spyware that is aimed at exploiting the company\u2019s devices running on Android system. Google initially got the hint of the android version of Pegasus in late 2016, and at that time only a handful of android devices out of the overall 1.4 billion devices were infected with Pegasus.Just like the version for iPhones, the android version of Pegasus contains highly sophisticated and advanced features, as it can be controlled through SMS and has self-destructing abilities too. It can grab higher amounts of comms data, WhatsApp\u2019s calls and messages records and valuable data from Gmail, Facebook, Skype, and Twitter, etc. Furthermore, it can control device\u2019s camera and microphone and conducts keylogging and can capture screenshots as well. Google maintains that despite its advanced nature, android Pegasus never made its way to the official Google Play Store.A full of Pegasus\u2019 capabilities are:Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, Kakao Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android\u2019s Native Email client Contacts and text messageThrough its self-destructing capabilities, the malware remained undetected for about three years. According to Michael Flossman (Pdf), a mobile security researcher at Lookout, the malware removes itself as soon as it feels it is going to be discovered and this is why it took such a long time to find its samples. Both Google and Lookout stated that the samples, although are from 2014, have solid evidence that this spyware was working on Android phones.The iPhone oriented version of Pegasus deleted itself after detecting a jailbreak, but the Android version deletes itself if it fails to connect to its command and control (C&C) server for a specific time period, or if it feels that it will be detected.Flossman is of the opinion that Android-based Pegasus was distributed in the same manner as the iPhone version was spread, that is, through an SMS message.\u201cThe various exploits contained in this surveillance-ware would attempt to be run once the app was installed. These exploits were patched on the target device, Pegasus would still be able to function but with a reduced set of capabilities,\u201d explained Flossman.Currently, investigators are not sure whether the developers of android Pegasus used any zero-day vulnerabilities for exploiting devices. It is, however, claimed that Framaroot technique is used to root the device. This technique uses exploits that have been named after the characters in Lord of the Rings and it allows an attacker to obtain total control of the operating system.According to the analysis of Google\u2019s researchers, a majority of the targets are located in Israel but there are reports that users in Georgia, UAE, Turkey and Mexico were also targeted.Google suggests that users must be cautious while installing apps and should only install through authentic sources. Furthermore, they need to keep their devices\u2019 software updated, to enable lock screen and keep the anti-malware software app turned on all the time.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "title": "Android Version of Sophisticated Pegasus Spyware Discovered", "date": "April 6, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Banking", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "North Korea", "security", "South Korea"], "body": "Last year, Bangladesh\u2019s Central Banks suffered a big blow when hackers apparently operating from North Korea managed to steal $81 million.

They identified the hackers through a strange, short, single connection and a single session that came out of the extremely \u201crare and unexpected IP rage\u201d that originated from North Korea. Moreover, the language of the computer coding also hinted upon the involvement of North Korean hackers.As far as the hacking operation is concerned, Kamluk believes that it was a very sophisticated malware campaign where hackers used a range of smart skills and tricks that even tricked the investigators. \u201cThey used a lot of anti-forensics techniques,\u201d Kamluk told CNN.Symantec, another cyber security firm, which conducted research on the recent surge in attacks on banks worldwide claims that the hackers surely are from North Korean, because malware code used in the Bangladeshi bank hack attack and the one used in the year 2014, the hack attack on Sony Pictures are same. The FBI confirmed the involvement of North Korean hackers in that past attack.Experts believe that if the analysis is true, the only reason behind such a massive hacking campaign is that North Korean government is trying to rake in easy cash. According to Marcus Noland from Peterson Institute for International Economics, North Korea tried drug trafficking but due to tightening of interdiction the switched to currency counterfeiting, and now they are left with no other option but to raise money through cyber-crimes.

Now there is another not-so-great achievement by the company that is related to its Tizen operating system. According to the findings of an Israeli IT security researcher Amihai Neiderman, this OS contains not one or two but around 40 Critical security flaws. That\u2019s what we may call it a highly vulnerable operating system because a single flaw in the software leads to devastating damages, therefore when there are 40 flaws you need to disregard the coding and write it afresh entirely.Samsung uses Tizen OS in its mobile phones, smart TVs, and smartwatches. Samsung states that Tizen is an open-source OS. According to the company\u2019s November 2016 statistics, the OS was used in 50 million devices including Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch and their Smart TVs. This means, if the analysis of Neiderman is accurate then the extent of impending security threat is also quite extensive in scope.More: Here\u2019s What a Samsung Galaxy S7 Hacked with Ransomware Looks LikeNeiderman has documented all the information in a detailed report and presented it at Kaspersky\u2019s Security Analyst Summit, which was held at St. Marteen on Monday. Neiderman claims that he did contact Samsung regarding flaws in its Tizen OS a few months back but all he received was an automated response email. On the other hand, Samsung claimed that they are now collaborating with Neiderman for mitigating the \u201cpotential vulnerabilities.\u201dAn official spokesperson of Samsung Mashable that \u201cSamsung Electronics takes security and privacy very seriously. We regularly check our systems, and if at any time there is a credible potential vulnerability, we act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue. We continually provide software updates to consumers to safeguard their products. We are fully committed to cooperating with Mr. Neiderman to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.\u201dThe Israeli researcher has claimed that all of the 40 flaws are of critical nature because they allow an attacker to gain control of any Samsung device remotely. However, the threat level also varies with every flaw, and some are highly critical. One of the identified flaws allows the attacker to control an app uploaded on Tizen OS app store called the TizenStore app. After controlling, the attacker can easily inject malicious code or malware into a Tizen device, reports MotherBoard.More: Hacker Shows How Smart TVs Can Be Remotely HackedNeiderman stated that after he purchased a Samsung Smart TV in 2016, he was curious to analyze the system\u2019s reliability regarding software security.

The so-called \u201cflash player update\u201d was an HTA file (HTML application file) and was designed to execute a PowerShell script to download a payload. The payload could be a JSE (encrypted JavaScript), but because the domain on which the scam was being hosted was down, a copy of the final payload could not be retrieved.

As per reports, this new technique allows hackers to hijack smart TVs remotely essentially enabling them to either spy on the users or to perform DDoS attacks.Rafael Scheel, a cybersecurity consultant said: \u201cOnce a hacker has control over the TV of an end user, he can harm the user in a variety of ways, \u201cAmong many others, the TV could be used to attack further devices in the home network or to spy on the user with the TV\u2019s camera and microphone.\u201dThe scheme involves sending malicious signals through DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial) to gain root access on a targeted Smart TV. The worst part of this hack is that it could be done remotely and an attacker could only be caught when transmitting the malicious signals in real time. If that is done, the possibility of finding the hacker is minimal. Furthermore, once the attack is performed not even rebooting or performing a factory reset can save your device.According to Scheele, almost all the smart TVs which relies on Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV), a technology supported by virtually every smart TV manufacturer, can be victimized using this technique, underlying a major security flaw in the smart TVs.The hack was performed at the European Broadcasting Union Media Cyber Security Seminar this February, and the security experts demonstrated it by hacking two of the latest models of Samsung, and it is likely to work against a wide variety of smart TVs.It is worth mentioning that WikiLeaks revealed a similar hacking technique used by the CIA to hack Smart TVs and now the hack is discovered by security firms as well.

At the very least, sensitive data should be protected with encryption and watermarking \u2013 both fairly straightforward technologies that are readily available. Organizations should also consider how they can use the public cloud for data storage in place of on-premises infrastructure.

As per reports, the app is currently targeting Russian users, and so far hundreds of Android users have been victimized.Cyber-security firm Zscaler first spotted the vicious code in the app and revealed that the cybercriminals behind the campaign are using third party stores to spread this malicious app.The scheme behind this app involves finding a popular app in the play store, disassembling it and putting the malicious code in the cloned version of the app. After the inclusion of malicious code in the app, the crooks upload the cloned app in third party stores waiting for the victim to fall into the trap.According to Zscaler\u2019 Gaurav Shinde, \u201cOne of the targeted apps is called \u2018OK\u2019, and it\u2019s one of the most popular Russian entertainment social network apps. The targeted legitimate app is available on the Google Play Store and has between 50,000,000 \u2013 100,000,000 installs. It is important to note that the OK app available on Google Play Store is NOT malicious.\u201dOnce the users download the app, it will not immediately attack the users; rather it sits quietly for hours before launching the attack. After a few hours, the app begins to execute the code, and undismissable popups keep appearing until the hacker gets what he wants i.e. administration rights.After acquiring the admin rights, the app locks the user screen asking for a payment of 500 Russian rubles (around 8-10$). To convince users to pay the ransom, the app threatens to send an SMS to all the contacts saying that the victim has ben caught watching illegal porn videos.The worst part about this app is that it lacks the basic decryption functionality which means that the phone can not be unlocked even if the ransom is paid. Furthermore, the experts, believe that the app could have been easily uploaded the Google play store because of the delaying tactic of the malicious code execution.According to the security researchers, the only way to get rid of the ransomware app is by booting the device in safe Mood, removing the device administrator account and deleting the app.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "title": "New Android ransomware proves why antivirus software are a joke", "date": "April 1, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Cyber Crime", "GitHub", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "TROJAN"], "body": "A new series of malware attacks has occurred, and this time, the targets are the owners of Github repositories.

The reasons behind this attack are still unknown, although it\u2019s suspected that the attackers were after one or more of the projects hosted on the platform. The developers said that these projects would be an attractive target for both cybercriminals and nation-state attackers.Senior threat researcher Brandon Levene said that the malware is a relatively unknown threat outside of the Russian-speaking world and that this is why it took them by surprise. Dimnie is known to use stealth as its specialty. It disguises its HTTP requests to the command and control infrastructure in a GET request to a defunct Google service called Google PageRank.In order to deceive, as said by Levene, an IP address was found in a DNS lookup request preceding the GET request that as the real destination IP for the follow-up HTTP request.Palo Alto reports that \u201cSending the request to an entirely different server is not complicated to achieve, but how many analysts would simply see a DNS request with no [apparent] related subsequent traffic? That is precisely what Dimnie is relying upon to evade detections.\u201dWhat this means is that Dimnie tries to appear to be a regular, legitimate traffic, which is more challenging due to the type of data that\u2019s usually moving off the victim\u2019s device.The new practice that has been observed in the more recent attacks is that the payloads don\u2019t leave any artifacts on the hard drive, but are instead injected into memory. Several modules have been discovered, some of which extract system data, enumerate running processes, keyloggers, screenshots and even a self-destruct module which deletes all files on the drive.Despite the attack, Levene has stated that the command and control infrastructure still operates and that Dimnie continues to be used against the Russian-speakers.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Ali Raza", "title": "Data-Stealing Malware \u2018Dimnie\u2019 Targeting Developers on Github", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Cyber Crime", "gaming", "internet", "Phishing", "Phishing Scam", "Privacy", "security"], "body": "Hackers have centered their attention towards a famous game \u201cWorld of Warcraft, \u201d and things aren\u2019t looking good for its fans.

If you have a website for your business that needs to be up at all times, then you should be willing to keep your web hosting account as secure as possible. For helpful tips on how to do this, have a look at some of the basic things you can do which will make a hacker\u2019s job a life of misery.The most obvious tip to consider is your password strength. As long as you have a long password that has many characters and numbers, then the chances of hackers being able to crack your password diminish to a much lower percent. It\u2019s hard to keep track of passwords if they are strong, but taking advantage of one of the many password management tools will help you greatly. When you do have a strong password for your web hosting account, make sure you change it regularly as this will make it even harder for a hacker to hack. Most hosting providers recommend you change your password every couple of months, but you can do it as regularly as you would like.Many web hosting providers offer cPanel as a way for their clients to manage their websites easily. cPanel comes with a range of tools that simplify the running of a website, and one of the many tools it does come with is a virus scanner. By using a virus scanner regularly, you can be sure your site is going to be clear of any malicious viruses that have managed to sneak their way in. Of course, there is a chance you will not have cPanel with the provider you are hosted with, but many web hosting control panels will have virus scanning tools to better your website security whether that is cPanel or not.It\u2019s not just your web hosting account you need to look after as hackers will try to get to your files by using their experience with certain content management systems. For example, if you have a website based on the popular WordPress CMS, then you will need to make sure all plugins, themes, and WordPress itself is updated to its latest versions. If you do not keep your site updated, you will find there are certain security flaws that the hackers will be able to take advantage of.Keeping your web hosting account secure isn\u2019t just beneficial to the uptime of your website, but you will also find that some of your personal details will also be kept safe in the process. Using the above tips will make it a lot harder for hackers to get into your web hosting account, but if you follow some of these other helpful tips, you can make sure your account is as safe as ever.Image Souce: PixaBay/Pixel CreaturesDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "title": "How to Keep Your Web Hosting Account Safe From Hackers", "date": "March 30, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Botnet", "DDOS", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Malware", "Mirai", "security"], "body": "Last August, a Malware called Mirai was discovered.

The DDoS mitigation firm said that it was the most they have seen out of any Mirai variant so far. They reported that the attack generated more than 2.8 billion requests.The attack lasted for 54 hours and was in a league of its own since most of the application layer assaults lasted under six hours.Researchers also observed a pool of attacking Internet of Things (IoT) devices usually associated with Mirai, such as DVRs, routers, and CCTV cameras. It has been discovered that the attack traffic originated from 9,793 IPs from all over the world, but the 70% of the botnet traffic originated in 10 countries.Most of the traffic was found to be originating from the US, with 18.4 percent of the IPs leading somewhere inside the US borders. Next in line by the IP botnet percents is Israel with 11.3 percent, Taiwan with 10.8 percent, India with 8.7 percent, Turkey with 6 percent, Russia with 3.8 percent, Italy, and Mexico both have around 3.2 percent. Finally, there are Colombia with 3, and Bulgaria with only 2.2 percent of botnet traffic.More: This IoT Scanner Shows if Your Device can be used in a DDoS AttackMore Mirai signature factors helped researchers to identify the attack, such as header order and header values. However, what finally lead the form to believe it\u2019s a new version of Mirai is the number of different user-agents. Apparently, the DDoS bots hide behind different user-agents than the five known to be a part of the default Mirai version. This time, it used 30 user-agent variants. Incapsula said that this means the new variant was modified to launch more elaborate application layer attacks.A day after the 54-hour-attack ended, another one was launched, but this time it only lasted an hour and a half. This time, the average traffic flow was only 15,000 RPS.Remember, Mirai malware was first used during a massive DDoS attack on DYN DNS leading to a complete shutdown of Twitter, PayPal, and several other websites for several ours.

In return, Google security researchers published some aspects regarding the flaws to give a glimpse into their findings. Fair enough.But when it comes to securing its own product, it looks like Google is as lazy as Microsoft. A security researcher Jason Doyle discovered critical vulnerabilities in Nest Lab\u2019s Dropcams allowing attackers to crash the cameras and block them from recording videos. The flaws exist in the camera firmware version 5.2.1.Nest Labs which was acquired by Alphabet Inc. (Google) for $3.2 billion in January 2014, specializes in products like Learning Thermostat, Smoke+CO Alarm, Indoor Cam and Outdoor Cam. In this case, its Dropcam and Dropcam Pro are vulnerable to attacks which can be exploited to crash the cameras using their Bluetooth feature, creating a perfect situation for thieves and burglars to carry out their illegal activities without getting caught.Softpedia reports that Doyle alerted Google about the vulnerability back in October 2016. However, no software update or patch was issued by the company. Google\u2019s lazy attitude forced Doyle to publish his findings on GitHub, according to which there are three vulnerabilities including 1: Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via SSID parameter, 2: Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via Encrypted Password parameter and 3: Bluetooth (BLE) based Wifi Reassociation.In Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via SSID parameter, an attacker can temporarily disconnect the targeted camera from Wifi and disable it from recording videos. However, the attacker has to be within the Bluetooth range.In the Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via Encrypted Password parameter flaw, an attacker can crash and stop the targeted camera from the recording by triggering a buffer overflow condition when setting the encrypted password parameter on the camera.In the Bluetooth (BLE) based Wifi Reassociation flaw, an attacker can disconnect the targeted camera from a connected network by issuing a new SSID, but since the video\u2019s local storage is not supported by Nest Lab\u2019s cameras they try to reconnect with the original network, however, the whole process takes a few minutes, during which the recording video feature is disable.Since the researcher has publicly published his findings, it\u2019s time for Google to issue a patch without further delay.

The purpose appears to have been to make it seem as though the bank had been communicating with the Trump Organization. The bank is now asking U.S. to assist it to uncover the culprits.On Friday, the bank revealed that their servers were under three cyber attacks targeting the domain name server (DNS) since mid-February. It is unclear who was behind these attacks; the details show unknown hackers allegedly used Amazon and Google servers to send requests to a Trump Organization server posing to look like they came from Alfa Bank, pushing the Trump server to respond back to the bank.An Alfa Bank spokesperson said: \u201cThe cyber attacks are an attempt by unknown parties to manufacture the illusion of contact between Alfa Bank\u2019s DNS servers and \u2019Trump servers\u2019\u2019.Furthermore, Alfa Bank revealed that it is ready to work with the U.S. law enforcement agency to identify the individuals involved in the campaign. The bank has already hired Stroz Friedberg, a US-based cyber security firm to get into the depth of the matter.\u201cThe cyber attacks are an attempt by unknown parties to manufacture the illusion of contact between Alfa Bank\u2019s DNS servers and \u2018Trump servers,\u201d an Alfa Bank representative said in a statement. \u201cWe have gone to the U.S. Justice Department and offered our complete cooperation to get to the bottom of this sham and fraud.\u201dOn February 18, 2017, the bank claims it experienced suspicious cyber activity from an unidentified third-party. Specifically, the unidentified third-party repeatedly sent suspicious DNS queries from servers in the U.S. to a Trump Organization server. The unidentified individuals made it look as though these queries originated from variants of MOSCow.ALFAintRa.nET.The use of upper and lower case indicated the human intervention in the process. Moreover, Alfa Bank says it received more than 1,340 DNS responses containing mail.trump-email.com.moscow.alfaintra.net.Last week, CNN reported that the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence team was investigating if there was a computer server connection between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank during the U.S. election, according to sources close to the investigation. The bank has now denied that there was ever a conversation between both parties.Mark McArdle, CTO at cyber security company eSentire commented on the issue and said that:\u201cA botnet is typically associated with an attack that leverages scale, as it can employ thousands (potentially millions with IoT devices) of devices and use them to coordinate an attack on a target. We\u2019ve seen this with some big DDoS attacks. We also see botnets being used as platforms for large-scale spamming. However, the number of DNS connections reported in the Alfa Bank attacks (1,340 in once case) don\u2019t indicate massive scale. A botnet, however, can be used to add another layer of obfuscation between you and your attacker. Following the breadcrumbs back could bring you to a PVR that has been hacked and is now part of a botnet. I suspect in this case, the botnet is being used more for obfuscation of identity than scale. The attackers may be using a botnet to send spoofed DNS requests to a legitimate Trump server using a spoofed \u201creply-to\u201d address inside Alfa-Bank\u2019s infrastructure.Spoofing DNS lookups is not very difficult since DNS is not authenticated, and the ability to spoof source addresses is unfortunately still available \u2013 all you need is a system to launch your attack from that is connected to the Internet via an ISP that doesn\u2019t filter out spoofed source addresses. While this type of attack has been around for a while, what\u2019s new in this case is that someone is using it to try and contrive evidence of a relationship where neither party sought one.Additionally, there is also reference in Alfa Bank\u2019s statement about Spam messages from marketing@trumphotels.com. It\u2019s also possible to spoof email (spammers do this all the time). A spoofed email could include a reference to a legitimate Trump Org server and a real connection would be established if a user clicked on it (or selected \u201cshow images\u201d in the email). Again, this does not mean the email came from Trump Org, just that it was sent in order to attempt to solicit \u201ca connection\u201d between Trump Org and Alfa-Bank.\u201dEither way, identity is difficult to determine unless cryptographic certificates are used, and ultimate hack attribution is even more difficult.This is not the first time that allegations surrounding Trump\u2019s relations with Russia have emerged. Some believe Russia hacked the US election to give Trump a way to win the presidency while some believe that Russian media was involved in spreading fake news against Trump\u2019s opponent Hillary Clinton.

Upon scanning, HackRead can confirm that the data has been stolen from various data breaches including Nulled.cr breach in May 2016, in which 599,000 user accounts were leaked, MPGH.net breach from 2015, in which 3.1 million users accounts were disclosed, Dropbox breach in which 68 million accounts were stolen in 2012, and leaked in 2016.Yahoo is already under criticism for its poor security implementations allowing hackers to breach company\u2019s servers and steal a trove of user data. Last week, Yahoo accused three Russians and one Canadian hacker of stealing 500 Million accounts in 2014.

The event began on the 15th of March and is under the sponsorship of Trend Micro.On the very first day of the competition, some major hacks were performed with the winners taking away a total of $233,000. This ushered in heightened hacking with some of the major pieces of software being put to the test. Being the 10th iteration of the event, a lot happened including the inclusion of Linux for the very first time. The competition included Ubuntu Linux 16.10 and other pieces of software.Qihoo 360, the firm famous for its suite of security features, focused on hacking the Adobe Reader. It employed the jpeg2000 heap overflow, an RCE, and a Windows kernel info leak. They were able to hack into the program with ease to earn the team $50,000. Although it seemed easy, it wasn\u2019t something anyone could pull off.Samuel Gro\u00df and Niklas Baumstark then carried out their hack on the Apple Safari app. They focused on using an escalation to root on the macOS. Theirs too was a successful hack after they employed a user-after-free (UAF) combined with some bugs to hack into the browser. For their efforts, they took home a cool $28,000. It was a very impressive hack given that it was simply done by two guys who made up the team.Team Ether from Tencent Security focused their efforts on hacking the new Microsoft Edge browser. To perform this hack, they employed an arbitrary write in Chakra mode then combined it with a logic bug that would escape the sandbox. For their efforts, they took away an awesome $80,000. It was a significant hack that brought to light the flaws in the Edge browser.Next on the list of the hacks was the Linux operating system. Being its first time in the completion, it was impressive seeing people focus on hacking it. Chaitin Security Research Lab employed a Linux kernel heap out-of-bound access that allowed them to take the operating system apart. For their efforts, they were rewarded with $15,000.These were just a few of the hacks performed during the first few days of the event. However, much more were carried out including on the windows operating system and Adobe Flash. It is a great way of pointing out the flaws in pieces of software while getting paid for it. It helps firms know what is wrong with their software and fix it. Given that the teams carrying out the hacks are from companies of high repute, it is unlikely that a single hacker can be able to carry them out on their own.

The flaw took advantage of a webapps vulnerability on the browser commands that could steal access to the victim\u2019s account or contact list when playing videos or opening photos.\u201cBy simply sending an innocent-looking photo, an attacker could gain control over the account, access message history, all photos that were ever shared, and send messages on behalf of the user,\u201d said Oded Vanunu, head of product vulnerability research at Check Point.However, it was not mentioned how many accounts could be effectively compromised, but for sure this flaw represented a danger to \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of users accessing the platforms from a web browser version as a hacker could effectively camouflage a malware in the image, which would have been activated whenever the recipient clicks to open it.WhatsApp and Telegram use a coding that ensures that only the sender and recipient of the messages can see its content, in simple words called encryption that differ from regular e-mails for example, and that could be the reason why the two Apps could not detect the malware content.WhatsApp acknowledged the problem and recommended that users restart their browsers to ensure they are using the most current version. \u201cWe\u2019ve built WhatsApp to keep people and their information safe.

Also, last month Yahoo announced that between 2015 and 2016 potentially malicious activity was observed on the website caused by the use of Forged Cookies.The nonstop data breach revelations almost sabotaged deal between Yahoo and Verizon Communications in which the former was supposed to sell its email service, mobile apps, and websites to the latter. Yahoo is also facing lawsuits against these breaches, and it costs the firm some big bucks.This is not the first time when US authorities are going after hackers involved in large-scale data breaches. Last year, a Russian hacker involved in the massive LinkedIn 117 million account data breach was arrested and charged in Prague.At the time of publishing this article, there were about 1 million decrypted Gmail and Yahoo accounts being sold on the dark web.Source: Bloomberg | Arrest Illustration Credit: Maria Jose Mosquera/ArtWantedDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "U.S. to Charge 4 Hackers Involved in Massive Yahoo Data Breach", "date": "March 15, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Android", "China", "internet", "Lenovo", "Malware", "Samsung", "Smartphone", "TROJAN"], "body": "Android devices have remained the center of attraction for malicious cyber criminals since forever. Not only do they churn out fake, infected apps one after another but also devise ways to exploit Android devices. The reason is quite evident; since Android devices are among the most commonly preferred mobile phone choices, therefore, cyber-criminals attack them often to claim a higher number of victims.The latest news regarding Android devices is that various types of pre-installed malware were identified by two tech firms who received a consignment of their ordered android phones. All in all, 36 devices were already infected with malware. The presence of malware on these 36 Android phones was discovered by Check Point Software Technologies while the names of the tech firms that received these devices haven\u2019t yet been disclosed.The names of the devices have, however, been shared by the research team. These include:It has been noted that the malware was hidden in certain apps that were not the part of the official ROM firmware. The manufacturers of Android phones usually provide the official ROM firmware. However, in this case, the infected apps were installed later on by someone who probably was part of the distribution network. According to reports, Loki malware was installed on some of these devices whereas Slocker ransomware was present on the other devices.In 6 out of the shortlisted 36 devices, the infection was installed to the ROM through utilizing system privileges. The exact extent of the attack is not yet known since the research team has shared very few details at Check Point Software. Apparently, the reason behind the installation of malicious, infected apps was to obtain private information of the mobile users and to display customized ads.In must be noted that this is not the first time when researchers have discovered pre-installed malware in Android devices. Since 2015, there have been a number of such cases including Android tablets on Amazon store and Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo, DJC, Xido, Alps, Sesonn and Concorde were shipped with pre-installed malware.

It was nothing short of a treasure trove of classified data because it contained sensitive personal/official information, backup data and confidential documents belonging to the US Air Force. It has been learned that the device was owned by a Lieutenant who failed to keep it secure by following appropriate measures.The leaked device has made thousands of US Air Force documents vulnerable. There is sensitive information like passport and social security numbers of high-ranking and senior USAF officials as well as celebrities like Channing Tatum. The entire data is equivalent of several gigabytes. It got leaked because it was stored on an unprotected web-connected backup drive and that\u2019s why it was accessible publicly. It wasn\u2019t protected by password at all however when the news of exposing of such a huge number of USAF files became public; the data was immediately secured.What MacKeeper Researchers discovered was much more than mere passport and Social Security numbers; the data also contained Personnel by Eligibility and Access Reports having ranks and names of hundreds of service members. There was a notice attached to every page of the documents, which read:It also contained open investigations spreadsheet in which name, rank, accusations and location of the accused were included. It is worth noting that there were all sorts of investigations from sexual harassment claims and accepting of bribes to other more serious crimes. In another file, there were Defense Information Systems instructions stored, which would help in encryption key recovery. This particular file serves as a step-by-step guide on regaining access to an encryption key. This file also contained URLs where requests for information about Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Common Access Card (CAC) could be made.Also included in this holy grail of USAF data were scanned images of the Department of Defence\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) account of the Lieutenant. The images contained login URL, login credentials (ID and password) and other details that would help in accessing the account. As apparent, this account is a very sensitive one, and US military would never want to leak such an important detail. There is also a copy of the Training Manual of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).Reportedly, the device has personal information of over 4,000 USAF officers and not only official data some files contained information of spouses of officers and other private data. Also part of the leaked data were applications (SF86) for improved national security clearances for two top ranking four-star generals who had held key positions at US military and NATO. The applications contained exclusive personal information such as mental health history, financial information, previous convictions, their links with foreign nationals and similar details. Though the SF86 data isn\u2019t confidential it is useful in conducting identity theft and wire fraud.Although the device is now well-protected but still it is important to identify who else has accessed the public database. We are not yet sure if anyone else other than MacKeeper security team was able to access these files or not. It is about time that institutions like the USAF made their system fool proof and advanced enough to protect the sensitive information of their personnel.Source: MacKeeper | Coverage: ZDNet | Image Credit: Flick/BeverlyDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Misconfigured Drive Leads to Data Leak of Thousands of US Air Force Officials", "date": "March 14, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Camera", "DDOS", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Microwaves", "Privacy", "security", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Technology"], "body": "In her recent interview with Bergen Record columnist Mike Kelly, the Counselor to the President for Donald Trump Kellyanne Elizabeth Conway stated that there was an article talking about how we can all be spied upon by \u201cmicrowaves that turn into cameras.\u201d She went on to explain that it is \u201cjust a fact of modern life.\u201dQ: Do you know if Trump Tower was wiretapped?Kellyanne: There was an article this week\u2014you can be spied on via a camera in your microwave pic.twitter.com/rObFkIrLGG\u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 13, 2017Kellyanne claimed she read the revelation in an article, but by \u201carticle\u201d she perhaps meant the latest Wikileaks Vault7 documents about CIA allegedly hacking everything that came their way or this MIT report on \u201cMicrowave Camera: Seeing Through Walls and Recording Microwaves in Flight\u201d or she misunderstood microwave oven for microphones.

Therefore, the more visitors on Chrome, the higher will be the number of victims of these hacking and scam campaigns. This is why every other week we notice a new scam circulating on Chrome.The latest one to join the bandwagon of Chrome-oriented scams involves using fake application that looks like Chrome browser but is a credit card scam that has been designed to trick unsuspecting users into providing their payment card details. This is done through the malicious app that seems like Google web browser and compels users to enter their payment card information, which is later collected and emailed to an AOL email ID, reports BleepingComputer.More: Facebook \u2018Comment Tagging Malware\u2019 Spreading via Google ChromeThe malware was discovered by Malware Hunter Team and dubbed as Betaling; after it invades victim\u2019s computer, it displays the standard Google Chrome icon on your desktop due to which it become difficult to differentiate between the authentic and fake Chrome application. The user interface used by Betaling is also very similar to the original Chrome.When the victim clicks on the icon to load the browser window, a URL navigation bar just like the one that Chrome displays, appears on the screen. This time scammers have paid great attention to details since apart from the interface and navigation bar, the fake app displays the same HTTPS lock icon as we are accustomed to on original Chrome.All this hard work is not without a cause; hackers wanted their campaign to garner attention from the majority of users and to achieve this task they followed the format of original Chrome browser window to the T thereby gaining the trust of users so that they provide payment card information easily.When Betaling window appears, it loads a page containing a form where victims are asked to enter payment details, and whatever debit or credit card information is entered, it is stored and sent to the scammers via email. Of course, victims stay oblivious of this whole feat.How can you stay protected from this latest campaign? Just like there is no perfect crime, there cannot be a complete scam either. In this particular scam, certain loopholes can help users identify whether it is a scam or an original Chrome window. Betaling app requires .NET Framework 4.0 or higher to be installed on a computer whereas Google Chrome has no such requirement.Moreover, Betaling\u2019s design is like Windows 8 Metro even if the app is running on an older version of Windows like Windows 7. Also, it is not possible to resize (minimizing or turning to full-screen) the browser window of Betaling while Chrome window can be easily resized. The only button that works on fake Chrome window is the Close button, which is obviously a great hint.

MAC address randomization is a technique that is used to secure mobile devices from being traced. What MAC does is it replaces the unique ID that makes a mobile\u2019s wireless hardware detectable with some randomly generated numbers, thereby making it difficult to trace the device and preventing it from being exploited by malicious cyber-criminals.It is a helpful technique since your smartphone\u2019s MAC address is usually logged by owners of public Wi-Fi such as at retail outlets so that customers could be recognized the moment they walk in. This is the same case that we have noticed in public wireless hotspots. For instance, in the UK, Transport for London uses this strategy to monitor Tube passengers. In theory, there is no problem with adopting such practices if the primary goal is to identify customers. However, it becomes a real issue when the data is sold to marketers and ad firms.More: 7 Easy Tips to Strong Android Security Against HacksBut, what we have come to know after the publishing of research report from US Naval Academy is that even MAC address randomization technique is flawed and contain implementation related vulnerabilities, which makes the entire purpose of using it completely useless. Another important issue is that on a majority of Android devices, MAC address randomization isn\u2019t enabled.The research report was published on Wednesday, and it stated that the researchers successfully tracked 100% of devices (regardless of their make and model) using randomization. They managed to do that by exploiting a vulnerability that existed in the way wireless chipsets handled low-level control frames. Apart from an active Request to Send or RTS attack, the team of researchers was able to identify various alternative deanonymization techniques that were also applicable to a wide range of mobile phones.The focus of the study was to analyze iOS and Android devices only. It was noted that every single 802.11 network interface of a mobile phone had a 48-bit MAC address layer-2 hardware identifier. This is supposed to be unique on a universal basis. They also focused on devices that weren\u2019t associated with a network access point because this is where the real work of unique global MAC addresses start.Previous studies in this context discovered flaws prevailing in the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) protocol, which can potentially be used to modify the MAC address of a device. The technique that allows this to happen is called Universally Unique IDentifier-Enrollee (UUID-E) reversal.11 easy tips to secure your Mac against hackersThe current study from US Naval Academy took this previous work into account to focus on randomized MAC address implementations. They identified that although there are randomization capabilities available, a majority of Android devices aren\u2019t implementing them despite the fact that the Android OS has it built-in to it. Due to this, tracking of Android devices becomes trivial. As per the researchers, the 802.11 chipset and firmware incompatibilities might be the reason behind it.More: How to use \u201cFind my iPhone\u201d app to locate your smartphoneDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Security Flaws in MAC Address Randomization Technique makes iOS, Android Devices Vulnerable to Tracking", "date": "March 12, 2017"}, {"topics": ["CIA", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "NSA", "Privacy", "security", "Snowden", "Spying", "Surveillance", "VLC", "Vulnerability"], "body": "On 7th Match 2017, the whistle-blowing organization Wikileaks published a series of new documents code-named \u201cVault 7\u201d allegedly belonging to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

When Notepad++ is launched, the modified scilexer.dll is loaded instead of the original one.It doesn\u2019t mean that CIA is interested in your coding skill or your sex message content in Notepad++, but rather it prevents raising any red flags while the DLL does data collection in the background.It\u2019s not a vulnerability/security issue in Notepad++, but for remedying this issue, from this release (v7.3.3) forward, notepad++.exe checks the certificate validation in scilexer.dll before loading it. If the certificate is missing or invalid, then it just won\u2019t be loaded, and Notepad++ will fail to launch.Checking the certificate of DLL makes it harder to hack. Note that once users\u2019 PCs are compromised, the hackers can do anything on the PCs. This solution only prevents from Notepad++ loading a CIA homemade DLL.

The document further revealed that CIA agents used a tool to exploit a modified old version of VLC media player. The described tool gathers documents from a computer or network and, to hide its activity, runs inside VLC Portable 2.1.5 on Microsoft Windows platforms. Such modified software provides a legitimate appearance (plays media files) while scanning the computer or the network for its intelligence purpose.In their official statement [Pdf], the developers of VLC player VideoLAN said that the company is taking the revelation seriously. However, it must be noted that this is not an actual vulnerability in VLC but a result of downloading the set up from untrusted sources.VicdeoLAN further explains that:The technique used is a modification of the software\u2019s manifest to force the loading of a fake dynamic library \u201cpsapi.dll,\u201d instead of using the official Windows version. This DLL contains the malware\u2019s executable code.

However, many other operating systems will work even better than the above mentioned OSs especially for those of us with specific needs. We assembled a list of the six of these operating systems for you to pick from. Be free to try each one out.The Pixel operating system is a version of Linux that has been stripped down to run on just about any hardware. It can be run on Windows or macOS and was originally meant for the minuscule Raspberry Pi computer. If you have an old computer but want to keep at it without buying another one, Pixel OS will run without a hitch on your machine. That is guaranteed. Just like the other versions of Linux, the user gets an easy to use interface with some preloaded apps to start using it the moment you install it on your computer.Another strong operating system is the Lineage OS which is created by the same people who brought us CyanogenMod. This operating system is simply the very purest of Android without the invasion of the user experience by the manufacturer. You can install this OS on your Android smartphone and then control just about everything you need to change your device. It is easy to install and will be up and running in just a few moments after hitting the install button.If you have been wishing (like we do) for a way to run Android apps on your desktop and can\u2019t wait for the Chrome OS to make that functional, then Remix OS is your best OS here. This operating system is based on Android and can be run on any desktop with the apps you need running in a window just like on the handheld devices. You can install this OS even on a USB stick which you carry around and enjoy its benefits whenever you feel like it as it is light and easy to use.Asteroid OS has been built to run on smartwatches that originally come with the Android Wear operating system. The creator of this operating system already managed to run it on the LG G Watch to reveal a smooth and beautiful operating system that would easily give other mobile OSes a run for their money. The OS even has basic apps like the music player, calculator and weather widget installed. While the OS is still in its development stages, a look at it reveals that it will be a great operating system for your watch.Another OS at its developmental stages but with a great potential is the Maru OS. While it currently works on the Nexus 5 alone, the potential for this OS is so much that it will be able to power a whole desktop. Image a scenario where your desktop looks exactly like your smartphone and everything else. With Maru, you only need an HDMI cable to connect your smartphone to your TV screen and away you go. The OS can be installed just like any other type of ROM on a computer.The Zorin OS looks a lot like a mixture of Windows and macOS for those who need other versions of OSes but do not want the two. It is a Linux version based on Ubuntu with a great desktop experience that many people have found to be very stable and full of functionality. The best part of this OS is that it comes with a version of Wine that allows you to use any Windows programs you might want to carry over to Linux.All the operating systems here (plus much more) come free of charge unless the mainstream operating systems most of which need you to pay a fee before using them. The potential for having an operating system away from the mainstream ones is that you get to use lots of features that come with lots of freedom. Many users have reported that the mainstream OS versions are so limited and unfocused that they cannot use them for their specific needs.

At the moment schools appear to be taking one of two approaches, either focusing on programing and discrete probability distribution or putting the emphasis on drafting security policy and the study of computer forensics. An ideal program would give you a thorough grounding in both skill sets, so you\u2019ll need to investigate exactly what\u2019s included in a program before you sign up.You can study for your degree on campus or through an online degree. Master of Information DegreeAn important aspect of cyber security involves handling and understanding data. An online master of information degree can be tailored to give you a specialization in data science or technology, information and management.Like the cybersecurity and computer science courses, you can study for this degree remotely through an online MLIS program.Courses typically last two years and can be studied online on a full-time or part-time basis.Taking an online degree gives you the ability to continue working full-time while you study, and to fit the program in around your schedule. Classes can be a mix of pre-recorded lectures and live sessions, and you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to interact with your fellow students in online discussion groups and joint projects.With the size of the cybersecurity market expected to grow from its current $75 billion to a whopping $170 billion by 2020, it makes sense to get your qualifications now, so that you can take advantage of the great career opportunities that are opening up in this industry.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Owais Sultan", "title": "Want a Career in Cybersecurity?

The email was written by the senior vice president and chief information officer of Verifone, Steve Horan, and its memo read:\u201cWe are currently investigating an IT control matter in the Verifone environment. As a precaution, we are taking immediate steps to improve our controls.\u201dKrebs narrated the chain of events in his blog post citing that Verifone is investigating the data breach in a secretive manner.It must be noted that Verifone is a high profile American firm that is considered the leading provider of credit card terminals in the country. It sells point-of-sale services and terminals to aid the swiping and processing of credit and debit card payments across a variety of businesses including gas stations, retailers and taxis.It is also being reported that the breach impacted some firms that run Verifone\u2019s point-of-sale solutions. Whereas the San Jose, California-based Verifone has categorically stated that the breach\u2019s scope was limited to its corporate network while the payment services system wasn\u2019t affected at all. As per the information shared by the spokesperson for Verifone Andy Payment:\u201cOur payment services network was not impacted. We immediately began work to determine the type of information targeted and executed appropriate measures in response. We believe today that due to our immediate response, the potential for misuse of information is limited.\u201dAs apparent from the memo, Verifone\u2019s staff wouldn\u2019t be able to install software of any type on their company laptops and PCs. This indicated that the breach occurred through downloading of malware. Verifone was informed about the breach by other credit card firms Mastercard and Visa only a few days before they sent out the email above.Krebs cited a source according to which the breach has affected the customer support unit of Verifone, which is based in Clearwater, Florida. This unit provides payment solutions to petrol and gas stations across the USA including the pay-at-the-pump credit card processing system, manual cash registers that are installed inside the fuel station\u2019s store, remote technical support and customer loyalty programs.Krebs\u2019 source also noted that there was potential evidence that Russia-based hacker group that is famous for targeting payment services and hospitality firms is responsible for compromising some portion of Verifone\u2019s internal network.Visa and Mastercard were tipped about the breach since mid-2016, and there was evidence that the attackers utilized a similar type of tools and techniques that were used by the cybercrime gang that hacked into Oracle\u2019s MICROS division in 2016.As per Krebs\u2019 sources, Verifone has hired its strategic partner, a UK based digital forensics firm Foregenix LTD for the investigation of this breach. Verifone has also issued another statement about the information the company has managed to acquire about the breach so far. The latest statement reads:\u201cAccording to the forensic information to-date, the cyber attempt was limited to controllers at approximately two dozen gas stations and occurred over a short time frame. We believe that no other merchants were targeted and the integrity of our networks and merchants\u2019 payment terminals remain secure and fully operational.\u201dDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Payments Giant Verifone Suffers Data Breach", "date": "March 9, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Android", "europe", "Google", "hacking", "internet", "iPhone", "Malware", "Microsoft", "security", "Smartphone", "wikileaks"], "body": "Wikileaks, the famed whistleblowing platform, recently revealed a lot to the public. Titled Vault 7, Part 1, the documents show a grim view of government surveillance as we know it. Among the disturbing pieces of information was that of the CIA\u2019s efforts to breach the security of Apple\u2019s iPads and iPhones. The Central Intelligence Service has teamed up with various researchers all aimed at finding backdoors in the products of some of the biggest tech firms such as Apple, Microsoft and Google. This case is just one of the many that the CIA has employed in carrying out surveillance in the guise of finding the bad guys. In many ways, however, the agency has gone overboard with its methods.CIA classifies hacking document to avoid \"law enforcement\" attributing CIA attacks to the CIA (pdf) https://t.co/13Bw3xOnN9 pic.twitter.com/PgxVftI3HV\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 7, 2017In an annual gathering called Jamboree with Top Secret written all over it, the researchers of the CIA discuss the various ways they can harness to exploit the numerous flaws in the current consumer products. This type of meeting started even before the very first iPhone was released. The focus of these meetings has always been on finding ways to snoop into devices by exploiting the encryption keys discovered in the devices such as iPads and iPhones. These encryption keys are what keeps devices safe through the encryption of the data.More: Cellebrite Can Now Unlock, Extract Data From iPhone 6 and 6 PlusThrough these meetings, a lot has gone on including the revelation of the tools already created to exploit the available pieces of software. For example, they have created a modified version of the Xcode which allows them to plant keyloggers into iOS devices. Xcode is the software tool Apple issues to its iOS developers for the development of apps and other resources. Another piece of software discussed in these conferences is BitLocker which is the encryption system used by Windows operating systems in data encryption. With such capabilities, the CIA is in a position to steal any data it needs using its crooked ways. Here are some of them:With most people buying smart TVs that come with the capability to communicate over the internet, the CIA and other intelligence services have just found a way to enter homes and listen to everything. Using a program called Weeping Angel, the CIA can listen to the goings-on in a home by switching the TV\u2019s microphone on even when the TV is off. As long as it is connected to the power, they can listen in according to the WikiLeaks report.Weeping Angel was developed by the CIA\u2019s Embedded Development Branch. It is a software that can be remotely embedded into the device firmware itself in order to compromise it. The Fake-Off mode in which the malware sets the TV, makes it appear as though it has been switched off. It is the method the agency has favored in activating the microphones in the TVs. The Fake-Off mode in which the bug takes the TV to think it has been switched itself off falsely is the method the agency has favored in activating the microphones in the TVs.The CIA has taken many steps into its hacking spree. Some of the hacks have been disguised as coming from other states, by modifying existing malware known to be from those regions. Especially Russia which would be an easy scapegoat for its rivalry with the United States. Most of the hacks have been performed by funded hacker groups through the Center for Cyber Intelligence which is a branch of the CIA tasked with hacking. In a manner akin to what the National Security Agency has been doing with its hacking victims. To many legal experts, these practices have gone way beyond the mandate of the CIA or any other security body.More: Samsung\u2019s Smart TV may be Spying on YOU!More: Be careful of what you say in front our Smart TV, warns SamsungThe Defense Department can also drop a JDAM on your house or drive an Abrams over your car.

According to this WikiLeaks report, the list of methods already developed by the CIA in hacking into phones is very impressive. Both Android and iPhone devices are in danger according to this report. The CIA has methods that go as far as taking full control of the device by giving the hacker root access and taking over the phone\u2019s kernel. With such control, the agency can do just about anything with the device they choose to focus on.Crowd-sourced find in #Vault7 discovers CIA tool to make Android phones  bulk-spy on WiFi networks around them https://t.co/GRqriXMU4H pic.twitter.com/cNfEIv4qLP\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 7, 2017In fact, the CIA has a department dedicated to the development of software implants and exploits intended for surveilling smartphones owned by targeted individuals. The firm can hack any type of mobile operating system including the latest iterations of Android and iOS. In the documents released by WikiLeaks, the CIA has sourced these kinds of capabilities from firms such as hacking groups, security companies, the GCHQ, NSA and the FBI among many others. The documents state that the agency has a whole library filled with various types of hacking code and methods.#Vault7: Secret CIA table reveals Google Android & Chrome vulnerabilities/zero days https://t.co/MCMqrhhEP6 pic.twitter.com/mEWtLNOvx4\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 7, 2017On the list of hacking tools are names such as SwampMonkey which is a bug that gives the CIA root access to some versions of Android devices. Another one is called Persistence can be planted by the agency into the device of an owner then gives them control of the device once the device is rebooted. The other one, which is the most dangerous, is called Shamoon and can be planted into a computer to steal all the data then destroy all the hardware parts. This is just some of the malware created by or modified by the CIA to use in its surveillance efforts.The CIA was also revealed to have found ways of hacking into just about every operating system we use on the desktop. In a project titled Improvise, the agency was able to target the major operating systems through various exploits including Windows, macOS, and Linux. For the three operating systems, the agency had projects to carry out remote surveillance called Bartender, JukeBox and DanceFloor respectively. They have various levels of exploitation of the resources of the operating system.Don't want to pay for Wndows? The CIA's hackers have a pirate guide to skip product key activation https://t.co/ogJJWUZ2Hg pic.twitter.com/GaaZW14BtK\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 7, 2017In Windows, the CIA has managed to plant a backdoor that they can activate at any time they wish. For example, they can enable the backdoor when one is making a Windows update. According to Kim Dotcom, a well-known technology expert, every PC can be entered into and controlled by the CIA at their will. It is like having a door in your house that you do not know of, but your evil neighbor knows about it. In a jibe at the Obama administration, Dotcom also stated that while Obama was accusing Russia of spying on the US, the US had sent Russia devices that listened to everything Russians did.Of the three desktop operating systems, Windows was the most targeted owing to its being the most popular. In fact, the number of exploits for the Windows operating system is more than double those created for the other operating systems such as macOS and Linux. This may not be news to many people who have been watching the number of hacks on the Windows operating system. It is a scary scenario that most users will learn of long after they have been hacked by Big Brother.Even more surprising from the documents is that Big Brother seems to have a hand in everything people do nowadays; even cars! Without actual details to the way the CIA was to hack cars, the Vault 7 documents state that the CIA has found ways of taking control of a car embedded operating system (built into all cars built after 2009). In this way, the agency can carry out assassinations without anyone taking a note of that. This remote control of cars and trucks has already been done by individual hackers and demonstrated at the Black Hat Security Conference in 2015. Therefore, the powerful CIA cannot fail to do it even better.This information has led many people to believe that the CIA might have been responsible for the death of Michael Hastings in a road accident. The manner of his death suggests that there could be a way the CIA hacked into his car and killed him. No proof of this has been given, but there is a high likelihood that it was the case. With more and cars being connected to the internet, this is a dangerous way of hacking into people\u2019s products and doing whatever they wish. Imagine losing control of your car and being rammed into a trailer on the highway.Unlike smart TVs which may or may not be connected to the internet, cars and trucks are always connected so that they are able to use maps and other navigation services. A Tesla car, for example, has an inbuilt cellular radio that allows it always to be online even when charging. With hackers already having the ability to remotely control smart cars, it is easy for a firm with all the money, skills and time to set its mind on doing something and doing it as cleanly as it wants. Now even your ride is at risk.If you are wondering how one agency can achieve all these breaches with ease, then be aware that the CIA uses malware from public hacking scenes then tweaks the code to suit its specific needs. The team tasked with this exercise is called UMBRAGE which has an extensive library of techniques and code sourced from public malware for its use when the need arises. Given the many public hacks announced over the year, the CIA has a potent tool to hack just about anything they think of.With this library of code, the CIA can quickly put together hacking codes from various sources to create a lethal one that can do anything they want. For example, if they want to carry out surveillance on the individual of their choice, they can use code from various types of malware both to hide its signature and make it more lethal. A closer look at the types of code acquired by the CIA reveals that they are mostly crafted for personal surveillance rather than public surveillance. The extent to which this code can be changed to fit the purpose needed is high given that the CIA is said to get the parts of the code it deems relevant and changeable.WikiLeaks has released less than 1% of its #Vault7 series in its part one publication yesterday 'Year Zero'.\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 8, 2017In the documents revealed by WikiLeaks, the CIA has used various types of malware to get the information it wants. For example, it has used DarkComet as a tool to activate the webcam on a computer without the user\u2019s knowledge. In fact, DarkComet is the same malware used by the Syrian government in hacking its citizens and finding information it needs. With such capabilities and more research being focused on the search for loopholes in which to steal data from customers, there is a high risk out there.

Furthermore, the leaks reveal how CIA worked with the United Kingdom\u2019s MI5 to hack Samsung smart TVs and spy on users.\u201cThe attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom\u2019s MI5/BTSS.

Previously the tech giant offered $20,000 for identification of this issue. Additionally, it has increased the reward for an Unrestricted file system or database access to $13,337 from $10,000.The reason for this sudden and substantial hike in reward is that these vulnerabilities are quite difficult to identify and therefore, the company wants security researchers to focus more upon these.\u201cHigh severity vulnerabilities have become harder to identify over the years, researchers have needed more time to find them.

Kaspersky Labs discovered that StoneDrill is being used in attacks against Saudi Arabia similar to the Shamoon malware reportedly linked with Iranian government-backed hackers since 2012.The difference between both malware is that StoneDrill is more sophisticated then Shamoon, however, its build is similar to Shamoon 2.0, a variant of Shamoon malware that made a comeback in 2016 by targeting government servers in Saudi Arabia. Also, StoneDrill and Shamoon have a different codebase yet the mindset of the authors and their programming \u201cstyle\u201d appear to be similar.It is unclear how StoneDrill is being delivered to victims, upon infecting a device, it injects itself into the memory process of the victim\u2019s web browser and uses two sophisticated anti-emulation techniques aimed at fooling security solutions installed on the victim machine. The malware then starts destroying the computer\u2019s disk files. Furthermore, StoneDrill also works as a backdoor apparently for large-scale espionage campaigns and spies on an unknown number of targets using four command and control (C&C) servers.\u201cWe were very intrigued by the similarities and comparisons between these three malicious operations,\u201d said Mohamad Amin Hasbini, Senior Security Researcher, Global Research and Analysis Team, Kaspersky Lab. \u201cWas StoneDrill another wiper deployed by the Shamoon actor? Or are StoneDrill and Shamoon two different and unconnected groups that just happened to target Saudi organizations at the same time? Or, two groups which are separate but aligned in their objectives? The latter theory is the most likely one: when it comes to artifacts, we can say that while Shamoon embeds Arabic-Yemen resource language sections, StoneDrill embeds mostly Persian resource language sections. Geopolitical analysts would probably be quick to point out that both Iran and Yemen are players in the Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict, and Saudi Arabia is the country where most victims of these operations were found. But of course, we do not exclude the possibility of these artifacts being false flags.\u201dWhile Shamoon malware was delivered to victims through infected documents there are chances that StoneDrill is possibly using similar means for infecting unsuspecting users.

This hints at the fact that attackers are administering RAT and launching numerous phases of fileless Powershell, which Talos researchers found very unusual and evasive. It indicated that attackers are making it a point to avoid detection by utilizing all available tools and tactics. The report stated:\u201cThis malware sample is a great example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting. It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc.\u201dThe attack has been named as DNSMessenger. When the user opens the Word file, which is in the form of a Protected Document that is McAfee secured, a message pops up asking the users to enable the content button that will lead to displaying of the document\u2019s content. However, when the victim clicks on the button, malicious Powershell script is loaded. Powershell is a scripting language that is built into Windows OS and lets the system administration tasks to be automated. The malicious script performs its job in memory and does not write any infected files to the disk.Then the Powershell script scans for different parameters on the Windows-based system such as identification of the Powershell version installed and the privileges of the user who is currently logged in. This information then determines the next step of the scam, which is launching of another Powershell script that is stored on the NTFS file system\u2019s Alternate Data Stream (ADS) or in the registry. Then the third stage commences in which the Powershell script launches another obscured script that manages to create a link between the device and the control server through the DNS. From there on, the exchange of commands from the attackers starts.We know that a majority of enterprises have already implemented tools to protect leaking of communications that pass through their web traffic but there are still many firms that lack such means of mitigating DNS-oriented attacks. It is also widely known fact that DNS is a very commonly used internet application protocol that almost all corporate networks heavily rely upon. Therefore, attackers are using all the resources to target the DNS with a variety of network protocols for evading detection.According to Brumaghin and Grady, they started their investigation with tracking a Powershell script containing a base-64-encoded string. This script displayed the phrase \u201cSourceFireSux.\u201d This led to uploading of a sample to Hybrid Analysis, a public malware analysis sandbox. This was led by the appearance of a page on Pastebin where the researcher duo found a Word file that was also uploaded to a public sandbox.The researchers noticed sharp similarities in the stages of infection in Word file and the Hybrid Analysis sandbox. Brumaghin and Grady then explored telemetry data and they obtained more samples. In their opinion, this Word file was serving as a phishing ploy because it showed message from an email security vendor and there was a malicious link too that was used to initiate the macro\u2019s operations for decoding the Powershell payload and communicate with the Command and Control server. The communications with the control server were to be performed using DNS TXT queries and responses.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Hackers Using Unmonitored System Tools, Protocols for Malicious Goals", "date": "March 4, 2017"}, {"topics": ["AI", "Drone", "internet", "Robots", "Science", "security", "Technology"], "body": "There are a lot of conspiracy theories about robots taking over our jobs or killing the humanity.

All sorts of speculations and rumors started spreading about the reasons behind the service outage.However, the company has now publicly announced that the actual reason behind the breakdown of its internet service is not a scam or hack attack but a typo error. This is even more surprising as the company admitted that one of their engineers caused the error.Reportedly, Amazon has released an official statement regarding the issue that disconnected Amazon from the rest of the world for a few hours and the company has blamed an engineer at Amazon Web Service (AWS). In its recent blog post, Amazon stated that \u201cAt 9:37 AM PST, an authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that are used by the S3 billing process. Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended.\u201dThis means just by pushing a button or executing a command that is not supposed to be executed can create all sorts of troubles. It is worth noting that about one-third of Amazon\u2019s entire internet traffic flows through AWS servers. So, when the engineer deleted a bunch of these servers, a huge number of users was deprived of visiting Amazon.However, here, the question arises that what took Amazon hours to resolve the issue? To this concern, the company clarified that some of its main systems had not been restarted completely in the past few years, which is why it took them \u201clonger than expected\u201d to resume internet service.Amazon is now implementing several modifications to its systems after this mishap; such as it will be modifying a tool for preventing deletion of such a large number of servers at once. But what Amazon is failing to understand is that to avoid such problems in the future, it has to do something to make its internet service dispersed across multiple services. Currently, it heavily relies on a single service.Typo errors like these will continue to occur as it is virtually impossible to eliminate possibilities of human errors completely.

In the latest research analysis from security firm Palo Alto Networks, it was revealed that around 132 Android apps on Google Play store contain malicious coding. This could be due to the use of infected computers by the developers at the time of app development.The research team claims that these apps either generate hidden iframes or produce HTML document, which is embedded in a web page and links two different domains where the malware is hosted.More: Fake Netflix, WhatsApp, Facebook Android Apps Contain SpyNote RATIt must be noted that the apps that were shortlisted by Palo Alto Networks to be infected with malware were not high-end apps but commonly downloaded apps like design ideas for landscaping a garden, creating cheesecakes, etc. The issue to be concerned about is that some of these apps have been downloaded 10,000 times.Google has removed the apps from its Play Store while Palo Alto Networks suggest that the developers cannot be blamed for the issue because they might not be aware of the fact that the computer they were using for development of the new app was infected with malware that searched for HTML pages only to inject them with malicious code.After installing the malicious coding containing app, these start displaying web pages, which contain hidden iframe that create a link between the device and two suspicious domains. These domains have already been identified to be involved in hosting Windows malware after which a Polish security company took their control in 2013 and later the domains were taken down.Palo Alto Networks also came across an app that instead of launching the web pages containing iframes, launched an MS Visual Basic script that is used for Windows, which the team found a bit awkward since the script cannot harm Android users.Researchers are of the opinion that the tainted 132 apps that create a link to two defunct yet malicious domains do not pose a serious threat and it seems that the tempering is a product of an accident. As the intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks, Ryan Olson stated:\u201cFile infecting viruses can bounce around for years, even after these domains are taken offline.

As businesses and consumers accelerate adoption, we\u2019re now on the cusp of an IoT revolution.The benefits of connected devices are massive and include better data, automation, and increased efficiency. From connected healthcare to smart manufacturing and the development of smart cities, every vertical benefit from this technology.But as the Internet of Things creates opportunities, it also creates new targets for cyber criminals. Worryingly, these devices are extremely vulnerable to exploitation; in the past three years, AT&T noted a 3,198% increase in attackers scanning for vulnerabilities in IoT devices.With billions of hackable devices using outdated security technology, coupled with a lack of consumer and business awareness, the Internet of Things is the world\u2019s greatest cyber security threat. Here\u2019s why.Feeble IoT security vs. powerful hackersThe widespread use of IoT continues to highlight how vulnerable these devices are when faced with modern, sophisticated cyber threats. A lack of investment in IoT security means these products are easy targets for cyber criminals. These are just some security issues associated with connected devices.Privacy \u2013 IoT devices collect masses of personal information through the cloud or mobile applications. Consumers may not realize that their personal information is being gathered, but it could be used against them. By analyzing smart heating data, cyber criminals could find out when you\u2019re out of the house, or when you\u2019re asleep. It would surprise few to see this data then sold on the dark net.Poor authentication \u2013 Many IoT devices use simple factory passwords or fail to educate users to create complex passwords. The opportunity is all too obvious for criminals. Weak passwords can be easily breached through brute force cracking, giving hackers access to your personal data.Lack of control \u2013 Users often have no control over the generation and storage of IoT data. These devices often fail to provide an obvious location where a user can give consent to data collection. Without consent, most consumers won\u2019t learn what data is being tracked and if they\u2019re prepared for this to be collected.Insecure software \u2013 Software vulnerabilities can be resolved with firmware upgrades, but manufacturers push back on these updates so as not to disrupt user bases. Updates for outdated hardware are often discontinued when new hardware is introduced. The result: IoT devices joining botnets to DDoS organizations, or your personal data stolen.Automatic updates \u2013 Some consumers simply won\u2019t update their devices manually, leaving it to the manufacturers to ensure automated and regular updates. But as we\u2019ve seen, this is not a widely adopted practice for IoT devices. With a lack of automatic updates on IoT devices, consumers are even less likely to keep their firmware updated, especially if they can\u2019t be controlled from a single computer. Again, the result is an easy route to your devices and data for hackers.Part of the problem is that many consumers may not realize the security of their IoT devices is outdated and plagued with vulnerabilities.\u201cThe challenge we face is that many of [these products] are not designed with security in mind,\u201d says Terence Greer-King, director of cyber security at Cisco.\u201cMany users do not realize that they are essentially deploying a tiny web-enabled server in their home that could potentially be subverted to cause harm.\u201dBut why should you care if your internet-connected fridge is hacked? For starters, hackers could access personal data, like bank details, passwords and emails. You may even be an unknowing participant of the largest DDoS attacks in history.The terrifying power of billions of IoT devicesVulnerable internet-connected devices are the perfect targets for cyber criminals. Hackers have already learned how to manipulate IoT devices into joining botnets \u2013 groups of Internet-connected devices that can be remotely controlled.Once assembled, botnets can be used to orchestrate Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks use large numbers of IoT devices to direct traffic to a website or server, overwhelming it and rendering it inaccessible to real users.Botnets are traditionally made up of infected computers, but the widespread use of vulnerable IoT devices provides a far more enticing target for cyber criminals. A lack of investment in security and the abundance of IoT devices, a result of cheap and quick manufacturing, means these botnets are potentially far more dangerous than infected PCs.This lack of security investment was revealed in 2016 when criminals launched the largest DDoS attack in history. The botnet malware behind the attack, Mirai, infected 100,000s of IoT devices that then pummelled DNS provider Dyn with a 1.2 Tbps DDoS attack.The Mirai botnet knocked PayPal, Spotify, Netflix and Twitter offline, causing never-before-seen levels of disruption to some of the largest websites in the world.This attack was amongst the first of its kind \u2013 think of it as the Morris worm of IoT malware. Just imagine the threats businesses will face as IoT continues to expand.One month later businesses were unprepared when the Mirai botnet struck again. This time the attack affected 100,000s of Deutsche Telekom customers.The Mirai botnet source code is now available online, so it\u2019s likely to continue plaguing poorly secured IoT devices. And in February 2017, researchers identified a new variant of the Mirai botnet capable of targeting Windows systems, allowing the malware to spread to even more devices.Mirai is just the tip of the iceberg and other powerful botnets continue to damage businesses globally. It\u2019s not just businesses that should worry, one attack against a UK bank in 2016 resulted in \u00a32.5 million stolen directly from customer accounts.One recent \u2013 and unnerving \u2013breach from CloudPets revealed an openly accessible database containing 2 million voice messages, most recorded by children. The messages were recorded on an internet-connected soft toy.The poor state of IoT security is unlikely to improve in the short-term and catastrophic attacks are inevitable.\u201cA major bank will fail as a result of a cyber-attack in 2017 leading to a loss of confidence and a run on that bank,\u201d says Prof Richard Benham, chairman of the UK National Cyber Management Centre.Preventing a future disasterThese threats are a precursor for a potentially massive IoT disaster, like a major data breach or DDoS attack. The Mirai attacks, though powerful, affected a relatively small number of IoT devices. With an estimated 15 billion low-security devices up for grabs, this is a disaster waiting to happen.In February, a group of industry leaders industry formed the IoT Cybersecurity Alliance aiming to use their combined expertise to solve the security challenges presented by the Internet of Things. Founding members include AT&T, IBM, Nokia and Symantec.\u201cThe explosive growth in the number of IoT devices is only expected to continue\u2026so must the associated cybersecurity protections,\u201d says Mo Katibeh, AT&T senior vice president of Advanced Solutions.The new group outlined some specific goals, like conducting collaborative research on IoT security challenges across healthcare, automotive, and industrial verticals.This is reassuring news because it\u2019s ultimately the responsibility of manufacturers to produce secure devices and ensure their firmware is up-to-date. But this isn\u2019t a solution.There\u2019s a battle ahead as cheaply manufactured internet-enabled devices, produced in countries with relaxed IoT security regulations enter the market.Cyber security spending is on the up globally with a predicted $1 trillion spent annually by 2021. Clearly, businesses continue to invest in cyber security skills, with recognized certifications \u2014 like ISC2\u2019s CISSP or EC-Council\u2019s Certified Ethical Hacker \u2014 but they must also now dedicate resources to ensuring the security of their IoT products.Until every industry can ensure the security of their connected devices, attacks like Mirai will continue to plague businesses for the foreseeable future.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Alex Bennett", "title": "Why Internet of Things is the world\u2019s greatest cyber security threat", "date": "March 2, 2017"}, {"topics": ["breach", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "Data", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security"], "body": "Coachella Valley, Music and Arts Festival, is a famous event that is attended by a large number of citizens.

Take the example from 2015 when researchers exposed an 18-year-old \u201cRedirect to SMB\u201d vulnerability which allowed attackers to steal data from all versions of Windows operating system.Now, security researchers at Google have revealed an existing vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Edge and Internet Explorer browsers which allows attackers to conduct remote code execution and take control of victim\u2019s browsers or simply crash them.The critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-0037) was discovered by Google back in November 2016, giving Microsoft 90-days to fix the issue but it looks like Microsoft did not take the deadline seriously and eventually Google had to go public with their findings.The researcher who originally found the vulnerability is Ivan Fratric, a Google engineer who is still reluctant to disclose additional details about the vulnerability as it may harm Window users on a large scale. Here, it must be noted that the vulnerability affects users on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. In a blog post, Fratric wrote that \u201cI will not make any further comments on exploitability, at least not until the bug is fixed. The report has too much info on that as it is (I really didn\u2019t expect this one to miss the deadline).\u201dIn a reply to Fratric according to BBC, Mircosoft commented that \u201cit has a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible.\u201dFurthermore, Mircosoft stated that \u201can ongoing conversation with Google about extending their deadline since the disclosure could potentially put customers at risk.\u201dAt the moment, there are no indications if hackers a exploiting the vulnerability in IE or Edge but the more Microsoft delay the issue the more it will force Google to publically release crucial information about the usage of this vulnerability.

Needless to mention, if the information lands into the hands of malicious cyber-criminals, it could very well be used for raking in ransom.It must be noted that CloudPets toys can be connected to mobile applications. These let parents and family members send messages to the kids, which are then played by the stuffed toys like teddy bears. To do this, you need to register at CloudPets by creating an account and provide the name of the kid and his/her picture along with an email address. The data is stored in the cloud instead of your smartphone on which the app is installed. CloudPets toys were launched in 2015. The all-animal range of toys includes rabbits, cats, dogs and stuffed bears.More: After Spying Webcams, Welcome the Spy Toys \u201cMy Friend Cayla and I-Que\u201dHunt has compiled a full-fledge report on the vulnerability of CloudPets toys and stated that more than 820,000 user accounts have already been exposed including 2.2 million voice recordings.\u201cI suspect one of the things that will shock people is that they probably didn\u2019t think through the fact that when you connect the teddy bear, your kid\u2019s voices are sitting on an Amazon server,\u201d stated Hunt.According to the findings, the central database of CloudPets\u2019 voice messages and user related data was stored in a MongoDB server. The database was secured through basic hashes only, which protected user addresses and passwords. That\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t a difficult task for hackers to access the stored voice messages that are recorded from apps and toys since the same database was connected to the recordings.The database was removed from the MongoDB server in January after demands for ransom started emerging using these recordings. Hunt believes that the company responsible for manufacturing these toys, the California-based Spiral Toys, didn\u2019t have enough resources and finances to address the warnings and complaints from users. This particular database was also indexed by Shodan so you can check out if your kids\u2019 toys are leaking data or not.In one of the ransom attacks, the data was deleted by the attacker and a ransom note was uploaded after which CloudPets was required to pay the ransom in bitcoins. However, the company restored the lost data using the backup. The worst aspect is that the company didn\u2019t inform users about the data leak as yet and the same passwords are being used until now. According to Californian law, companies need to notify users about such data breaches so, in that sense, we can term it as a clear violation of the law. It is also a matter of concern for parents as the Android app has already been downloaded over 100,000 times despite poor advertising and negative feedback from users.Hunt was contacted by some concerned users about the vulnerability of CloudPets and Spiral Toys\u2019 products citing that their emails are not being answered by the involved manufacturer firms. To get to the root of the matter, Hunt collaborated with tech website Motherboard\u2019s reporter Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai to report the issue to CloudPets but his efforts went in vain.\u201cNormally I would say get in touch with the company involved, but CloudPets is non-responsive. I almost think the advice here is to get in touch with local regulators and make a complaint about this,\u201d said Hunt.Hunt recommends that parents need to change the passwords in case they are reusing them somewhere else too. Already, it is not advisable to use the same password on various platforms.Javvad Malik, security advocate at AlienVault and former 451 senior analyst at 451\u2019s Enterprise Security Practice commented on the issue \u201cA lot of the vulnerabilities and issues within children\u2019s toys are a subset of the vulnerabilities we are seeing more of in the broader internet of things (IoT). With that in mind, the breaches of toys aren\u2019t necessarily different. Any time you embed technology within a toy such as a doll, a kids tablet, a baby monitor, etc., particularly where there is external connectivity via internet or Bluetooth, you run the risk of someone accessing it inappropriately.  Shodan (the search engine for the internet of things) has a paid feed for members where they can trawl the internet to look for open webcams. Many show kids sleeping \u2013 as parents have them setup to monitor their children. It can also be searched for free at http://images.shodan.io/Because security is a low priority for manufacturers and consumers, it typically doesn\u2019t get implemented. So in theory, nearly any kids\u2019 toy that has a camera and connectivity can be at risk.What info is being stored:A lot and poorly. Technology companies have an unhealthy fetish to collect as much data as possible. Whilst there are business benefits to knowing your customers \u2013 there needs to be a measure of appropriateness applied and the data that is collected needs to be properly secured. Looking at the VTech breach, you had potentially millions of children\u2019s details exposed. This included names, genders, birthdays, parents and home addresses amongst others. The questions that arise are, does a company really need that much information and are they protecting it adequately?For the large majority of companies producing children\u2019s toys, the answer is unfortunately, more likely to be a no on both accounts. Not only can you pinpoint individual children, such as John, age 8 who lives with his parents at this address, but it becomes relatively trivial to then steal a child\u2019s identity \u2013 something that maybe won\u2019t be discovered until the child is 18 and applies for their first bank loan or applies for a job \u2013 only to find they have been blacklisted on different systems.What kind of risks are these toys creating for your entire family?The internet today is not how it was 10-15 years ago. Letting all manner of devices and applications connect to the internet is, from a risk perspective, an unsustainable strategy. The sensitive nature of data transmitted via some of these toys, which can also include video or pictures of children \u2013 coupled with the fact that security is typically weak \u2013 it does indeed create another risk avenue. I\u2019d say that yes, connecting to unsecured public wifi only increases the risk exposure. Why would hackers want to breach kids\u2019 toys anyway?I am reminded of the story of the scorpion and the turtle, where the scorpion asks the turtle for a ride on its back across the river. Along the journey, the scorpion tries to sting the turtle on its shell. When the turtle asks why the scorpion acted in that way, the scorpion replied, \u201cbecause it\u2019s in my nature\u201d (I hope you know the story I\u2019m referring to, I\u2019ve really shortened it).Similarly, it\u2019s in hackers\u2019 nature to hack. If something has the technology, internet connectivity or something else \u2013 then a hacker will be curious in trying to determine how it works. The person who finds the vulnerability may not even be interested in exploiting it \u2013 but there are nefarious individuals that can use that knowledge to further their own goals. Identity theft of children can be a particularly good avenue as it can provide returns long before it\u2019s detected. What should parents be doing to keep their children\u2019s personal information safe?We should teach kids, similar to the way we advise them not to accept candy from strangers or get into someone\u2019s car. We need to become more aware of the dangers that are posed. Not sharing identifying information is the first step. Have a separate email account setup for registering toys. Don\u2019t use your real name or address and don\u2019t disclose details such as your school or where your parents work. These tips could apply equally to many adults too. It only takes one member of the family to expose details that could undermine everyone\u2019s privacy.\u201dMore: UK May Approve Bill Allowing Spying on Individuals via Their Kids ToysThis is not the first time when a toy manufacturer has faced such a large scale data breach.

The targeted platforms according to researchers include online banking customers of Capital One, Chase, Fargo, Wells and online money transfer giant PayPal and Venmo.The new phishing campaign carries the same old method of tricking users into clicking on a phony attachment file, but this time the attached HTML file is embedded with data URLs. It must be noted that last month, Gmail users were targeted with a similar phishing scam in which attackers embedded data URLs in PDF files which took users to a fake Gmail sign in page.However, since the Gmail scam has been busted the attackers are heavily relying on HTML files to phish users. The latest scam according to Cyren is already reaching new heights with 50% increase only in the month of February. \u201cThese attacks are proving effective at evading detection by many email security systems, which typically allow HTML attachments, or are not capable of scanning their content, and therefore do not detect the telltale \u201cdata:text\u201d URI header \u2014 as opposed to .exe attachments, which are commonly blocked,\u201d notes Cyren.This is not the first time when Cyren has discovered such scams.

As you may already know, Cloudflare offers internet security and infrastructure to some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies. These include Cisco, Zendesk, Nasdaq etc. As such, if you have used a website that uses CloudFlare\u2019s services, chances are that your information may also have been leaked unceremoniously by this bug.Cloudbleed may not be as dangerous as Heartbleed. However, it is being speculated that the damage caused by Cloudbleed is still not completely known. As such, the actual damage may be a lot more. Up till now, only 3400 websites are reported to have been affected by the bug. However, these websites were Cloudflare\u2019s clients. There might be a number of other websites that might also have been affected.Essentially, secured websites whose addresses have \u201chttps\u201d, instead of just \u201cHTTP\u201d, in the beginning, prevent private information such as one\u2019s address or passwords to be leaked and Cloudflare provides the necessary infrastructure for the secure movement of information between such websites. However, due to Cloudbleed, the information got saved and was also cached by search engines such as Google. Hence, the information could be easily retrieved by any hacker.As of now, all that is known is that Change.org, Uber, OKCupid, and FitBit are among the websites that were affected. However, the good news is that Cloudflare has now fixed the bug and it is no longer on the loose.To date, there is no clear-cut answer to this. What has been leaked cannot be made secure again. Nevertheless, one should change one\u2019s passwords immediately. Furthermore, websites that use Cloudflare are to be avoided.

The Saudi government had issued a warning notice last month to all telecommunications companies of the detection of the malware attack on many organizations and networks, including government departments.The 2012 attack was carried out using the original virus. That time Aramco the state-owned oil producer was the primary target, in what is still today one of the most destructive attacks detected. 30\u2019000 or more computers were damaged or destroyed in the attack.On February the 10th the State Department issued a report which stated that 75% of Aramco\u2019s computers were compromised in the 2012 attack, the cost was not declared, but the five months it took to mitigate was at \u201can extreme cost.\u201dU.S. officials have warned that this orchestrated attack is a renewal of its takeover strategy of the region. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia\u2018s demise could tip the balance away from U.S. and regional allies. Other allies such as Qatar, have also been attacked by the malware originated from Iran.

In November however, a newer version of the malware surfaced in a new cyber attack. This attack was traced back to the hacker group called Greenbug by security officials.Shamoon 2 used fraudulent e-mails in multiple phishing scams to obtain login credentials for Saudi networks. The latest hacks have been linked to two Iranian groups known as \u201cCadelle and Chafer\u201d in security circles. A cyber security specialist who must remain anonymous explained that, unlike the previous attack, this attack was only designed to damage, which was why Shamoon 2 was not as destructive as the 2012 attack.The Iranian hackers stole large amounts of data from the computer network, after that, a digital wiping tool was used to remove all data from the devices. They left a burning American flag image as a calling card in the 2012 attack, in the recent attack an image of a dead Syrian refugee boy was left.Initially, The U.S. targeted Iranian nuclear facilities with cyber attacks using an industrial control software called Stuxnet which had caused nuclear centrifuges to self-destruct. The NSA believe these are a direct retaliation for those attacks.Many experts believe the ongoing cyber attacks are part of Shiite Iran\u2019s long-term strategy to rid the Islamic world of the Wahhabist dominance and influence exerted by the mainly Sunni Kingdom of Saud. The NSA believe there will be further continuation even an escalation of the attacks as it has been viewed as a success so far by Tehran.A warning issued by the State Department stated \u201cDevastating Cyber Attack Program Returns to Saudi Arabia\u201d, further adding \u201cThe increased tensions and unpredictable future between Iran, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. raises the potential for U.S. companies in the region to be future targets for a cyberattack, either with Shamoon or similar malware tuned for destruction rather than corporate espionage or theft.\u201dThe conflict in Yemen has seen the opposing governments backing different sides in the country. The proxy war is being fought by the pro-Saudi government, while Iran is supporting the Houthi militia. The escalation of the war has seen mass civilian casualties in the civil war, so much so the Obama administration first ceased its covert drone attacks and then delayed the delivery of precision-guided bomb kits which were to be used to turn gravity bombs into precision-guided missiles.And with the increased awareness of the fatalities in the conflict, it forced Obama into a controversial policy U-turn by sending the Secretary of State John Kerry in to try and negotiate a deal to end the war. Many officials were critical of the outgoing administration\u2019s proposed deal citing it would be to the detriment of the Saudi\u2019s while shifting power to IranWith the Iran government stepping up with direct help in the form of sending Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to fight alongside fighters from Iraq fresh from defeating Isis, Al-Nusra and other terrorist organizations that were operating in Iraq. U.S. officials say the Houthis are now planting sea mines of the coast of Yemen under the guidance of Iran. It is believed the aim of Iran is to create a choke hold first on Bab-el-Mandeb, a widely used shipping lane between the Red Sea, Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean. While using the control they have of the Strait of Hormuz, to weaken Saudi Arabian influence in the region.Recently, a Saudi warship was attacked using a boat loaded with explosives, that was remote controlled much like a drone attack except at sea. Due to this ramping up of activity against the U.S. ally, America dispatched the destroyer USS Cole to patrol the regional waters. Warnings have been issued to shipping companies using the regional shipping lanes to check in with the U.S. Navy before proceeding into the area.It is now reported, the Trump administration is close to lifting the ban on arms sales to the Saudi\u2019s, and the goal of peace and warmer relations with Iran have been binned.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Salek Ahmed", "title": "Saudi-Iran: Proxy Wars Escalate To Direct Cyber Attacks", "date": "February 25, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Encryption", "Google", "hacking", "internet", "Password", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "body": "According to Google\u2019s research team, they have successfully broken Secure Hash Algorithm 1 encryption, commonly referred to as SHA-1, which is a vital internet security tool. They believe that with this new breakthrough they can limit the widespread use of encryption technology.It is indeed a breakthrough since SHA-1 has been touted as vulnerable so far despite being an important and widely used internet security method but nothing was practically proved. So, now we can claim SHA-1 to be vulnerable without any confusion and it is time for the safety firms and software developers to update the system and use something else instead of this algorithm.Marc Stevens spearheaded the research with other staff members at the Netherlands-based computer science institute Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica while the Dutch government funded the research. They have been trying to crack the SHA-1 code since 2009 and today, they have finally decoded it successfully and have publicly announced the success story. Google collaborated with Stevens in 2015 and contributed to the research through resourcing pro bono such as computing/engineering infrastructure and technological expertise.SHA-1 has been a vital internet security tool for as long as 1995, and with the passage of time it became mainstream security tool for internet users and cyber-community, but its salient weaknesses weren\u2019t highlighted until 2005.LinkedIn data leak in 2016 revealed the company was using unsalted SHA-1 to hash user passwords.Google practices a profound vulnerability disclosure policy, and as per its policy, the company has plans to release the code acquired after cracking the SHA-1 encryption algorithm. However, this will happen within 90 days from today. This would lead to attackers and cybercriminals receiving an instruction manual for decoding the algorithm. Therefore, whoever will be relying upon SHA-1 will most definitely become vulnerable to attackers\u2019 malicious antics.In a blog post by Google researcher Elie Bursztein, it was noted that the company had urged security practitioners to employ more reliable and safe \u201ccryptographic hashes,\u201d on an urgent basis. The post further clarified that the SHA-1 algorithm was used very commonly for encryption of documents such as emails, payment transactions, email attachments, electronic files and legal documents. The algorithm has remained in use for so many years that most people would find it difficult to switch to a new mechanism.

The leakage of sensitive data such as HTTPs cookies and others, which occurred on the servers, is said to have affected some of the major global brands such as Uber, Lyft, OKCupid and others.None of these companies has commented on the issue, so far. However, CloudFlare says that it took some necessary steps to address the situation immediately; it was notified of its existence by Ormandy.According to the company, its experts immediately deactivated the Automatic HTTPS, Server-Side Excludes and email obfuscation features on its servers immediately after it had been notified of the fault. But in what may further complicate matters for the company, it is now emerging that the company may not have taken the issue as seriously as it now states.According to Ormandy, after he notified the cyber security experts at the company about the breach, he was referred to the infamous bug bounty program that the company runs. Interestingly, the company runs a bug bounty program under which it rewards hackers who manage to point out flaws in its systems with T-Shirts.Speculation is rife that the company may not have given the issue the level of attention and seriousness that it deserved in the first place.It must be noted that Google started a program under which it sought to find and remove all the data from the service that has been cached on its search engine.

A couple of weeks ago, it was also discovered that after infecting Linux devices, the Mirai malware is can also infect Windows devices.Now, in a report published by Kaspersky Lab, it was identified that the code had been written by someone experienced and who is well-versed in spreading the IoT malware onto Linux systems in specific conditions. According to their research, the campaign isn\u2019t merely an over-hyped hike from Linux based Mirai to Windows based Mirai because it appears to be yet more proof of the dangers of public availability of the source code of Mirai malware and the inadequacy of security measures that has made IoT devices and embedded systems so vulnerable to hacking.It is, however, quite alarming that Mirai is easily spreading from OS to OS. As per the report from Kaspersky Lab, just like Zeus banking Trojan source code\u2019s release turned out to be a devastating step for the online community, the leaking of Mirai IoT source code is also becoming a big problem as far as the security of the Internet-connected infrastructure is concerned. This is indeed concerning for the online security fraternity as the problems will continue to rise for many years as it is just the beginning of hackers learning to use the source code in a variety of ways.Windows botnet can spread to Linux-based machines through using brute force attack against the device\u2019s remote telnet connection and may then spread over SMI, SQL Injection and SSH attacks as well as IPC techniques. These can target cameras that are IP based, media center appliances, internet connected DVRs and Banana Pi and Raspberry Pi devices.Kaspersky Lab researcher Kurt Baumgartner noted that this year around 500 different systems had been targeted and most of the targets are located in emerging markets.\u201cMore experienced attackers, bringing increasingly sophisticated skills and techniques, are starting to leverage freely available Mirai code. A Windows botnet spreading IoT Mirai bots turns a corner and enables the spread of Mirai to newly available devices and networks that were previously unavailable to Mirai operators. This is only the beginning,\u201d added Baumgartner.As per their analysis, the bot was not just coded and compiled on a Chinese machine but also signed with code-signing certificates that were stolen from a pair of Chinese silicon and wafer manufacturers namely Xi\u2019 a JingTech Electronic Technology, Ltd., and Partner Tech Co., Ltd. Both are Shanghai-based companies.The malware\u2019s main targets are Microsoft SQL servers, and MySQL database servers since these are internet-oriented servers and offer access to privately networked devices like IP-based cameras and DVRs.

Now, according to ESET researchers, there is a new ransomware malware called \u201cPatcher\u201d targeting Mac users.The new ransomware is written in Swift and is called Patcher; it is being distributed through BitTorrent distribution sites. The Torrent has just one ZIP file, which is actually an application pack with bundle identifier NULL.prova. ESET researchers identified two fake application Patchers one of which is for Adobe Premiere Pro and the other is for Mac system\u2019s Microsoft Office. The app has been coded poorly and research suggests that the window contains transparent background that is certainly quite confusing as once it is closed it becomes too difficult to reopen it.More: Hackers Selling Undetectable Proton Malware for macOS in 40 BTCWhen the victim clicks on the Start button, the encryption process begins and a file called README!.txt is copied everywhere around the directories of the system including Documents and Photos directories. The ransomware then creates a random 25-character string, which serves as a key for completing the file encryption process. This key is then applied to all the existing files. The files are then numbered with the fine command line tool. The purpose of the ZIP tool is to store the file in an encrypted library.Afterward, the real file is deleted with rm and the time of the encrypted file is modified to midnight, Feb 13th, 2010 using the touch command. Now the same process that was carried out for the directory is used for all the external and network storage folders present in /Volumes. After completion of file encryption, a code helps the attacker to null all the available free space on the root partition using diskutil. It is worth noting that the malware has a wrong path for diskutil i.e, for macOS it is /usr/sbin/diskutil while the malware tries to execute /usr/bin/diskutil.The victim receives the instruction from the README!.txt file, which is hard coded within the Filecoder. It actually represents the Bitcoin address and email address remains the same for every victim and both the samples utilize the same message and contact details. Please note that there hasn\u2019t been any transaction related to the Bitcoin wallet, which hints at the fact that as of now the campaign designers haven\u2019t been able to earn anything from this ransomware.The problem with this campaign, as per the researchers, is that the ransomware does not have any specific code with which it could communicate with the C&C server. Therefore, there is literally no way to decrypt the files since the encryption key was never sent to the attackers in the first place. Furthermore, the ZIP password is generated by arc4random_uniform, which is believed to be a secure random number generator. So, victims have no other choice but to pay the ransom to get the files back.So far, the attackers have targeted Chinese-speaking victims. What led to this conclusion is the fact that the ransom note is written in Mandarin and the instructions say that the attackers can be contacted through QQ instant messaging service for payment of ransom and unlocking of code. However, since the target computer is locked up, the victims have to contact the attackers from another machine/device.This is not the first time when researchers have discovered a ransomware malware targeting Mac users.

TOR hides and occasionally changes your IP address when you are online. Thus, when you are using TOR on either of these devices, your privacy and identity will be safe when you visit social media sites or any other sites on the internet. Here is a detailed guide on how you can successfully install TOR on your Android or IOS device.1: Download OrbotYou will have to download Orbot from any the credible app stores available. You can download it from Google Play, Amazon App Store or even from the website of the developer, which is the Guardian Project.2: Install Orbot on your deviceIt is easy to install Orbot on your Android device, thanks to its highly intuitive installation wizard. Here is how the setup wizard looks like at first glance when you are just about to start the actual process of installing Orbot on your Android device3: Select the features you would like to run via Orbot If your device is rooted, you will have to choose the particular applications you would like to access via Orbot. The process of selecting the apps that you would like to use via Orbot is simple and straightforward. However, if your device is not rooted, you may skip this step of the process by choosing the option that lets you proxy all the apps on your device through TOR.4: Give Orbot Superuser access for rooted devicesIf your Android device is rooted, you will have to give Orbot super user access for you to proceed with the installation process. Granting the app superuser access at all times ensures that you will be able to use Orbot when you are opening any app on your rooted Android device at any time.This is how the screenshot for the stage when you have to grant Orbot superuser status to the apps on your Android device looks like.5: Reboot your deviceYou will have to reboot your device at this stage of the installation process to allow Orbot to access all the apps on your device. If you attempt to open your mobile browser at this stage, it is likely that the browser may not function as desired. Therefore you may have to restart your device at this stage of the installation process.6: Check your IP addressOnce you have reset your device, you will have to visit any website that checks your IP address. The purpose of this activity is to confirm that your traffic is getting re-routed via a proxy server and that you have a different IP address from your original one. If the Orbot installation process has been successful, you will get a different IP address. Here is a screenshot of how things should appear at this stage of the process.6: Make configuration for some applicationsYou may have to configure some apps on your mobile device for you to use Orbot successfully. In this case, you may have to go to the \u2018settings\u2019 section of every particular app you would like to configure and make the necessary changes.For some apps, you may have to download and install particular add-ons for you to use the apps on Orbot successfully.7: Start using your deviceOnce you have successfully gone through the five steps that have been outlined above, you will be able to use TOR for your Android device. One important thing you need to note is that TOR will change your IP address at times. The occasional changes to your IP address are essential in making you anonymous online. Here is a screenshot of how things look like when you check your IP address once you complete the process of installing TOR on your Android device.The procedure of installing TOR on your IOS device is similar to that of when you are installing the app on your Android device. However, there are slight variations that you have to keep in mind when installing TOR on your iOS device. Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can set up TOR on your iOS device so you may enjoy the level of anonymity and online privacy that TOR offers to its users.1: Download the TOR browser from Apple App StoreYou will have to visit the App Store on your iOS device as the first step of the process. Once you access the app store, you may have to search for the TOR browser. You will see a list of alternatives. Choose the TOR-enabled browser that suits your needs. Here is a screenshot of what you should have when you are just about to tap on the \u2018Get it\u2019 button on the app store.Remember that you may have to buy some apps from the Apple App store.2: Install the app on your deviceOnce you successfully download the TOR app, you will see a button asking you to install it on your device. You will have to tap on the button to allow the installation process to commence. Remember that it is at this stage that the highly technical aspects of setting up TOR on your iOS device begin.The installation process takes a few minutes. Here is a screenshot of what you are supposed to have on your device just before you tap the \u2018install\u2019 button.3: Connect to TOROnce you have successfully downloaded and installed TOR on your iOS device, the device will prompt you to connect to the TOR network. You will have to select this option to enable the TOR browser to start working on your device.Remember that this stage is similar to that of installing TOR on your Android device during which you have to reconfigure some apps so that they work on TOR. Similarly, you may have to select to use the TOR app on particular apps on your iPhone device. However, the good news is that the process is straightforward.4: Start using TOR to browseOnce you have successfully gone through the steps that have been outlined here, you will be ready to use TOR when browsing the internet on your iOS device. TOR helps to safeguard your online privacy by changing your IP address. As it is the case with installing TOR on your Android device, you may find it necessary to check if the installation has been successful by testing your IP address. If the installation has been successful, you will realize that you have an IP address that is different from the previous one.In conclusion, it is easy to install the TOR app on your Android as well as an iOS device. The most important things you need to keep in mind are that you may have to reconfigure some apps on your device to make them compatible with TOR. Also, in the case of Android devices, the level of complexity of the process largely depends on whether your device is rooted or not.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Ali Raza", "title": "How to Install TOR on Android and iOS Devices", "date": "February 23, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Chrome", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Wordpress"], "body": "Chrome has remained the eye-candy of cyber-criminals lately and the latest hacking campaign is a clear proof of that.

To do this, the victim will have to update the Chrome font pack.It does seem like a pretty decent trick to lure users into downloading malware primarily because the dialog window that appears to request users for installing the missing font has been designed like the genuine Chrome message window containing the same shade of blue color on the Update button and the logo on one side. However, no ploy can be fool-proof and in this particular case as well there are certain loopholes. Firstly, the dialog window states that the victim is using Chrome version 53 even if it is not true.

In this particular campaign, the targets are quite broad range and the basic purpose is to spy on confidential communications of key Ukrainian officials by remotely controlling PC microphones. Apart from Ukraine, CyberX has identified targets in Russia as well and to some extent in Austria and Saudi Arabia. Some of the targets are also discovered in the separatists\u2019 states of Luhansk and Donetsk, which the Ukraine refers to as terrorist groups.In this campaign, which has been dubbed by CyberX as Operation BugDrop, DropBox is used to store the acquired data. As per their research, 70 victims have been targeted successfully by the cyber-criminals. The victims come from a variety of fields including critical infrastructure, scientific research and media, etc.In this operation, the focus is upon capturing sensitive information such as audio recordings of communications, login credentials, documents and screenshots. Usually, users can block video recordings by placing a tape upon the lens of the webcam but blocking the microphone of a computer is impossible without manually disabling it by manipulating the hardware.According to CyberX, in Ukraine BugDrop has so far targeted companies that design remote monitoring systems primarily for Oil and Gas pipeline infrastructures, organizations that monitor human rights, cyber-attacks on main infrastructures and counter-terrorism institutions and engineering company that develops electrical substations, water supply plants and gas distribution pipelines.It is a pretty well-organized operation in which very sophisticated malware is utilized and apparently a resourceful organization is sponsoring it. The operation is launched via a large back-end infrastructure that stores, decrypts and analyses various GB of unstructured data obtained from the victims on a daily basis. Moreover, a massive team of human analysts is required to sort out and process the captured data manually or using analytic tools like Big Data. It is worth noting that use of DropBox for data exfiltration is a strategically wise decision since it cannot be blocked or tracked by corporate firewalls.The malware infects the target computer using phishing emails in which malicious macros are embedded inside Microsoft Office attachments and users are tricked with sophisticated social engineering skills so that they activate the macros manually if these do not get activated on their own. CyberX stated that just a few anti-malware scanners could detect BugDrop, which is quite unfortunate.For more technical details it is highly recommended to read CyberX\u2019s blog post.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "title": "BugDrop Malware Campaign Obtains Data by Compromising PC Microphones", "date": "February 22, 2017"}, {"topics": ["internet", "Mac", "NSA", "Privacy", "security", "Snowden", "Spying", "Surveillance"], "body": "Last year, a picture of Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg in his office went viral on the Internet, but the reason for it going viral was not only Zuckerberg himself but also the background in the picture showing his Macbook webcam was covered with a tape. Why was his webcam covered? Well, thanks to Edward Snowden who taught us a lot about privacy, exposing how government spies and hackers can secretly spy on users through their webcams without even turning its light on.Since then, we at HackRead have been urging users to protect their privacy by respecting their privacy. Now, Spy-Fy, a group of privacy advocates from Amsterdam, Netherlands have developed a webcam cover which is small in size but great at work. Dubbed Spyslide, this tiny webcam cover not only covers a laptop webcam but also fits perfect on desktops and tablets. However, you may need to wait for the perfect match for your smartphone.The Spyslide webcam cover was launched on Indiegogo just a few hours ago. We at Hackread were lucky enough to get a sample from Peter van de Rijdt, co-founder of the project. Under our use, we found the Spyslide not only useful but also to be the world\u2019s thinnest webcam cover with 0.6mm in size, made of stainless steel, and with the ability to achieve 100% webcam coverage.Just slide Spyslide to the right to open and left to closeSpyslide is not only elegant but also sleek in design. One of the best things we noticed about this cover is that it almost looks invisible once installed on a webcam, unlike stickers or tapes that make a device a bit rough looking. We tested Spyslide on Mac, but, the good news is that it has already been tested on several other devices including desktops, laptops and tablets from Acer, HP, Microsoft Surface, Lenovo, Samsung, Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo, Chromebook, and Asus. So if you are looking for a webcam cover, Spyslide might be a suitable choice for you.Another positive aspect of Spyslide is that it comes with built-in sticky material and takes less than few seconds to be placed on a webcam. A user does not have to put additional glue or any other sticky materials to affix it to a device.The price of Spyslide depends on the package you are going for however great news is that the shipping is free worldwide.While we encourage companies to develop more products like Spyslide, it must be noted that currently, a number of webcam covers available in the market are difficult to install, some are too thick for laptops and may damage the screen or shipped with more than one part which are difficult to install and easy to lose.If protecting online security and privacy are your core values check out Spyslide on IndieGoGo and support Spy-Fy\u2019s project right now.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Tiny \u201cSpyslide Webcam Cover\u201d Protects Your Privacy From Hackers, Spies", "date": "February 22, 2017"}, {"topics": ["AI", "Artificial Intelligence", "Facebook", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Social Media"], "body": "It isn\u2019t a secret that Facebook studies the activities of its users for miscellaneous purposes using its Artificial Intelligence mechanism.

This time, the malware being used in a new campaign that has been discovered by researchers at Heimdal Security. Through using TeamSpy (Pdf), attackers and threat actors can easily gain access and full control on any compromised computer. A majority of the targets seem to be unsuspecting online users, however, as suggested by Heimdal Security, high-profile industrial executives, researchers and diplomats are also among the targets of cyber-criminals.This campaign is being spread through malicious, infected emails in which attackers are using various social engineering skills and misusing the authentic TeamViewer remote access tool that includes TeamViewer VPN and keylogger to carry out the attacks. The cybercriminals trick innocent users into installing TeamSpy malware using DLL hijacking technique. In this trick, an authentic software program is manipulated in a way that it starts performing illegal activities.It starts with users receiving an email that contains an eFax attachment. When the recipient opens that email, a .exe file that is also attached with this file gets activated causing the TeamSpy malware code to be installed on the computer as malicious DLL. A TeamViewer session then commences while the attacker\u2019s activities remain hidden from the victim. Furthermore, attackers can easily carry out a variety of exploits on the machine using the services that the user has been running on the computer. The campaign is also able to circumvent two-factor authentication. The malware also provides attackers full access to encrypted content that has been unencrypted by the victim on the infected computer.Heimdal Security\u2019s researcher Andra Zaharia recommends that users be careful while opening emails and analyze every email that they receive. If there is an attachment that seems suspicious, it is better not to click on it. Moreover, emails from unknown senders must strictly be avoided.It is worth noting that the last time TeamSpy malware was in the news was back in 2013 when a secret cyber-spying campaign that remained active for almost a decade was uncovered. Also, Heimdal Security clarified that TeamViewer hasn\u2019t been infected and is completely safe to be used just like it was in 2016 when cyber-criminals utilized old passwords to compromise PayPal accounts.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "TeamSpy malware targeting users through malicious TeamViewer app", "date": "February 21, 2017"}]
