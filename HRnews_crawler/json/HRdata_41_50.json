[{"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Why buy expensive MacBook Pro when you can get it for $1? But then you will be the bad guy.The IT security researchers at ERPScan discovered a bunch of critical vulnerabilities in SAP Point-of-Sales systems (SAP POS), a client/server point-of-sale (POS) solution allowing them to buy an expensive MacBook for just $1.According to researchers, the vulnerabilities exist in the SAP POS Xpress Server that can be exploited to modify the price while purchasing a specific product. An attacker can also use the vulnerabilities to steal banking data including credit card details used for purchasing.The attack is only successful if an attacker is connected from the same network that is used by the payment system. The security firm says in order to conduct the attack, a hacker needs to physically connect Raspberry Pi or similar tools (which won\u2019t cost more than $25) to electronic scales inside a shop or carry a remote attack if the network is exposed to the Internet.In a blog post, ERPScan researchers wrote that \u201cOnce you are in, you have unlimited control over the backend and frontend of the POS system, as the tool can upload a malicious configuration file on the SAP POS Xpress Server without any authentication procedure.

But, today, it is quite easy as there are a number of tools that can help malicious threat actors in achieving their objectives without much effort. One such tool is the ransomware development kit and it is being sold on the internet\u2019s underground marketplace.The Trojan Development Kit (TDK) is basically an app that doesn\u2019t require the hacker to have coding skills for using it and developing ransomware. Which means even ambitious people with limited skills can create their personal file-locking malware. The kit is downloadable for free from various hacking discussion boards.More: 7 Easy Tips to Strong Android Security Against HacksTDK app has a user-friendly interface allowing cyber criminals to quickly create their ransomware. Tools for creating ransomware are usually developed for running on laptops or desktops but this particular kit is different as it is being distributed as a mobile app that helps in the development of customized ransomware strains for targeting Android devices.The kit was identified by Symantec researchers. According to Symantec\u2019s principal threat analysis engineer Dinesh Venkatesan, this is a \u2018ready-to-use piece of malware.\u2019 The whole process of creating ransomware is performed on a smartphone without even writing a \u2018single line of code,\u201d said Venkatesan.All the user has to do is follow some instructions of the app and fill out certain forms. When the forms are filled the user needs to click on Create button. This step would initiate communication between the app developer and the user. After paying the demanded one-time fee, the user can distribute the ransomware and make variations.The created ransomware has the same functionality as the Lockdroid, that is, it locks the device using a system alert error displaying the text to the user in a straightforward manner. The error message content just tells the victim that the device has been locked and in order to regain access, the victim has to pay a certain amount.The app comes with wide range of customization options as well. Such as the messages that will be displayed in the targeted device\u2019s lock screen, malware\u2019s icon, the key that will unlock the device, animation types that will be displayed on the infected device and the mathematical operations required to randomize codes.Currently, the TDKs are available at China\u2019s Great Firewall forums and famous Chinese social networking websites, which refers to the fact that it is created for Chinese speaking users. However, researchers believe that modified versions of ransomware in other languages will also be available soon if not already developed.There are ransomware-as-a-service kits also making their presence felt on the internet and the emergence of DIY kits like the TDKs would eventually make the task of both newcomer and seasoned cyber criminals a lot easier. The kit happens to be a subscription-based service and there is virtually no limit to the number of ransomware strains a subscriber can create after paying the one-time fee.\u201cEven hardened malware authors could find these easy-to-use kits an efficient alternative to putting the work in themselves. We expect to see an increase in mobile ransomware variants as these development kits become more widespread,\u201d stated Venkatesan.To stay protected from the latest DIY Android ransomware, users must refrain from downloading apps from unreliable platforms and must create a backup of important data along with regularly updating the system.

Reportedly, the victims are being redirected to customized, fake versions of famous websites.Jacoby, the senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, states that he became alerted about the attacks when he received a suspicious message on Facebook sent by his contacts. Jacoby then analyzed the content of the message and concluded that the malware is being distributed through Facebook Messenger. He further explained that the malware is \u201cserving multi-platform malware/adware, using tons of domains to prevent tracking, and earning clicks. The code is advanced and obfuscated.\u201dRelated: Facebook users hit with \u201cYou are in this video?\u201d malware scamFurthermore, the malicious links that are being sent via Facebook Messenger accounts are all infected and the messages are being sent from stolen accounts and hijacked browsers. They might even be a result of clickjacking.The method of attack is quite basic considering that it relies on identity theft. The person supposedly sending the message is a trusted contact, and therefore, the recipient of the message will inadvertently click on the sent link. However, the message has been sent by a contact the credentials of who have been stolen by the attackers. The link appears to be memes and videos, etc. The message bears the recipient\u2019s name followed by the word \u201cVideo,\u201d with a shocked emoji face. There is a shortened URL link as well.For instance, the message says \u201cDavid Video\u201d with a link leading to Google Doc. The photo, which apparently is stolen from the victim\u2019s Facebook page, is blurred and video seems to be a playable movie.However, when the link is clicked upon by the recipient, the malware redirects the victim to any one of the compromised websites. The website is selected according to a number of factors such as the operating system and browser being used and the victim\u2019s location. Once the victim visits the fake website, the malware would initiate the second stage of the scheme and installs adware.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Such as, if the victim is using Google Chrome, the link will redirect him/her to a website that appears like the legitimate YouTube with genuine looking logo and layout. A fake error message will appear on the website that would require downloading of a Chrome extension, which is malware.Similarly, Firefox users will be redirected to a site where they will be notified to update Flash, and the adware will be delivered via a Windows executable. Safari users will receive a website link that is compatible with macOS. The user is prompted to download a .dmg file that also happens to be adware.Related: Facebook \u2018Comment Tagging Malware\u2019 Spreading via Google ChromeSo why are cyber criminals sending out adware in this campaign? The reason is that adware program can track browser activity. This is done by use of cookies. Adware display targeted ads across the internet, and some of these ads are engineered in a way that users are compelled to click on them. These clicks are very important for the ad developers as these generate revenues.Currently, it is not confirmed who is behind the new Facebook Messenger campaign, but it is quite concerning given that Facebook is used by 1.2 billion users per month and therefore, the scope for cyber criminals operating this scheme is extremely wide. As Jacoby stated:\u201cThe people behind this are most likely making a lot of money in ads and getting access to a lot of Facebook accounts.\u201dSo how can you stay protected? Facebook spokesperson claims that the company has embedded numerous automated systems to prevent these kinds of the malicious scheme from affecting its users. However, the best method is to be skeptical of messages containing shortened URL links sent by your Facebook contacts. Moreover, Facebook has promised its users that even if the computer has been infected with malware, the social network will provide users \u201ca free antivirus scan from trusted partners\u201d and the company will also share tips on how users can stay safe from malicious campaigns.

It is worth noting that the software was designed for working on Windows XP based systems, but it is yet unclear if the tool is still being used and if yes then what changes have been made to its functionality.The released or rather leaked documents are ticked as \u201cSecret,\u201d and have exposed the methodology of the CIA. The files revealed that two divisions of CIA\u2019s Directorate of Science and Technology namely the Office of Technical Services (OTS) and Identity Intelligence Center (I2C) were involved in the covert collection of biometric data. ExpressLane discreetly copied data using the biometric software and disabled the software if the targeted agency didn\u2019t require continued access.The tool was developed so that the CIA could get the information, which its partner organizations were holding out, without even asking for it. The ExpressLane program is capable of accessing biometric data and copying it for the agency by appearing as a software update. The CIA handed over the program to its technicians called agents while the update didn\u2019t make any changes to the program at all but just played the role of a siphon that provided the required data to the CIA.ExpressLane was able to secretly collect data from intelligence organizations primarily because the targets use a biometric collection system that has been provided by the OTS. The agencies targeted include the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation), DHS (Department of Homeland Security) and NSA (National Security Agency) along with various liaison services across the globe. However, these are mere speculations as none of the targets that ExpressLane spied upon have been named in the released documents. What is confirmed is the fact that ExpressLane collected biometric data from the target partner agencies.As per the leaked documents, an OTS agent installed ExpressLane on the targeted system using a USB device claiming to carry out an upgrade to the system. The software displayed fake update screen for a specific duration that is determined by the agent. In the background, the required biometric data was compressed, encrypted and copied to the USB drive that belonged to the agent. The collected data is later extracted at the CIA headquarters using the ExitRamp utility.ExpressLane also allowed the CIA to make sure that the biometric software gets disabled after a certain number of days through Kill Date switch, which is enabled when the tool is getting installed. Kill Date specifies the date when the software will stop functioning. Usually, this duration was six months from the date of installation.If the agent doesn\u2019t return with the USB drive during these six months or whatever the duration is the biometric software\u2019s license expires. However, if ExpressLane is run on the computer, the Kill Date gets extended. The purpose is to ensure that the CIA gets the data it needs.WikiLeaks stated that the Florida based company Cross Match was responsible for manufacturing the core components of the biometric system. Cross Match is known for providing the field devices that helped in identifying al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden; it is the key firm that provides biometric software to intelligence and law enforcement agencies.RELEASE: CIA 'Express Lane' system for stealing the biometric databases of its 'partner' agencies around the world. https://t.co/8FefOS2Ljl pic.twitter.com/LPwlAd0Tgr\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 24, 2017Vault 7 documents previously leaked by Wikileaks:BothanSpy and Gyrfalcon: Steals SSH credentials from Linux & Windows devices OutlawCountry and Elsa: Malware targeting Linux devices and tracking user geolocation Brutal Kangaroo: CIA hacking tools for hacking air-gapped PCs Cherry Blossom: CherryBlossom & CherryBomb: Infecting WiFi routers for years Pandemic: A malware hacking Windows devices AfterMidnight and Assassin: CIA remote control & subversion malware hacking Windows Dark Matter: CIA hacking tool infiltrating iPhones and MacBooks Athena: A malware targeting Windows operating system Archimedes: A program helping CIA to hack computers inside a Local Area Network HIVE: CIA implants to transfer exfiltrated information from target machines Grasshopper: A malware payloads for Microsoft Windows operating systems Marble: A framework used to hamper antivirus companies from attributing malware Dark Matter: A CIA project that infects Apple Mac firmware Highrise: An Android malware spies on SMS Messages Aeris, Achilles, SeaPea: 3 malware developed by CIA targeting Linux and macOS Dumbo Project: CIA\u2019s project hijacking webcams and microphones on Windows devices CouchPotato Tool: Remotely Collects Video Streams from Windows devices", "topics": ["Biometric", "CIA", "hacking", "internet", "LEAKS", "Privacy", "security", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Vault 7", "wikileaks", "Windows"], "title": "Vault 7 Leak: CIA Collected Biometric Data from Partner Agencies", "date": "August 25, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "About a week ago, it was reported that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is demanding IP addresses of approximately 1.3 million people who visited disruptj20.org, a website known for facilitating protests especially at the time when US president Donald Trump was being inaugurated.Earlier today, the company hosting the site was ordered by a District of Columbia court to hand over some data about the site to the Department since it is being claimed that the platform played a significant role in organizing protests against Trump.\u201cThe website was not just a means to publicly disseminate information (as many websites are designed to do), but was also used to coordinate and to privately communicate among a focused group of people whose intent included planned violence,\u201d said DOJ.The hosting company DreamHost denied the request submitted by the government.

They have been analyzing robots used in industries and businesses, and their subjects happen to be the creations of top vendors UBTECH Robotics, SoftBank Robotics, ROBOTIS, Asratec Corp., Universal Robots and Rethink Robots.They checked mobile apps, firmware and software for flaws and discovered about 50 vulnerabilities. These included flaws related to different features of the robots such as authentication, communication, cryptography, open source components, authorization mechanisms, privacy and default configurations.More: Security Robot Found \u201cDrowned\u201d in An Indoor FountainIOActive CTO Cesar Cerrudo and the company\u2019s Senior Security Consultant Lucas Apa had warned previously that the security holes might very well be exploited and attackers can force the robots to spy and steal sensitive private data. Furthermore, the exploitation can cause malfunctioning of the cobot leading to physical damages to the operators.Now IOActive\u2019s researchers have revealed that a remote attacker can easily hijack a cobot. Cobots are industrial collaborative robots that share workspace with humans, who operate these robots. Cobots help in performing a variety of tasks and are quite advanced as they can see via built-in cameras, hear through microphones, learn new movements and execute repetitive tasks.However, once hijacked, the attacker can alter the settings of cobot leading to physical damage caused to nearby human operators. \u201cImagine what could happen if an attack targeted an array of 64 cobots as is found in a Chinese industrial corporation,\u201d said IOActive researchers.\u2018In the very near future robots will be everywhere, on military missions, performing surgery, building skyscrapers, assisting customers at stores, as healthcare attendants, as business assistants, and interacting closely with our families in a myriad of ways,\u2019 revealed the research paper published by IOActive titled \u2018Hacking Robots Before Skynet.\u2019\u2018Similar to other new technologies, we\u2019ve found robot technology to be insecure in a variety of ways, and that insecurity could pose serious threats to the people, animals, and organizations they operate in and around,\u2019 revealed the research.The focus of the latest research from IOActive was on most recent industrial models such as Baxter/Sawyer cobots from Rethink Robotics and Universal Robots\u2019 UR. A video providing details of their findings has also been uploaded by the IOActive team, which can be viewed below:In the video, Apa and Cerrudo demonstrated the way an attacker can chain six different vulnerabilities remotely for altering the safety settings or a UR robot. An attacker could disable emergency functions, and this would put human lives in danger.The Alpha 2 robot featured in the video (built by the Chinese firm UBTech Robotics) is seen attacking a tomato with a screwdriver. You would say that Alpha 2 is a home robot and isn\u2019t a very harmful machine, so the damage caused won\u2019t be much if nearby humans move a few foot away from it. However, IOActive states that it is only a matter of time when these home robots would also become an object of concern as far as security is concerned. The team also showed how bigger industrial robots such as the arms of the Alpha Robots, Pepper and SoftBank\u2019s Nao, which have been made by Universal Robotics, could be compromised and their security protocol can be overridden.More: Robots can be hacked, exploit to kill people, spy on military secretsThe team has provided details of every exploited flaw, and the video shows how the attacker can disable safety features of the cobot by compelling the robot\u2019s arm to malfunction. This proves that bigger industrial robots aren\u2019t immune to attacks at all. However, IOActive researchers claim that to pull off the compromising feat of these robots, attackers must have access to the robot\u2019s network, and they need to temper with it physically. In case they do manage to control the bots, the consequences would be disastrous.IOActive contacted some robot manufacturer firms regarding the new findings and steps have been taken to fix the flaws. Rethink Robots fixed the vulnerability back in February, but UR hasn\u2019t yet resolved the issues found in its robots.It is worth noting that IOActive isn\u2019t the first or only security firm that has researched upon industrial robots but Trend Micro researchers and the Polytechnic University of Milan have also published their research findings regarding the cybersecurity aspect of such robots. It is indeed worrisome that with just a little hacking tricks the attackers can cause skull fracture along with converting the robots into spies and malicious threat actors.According to IOActive, what\u2019s most troubling is that the size and strength of these robots are considerably high and when working with human operators they can cause \u201cskull fracture\u201d even if \u201crunning at low speeds\u201d due to the enormous force they can exert.Source: IOActive", "topics": ["AI", "Cyber Attack", "cyber war", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Robots", "Science", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Experts Show How Easy It Is To Hack Home & Industrial Robots Remotely", "date": "August 23, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "500 Android Apps on Google Play Store Secretly Compromised with Powerful SDK.Due to a malicious advertising SDK, Hundreds (approx. 500) of Android applications have been compromised to distribute spyware to unsuspecting users discreetly.

It propagates services that claim to leverage data related to people like their location, interests, occupation, and income, etc.Researchers at Lookout started investigating this SDK after they noticed communication between apps and servers that were known for distributing malware. A bit more research revealed that most of the requests from these infected apps were being made to an endpoint that in use by the Igexin ad SDK. Since this kind of traffic is often used by malware distributors who are expert at hiding their payloads within apps to make them look authentic, suspicion was raised within the LookOut fraternity.App developers stay unaware of the abuse of app permissions but the SDK because the function is not apparent on the onset; moreover, the attackers can modify the malicious code anytime.\u201cIt is likely many app developers were not aware of the personal information that could be exfiltrated from their customers\u2019 devices as a result of embedding Igexin\u2019s ad SDK. It required deep analysis of the apps\u2019 and ad SDK\u2019s behavior by our researchers to make this discovery. Not only is the functionality not immediately obvious, but it could also be altered at any time on the remote server,\u201d noted the research team.This means the most exploitative function of Igexin code is of log exfiltration. This enables hackers and attackers to exploit every type of user data. PhoneStateListener is also utilized by the apps, which is an authentic tool having the capability to record call logs. The compromised apps didn\u2019t indicate that they could record times of calls and numbers.The research team provided two examples of the infected apps on Google Play. One was SelfieCity, a photography app that has been downloaded 5 million times, and another app called LuckyCash that has over a million downloads so far.According to Lookout, Google was informed about the secret functionality of Igexin, and the company immediately removed the infected apps from the Play Store and uploaded their new, clean versions. The above mentioned two apps are also no more infected.Do not download unnecessary apps on your smartphoneLookOut states that other compromised apps included a weather app and a photo app both of which had one to five million downloads, a game that had more than 50 million downloads. There was an internet radio app as well that was downloaded about a million times. Some other apps available on Google Play Store such as health & fitness apps, emoji, home video cameras, educational and travel related apps were infected too.Although Google\u2019s prompt response has ensured that none of the new downloaders get victimized by malicious cyber criminals, the fact that more than 100 million android phone users have already downloaded these apps with spying capabilities is a cause of serious concern. Apparently, these users and their employers are at risk of being exploited. SDK\u2019s use to infect Android devices is a relatively new trend that lets threat actors to insert malware on devices through a seemingly clean and reliable app.Google is nonetheless, trying to keep its Play Store free from infected apps and this is why the company recently introduced a new solution to safeguard Android devices. It is called Google Play Protect, and its function is to scan the apps automatically before they are downloaded.More: 10 Powerful But Not Yet Promoted Antivirus for PC, Mac, Android, iPhoneSource: Lookout", "topics": ["Android", "app", "China", "Cyber Crime", "Google Play", "internet", "Malware", "Scam", "Smartphone", "Spyware", "Technology"], "title": "Hundreds of Android Apps on Google Play Store Infected with Spyware", "date": "August 23, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "In April 2015, it was reported that Eddie Raymond Tipton, a lottery computer programmer from Texas was arrested for hacking Lottery computers to win $14.3 million jackpot.Now, it is being reported that Tipton has been jailed for 25 years in prison for hacking and manipulating computer systems in three other States including Colorado, Iowa, and Wisconsin allowing him to win $2.2 million by picking up the winning numbers in six years long scam.Tipton, a former information security director of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), was arrested in 2015 and charged with two counts of fraud for attempting to illegally participate in the lottery, and attempting to use fraudulent means to claim prizes.MUSL provides Random number generation computer systems for lotteries almost all over the United States including U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.Tipton popped in a thumb drive into an extremely locked-down computer that generates the random numbers which determine the lottery winners.

Now, it turns out that a $500 device that can recover passcodes of not one or two but three iPhone 7 at the same time. Believe it or not but this American YouTuber has posted a video showing a device just the size of a phone retrieving the iPhone passcode in a jiffy.Called the iPhone Unlocker, the device has been produced in China, and the YouTuber probably bought it online. Wondering how it performs this humongous task?More: Textalyzer Device Tells Police Everything Users Do on Their SmartphoneIt doesn\u2019t bypass passcode, but the device enters the passcodes in sequence such as 0000, 0001, etc. it is worth noting that the device can try out passwords on at least three iPhones simultaneously. The process continues until the correct password is retrieved. The phone\u2019s reaction to the entered passcode serves as an indicator of passcode\u2019s accuracy. The code is noted from the device and entered into the phone when the lock screen is displayed.However, the trick seems unreal because let\u2019s face the fact; it is The iPhone\u2026 It is seemingly impossible to retrieve the correct passcode by continually trying out different combinations just because the phone doesn\u2019t allow too many wrong guesses. So how does it happen with the device?The video explains about it as well. It says that there are certain situations such as halfway through a firmware update when it is possible to try out passwords because the phone won\u2019t get locked after multiple wrong guesses. Believably the device exploits similar situations to keep on entering a series of numbers.However, the trick isn\u2019t as easy to pull off as you might be thinking because there are salient conditions without which the method won\u2019t work. For instance, it is important that you have recently changed your password. TechCrunch explains that the password must be changed at the last minute if you want to make unending guesses. Secondly, forcing the phone to run a firmware update is important to create a situation that would allow entering of passwords. Thirdly, the password must be brief.The device will try six passwords in a minute, and this means the guessing rate is much slower (twenty times slower according to TechCrunch) if you changed your password about ten minutes, ago.The video shows that three iPhones were cracked within 12 minutes but it was evident that the phones were deliberately configured with similar passcodes, that is, 0015, 0016 and 0012. The device started guessing the passcode from 0000 so guessing the correct passcode wasn\u2019t a big deal. Let\u2019s assume that you have a 6-digit password and you haven\u2019t changed your password in past few minutes then the gizmo trick is useless as it will keep entering codes for as long as ten years. The reason is that every extra digit will slow down the guessing time by a factor of 10. So, a seven digit password will take a few decades to be retrieved.This means, even someone steals your iPhone, this device trick will only work if your password is short and belongs to the list of easy-to-guess codes such as 123456, 5683 or 111111. Remember that the method works only on some models of iPhone 6 and 6s while it is fully compatible on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

Its key targets are Windows based systems, and it uses the EternalBlue exploit to gain access to the system and being a fileless malware it becomes relatively much easy to avoid detection.The Eternalblue vulnerability is the same that was used in the WannaCry ransomware back in May and in a mass ransomware campaign known as Petya, NotPetya, and GoldenEye which targeted European regions in June.According to the blog post from Trend Micro, the miner so far is affecting systems located in the Asia Pacific region while the major target countries include Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, and India. The research team identified the miner in July.Reportedly, the malware utilized a core component of Windows OS called the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). It is used for performing daily management tasks. The infection enters a system via EternalBlue vulnerability, as a backdoor on Windows OS and they install numerous WMI scripts. These scripts are then linked with the attacker\u2019s C&C server to receive further instructions and download the cryptocurrency miner malware.Microsoft has advised system administrators to limit and disable WMI to prevent the malware from infecting the system. It is not a difficult task since the company maintains that not every system needs the WMI service; so if WMI access is not needed it is better to disable it in order to eliminate the risk.A tool has also been provided by Microsoft that can trace WMI activity, and a quick guide on stopping the WMI service for good is also available. To further reduce the probability of infection the company advises to disable SMBv1 as well. A patch for the EternalBlue vulnerability has already been released in March 2017.Trend Micro stated that there are still a large number of systems that are at risk. It is, according to the security firm, important that users make sure \u201cthe operating system, software, and other applications are updated with the latest patches deters threats from using security gaps as their doorways into systems and networks.\u201dIt is indeed a reality that Fileless malware is a complicated threat because it makes it very difficult to detect and carry out forensic investigations. This is why nowadays, threat actors are producing fileless malware threats in large proportions.Users need to search the hard drive for the presence of malicious files, but even that isn\u2019t enough because you will only capture systems memory.

In the second phase, researchers noticed that the malicious chip could also exploit security flaws in the operating system kernel of a targeted device.According to the study: \u201cIn contrast to \u2018pluggable\u2019 drivers, such as USB or network drivers, the component driver\u2019s source code implicitly assumes that the component hardware is authentic and trustworthy. As a result of this trust, very few integrity checks are performed on the communications between the component and the device\u2019s main processor.\u201dThe biggest issue with this attack is that once the original screen is replaced with the malicious one, it is almost impossible to know the difference and since it\u2019s a file less attack it can evade anti-virus detection. That means an attacker with above average knowledge of smartphone hardware can easily target its victims without their knowledge.\u201cWe analyze the operation of a commonly used touchscreen controller. We construct two standalone attacks, based on malicious touchscreen hardware, that function as building blocks toward a full attack: a series of touch injection attacks that allow the touchscreen to impersonate the user and exfiltrate data, and a buffer overflow attack that lets the attacker execute privileged operations. Combining the two building blocks, we present and evaluate a series of end-to-end attacks that can severely compromise a stock Android phone with standard firmware. Our results make the case for a hardware-based physical countermeasure.\u201d researchers explained (Pdf).Although the research was conducted on Android devices, the researchers warned that iPhones could also be targeted with similar attacks. The researchers presented their findings during 2017 Usenix Workshop on Offensive Technologies.A well-motivated adversary may be fully capable of mounting such attacks in a large-scale or against specific targets.

The difference between both addresses is \u201ci\u201d and \u201cI\u201d or L instead of an I which is enough to target those unfamiliar with phishing pages.Furthermore, the fake site is a copy of the login page of Bittrex which again is helpful for cyber criminals to carry out their scam. Here are the screenshots of legit and phishing domains.The phishing website was first noticed by one of its victims \u201cTourpaul\u201d who wrote his experience on the social news service Steemit that he has fallen victim to a scam in which $2000 has been stolen.On Aug 15, 2017, my Bittrex account got hacked !! lost all my money, over 2grand!!! I figured out what happened! The hackers created a website that looks just like the real one! Login page looks exactly the same!! And they will get your password and authenticator code once you try to log in on their website! It all happens in less than five minutes! I try to contact Bittrex but so far didn\u2019t receive any reply! [\u2026]I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get my money back! The next day the fake website was gone! The website I spotted is \u201cwww.blttrex.com\u201d I\u2019m sure the hackers will create more fake website in the future so please be careful! Hope no one has to gone thru what happen to me, said Tourpaul.A topic was also being discussed on Reddit which also warns users of the fake website. However, by checking on who.is, it can be seen that the phishing domain is owned by \u201cSergey Valerievich Kireev\u201d from Russia. The data also shows owner\u2019s address, city, state, postal code, phone number and email address which can be used to track him quite easily.At the time of publishing this article, the fake domain was offline while Google Chrome browser was identifying the site as a phishing site. It\u2019s unclear if the domain has been taken down by its hosting company or the scammer has decided to take it down.Another phishing scam HackRead.com noticed was also reported by one of the users on Steemit. In this scam, the cyber criminals were actually using Google AdWords service to rank their site on the first page of Google.It may sound funny but the scam website was shown on top of the actual Bittrex website. Thank you, Google. However, at the time of publishing the article, this domain was also inactive.Here is a screenshot grabbed by the user:What users need to do is be vigilant and bookmark the official websites they visit, use password managers as they only auto fill saved login details for websites where users set it up.

This vulnerability is so extensive that it would need a generation of cars to be patched.As per the research team\u2019s findings, it is possible for an attacker to remotely or manually shut down different components of modern vehicles due to an inherent flaw. The components that could be targeted include safety systems like parking sensors, brakes, and airbags, etc. The \u2018Controller Area Network\u2019 or CAN protocol is affected by this embedded flaw. CAN protocol is commonly deployed in modern vehicles.More: Hacker unlocks vehicle for family who\u2019d lost keys months agoIts purpose is to initiate and manage communication between the internal components of a vehicle. The flaw is quite critical, but it is not a real vulnerability but a complexity noted in the standard design of CAN protocol. This design choice by the manufacturers has made it unpatchable. Bosch designed CAN protocol in 1983 and 1993 it became an ISO standard.According to researchers, to fix the flaw, it is important to make CAN protocol work at lowest levels. However, car makers cannot eliminate the flaw but can only mitigate the issue through network countermeasures. To eliminate the risk the only way is to update CAN standard and propose, adopt and implement it in modern cars, which would ideally take an \u201centire generation of vehicles\u201d for resolving the flaw. The issue cannot be fixed with an On-the-Air/OTA upgrade, claims Trend Micro\u2019s researcher Federico Maggi.\u201cIt is currently indefensible by modern car security technology, and to completely resolve it would require broad, sweeping changes in standards and the ways in-vehicle networks and devices are made,\u201d says Maggi.It is being speculated that the flaw is present in almost every modern vehicle because nearly all modern vehicles rely upon this protocol to interconnect components. The flaw is a denial-of-service attack, which can easily be exploited through local access by default. However, if any component of the vehicle contains a remotely-exploitable flaw, the CAN flaw will also be exploited by an attacker remotely.Attackers then would require a specially created device to connect to the CAN bus via local open ports. Frames already circulating in the CAN dictated the device reuses vicinity, and new frames are injected. This produces errors and initiates a denial-of-service attack in a number of components.Maggi explains the consequences of the attack: \u201cThis, in turn, can drastically affect the car\u2019s performance to the point that it becomes dangerous and even fatal, especially when essential systems like the airbag system or the antilock braking system are deactivated.\u201dMore: Car Hackers Remotely Steal Keyless BMW within SecondsThe flaw has been recognized by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s ICS-CERT despite that car manufacturers cannot do anything immediately to fix it. The only possible immediate solution is to restrict the access to input ports on vehicles specially OBD-II.In the long term, researchers recommend that standardization bodies, decision makers, and car manufacturers get together to revise and improve existing standards or issue new ones in tune with our times. The research was presented last month at the DIMVA conference in Bonn, Germany.

It is an already known threat, but cybercriminals have now modified it to steal credentials from nu-taxis, hotel room booking, flight booking and traffic ticket paying apps.According to the research team at Kaspersky Lab, due to the growing trend of mobile applications, a large number of different services is being offered to users through smartphones such as taxi services or ride-sharing. These services require provision of confidential financial data and bank card information, which is saved on the app. These apps, which are installed on \u201cmillions of Android devices worldwide,\u201d have become attractive targets for cyber criminals. That\u2019s why we are observing \u201cextended\u201d functionality of mobile banking Trojans.More: Thousands of Android Apps Infected with SonicSpy malware spying on usersThe modified Faketoken banking Trojan can track applications. When the user opens a specific app, the malware alters the interface and runs a fake, phishing window instead so that the bank account details could be stolen. It is worth noting that this Trojan has almost identical interface bearing similar color schemes and logos that create a completely invisible overlay almost instantly.Kaspersky Lab has noted that the current favorite of cyber criminals is the taxi-like apps and the most popular services in this category are being targeted nowadays such as Uber. The threats are various, such as \u201cthe malware and that infected users face SMS message redirection for password intervention and the threat of having all their comms recorded and sent off for bad purposes\u201d to name a few. The malware is designed not just to steal banking credentials but also to spy on SMS messages and monitor phone calls.It is a known fact that banking industry has always remained the prospective target of fraud schemes and other scams, but the targeting of a taxi or ride-sharing services is relatively new. This hints at the fact that cyber criminals are trying to expand their domain and spread their range to other, unconventional areas apart from strictly financial apps. This calls for enhanced security of the apps by their owners and developers to ensure users\u2019 protection.A security expert at Kaspersky Lab Viktor Chebyshev states: \u201cPrevious response involved the implementation of security technologies in apps that significantly reduced the risk of theft of critical financial data. Perhaps now it is time for other services that are working with financial data to follow suit.\u201dFaketoken currently is limited to Russian and ex-Soviet countries\u2019 users, but the scope can be broadened in the future quite easily as was evident with the previous versions of Faketoken and similar banking malware. Its previous version was capable of stealing 2FA codes by intercepting text messages, but this new version is distributed through bulk SMS text messages.Victims are then asked to download some images and when they do that the malware gets installed and hides its icon to covertly change the overlay of banking and other applications installed on the Android device. The malware can perform this trick on all sorts of apps may these be at Android Pay or Google Play Store. When the credentials are stolen, the attacker gets hold of them and can perform identity theft or bank fraud easily.More: 10 Powerful But Not Yet Promoted Antivirus for PC, Mac, Android, iPhoneAccording to Kaspersky researchers: \u201cTo this day we still have not registered a large number of attacks with the Faketoken sample, and we are inclined to believe that this is one of its test versions. According to the list of attacked applications, the Russian UI of the overlays, and the Russian language in the code, Faketoken.q is focused on attacking users from Russia and CIS countries.\u201dAs is the norm, security experts suggest that users of Android smartphones must only install apps from official Google Play Store and ignore third-party app sources.

Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering research team has concluded that it is possible to use music for tracking body movements. This means hackers and emissaries may not need specific surveillance equipment for tracking our movements or location.This is achieved through exploiting the smartphone\u2019s speakers and microphones; these can be turned into surveillance tools for collecting information about the movements and body position of any nearby person or the phone\u2019s user. The findings will be presented in September at the Ubicomp 2017. Researchers claim that by hijacking smart devices remotely and set them to function in a way that these play music with repeating pulses it is possible to track the position, body movements and actions of anyone using the device.More: Malware can Convert your Headphones into Microphone for HackersUW\u2019s research team identified that CovertBand software could be used to transform harmless smart devices into active sonar systems since the software can exploit built-in speakers and microphones and can be controlled remotely.Perhaps this is the very first time any researcher has showed that it is possible to convert smartphones, smart TVs, and other smart devices into spying tools through music. According to Shyam Gollakota, associate professor at the UW computer science and engineering school and senior author, \u201cthe physical information CovertBand can gather \u2014 even through walls \u2014 is sufficiently detailed for an attacker to know what the user is doing, as well as other people nearby.\u201dBut how can CovertBand track body movements? This is possible because it uses the active sonar principles to collect information. Active sonar systems can be found on submarines and are installed to identify the position of an object through sending out acoustic pulse. When the sound waves hit the objects in their path a deflection effect is created which is then picked up by a receiver. This is how the position, shape, and distance of an object is determined.CovertBand can use a smart device\u2019s speaker to send out the repeating pulse of sound waves, which happen to be in 18 to 20 kHz range. Just like the sonar system on a submarine, the sound waves encounter objects that come in their path and get reflected as a result; the built-in microphones collect the sound waves\u2019 reflection.The information is transferred to the attacker who can be residing at an entirely different corner of the world or a few feet distance. As per the findings of the research team, the technology can detect a variety of movements including \u201carm-pumping, walking or pelvic tilts to a range of up to six meters from the smartphone\u201d while CovertBand developers say that movements can be identified much quickly with sufficient data and machine-learning algorithms.The purpose of this study was to determine the flaws in the everyday use smart devices, and the findings have been published in an official press release. It is claimed that CovertBand can track movement right across the wall, which is rather alarming because even your neighbors can use music to spy on you. It would become tough to understand if someone is listening to music or carrying out a surveillance act.Researchers believe that jamming signals, sound-proofing or disabling the speaker and microphone of the device can help to some extent but these options aren\u2019t very realistic. They have urged that scientists develop countermeasures that are much more practical.

At that time we assumed it to be a mistake on the developer\u2019s part and brushed off the likelihood of another such incident. However, we have been proven wrong since Proofpoint security researchers are claiming that at least seven more Chrome extensions are infected.Researchers state that attacker got hold of Google Account credentials through phish scam and managed to compromise seven widely downloaded extensions, which has put so many users at risk of credentials theft and traffic hijacking.In their blog post, Proofpoint researchers exposed the names of compromised Chrome extensions:\u201cWe specifically examined the \u201cWeb Developer 0.4.9\u201d extension compromise, but found evidence that \u201cChrometana 1.1.3\u201d, \u201cInfinity New Tab 3.12.3\u201d [8][10], \u201cCopyFish 2.8.5\u201d [9], \u201cWeb Paint 1.2.1\u201d [11], and \u201cSocial Fixer 20.1.1\u201d [12] were modified using the same modus operandi by the same actor. We believe that the Chrome Extensions TouchVPN and Betternet VPN were also compromised in the same way at the end of June,\u201d read the blog post.This means cyber criminals and spammers are endlessly searching for novel ways to drive traffic to their partners\u2019 programs and post malicious, unwanted ads on victims\u2019 browsers. The attacks were noted at the end of July and at the beginning of August. After the hackers obtained developer\u2019s credentials, they were able to publish \u201cmalicious versions of legitimate extensions,\u201d stated Proofpoint researchers.Just like the methodology adopted to infect Copyfish extension, cyber criminals deceived extension coders to give away Google Account credentials, which were used to access Google developer accounts. These accounts were linked to certain Chrome extensions; once access was established the hackers modified them with malicious code and compromised Google developer accounts.Proofpoint research team explained that the infected extension could substitute advertisements on the victims\u2019 browsers, hijack incoming traffic from authentic ad networks and trick victims into repairing their computer systems by presenting fake JavaScript alerts. Adult websites were singled out when substituting ads while much focus was laid on an unnamed ad network.\u201c(The) malvertising chain that brings users from the fake alert to an affiliate site; we observed the compromised extension directing victims to two such affiliates, although others may also have been used,\u201d revealed Proofpoint blog post.The affiliate landing pages \u201cbrowser-update[.]info, Browser-Update[.]info and searchtab[.]win\u201d depicted substantial traffic; such as 920,000 visits were recorded for searchtab[.]win in a month.

Moreover, the hacker is in his mid-20s and is a Nigerian national who used phishing and malware infection to compromise over 4,000 computers.The huge scale of the attacks suggests that the hacker had access to extensive resources, but that is not the case. Despite having poor operational security, he was successful in hacking into the networks of 14 organizations, but that\u2019s also the reason why researchers were able to detect and monitor his actions.The hacker used a remote access Trojan called NetWire and a keylogger called Hawkeye to steal login details and financial information from targeted organizations. The RAT was used to gain control of infected systems while the keylogging program helped in stealing the login credentials.It is worth noting that the attacks were directed towards the financial staff employed in different sectors and regions. For instance, the Middle East and Europe based energy andtransportation firms were attacked through phishing. The attacker sent an email that appeared to be sent by Saudi Aramco, a noteworthy oil, and gas firm. Email addresses from Yahoo domains were used, and the hacker didn\u2019t even try to hide the addresses from being identified, which security experts\u2019 claim was an amateurish act.His targets included a transportation company in Abu Dhabi, an energy company in Croatia, Egypt based mining firm, Dubai based construction company, another construction firm in Germany and an oil & gas firm in Kuwait.The campaign was launched in April 2017, but the activities of the hacker were identified after he had claimed several targets. A series of suspicious emails were detected, which were Phishing scams. The emails were pretty unconvincing as these contained spelling mistakes and generic subjects. The recipient was referred to as Sir or Ms. Recipient was asked to download an attachment, which asked for enabling macro and installed two different types of malware.The name of the hacker hasn\u2019t been revealed by CheckPoint but the company did acknowledge that he lives somewhere near the capital city in Nigeria. The security firm is helping local law enforcement for locating the cyber criminal.The revelations point out a key factor that phishing still remains a major threat to businesses around the world; in this campaign, the hacker tricked the firm\u2019s financial staff to give away bank details of the firm. Since Saudi Aramco is among the world\u2019s top exporters of natural gas and crude oil, use of its name in the email was enough to attract the victim. Through his \u201ccrude and unsophisticated\u201d phish campaign, the Nigerian hacker managed to make thousands of dollars but the exact figure hasn\u2019t been disclosed as yet.\u201cEven though this individual is using low-quality phishing emails, and generic malware which is easy to find online, his campaign has still been able to infect several organizations. It shows just how easy it is for a relatively unskilled hacker to launch a large-scale campaign that successfully breaches the defenses of even large companies, enabling them to commit fraud,\u201d said Horowitz.Researchers urge that organizations need to educate employees regarding security etiquettes as they must remain cautious in opening emails even if these seem to be sent by legit companies or individuals.", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Nigeria", "Phishing", "Privacy", "security"], "title": "Nigerian Man Hacked Thousands of Global Oil & Gas and Energy Firms", "date": "August 16, 2017"}, {"authur": "Carolina", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});HBO accidentally aires upcoming Episode 6 of Game of Thrones; now it\u2019s all over the Internet.It looks like trouble finds the media giant Home Box Office (HBO) before anything else.

Where there are hackers eager to use their skills for wrong purposes and we have this hacker who made sure he utilized his skills to help a family in need.News has come out revealing that a hacker whose name is still unknown helped a family regain access to their Toyota Estima family wagon the key to which the family lost while dining at a restaurant while traveling to Victoria, Canada back in June 2016.The family, John and Maria Higgins, were traveling with their two kids when the key got lost putting them in a position that no one wants to face. You may be thinking people lose their car keys all the time so what is so special about this key? Well, in this case, the key was one-of-a-kind key with no duplicate anywhere in the world except Japan since the car was imported from there.Disappointed with the situation, the Higgins posted about the situation on Facebook and announced a reward of $500 for anyone who can find and return the keys. It must be noted that Toyota Japan has the replacement key, however, the company wasn\u2019t willing to send it all the way to Canada for obvious reasons.\u201cI understand that if they helped every person out there who lost a key to a minivan, they would do nothing else, but to string us along for seven weeks saying [maybe] is tough. It would have been nice to know [they wouldn\u2019t help] seven weeks ago,\u201d Higgins told Victoria based the Times Colonist.In a Facebook post, John explained the importance and specialty of the key in following words: \u201cWhat was picked up is the only three-button RFID transmitter key in existence on this continent for our van. This vehicle is a Japanese import with a sophisticated Immobilizer, and the key has a chip in it that can\u2019t be duplicated by North American Toyota dealers. I bought the vehicle a month ago from a dealer on the mainland who led me to believe they would be receiving another key for it from Japan in the few weeks following our purchase. This was not the case; as the manager just informed me, most cars sold by auction in Japan come with only one key, and they haven\u2019t gotten anything else from the auction since.\u201dBut, there was no response from anyone until after two months when a hacker contacted the Higgins family willing to help and get them out of the situation. The hacker then hacked into the car\u2019s onboard Immobilizer computer, found the chip on the circuit board which stored the key codes and reprogramed the codes so they can work with new keys.It took $5,000 for the family to regain access to their car but due to the generosity of Burnaby based Velocity motors, (the company who imported the car from Japan) the Higgins had to pay only half of the amount while Velocity paid the other half.\u201cIt was like disassembling the space shuttle \u2014 there was miles of wires. It\u2019s more computer than car,\u201d said Higgins.It is indeed good news for the Higgins family, but at the same time, it leaves a big question mark over the security of smart cars as this time it was a good guy doing a good deed but what will happen when bad guys work out how to hack this or other cars like this? Remember, about four months ago, a gang was seen remotely stealing a keyless BMW within seconds in the United Kingdom. While in June this year, a biker gang was caught hacking and stealing 150 Jeep Wranglers.It is time for smart cars manufacturers to come up with proper security measures so owners can spend their time driving the vehicle rather than hiring specialists to hack or unhack it.", "topics": ["Car", "hackers", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "security", "Technology", "Vehicle"], "title": "Hacker unlocks vehicle for family who\u2019d lost keys months ago", "date": "August 16, 2017"}, {"authur": "Agan Uzunovic", "body": "The web servers of Blizzard Entertainment have suffered a series of massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks over the weekend causing disconnection and latency issues in Blizzard Games including World of Warcraft and Overwatch.The attacks started hitting Blizzard on August 13th when the company\u2019s official customer support Twitter account stated that \u201cWe\u2019re currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers, which may result in failed or slow login attempts.\u201dWe're currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers, which may result in failed or slow login attempts. #BlizzCS\u2014 BlizzardCS (@BlizzardCS) August 13, 2017After few minutes, in another Tweet, the company said: \u201cWe are currently monitoring a DDOS attack against network providers which is affecting latency/connections to our games.\u201dWe are currently monitoring a DDOS attack against network providers which is affecting latency/connections to our games. #BlizzCS\u2014 BlizzardCS (@BlizzardCS) August 13, 2017Furthermore, the attack also crippled Paypal payment option for Blizzard. \u201cWe are currently experiencing issues with Paypal as a payment option.

On the day of his departure back to London, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested him and accused him of developing the Kronos malware. However, Hutchins\u2019s attorney Adrian Lobo rubbished all charges and told media that her client had got the bail for $30,000 on conditions that he will not access the Internet, he will not leave the country and must use a GPS monitor. Lobo also stated that Hutchins would plead not guilty.If found guilty, Hutchins can face a 40-year prison sentence. However, on Monday, Hutchins appeared at a federal court in Wisconsin where not only did he not plead guilty but also argued why he should be allowed to use the Internet. Apparently, Hutchins\u2019s arguments were strong enough for the judge who allowed him to use the Internet on one condition that he will not access the \u201ckill switch\u201d for WannaCry ransomware which halted the infection from spreading.

Reportedly, there is a vulnerability in the Windows Object Linking, and Embedding (OLE) interface that can be exploited to avoid detection by antivirus software. Malicious threat actors are using the OLE interface flaw to distribute infected Microsoft Office documents.According to Trend Micro\u2019s cyber security experts, this flaw can help in delivering RTF/Rich Text File documents, but attackers can also use it to compromise PowerPoint slide show documents. This is a unique way to exploit a flaw.Related: Malware that infects users without needing to click anythingThe attack is launched as a spear-phishing email. Researchers have provided a sample email in which the attachment is named as PO-483848.ppsx. The email is disguised as an order request from a cable manufacturing provider. The common targets of this campaign are electronics firms. The sender\u2019s address appears as a message sent by a business partner. The recipient is asked to check the order and quote CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) along with FOB (free on board) prices.The malicious attachment supposedly contains shipping information, but it is harboring a malicious slide show document. When this file is opened, it shows the text \u2018CVE-2017-8570,\u2019 which refers to another of Microsoft vulnerability. This infected file triggers an exploit for the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability to start the infection process.The malicious code is executed through the animations feature on the PowerPoint Show. If the process meets success, it downloads a file named logo.doc containing JavaScript and XML code. Afterward, PowerShell is run to execute another file titled RATMAN.EXE. This file is a malicious version of the Remcos remote access tool. Connection with the malware\u2019s C&C server is then established.Remcos can carry out a variety of criminal operations on the compromised system such as screen capturing, keylogging, recording of audio and video via webcam and microphone and downloading/execution of other malware. The attacker manages to gain full control of the system. All this while, the victim remains unaware.Researchers identified the use of NET protector in the attack after examining the sample attack. NET protector has various layers of protections that can help in making the process of reverse engineering extremely complex for researchers. This shows the attackers are quite skilled and experienced cybercriminals have launched the campaign not some newcomers.It is also worth noting that a majority of the methods that detect CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability are RTF attack based. This is probably the first time attackers have used PPSX PowerPoint as the main attack vector, which hints at the fact that attackers can code malware to avoid detection from an antivirus.To address the flaw, Microsoft already released a patch in April so if you have updated your system, you are likely to remain safe from the malware campaign. Still, it is important to remain alerted and never to open emails from unknown or unverified sources. Users need to open or check files cautiously even the source seems legitimate because spear phishing attempts are becoming more and more sophisticated.Trend Micro researchers Ronnie Giagone and Rubio Wu state that organizations can defend themselves by educating their staff. Since businesses are the key targets of this new malware campaign, therefore, employees need to play a significant role in thwarting the attacks.

However, according to LookOut\u2019s cyber security researchers, in the past six months, over a thousand applications have been infected with spyware, and some of them are being distributed through Google Play. These infected applications are part of malware family called SonicSpy, which includes support for about 73 different remote instructions.The deployment of infection started in February 2017. The perpetrators of this cyber crime are based in Iraq since the account behind one of the infected Android apps Soniac was identified as iraqwebservice. It is the same account from where two other SonicSpy samples were posted on Play Store.LookOut\u2019s team found an app called Soniac available on Google Play, which appeared to be a harmless version of Telegram messaging app but it also included malicious mechanisms. When an infected app is installed on a device, the cybercriminal behind the scheme immediately receives considerable control over it.Out of the 73 supports, some are identified in Soniac. Once the control is gained, the author of the threat can perform a variety of tasks such as discreetly recording audio, capture images/photos through the camera, send text messages to desired numbers, make outbound calls and extract information like contacts, call logs and Wi-Fi access points related info.When installed, SonicSpy removes its launcher image and hides so that the victim is unable to realize that the device has been infected.

Research suggests that to achieve their malicious objectives they are using a highly powerful NSA hacking tool EternalBlue (6) leaked by Shadow Brokers (7).Cybersecurity firm FireEye\u2019s research team has identified that Fancy Bear have been running an espionage campaign via Wi-Fi networks and to upgrade their attacks they are using a leaked NSA hacking tool.APT28 attacked unsuspecting guests by hacking the Wi-Fi networks of the hotels across Europe. The scheme, claims FireEye, has links with Russian Military Intelligence service called GRU. The hacking group has now started using the EternalBlue to expand their control on hotel networks. It is worth noting that the group already has gained a foothold through various techniques like phishing.Researchers Lindsay Smith and Ben Read stated in an official blog post that:\u201cA campaign targeting the hospitality sector is attributed to Russian actor APT28. We believe this activity, which dates back to at least July 2017, was intended to target travelers to hotels throughout Europe and the Middle East. The actor has used several notable techniques in these incidents such as sniffing passwords from Wi-Fi traffic, poisoning the NetBIOS Name Service, and spreading laterally via the EternalBlue exploit.\u201dAll this is being done to control the Wi-Fi network of a hotel where their targeted personality is staying as a guest. The hackers use acquired access to the network to steal important, sensitive information like username and passwords from the victim\u2019s network silently. They have used a unique method for obtaining sensitive data in which they did even need the user to type their credentials while using the hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi network.FireEye\u2019s espionage research group head Ben Read states that the technique is a new one; it is a lot more passive way to spy on people and collect credentials. According to Read, the company got a hint of targeting of customers in European hotels during last fall when a corporate employee\u2019s computer was intruded.The victim\u2019s computer was infected through a hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi network, and 12 hours later, when the employee connected to that network it was learned that someone else had already connected to the same network using the credentials of the victim. The attacker logged in to the victim\u2019s computer and installed malware to access Outlook data. Apparently, the hacker was spying upon the hotel\u2019s network already probably he had an idea of the victim visiting that hotel or attacker was tracking the victim since long. The purpose of spying and tracking was to steal victim\u2019s credentials.Later on, FireEye identified a series of similar attacks using wireless networks of hotels across one Middle Eastern capital and 7 European capitals. All the attacks were similar since the hotel\u2019s network was compromised initially through phishing emails that carried infected attachments including infected Microsoft Word Macros.The network was used to launch EternalBlue, which was part of a huge collection of internal data belonging to NSA leaked earlier this year by ShadowBrokers. EternalBlue helped the hackers in spreading their control across the entire network of the hotel rather quickly. This was made possible by a flaw in Server Message Block protocol of Microsoft (SMB). Attackers finally managed to access the corporate and guest Wi-Fi networks\u2019 servers.Using the Responder, another hacking tool, attackers were able to monitor traffic on these networks and trick computers that were connected to these compromised networks into giving away victim\u2019s credentials without any trace. When the victim tried to use Printers or Shared Folders, Responder used a fake authentication process to fool the computer, and this is how attackers managed to get the username and password. The obtained password is in crack-able cryptographically hashed form.FireEye noticed that the hacked networks were mostly of moderately high-end hotels where high-profile personalities might want to stay. Read explained:\u201cThese were not super expensive places, but also not the Holiday Inn. They\u2019re the type of hotel a distinguished visitor would stay in when they\u2019re on corporate travel or diplomatic business.\u201dFireEye perhaps is moderately convinced that Fancy Bear is the real perpetrator of the attack on hotels in 2016 and the recent ones because the two malware GameFish and XTunnel used to attack the hotels\u2019 Wi-Fi networks are associated with Fancy Bear. Furthermore, the C&C infrastructure of the 2016 attacks and latest ones is also similar.The cyber security firm also believed that Fancy Bear\u2019s use of EternalBlue malware represents that Russian hackers are now accessing NSA hacking tricks and that the group is continually improving its intrusion techniques. EternalBlue is a powerful hacking tool that performs computer intrusion silently.FireEye has noted that business and government personnel traveling within or outside their country are key targets of Fancy Bear hackers. That\u2019s because these travelers rely upon systems to carry out business outside the home office and are usually unfamiliar with threats they might face abroad. As of now, FireEye has only released information about the series of hack attacks and subsequent data breaches, but the research team hasn\u2019t yet clarified the extent of success of this campaign from APT28.

Accounting firms are at a heightened risk for cyber attacks because they hold large amounts of their clients\u2019 personal and financial data, they are privy to confidential corporate information that has immense value to cyber attackers, and they typically have fewer layers of cyber protection to guard against theft of that information than the sources of that information. These elements combine to create a perfect storm of cyber attack exposure that can leave accountants as the losers in any ultimate showdown.Related: Privacy and The Digital WorldA California CPA firm discovered this the hard way in August 2016 when it discovered that hackers had breached its data systems and filed 45 fraudulent tax returns using their clients\u2019 data. The firm contacted those of its clients that might have been affected and implemented whatever procedures it could to limit the damage, including offering complimentary credit monitoring services to those clients.The firm did not announce what costs and expenses it incurred as a result of this event. Between actual expenditures and costs associated with reputational losses, experts estimate that in 2016, a data breach cost an average of $221 per compromised record. At that rate, the firm would have lost almost $10,000 as a result of the hack. That might not be a significant number to a larger CPA firm, but that magnitude of loss can impact the viability of many smaller CPA firms.Rather than waiting for the showdown to come to them, CPA firms can take affirmative steps to protect themselves and their clients\u2019 data to minimize or even eliminate the prospects of these types of losses. Some of the more common recommendations include:1 Start at the top: If a CPA firm\u2019s senior accountants and managers do not demonstrate a commitment to implement cyber security measures, the rest of the firm will likely not follow suit.2 Make cyber security awareness a regular topic: Like all professionals, accountants are charged with staying on top of new industry developments that affect how they manage their clients\u2019 finances. Cybersecurity should be an integral part of an accountant\u2019s continuing professional education efforts.3 Periodically test the system: An accounting firm\u2019s employees will more likely adhere to cyber security requirements if they know that their compliance will be periodically tested. Rather than just implementing a cyber protection policy, enact measures to confirm that it is being followed.4 Keep software and systems updated: Cyberattackers rely on flaws in operating systems that become publicized on hacker bulletin boards and across the Dark Web. Software developers issue patches and updates to close those flaws. CPA firms should take steps to ensure that all patches and updates are installed on their networks, computers, and mobile devices.5 Enhance network login requirements and encryption: CPA firms should implement dual-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption to improve their technology defenses against cyber attacks.The best laid and most robust cyber defense strategies will raise the bar against a successful hacking attack, but it will not entirely prevent them. When an attack does succeed in breaching a CPA firm\u2019s cyber defenses, cyber insurance for accountants can limit or eliminate the direct and third party losses that the accounting firm might face.Related: 3 Ways Corporations are Keeping Track of Data BreachesRoughly two-thirds of the average $221 cost per compromised record comes from reputational and client confidence losses that occur when an accounting firm\u2019s data and network are breached. An accounting firm that carries cyber insurance will send a message to its clients that it takes their data security seriously and that it is taking all precautions to prevent a breach and to recover from a breach if one does occur. Thus, cyber insurance for accountants provides assurances that losses will not strangle the firm and that the firm\u2019s reputation and very existence will survive any showdown with hackers.", "topics": ["Banking", "breach", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "hackers", "hacking", "internet", "Money", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "The Showdown: Hackers vs. Accountants", "date": "August 12, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "In April 2017, it was reported that the US Department of Defence (DoD) announced launching \u201cHack the Air Force\u201d bug bounty program urging hackers and security researchers to hack the United Airforce and make some big bucks.Now, it turned out that Jack Cable, a 17-years-old kid and a high school student made it to the top by hacking and identifying 30 critical vulnerabilities in the Air Force\u2019s cyber infrastructure. As a result, he took a huge sum of cash with The Pentagon paying $130,000 in prizes and $1,000 and $5,000 for each vulnerability.\u201cTwo participants in the program were active duty military personnel and 33 participants came from outside the U.S. Top participating hackers were under 20 years old, including a 17-year-old who submitted 30 valid reports and earned the largest bounty sum during the challenge window,\u201d Air Force said in a statement.In an interview with Marketplace, Cable said that he found an XML external entities vulnerability. \u201cI found that I could give it a URL and the application would make a request to that website. And I was able to escalate that after working on it for a few hours into a remote code execution. So that would allow me to basically do whatever I wanted. So I could access all the user data that was on the website and I could change anything that I wanted to.\u201dThe bug bounty program was run by HackerOne platform from May 30 to June 23 and some 272 hackers from all over the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom participated.

The reason behind ShapeShift\u2019s involvement in the investigation is that Bitcoin withdrawn for the ransomware were exchanged for Monero on this platform.While speaking with O\u2019Neil, Alberti Ornaghi, the chief technology officer at Neutrino, stated that $20,000 was withdrawn from a bitcoin wallet that was linked with the WannaCry ransomware. ShapeShift got alerted almost immediately as the funds moved and the company\u2019s legal team announced that by using their platform WannaCry distributors have breached their terms of services. The team also emphasized upon cooperating with the law enforcement for tracking the transactions made by the ransomware distributors.ShapeShift is the most popular and recognized instant digital asset exchange service in the cryptocurrency industry. It is also believed to be the most efficient private exchange that facilitates altcoins or alternative cryptocurrencies since it doesn\u2019t require users to present personal or financial information while using ShapeShift for digital trading currencies.In an official statement, ShapeShift\u2019s team stated that the company has already taken necessary steps to \u201cblacklist\u201d all the addresses that the team believes are linked with the WannaCry attackers. The statement read:\u201cAs is our policy for any transactions we deem breach our terms of service. We are closely watching the situation as it continues to unfold as to block any further addresses associated.\u201dVarious Bitcoin experts, privacy advocates like TDevD and Samourai Wallet developer Crud have criticized ShapeShift\u2019s decision to cooperate with the law enforcement and create blacklists on a service that inherently is privacy-oriented. Crud said:Shapeshift working with authorities and creating blacklists. Just beautiful. #fungibility #bitcoin https://t.co/AQgoQGTNKk\u2014 TDevD aka \"Crud\" (@SamouraiDev) August 4, 2017Conversely, some claim that the decision is ironic and hypocritical because ShapeShift is among the few companies that stopped their services in New York State when BitLicense was implemented. BitLicense required cryptocurrency firms to integrate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems.It is indeed true that ShapeShift took a difficult decision. Eric Voorhees, the team head at ShapeShift, tried to offer privacy and financial autonomy to users since the time the service was launched. But, Voorhees cannot be blamed for the decision because if ShapeShift hadn\u2019t agreed to cooperate, there would have been a legal conflict between the law enforcement and ShapeShift. However, ShapeShift has revealed that the service ensures \u201c100 percent transparent\u201d transactions, which makes money laundering of \u201cdigital tokens impossible.\u201dUntil now it isn\u2019t clear if the team at ShapeShift and law enforcement can trace down the Monero transactions because the cryptocurrency used to launder the funds from WannaCry ransomware are characteristically anonymous.\u201cYou cannot track a Monero address.

This information exposure is attributed to electronic crosstalk, which the team referred to as \u201cchannel-to-channel crosstalk,\u201d between the linked components.Researchers tested 50 computers and external USBs, and it was learned that 90 percent of them leaked sensitive information such as keystrokes to another external USB drive.

They have regarded external USB drives as \u201cvulnerable\u201d devices that cause \u201cinformation leakage.\u201dRelated: 8 Technologies That Can Hack Into Your Offline Computer and PhoneThe study has raised concerns over the reliability of external devices. According to Dr. Yarom USB-connected devices such as \u201ckeyboards, card swipers and fingerprint readers\u201d usually send sensitive information to computers and their research verified the notion that if an infected or tampered device is plugged into adjacent ports of the same internal USB hub or external USB drive, then this would result in leakage of sensitive information. The information that can be exposed include keystrokes, which is rather alarming as it would give away passwords and private data to threat actors.Researchers have compared the data leak with water leakage from pipes and state that voltage fluctuations on data lines of the USB ports can be easily monitored from the adjacent ports.\u201cElectricity flows like water along pipes \u2013 and it can leak out.

They added that since these devices are so commonly used and users never give attention to the possibility of USB sticks being tampered might lead to exposing their private data to any computer around the globe through SMS or Bluetooth.Dr. Yarom stated that it is important to redesign USB connections to ensure optimal security and data must also be encrypted before being sent to another device through USBs.

This time, the whistleblowing platform has leaked the \u201cUser Guide for the CoachPotato project\u201d of the agency work of which is to hack and obtain RTSP/H.264 video streams and still images remotely.The project CouchPotato is different from Dumbo project details of which were released by WikiLeaks according to which CIA needs physical access to hack webcams on a targeted device. But in CouchPotato\u2019s case, everything is done remotely.According to the leaked documents:\u201cCouchPotato is a remote tool for collection against RTSP/H.264 video streams. It provides the ability to collect either the stream as a video file (AVI) or capture still images (JPG) of frames from the stream that is of significant change from a previously captured frame. CouchPotato utilizes FFmpeg for video and image encoding and decoding as well as RTSP connectivity. In order to minimize the size of the DLL binary, many of the audio and video codecs along with other unnecessary features have been removed from the version of FFmpeg that CouchPotato is built with. pHash, an image hashing algorithm, has been incorporated into FFmpeg\u2019s image2 demuxer to provide image change detection capabilities. CouchPotato relies on being launched in an ICE v3 Fire and Collect compatible loader.\u201dA look at CouchPotato\u2019s 11 pages user guide shows it is dated back to February 2014 and utilizes FFmpeg software. It is a free software project that produces libraries and programs for handling multimedia data. The agency uses the software for video and image encoding and decoding as well as RTSP connectivity.The documents only detail about version CouchPotato 1.0, therefore, it is unclear if there is a version 2 out there or not. However, it uses a massive amount of CPU from a targeted device making the victim somewhat suspicious.According to the user guide\u2019s page 11:\u201cCPU usage of the process that CouchPotato is injected into can potentially be high depending on the number CPUs/Cores available.

Mamba (a large, agile, highly venomous African snake in real life) was so dangerous that it encrypted the entire hard drive, not just a few files. This Windows based malware was infecting computers in the US, India, and Brazil. It was among the first ransomware samples that encrypted hard drive and launched attacks against organizations including the high profile ransomware attack on SFMTA (San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency).Kaspersky Lab researchers have identified the reemergence of Mamba infection in Brazil and Saudi Arabia. This means, the attackers are now disguising sabotage in ransomware, which isn\u2019t a new practice at all since attackers used the same strategy in Petya and Mischa in 2016. However, the attacks met an unprecedented rise in 2017 with the emergence of ExPetr/NotPetya wiper malware attacks.The perpetrators of the new wave of Mamba ransomware are yet unknown; at the moment it is unclear whether a criminal gang is behind the attacks or a nation-state sponsoring them.Mamba is quite different from ExPetr/NotPetya attacks since victims cannot recover their computer systems. ExPetr uses a randomly generated key for encrypting the targeted system and does not save the key for decryption later, therefore, it can be called a Wiper, explained Kaspersky Lab researcher Orkhan Memedov.Currently, Mamba is targeting users in Brazil and Saudi ArabiaConversely, Mamba passes the key to the Trojan as a command line argument, which means the attacker possesses the key and can decrypt the machine. When the malware infects a Windows based machine, the Trojan overwrites the Master Boot Record through a custom MBR and encrypts the hard drive. This is achieved through an open source full disk encryption utility, which is known as DiskCryptor.Kaspersky Lab has also published a ransom note which proves that unlike original Mamba infections the latest wave of malware does not demand money but only encrypts data and sends two email addresses along with an ID number for recovering the encryption key. There is no way for data decrypting because DiskCryptor is a legitimate utility that uses extremely strong encryption algorithms.Kaspersky Lab report suggests that the perpetrators behind newest Mamba attacks in Saudi Arabia and Brazil utilize PSEXEC utility for execution of the malware across the corporate network, which is the same utility used in ExPetr malware attacks. The attacks are also quite similar to the Petya attacks. The bottom line is that the purpose behind the latest attacks is destruction and not profit because the malware\u2019s functioning is faulty and victims cannot recover files. The actual purpose is to wipe out data stored on the hard drives of targeted computers.Kaspersky Lab states that the attacks occur in two stages, in the first stage DiskCryptor is stored into a folder created and installed by the malware. A system service dubbed as DefragmentService is also registered to ensure persistence. The targeted machine is then rebooted. The second stage creates the new bootloader, and in this stage, disk partitions are encrypted through DiskCryptor. The system is then booted again.The report further explained that for every machine on the targeted network a password is generated by the threat actor for DiskCryptor utility. The password is then passed through the command line arguments to reach ransomware dropper.To protect yourself from Mamba and other ransomware attacks, check our exclusive and in-depth \u201cHow To\u201d on tackling such threats.

According to the research team, it is indeed possible to insert malicious malware into the physical DNA strands. The data resulting from the malware corrupts gene-sequencing process and gains full control of the underlying computer.Tadayoshi Kohno (1) and Paul G Allen (2) led the research that is being termed as the first ever \u201cDNA-based exploit of a computer system.\u201d The scientists created the malware to be incorporated into the genetic molecule.More: Microsoft Planning to Use DNA for Data StorageKohno, Allen and Luis Ceze along with others performed the hack by encoding malicious program in a tiny DNA stretch, which they bought online for $89, and used it to control a computer that was processing genetic data fully. They developed the malware by translating a simple computer command into a tiny stretch of about 176 DNA letters. These letters were denoted as A, G, C and T. These strands were processed through a gene sequencing machine that reads gene letters and stores them as binary digits 0 and 1.\u201cIt is well known in computer security that any data used as input into a program may contain code designed to compromise a computer. This led us to question whether it is possible to produce DNA strands containing malicious computer code that, if sequenced and analyzed, could compromise a computer,\u201d explained Allen.Researchers have concluded that hackers might one day use fake blood or spit sample to access university computer system and obtain sensitive data from police forensics labs. They may also infect genome files. The team will be showcasing their findings at the Usenix Security Symposium due to be held in Vancouver.Kohno has a reputation of coming up with novel ideas of hacking probabilities. He was among the first group of scientists who proved that automobiles could be hacked through a diagnostic port and accessed remotely through Bluetooth connections.According to Yaniv Elrich, a geneticist and programmer, the exploits used by the research team are \u201cbasically unrealistic.\u201d Elrich opines that this hack trick relies upon the spill-over effect where data exceeding storage buffer is interpreted as computer command. In this research, the command initiated contact with a server that was being controlled by Kohno\u2019s team of scientists. They took control of a computer present in their lab, which they were already using to analyze DNA file.But University of Washington researchers are of the opinion that this might just be possible because DNA sequencing is becoming more and more powerful and commonplace. The sequencing is performed by third-party services on sensitive computers, and if an adversary gets control of the data processed by the computer, it will be incredibly easy to hack the computer.Kohno states that the threat is entirely practical despite being unconventional \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at the security of computational biology systems, you\u2019re not only thinking about the network connectivity and the USB drive and the user at the keyboard but also the information stored in the DNA they\u2019re sequencing. It\u2019s about considering a different class of threat.\u201dMore: Biohackers Identified the Way to Transform your Eyes into Night Vision GogglesAllen explained that it was indeed theoretically possible to produce synthetic DNA that can compromise a computer system but at the moment these attacks are difficult to carry out. Reason being that \u201cit is challenging to synthesize malicious DNA strands and to find relevant vulnerabilities in DNA processing programs thus, while scientifically interesting, we stress that people today should not necessarily be alarmed.\u201dSanger Institute UK\u2019s bioinformatics expert James Bonfield confirms that the threat is real. Bonfield stated that in some cases scientific programs that are used to interpret or organize DNA data are not maintained actively, which can be a cause of risk. Bonfield further explained that \u201cfqzcomp,\u201d which he claims the University of Washington research team targeted, was created as an experiment to be presented at a file compression competition.With this new research, the companies responsible for manufacturing synthetic DNA strands for scientists must become warned about the existence of bioterrorists. In the future, they might need to check DNA sequences as well to identify computer threats. Researchers also warned about the use of more conventional means and methods for attacking genetic data because it is appearing online so casually and can be accessed via app stores.Source: UW, Via: Wired", "topics": ["Biohackers", "DNA", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Medical", "Privacu", "Science", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Researchers Encode Physical DNA with Malware To infect Computers", "date": "August 10, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "An unknown hacking group has been targeting organizations in North Korea with Konni Malware. It is a RAT/remote access Trojan having all those features that any effective backdoor might have such as host profiling and remote access control. In 2017, already three different campaigns were identified by security experts against North Korean companies using this malware.Talos Intelligence, a cybersecurity firm owned by Cisco, firstly identified the campaign in which Konni malware was used. This campaign was launched against North Korea on July 6th, just a few days after the testing of the missile. Talos stated that the campaign most likely was related to the \u201claunch and the ensuing discussion of North Korean missile technology.\u201d In total, Talos identified two campaigns using Konni.On the other hand, a similar campaign was noted by Cylance security firm\u2019s researchers on Tuesday. This strengthened the findings of Talos and further established the notion that North Korea was being targeted with Konni.The latest Konni campaign uses a Word document containing the content of a news article published by a Korean news agency Yonhap. This document is infected with a malicious executable file the purpose of which is to invade the computer where it is opened. As soon as this file is executed, the malware starts communication with its C&C server for further instructions and to fulfill the attacker\u2019s malicious objectives.Cylance\u2019s security experts state that these campaigns were noticed in July. The reason behind the latest surge in malware campaigns against North Korean organizations is yet unclear, and experts believe that the campaigns seem to be espionage efforts by those who are \u201cinterested in North Korean affairs.\u201dKonni malware is capable of hiding in the background while the victims are tricked in such a way that they end up executing its payload. The malware also has screen capturing and keylogging capabilities due to which it manages to steal data from targeted computers.Apart from Konni, there is another malware targeting North Korean firms. BitDefender identified that a new campaign is also active where an enhanced version of DarkHotel malware is used dubbed as Inexsmar. Just like DarkHotel, which targeted business execs and prominent figures visiting hotels, Inexsmar targets political personalities.The campaign using Inexsmar was identified in July, and it delivers a malicious payload to the target instead of exploiting the zero-day vulnerability as is the usual norm. Inexsmar campaign contained a malware dropper called Pyongyang Directory Group email SEPTEMBER 2016 RC_OFFICE_Coordination_Associatewxcod.scr.\u201d This dropper is identical to the document used in the Konni campaign, aptly titled \u201cPyongyang Directory Group email April 2017 RC_Office_Coordination_Associate.scr.\u201d Furthermore, the files used in Konni and Inexsmar campaigns both include a similar set of names and contact information, which belonged to North Korean embassies, United Nations and UNICEF.Cylance researchers state that the attacks leveraging intelligence gathering and social engineering skills are extremely devastating for the targeted companies because these \u201ctarget user\u2019s (very human) emotions of trust, and can lead to a total take over.\u201dPreviously researchers from Kaspersky Lab claimed that the hackers behind Konni malware campaigns might be of Korean origin and the campaigns are probably originating from South Korea.

Kadar issued bomb threats through emails that contained the message \u201cComrades [had] planted a few bombs at school,\u201d and that students and staff members will be \u201cmassacred mercilessly shortly.\u201d Naturally, the threat resulted in a quick evacuation. In fact, his threats caused widespread evacuations across the country. The Israeli police arrested Kadar after his failure to route his internet connection via a proxy server. This gave away his IP address. The police raided Kadar\u2019s Ashkelon residence on March 23rd from where the law enforcement confiscated a couple of computers, a hard drive containing receipts of his deals.Recently unsealed search warrant suggests that Kadar was calling the shots on behalf of a third-party. The warrant hints at the fact that the 19-year old Israeli citizen could very well be part of a larger bomb-threat-for-hire scheme on the Dark Web. Researcher Seamus Hughes of The Atlantic initially released the warrant. The police are now trying to access the AlphaBay accounts of Kadar. This is believed to be the account from where Kadar has been conducting his activities related to the bomb threat business.The guy charged w/ threatening Jewish organizations throughout US ran an online paid service offering to call in threats. Someone paid him pic.twitter.com/bysptT9c3b\u2014 Seamus Hughes (@SeamusHughes) August 8, 2017The FBI maintains that the teen issued threats for making quick cash. The Bureau believes that Kadar was the key figure behind the \u201cSchool Email Bomb Threat Service\u201d on AlphaBay. For your information, AlphaBay used to be the world\u2019s largest marketplace on the dark web, but it was taken down by the FBI in July.Investigators identified a public description of this service, which was saved in a text file on Kadar\u2019s computer. The file includes details about various aspects of the business dealings. Such as the pricing of the packages offered for bomb threats and optional services like the inclusion of fake name in the email and refunding of the amount in case the threat doesn\u2019t achieve its objective. The description was referred to schools mainly while a calling service was also threatened.Reportedly, Kadar used to charge $30 for a single threat while an additional charge of $15 was added if the client wanted to frame an individual for the threatening message. The teen has been issuing threats since January, and it is suspected that he had phoned in about 245 threats to different schools and Jewish community centers across America. He was also responsible for issuing threats to hospitals and airborne flights, which gave the impression that anti-Semitism was rising in America.AlphaBay contained the same text posted by someone using the ID \u201cDarkNetLegend\u201d on the dark web, revealed the investigators. According to tracker record released by ProPublica, about 65 bomb threats were launched against Jewish centers by February 8th and much more between February and March. It was learned after analyzing Google Voice account of Kadar that threats weren\u2019t limited to Jewish centers since a middle school in Florida and an Orlando flight of United Airlines were also threatened.The police filed warrant application on April 6th against Kadar exactly three months before AlphaBay was taken down and Israeli police raided two weeks after Kadar\u2019s home. However, the application was unsealed last week.The FBI located Kadar through Google Voice numbers, which helped the investigators in tracing the accused. The numbers were used in the attacks. However, still, there isn\u2019t any indication of who was running the network and who hired Kadar for launching a spree of bomb threats to Jewish centers. Since AlphaBay offered anonymous transaction feature, so if the payments were made through AlphaBay, then the client cannot be traced.The accused will be facing federal charges in the US and Israel simultaneously. He has been accused of issuing around 2,000 bomb threats around the world. Currently, the accused hasn\u2019t been extradited to the US, and if he gets convicted in Israel, he will most likely be sent to jail for ten years.This is not the first time when a Jewish man has sent threats to people. In 2015 it was reported that Joshua Goldberg, a Jewish Lawyer, and White Supremacist pretended to be a member of ISIS/ISIL terrorist group and encouraged people to carry out a terrorist attack on September 11.", "topics": ["Crime", "Cyber Crime", "Dark Net", "dark web", "FBI", "internet", "Israel", "security", "Technology", "Terrorism"], "title": "Israeli Teen Accused of Running Bomb Threat Service Against Jewish Community Centers On Dark Web", "date": "August 9, 2017"}, {"authur": "Agan Uzunovic", "body": "The official Twitter account of Blizzard Customer Support has revealed that their servers are facing issues affecting Overwatch.

CDT has asked FTC (Federal Trade Commission) to investigate the matter.According to one of the accusations, \u201cHotspot Shield engages in logging practices around user connection data, beyond troubleshooting technical issues\u201d by using a user\u2019s location and IP addresses to \u201cimprove the service, or optimize advertisements displayed through the service.\u201dThe group has also accused the company of forcing javascript and ad codes into browsers of its customers whenever they use Hotspot Shield. \u201cThe VPN has been found to be actively injecting JavaScript codes using iframes for advertising and tracking purposes.\u201dIn a statement, Michelle De Mooy, Director of CDT\u2019s Privacy & Data Project said that \u201cHotspot Shield tells customers that their privacy and security are \u2018guaranteed, \u2018 but their actual practices starkly contradict this. \u201cThey are sharing sensitive information with third party advertisers and exposing users\u2019 data to leaks or outside attacks.\u201d\u201cWhile insisting that it does not make money from selling customer data,26 Hotspot Shield promises to connect advertisers to unique users that are frequent visitors of travel, retail, business, and finance websites.27 Moreover, these entities have access to IP addresses and device identifiers collected via Hotspot Shield.[\u2026]Even if Hotspot Shield only provides \u201chashed\u201d or \u201cproxy\u201d IP addresses to these partners, third parties can also link information about web-viewing habits while using the Hotspot Shield by cross-referencing cookies, identifiers, or other information,\u201d according to page 7 of the filing.The group discovered these privacy flaws after teaming up with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University who noted that \u201cWhen a user connects through the VPN to access specific commercial web domains, including major online retailers like target.com and macys.com, the application can intercept and redirect HTTP requests to partner websites that include online advertising companies.\u201dIn a blog spot from April 2017, Chris San Filippo of Hotspot Shield wrote that the company is against ISPs selling user web history to third parties. \u201cInternet service providers (ISPs) being able to sell user web history to third parties, to advertisers possibly bombarding users with ads, the looming elimination of the FCC\u2019s privacy rules can lead to privacy and anonymity anxiety for a lot of users in the US.\u201dHowever, CDT\u2019s filing accuses the company of doing exactly what it kept on opposing publically. In an email conversation with ZDNet, David Gorodyansky, CEO of AnchorFree said he does not agree with the filling.\u201cWe strongly believe in online consumer privacy. \u201cThis means that the information Hotspot Shield users provide to us is never associated with their online activities when they are using Hotspot Shield, we do not store user IP addresses and protect user personally identifiable information from both third parties and from ourselves.\u201dPreviously, CDT accused smart toys \u201cMy Friend Cayla and I-Que\u201d of spying on users and sending conversation and other data back to the company\u2019s server. In their filing, the group stated that these dolls are violating the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) as well as the FTC rules.After a few months, Germany banned the My Friend Cayla doll citing that it can listen to the conversations of kids and apart from responding in real-time to them, it also conducts surveillance.As far the Hotspot Shield VPN, it will be interesting to see what FTC has to say about the issue since only its Android app has been downloaded by 50,000,000 \u2013 100,000,000 users.

The latest to join the list of unsecured medical equipment is the Positron Emission Tomography scanners or PET scanners manufactured by the Munich based company Siemens.These scanners require Microsoft Windows 7 to run and their purpose is to reveal the functioning of tissues and organs. This is done with the help of a radioactive drug that traces the activities of these tissues/organs. PET scanners are used to diagnose cancerous cells, brain diseases, and cardiac disorders.Reportedly, Siemens has identified (Pdf) security flaws in these scanners, and it is believed that cybercriminals can remotely exploit the device. The company initially informed its customers including hospitals to immediately disconnect the scanners and wait for an update, which is due to be released soon. However, further review revealed that disconnecting the scanners was not necessary because patients were not at risk.\u201cTo date, there have been no reports of exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities on any system installation worldwide,\u201d said a spokesperson of Siemens.Siemens used the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which is an open industry standard risk assessment system and concluded that the vulnerability\u2019s security severity ranking was 9.8/10.It is worth noting that imaging machines like the PET scanners don\u2019t have to be directly connected to the internet to function. Instead, these require being connected to the clinical IT system. If the system is infected, then the machine will also receive the impact of infection.Graham Cluley, an independent computer security analyst, states that the problem is quite serious because the vulnerabilities in medical equipment can be exploited remotely. He further claimed that hospitals were poorly protected against hacking probably because of two reasons: underfunding and old equipment that is not compatible with advanced operating systems.The German industrial firm Siemens is, therefore, likely to issue software update by the end of this month to fix the vulnerability that would lead to hacking of PET scanners.The US Department of Homeland Security notified companies about the possibility of a hack attack on medical equipment running on Windows 7 by a \u201clow skill\u201d hacker.

We got to learn about a variety of novel hacking ideas such as the hacking of Voting Machines, hacking airborne drones, hijacking phone numbers and Internet connected car wash system etc. However, there is one story that has been somewhat ignored by many within the tech fraternity but which is extremely important to be noted.This was noticed by David Holmes of SecurityWeek who reported that it was the \u201cCable Tap: Wireless Tapping Your Home Network\u201d talk, which initially was believed to be just a brief discussion on how to track what\u2019s happening on your home network but in reality, it turned out to be way \u201cbroader\u201d in its scope. Marc Newlin, Logan Lamb and Christopher Grayson with Bastille Networks and Web Sight have managed to identify 26 different flaws and weaknesses in the ISP network devices. These vulnerabilities would easily provide remote admin access to most of the home networks currently used in the US.CableTap whitepaper: https://t.co/se9T703Kn0\u2014 Marc Newlin (@marcnewlin) July 30, 2017The crux of the research was that there happen to be a large number of critical weaknesses in \u201cISP provided, RDK-based wireless gateways and set-top boxes.\u201d These vulnerabilities are identified in devices manufactured by Cisco, Arris, Technicolor, and Motorola.\u201cWe discovered a wide array of critical vulnerabilities in ISP-provided, RDK-based wireless gateways and set-top boxes from vendors including Cisco, Arris, Technicolor, and Motorola. Our research shows that it was possible to remotely and wirelessly tap all Internet and voice traffic passing through the affected gateways, impacting millions of ISP customers.\u201dThe research team demonstrated at Defcon that remotely and wirelessly tapping all the Internet and voice traffic that passed through an active gateway was possible.\u201d They also stated that these findings applied to tens of millions of ISP customers. The scope of hack ranges from reverse-engineering the Comcast Xfinity routers\u2019 MAC address generation process to exploit the flaws present in the FastCGI Subsystem. This system is used by web servers like Apache, Lighttpd, and Nginx.Until now we believed that Xfinity access point ensures that you have your private network and offers a public wireless network \u201cXfinity wifi\u201d for providing an access point to roaming Comcast customers, who can use it by entering their credentials. However, at the Defcon it was revealed that it has another hidden WiFi network apart from the above mentioned two. This network is named XHS-XXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXX indicates the lower four bytes of the cable modem/CM MAC and this hidden WiFi network is generated deterministically through the interface\u2019s MAC address.The team of researchers identified around four different methods to get the MAC address and one of these methods use the Xfinity wifi public network connectivity since the DHCP ACK contains the CM MAC address. When the researchers hacked the Xfinity wifi using the MAC address, they were able to understand the passphrase and access the Xfinity wifi network without needing to use their personal Comcast credentials.This means, if there is malicious activity noted on that network, it should be attributed to the cable modem owner. There is another flaw in their chain of attacks, which was brute-forcing of the radio-frequency pairing of remote voice control of Comcast. This could be used to attack or infect Xfinity set-top boxes.Most noteworthy among all the information shared at the talk was the reference development kit/RDK. It is an open-source platform used by internet service providers in cable modems and set-top boxes. Although developers regularly patch RDK around the globe, it is open-source and therefore, anyone can identify source changes for further vulnerability fixes even months before the fix is applied to the millions of set-top boxes used by Americans.Why is this story so important? That\u2019s because: \u201cNothing is more important than our customers\u2019 safety, and we appreciate Bastille bringing these matters to our attention.

In June 2017, two researchers from RiskSense Security namely Sean Dillon and Jenna Magius identified a flaw in Microsoft\u2019s file sharing protocol.The flaw, dubbed as SMBLoris, was identified while researching upon the NSA\u2019s EternalBlue SMB exploit (the same exploit used by hackers to spread WananCry ransomware). The disturbing element of their research is that the vulnerability is around 20 years old and was present in older versions of MS Windows too, such as Windows 2000.Related: Microsoft fixes security flaw in Windows that existed for 19 yearsThe flaw was evident in all the three SMB protocol versions SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3 and Samba Linux Server. This server provides Linux systems the necessary SMB interoperability. Exploiting this flaw, a hacker doesn\u2019t need to authenticate himself for opening a connection to any remote computer and instruct it to allocate RAM. This happens because the flaw doesn\u2019t let remote code execution take place. Naturally, the flaw is serious and dangerous because the attacker can open millions of connections to the same device. This would exhaust the RAM and result in crashing the computer.\u201cThe vulnerability is in all modern versions of Windows, at least from Windows 2000 through Windows 10. Systems are still vulnerable even if all versions of SMB (1, 2, and 3) are disabled.\u201dSMBLoris has derived its name from the infamous Slowloris attack, which was discovered in 2009 by security researchers and it was claimed that Slowloris could attack web servers and create countless connections on a single server.As a result, bandwidth, memory, and sockets got exhausted, and it became a lot easy to carry out one-man DDoS attacks. There is no such difference between SMBLoris and Slowloris apart from the fact that the former doesn\u2019t use HTTP but SMB.It is useless to disable SMB protocol, and the only way to prevent SMBLoris attack is by protecting the SMB service through a firewall to block incoming SMB connections or at least limit them to a lower number. On Linux systems, it can be prevented if admins set \u201cmax smbd processes= 1000.\u201d This would be done in the Samba smb.conf config file. Through this method, attackers won\u2019t be able to create a large number of SMB connections to the Samba server.Experts were expecting a patch for this vulnerability, but surprisingly, Microsoft has declined to patch the SMB protocol on an urgent basis. Microsoft was notified by the researchers as soon as the vulnerability was identified but the tech giant claims that this issue does not fall into security bug category. The claim was made after two different internal security teams of Microsoft analyzed the issue separately.However, Microsoft has agreed to fix the bug in the bugfix update in the near future. The company maintains that an attacker having \u201crudimentary network programming knowledge\u201d can successfully exploit SMBLoris and make critical systems crash through exposing port 445 to the web.Related: Microsoft Windows Devices Responsible For 80% of Malware InfectionsThe researchers presented their findings at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas.

However, the cons associated with such devices easily surpass their pros. The case is same with self-driving technology. Although the technology is evolving every passing year the vulnerabilities and loopholes that are constantly expanding present a point of concern for automobile experts, people, and governments.The University of Washington\u2019s team of researchers has identified a huge flaw in the technology of the connected car, which is so dangerous that it makes self-driving car hacking look like a low-grade problem. According to the team, defacing of street signs is a bigger problem because the nature of the threat is highly practical.It is quite easy to alter street signs through the strategic use of stickers and throwing off an autonomous vehicle\u2019s image recognition system. In case the attackers are aware of the way a vehicle sorts the objects it views like pictures of signs, it is possible for them to create stickers that could deceive the vehicle into believing that the fake sign does mean something.For example, through simple social engineering skills, attackers can make the car believe that a stop sign is a speed limit sign. Thus, the problems are evident, and attackers can easily create chaos on streets using these stickers that can be printed at home. If the street signs are altered, there will be crashes on roads as people will be misguided.The method is quite similar to the way Galaxy S8 iris scanner was tricked through a picture; image recognition system in connected vehicles can be confused and forced to misread signs using sticker-borne street signs. To validate their findings, researchers showed two methods of tricking the system.Firstly, they used to love/hate stickers over a Stop sign to trick the car into believing that it was speed limit sign and they succeeded.

If this flaw is exploited then European power grids will be severely affected, and there is a threat of widespread outages. According to Westerhof, the flaw is present in thousands of Internet-connected inverters installed across Europe. The findings were published in a Dutch newspaper Volkskrant.The function of the inverter is to convert direct current into alternating current. Since Internet of Things devices are vulnerable to hacking, therefore, it is easily possible to gain control of as many inverters as hackers may want to. Resultantly, hackers can switch them off to affect power supply by creating an imbalance and enable power outages in different parts of Europe.Related: Even Solar Panels Can Be HackedWesterhof researched upon some inverters which were responsible for managing 15 gigawatts of power and found them to be poorly secured. This highlighted the gravity of the problem. If all of them get hacked, and hacker decides to shut them all off, there will be a widespread outage.Research also revealed that the flaws were present in inverters produced by German based inverter manufacturer SMA. This issue was reported to SMA by Westerhof in December 2016, and the company invited him too for further discussion, but until now there is hardly any progress in addressing the problem. On the other hand, SMS denied that its inverters were poorly secured, and the company claimed that the identified flaws are restricted to a limited range of inverters.

Recently, a security researcher has discovered that Amazon Echo or Echo, a smart speaker developed by Amazon is vulnerable to physical hack attack.In this attack, an attacker with physical access to Amazon Echo 2015 or 2016 models and with professional knowledge of Linux OS can install malware on the device turning it into a perfect surveillance tool \u2013 All that without leaving a trace or clue for its owner.How severely the device can be comprised depends on the attackers and for which purpose they want to exploit it for. However, a British security researcher Mark Barnes of MwrLabs says that the malware infection can allow attackers to gain full remote access to a targeted device, steal customer authentication tokens, and live stream microphone audio. This means strangers can hear in-house conversations which you thought to be private or secretive.This makes Amazon Echo a perfect device for hackers, police and intelligence agencies should they choose you as their target or suspect you of a crime. An attacker, in this case, can be anyone including your family member, a friend or anyone else trustworthy with physical access to your house.This is just like what WikiLeaks released in its Vault 7 series documents alleging that CIA can spy on users through their Samsung smart TV without the knowledge of users.In order to conduct the hack, Barnes removed the rubber base of the Echo which allowed him to access 18 metal pads, the purpose of which is to find bugs and conduct tests on the device before sending it to market for sale. Using these pads, one can also read data on the SD card. Barnes then used one of the metal pads to connect his laptop to boot the device which was successfully executed since there was no authentication required.Furthermore, Barnes used a research paper released by researchers at The Citadel which highlighted how researchers were able to boot into a generic Linux environment from an external SD Card attached to debug pads made available on the base of the Amazon Echo device. It allowed Barnes to install \u201ca persistent implant, gain remote root shell access, and finally remotely snoop on the \u2018always listening\u2019 microphones.\u201d\u201cOnce we had root access we examined the processes running on the device and the scripts that spawn these processes. We were able to understand how audio media is being passed and buffered between processes and the tools that are used to create and interact with these audio buffers. Using the provided \u2018shmbuf_tool\u2019 application developed by Amazon, we created a script that would continuously write the raw microphone data into a named fifo pipe which we then stream over TCP/IP to a remote service. On the remote device, we receive the raw microphone audio, sample the data, and either save it as a .wav file or play it out of the speakers of the remote device\u201d.For those looking to fix the issue are advised by Barnes to mute their device by using the physical button and check the original pack for a 2017 copyright and a device model number ending 02. Also, keep an eye on who has physical access to your Echo device and in the case of any suspicion inform Amazon.

The latest Android Banking Trojan is a clear proof of this.According to Kaspersky Labs\u2019 security researchers, most dangerous android banking Trojan family of all namely Svpeng has now been equipped with Keylogger feature. This has provided cyber criminals easy access to sensitive data logs.Senior malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, Roman Unuchek identified a new and highly dangerous version of the already harmful Svpeng, an Android banking Trojan, which is equipped with keylogging capability. The malware uses Android\u2019s Accessibility Services for adding Keylogger. It is a service from android that provides users substitute methods of interacting with their devices.The addition of keylogger has made Svpeng Trojan extremely powerful because it can now steal entered text from all the apps installed on the Android device as well as logging all the keystrokes. As if this was not enough, it grabs more permissions and rights to prevent uninstallation of the malware.This version of Svpeng is although not deployed widely users in 23 countries including Russia, Poland, Germany, Turkey, and France have already clicked on it. However, Russian users are not at all attacked. Unuchek highlighted a key fact that when the device is infected, the malware identifies the language of the device and if it is Russian it does not perform any malicious acts. This hints on the involvement of Russian threat actors in this latest malware spree.The Trojan is being distributed via infected websites, which are disguised as Flash Player. When the device is infected, and language checked, the malware exploited Accessibility Services to launch dangerous attacks. The malware grabs admin rights, hacks legit apps for displaying an overlay, grants itself dynamic permissions like making calls or sending/receiving messages, gets installed as the default app for SMS and views contact details. It also blocks all attempts from the victim for removing admin rights, and this is how it prevents its uninstallation.It also steals the text entered on apps and takes screenshots whenever the victim presses a key on the keyboard. As Unuchek said:\u201cSome apps, mainly banking ones, do not allow screenshots to be taken when they are on top. In such cases, the Trojan has another option to steal data \u2013 it draws its phishing window over the attacked app.\u201dThe information is uploaded to the C&C server of the attacker.The further probe by Unuchek revealed the websites and apps targeted by Svpeng, which included banking apps from the UK, France, Turkey, Singapore, Poland and Australia.If you want your device to stay protected, always download apps from trusted websites and avoid downloading unnecessary apps.

Remember, in December 2014; Sony suffered a similar breach in which a hacking group going by the handle of \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d (GOP) stole a massive amount of data from Sony\u2019s servers and ended up leaking movies and financial information of the company.In an email alert sent by HBO\u2019s chairman and CEO Richard Plepler, it was stated that: The problem before us is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a part of. As has been the case with any challenge we have ever faced, I have absolutely no doubt that we will navigate our way through this successfully.\u201dJohn Humphreys, SVP of Business Development & Alliances of Proficio commented on the issue and said that:\u201cStudios, like many other industries, has an extensive list of supporting partners and business alliances with \u2018mission-critical\u2019 data that must be protected. It would benefit entertainment entities (like HBO) to follow strict security procedures \u2013 similar to those found in regulated industries \u2013 to keep propriety information out of the hands of faceless hackers. Although the attack method isn\u2019t entirely clear just yet, this particular incident underscores the need for organizations to take a layered security approach to protect critical and digital assets. Using perimeter security alone is not enough \u2013 host based security and database security will also need to be employed (with events from these security systems monitored 24\u00d77 by a SOC or MSSP).This is the fourth incident this year where hackers have stolen data from a media giant. The hacking spree started in May by The Dark Overlord hacker or hackers. Here is the list of their hacks and leaks: Netflix\u2019s Orange Is the New Black season 5 leak: The Dark Overlord hacked Hollywood-based Larson Studios and stole unreleased season 5 of Netflix\u2019 Orange Is the New Black and leaked it online after failed negotiations with Netflix and the Studio.Steve Harvey\u2019s \u201cFunderdome\u201d TV Show: The Dark Overlord leaked the first eight episodes of Steve Harvey\u2019s Funderdome TV show, before its premiere.

The very hyped Micro:bit computer board from BBC is not as safe as we expected it to be. According to Econocom Digital Security\u2019s senior security researcher Damien Cauquil, the board that is worth $15 in the US and \u00a312 in the UK has such weak wireless operations that it could be exploited easily. Furthermore, the board\u2019s programmable feature has made it the perfect tool for hackers to fulfill their malicious objectives. Since it is a tiny device, it becomes even easier for hackers to hide it while performing the attack.Cauquil presented his findings at the DEF CON hacking conference held in Las Vegas on Friday. As per his research, it was quite easy to configure a mini microcomputer to record keystrokes from a wireless keyboard. It could even control quadcopter drone using skillful programming. The device is powered by a 16MHz 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 CPU with 16KB of RAM and also features Bluetooth connectivity. Using simple Python coding, the Micro:bit becomes the perfect wireless sniffer.The Register reports that using a publicly available program, Cauquil showed how it was possible for a hacker to program the Micro:bit for locating signals from a wireless keyboard through Bluetooth connectivity and later hide it at any feasible location to remain undetected. This way, the hacker could grab sensitive information like account passwords or login details as soon as the user types them. Although the Micro:bit has small storage space but it is sufficient for storing data that could be useful for hackers.When Cauquil attached the Micro:bit to a drone controller handset, he was able to interfere with the control mechanism of an already airborne quadcopter and ultimately the flight controls of the drone were hijacked.Cauquil believes that the Micro:bit\u2019s system in this regard was imperfect and its latency issues may cause losing the connection with the drone. Yet, it was quick enough to control the controller signal from the owner. Also, drones already are quite dangerous when their owners are controlling these so we can only assume what these could be capable of when a hacker gains control of them.Apparently, this tiny device that was supposed to be used by kids in different kinds of projects is capable of performing bigger tasks if used by a hacker.", "topics": ["Bluetooth", "DefCon", "Drones", "Gadget", "hacking", "internet", "security"], "title": "Airborne Drones can be hijacked using $15 BBC\u2019 Micro:bit", "date": "July 31, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "A couple of days ago it was reported that the 38-year-old Russian citizen Alexander Vinnik, co-owner of one of Internet\u2019s largest digital currency exchange BTC-e was arrested in Greece on suspicion of using his platform for a large scale money laundering campaign and aiding cyber criminals in receiving money from victims of ransomware attacks.Now, the US law enforcement authorities have moved one step further and seized the official website of BTC-e exchange leading to an outrage among unsuspecting users who might lose their investments.

As per the team of researchers, CSFB\u2019s authentication step is missing from its procedure, which can allow easy access to hackers to the phone.At the summit, Unicorn Team created a situation where a hacker could use a stolen mobile number to reset the password of a Google account.

Dubbed Triada by researchers the Trojan is embedded in the Zygote component\u2019s system process whose function is to launch apps and programs on a device. By infecting Zygote, the trojan downloads and executes additional modules on targeted devices \u2013 All this is done without the knowledge of the user.The researchers further noticed that Triada is embedded into libandroid_runtime.so system library which is used by every Android app. This means millions of devices could be infected. However, it is unclear how the Trojan made its way into these devices. Dr.Web believes that it\u2019s an inside job.

It can be assumed that insiders or unscrupulous partners, who participated in creating firmware for infected mobile devices, are to be blamed for the dissemination of the Trojan \u2013 Android.Triada.231 is embedded into libandroid_runtime.so in a way that it gets control each time when an application on the device makes a record to the system log. As Zygote is launched before other applications, the initial launch of the Trojan is performed by Zygote.Furthermore, Triada has the ability to download additional Trojan components on an infected device which then steals sensitive data from banking apps, intercepts chats from messengers and social media platforms and there are also cyber espionage modules on the device It must be noted that Triada is not a new Trojan.

According to the latest set of information provided by WikiLeaks in its ongoing Vault 7 leaks saga, the CIA developed three dangerous malware for Linux and macOS systems.The malware were dubbed as Aeris, Achilles, and SeaPea. Aeris is an automated implant that infects Linux systems whereas Achilles and SeaPea infect macOS. The CIA developed the malware for its Imperial Project. Every one of the three hacking tools served a different purpose. Apparently, these were developed for targeting a certain set of operating systems.Achilles is a utility specially developed for trojanizing macOS DMG installers. WikiLeaks exposed a one-page user guide as well explaining how this particular hacking tool worked. According to the user guide, this tool allowed an operator to fix an executable to a DMG file. This would be used for one-time execution only. When the DMG file is run, the original app is installed, and then the payload is installed. The payload is then removed from the DMG file.We are not surprised to learn that the Achilles was designed as a one-time execution malware because this is a typical routine of the CIA since the agency is well-known for its preference on staying undetected on targeted computers. The malware has been tested to be compatible with Intel processors running 10.6 OS.Aeris is the second tool exposed by WikiLeaks. This malware was named after the character called Aeris Gainsborough of the famous game Final Fantasy VII and is designed to infect POSIX systems. The implant/malware is equipped with data exfiltration utilities. These utilities can attack targeted hosts for data stealing through secure TLS-encrypted channels.The user guide does not provide information about the way this malware collected data. We can only assume that it is part of a bigger chain of attack and that CIA was using it with other tools. The purpose of Aeris was to infect systems, download Aeris malware, locate required data and perform exfiltration of information.The key features of Aeris include standalone support for HTTPSLS, TLS encrypted communications, configurable beacon interval, structure command, and control server and create compatibility with NOD cryptographic specification. Aeris is distributed through a set of Python utilities. The coding for this hacking tool is done in C while it affects the following systems:Debian Linux 7 (i386), Debian Linux 7 (amd64), Debian Linux 7 (ARM), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (i386), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (amd64), Solaris 11 (i386), Solaris 11 (SPARC), FreeBSD 8 (i386), FreeBSD 8 (amd64), CentOS 5.3 (i386) and CentOS 5.7 (i386).It is the third malware exposed by WikiLeaks. SeaPea is an OS X rootkit. The manual for SeaPea was released previously by WikiLeaks in another set of CIA data exposure called DarkSeaSkies. It was published in March and showcased a collection of tools, which helped in hacking iPhones and Macs. The purpose of this malware was to provide CIA with a kernel-level implant.This implant supposedly allowed the CIA operators to distribute persisting infections on OS X systems when the system is rebooted.

In their findings, robots could be hacked, but in this case, we are about to discuss a smart coffee machine or an Internet connected coffee machine.The incident took place in June 2017 and was shared by a chemical engineer on Reddit who goes by the handle of \u201cC10H15N1.\u201d He works as a PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) expert in a company that has multiple petrochemical factories making chemicals in Europe.According to C10H15N1, he received a call from one of the factory operators informing him that something has hit the local control system and all computer systems are down and showing an error. However, upon analyzing the problem remotely, C10H15N1 didn\u2019t find any issue other than the monitoring system which crashed even when it wasn\u2019t connected to the Internet.It was then C10H15N1 suspected that something is seriously wrong since the system was running on Windows XP. Here, it must be noted that a couple of months ago, millions of devices running on Windows XP were severely infected by WannaCry ransomware and Petya wiper attack around the world.Therefore, C10H15N1 asked the operator what\u2019s happening on the computer screen and his reply sounded like the company was under a ransomware attack.\u201cAs I\u2019m part of the team working on the monitoring software I\u2019ll take over the call, while my college will keep monitoring the situation. I asked operator what was happening on his screens, and he starts describing something that sounds very similar to an infamous ransomware attack. Which is problematic, because the computers running the monitoring software are not connected to the internet,\u201d C10H15N1 wrote on his Reddit post.Although it is unclear which ransomware hit the company\u2019s system, based on the timing, it\u2019s more likely that the culprit could be WannaCry ransomware since the same ransomware also infected Honda Motors plant in Japan and traffic cameras in Australia in June 2017.However, describing the situation, C10H15N1 revealed that his company couldn\u2019t update their operating system due to local laws implemented by the government. Therefore, they were left with no option but to use out dated Windows XP on their system.\u201cWe cannot update the monitoring software on those machines because it\u2019s then no longer validated by local government. We cannot update those machines because as soon as we update them, monitoring software crashes due to a race condition that is not in the older version of the operating system.Local government can only validate the new version of monitoring software when the factory is down, and the factory is normally only down when all our clients are down. All our clients are normally only down when all the factories are having their planned big maintenance stop. Which is normally once every 5 years.[\u2026]So because of this stupid bureaucracy, we cannot update those computers, and because of that they are not connected to the internet, and also have no accessible USB ports. They are only on an Internal network which can reach the PLC\u2019s,\u201d C10H15N1 wrote.Now, to tackle the issue, C10H15N1 asked the operator to pull the power plug on the computers powering the monitoring system, and then power them back on, and press the key combination to start reinstalling from a network image.Once the operator finished re-imaging the system; C10H15N1 thought the nightmare was over but little did he know it was just the beginning. Suddenly, one by one the targeted system started to get infected and displaying the same error message again.The operator asked C10H15N1 if he can get some coffee and went straight for the coffee machine but came back empty handed and revealed that he couldn\u2019t get coffee because the coffee machine was displaying the same error message as the computers.It was then when C10H15N1 realized what\u2019s going on and explained that:\u201cSo long story short, the coffee machines are supposed to be connected to their own isolated WiFi network. However, the person installing the coffee machine connected the machine to the Internal control room network, and then when he didn\u2019t get internet access remembered to also connect it to the isolated WiFi network. The operator contacted us about his monitoring system not working but forgot to mention the Coffee Machines were showing the same error.\u201dHence it was discovered that it was the mistake of the external company responsible for managing their coffee machine. C10H15N1 wrote a scathing letter to the company who was quick to fix the issue.This is a lesson for those working at sensitive installations to always check which device is connected to which connection. And to be honest, who needs an Internet connected coffee machine?

This smart gun model called Armatix IP1 allows the owner to open fire only if the company\u2019s smartwatch near by the gun.However, the presence of such a huge flaw that could be detected so casually by a cheap device highlights for the umpteenth time the hazards of connecting devices to the internet. We have been hearing time and again that internet connected devices lack the most important element, security and this revelation only re-confirms this notion once again.Armatix IP1 is the latest to join the ever-growing list of smart guns. Previously we have been introduced to smart guns that shoot after verifying the owner\u2019s fingerprint. However, Armatix IP1 is different because it shoots only when it is within the range of the smartwatch.However, a hacker using the alias Plore demonstrated how IP1 could be hacked using a cheap $20 radio equipment and even cheaper magnets. Plore researched on identifying ways to exploit the flaw in IP1 for six months and so far he has found three different ways to crack the gun.He connected the gun with the watch through short-range radio; every time the trigger was squeezed, the radio transmitter device acted as a relay and extended the gun\u2019s range by over 12 feet more. This meant anyone else wearing the smartwatch could use it.Plore also identified another security flaw that was even riskier because it allowed an attacker to bypass the gun\u2019s safety mechanism easily. When the smartwatch was taken apart, Plore managed to find the component that turned the green light one notifying the gun to shoot.The gun\u2019s electromagnet system that was used to unlock the firing pin of the gun was also replicated without any difficulty using $15 magnets. The task was achieved by placing the magnets near the gun.While speaking with Wired, Plore explained: \u201cI almost didn\u2019t believe it had actually worked. I had to fire it again. And that\u2019s how I found out for $15 of materials you can defeat the security of this $1,500 smart gun.\u201dPlore then used a relatively similar transmitter to emit radio waves of the frequency same as the smart gun and smartwatch. This resulted in jamming the device completely hinting on the fact that it was possible to disarm the person using Armatix IP1.This has raised eyebrows because a smart gun is bought and owned for the sole purpose of enhancing security. However, the presence of such easily exploitable security flaws is certainly disappointing and demotivating.In its defense, Armatix stated that although the flaws are real but won\u2019t be so easy to pull off since people never carry magnets around.

Usually, many of us leave Wi-Fi open throughout the day even at night. This could cause you lots of trouble if you haven\u2019t updated your smartphone, particularly iPhones and Android devices manufactured by Google and Samsung.According to research conducted by a specialist at Exodus Intelligence, hackers can exploit vulnerability present in widely used Wi-Fi chipsets manufactured by Broadcom to control your phone through a bug. This bug, dubbed as Broadpwn, allows them to hack into a smartphone remotely. This bug can infect smartphones made by Apple, Samsung, and Google. Broadpwn is regarded as an unstoppable malware as it leads to crashing your phone and then spreads the attack to other devices.Nitay Artenstein explained his findings at the Black Hat security conference on Thursday. As per Artenstein, the vulnerability in chipset would let hackers use Wi-Fi to control your phone by writing on the chip directly. This would be possible if the hackers are in the Wi-Fi network\u2019s range. The attack would be carried out through airwaves, and ultimately it results in crashing the device. All of this will be possible if the Wi-Fi is on, it is not necessary to be connected to the network.Google and Apple have already patched this bug, so if you haven\u2019t updated your device lately, the chances are that your smartphone is vulnerable to hack attack. Once infected with Broadpwn, your phone will become a rogue access point, which would then be used to infect other phones that come in the Wi-Fi connection\u2019s range. This way, the infection will spread from one device to another. Artenstein refers to the bug as a WiFi worm.According to Artenstein, this is an interesting and powerful vulnerability because it is a remote exploit, which means the victim doesn\u2019t even have to commit a mistake to get his/her phone infected. The attacker, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to identify the make and model of the targeted device before launching the attack. If the attackers want to cause more damage apart from crashing the device, a second vulnerability will be required.At the conference in Las Vegas, Artenstein demonstrated proof-of-concept of the research by infecting Samsung Galaxy phone set with the bug and without any intervention, the infected device managed to spread the infection to another Samsung device.\u201cWhen I started working in this field, we had worms, self-propagating malware which could be run across the network. There were quite a few in the good old days. They died out, together with remote exploits: worms pretty much need them to propagate,\u201d stated Artenstein.\u201cBut Broadpwn is a perfect bug for this kind of thing.

Well, it turns out Internet connected car washes or smart car washes can be hacked and trap the customer inside with their vehicle or even smash it while you in there.IT security researchers at WhiteScope Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts have discovered a critical security flaw in the design of the software responsible for running a huge number of Internet connected car washes in the United States. The flaw can allow an attacker to gain remote access to the equipment and take control of the doors, including locking them and causing whatever damage possible.Originally, Rios noted the flaws back in 2015, and since then his mission was to find as many devices as possible and analyze what they are exposing to the public web. This time, to take his findings to a new level both researchers came up with an exploit for the flaw and with the permission of a car wash owner they successfully targeted the system. The problem exists in PDQ Vehicle Wash Systems, a brushless automated car wash system which is operated through a software that runs on Windows CE (Compact edition) and uses a mechanical arm to spray around the vehicle. It must be noted that Windows CE was initially released in 1996 making it a 20-year-old operating system which is not even supported by Microsoft anymore.The system is protected with login credentials ( a username and a password) which are easy to guess \u2013  especially if the user has not changed them since it was installed or in simple words, researchers say default credentials are easy to guess.Upon knowing the login details, researchers exploited the vulnerability and sent remote commands to the car wash system directing it to close the bay doors, trap the vehicle inside, spray as much water and soap they want and even smash the vehicle around which can be life threatening for some customers trapped inside.In a conversation with MotherBoard, researchers explained that \u201cWe believe this to be the first exploit of a connected device that causes the device to physically attack someone.\u201dBoth researchers demonstrated their findings at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. This is not the first time when Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts have identified critical vulnerabilities in an IoT system. Previously, both researchers identified life threatening vulnerabilities in hospital drug pumps which can be exploited to remotely administer a fatal dose of the medication to a patient.A couple of months ago, the researchers also exposed another life threatening vulnerability in pacemakers which can be exploited to conduct potential ransomware attacks on a targeted device.In this era of technology, almost everyone owns an IoT device.

The WannaCry ransomware and Petya wiper malware attack are the best example of the increasing ransomware campaigns.In a separate study conducted by researchers from University of California San Diego, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Chainalysis, and Google have found out that victims are paying a massive amount of ransom to cyber criminals.In their study, researchers analyzed 34 families of ransomware discovering that only a few of them have made a lot of profit. One of them was Locky that earned $8.85 million and was the \u201cpatient zero\u201d of this recent problem.Locky was one of the first and most sophisticated ransomware programs which targeted users and kept its encryption and payment system separate from the groups spreading the malware. This allowed the ransomware to spread faster around the world.NYU professor Damon McCoy told The Verge that  Locky\u2019s big advantage was the decoupling of the people who maintain the ransomware from the people who are infecting machines. \u201cLocky just focused on building the malware and support infrastructure. Then they had other botnets spread and distribute the malware, which was much better at that end of the business.\u201dOther ransomware programs like Cerber and CryptXXX followed the same pattern and made $6.9 million and $1.9 million respectively the report reveals.It was three months ago when Samyntec, a cyber security giant reported that not only Americans are number one target of ransomware attacks but also most likely to pay ransom to cyber criminals.A targeted user pays ransom due to lack of knowledge of ransomware decryption programs. Also, there\u2019s not much out there for a layman to go through to decrypt their data without the help of a specialist which is not easy to get in touch with. Most importantly, FBI encourages users to pay ransom whenever their system is infected with a ransomware malware.However, it is highly advised not to pay ransom to cyber criminals and don\u2019t feed them.

However, it is the software\u2019s obsolescence that is believed to be the main reason behind its unceremonious expulsion from the cyber world.Forrester Research analyst Jeffrey Hammond revealed that developers were gradually moving away from Flash and preferring open standards like HTML5, WebGL and WebAssembly that were although not as competent or comprehensive as Flash but provided optimal security. Even Adobe acknowledged that \u201copen standards like HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly have matured over the past several years, most now provide many of the capabilities and functionalities that plugins pioneered.\u201d The company went on to declare that these open standards have become a relatively more \u201cviable alternative for content on the web.\u201dWe might not miss Flash plugin much since already a majority of internet users are leading Flash-less life. As we already highlighted that the software had not been a part of iOS platform since 2010 and Android OS since 2012. Google blocked Flash ads in September 2015 and last summer even Firefox blocked them whereas Microsoft Edge picked a click-to-run option in 2016. This means, Internet Explorer is the last hotbed on the internet for Flash and even IE will be bidding farewell to Flash in 2019 as the software will be disabled automatically.However, let\u2019s not fall into the trap that everything on the web space will become hunky dory after the departure of Flash plugin. Expect the cyber-weaponry of malicious threat actors to be targeted to other software once Flash makes its exit. As Segura pointed out:\u201cThe focus might switch to yet another Achilles\u2019 heel for all browsers, which are extensions and third-party plugins. This is, in particular, true for Google Chrome, which has the most market share and as such represents the most coveted target.\u201dStill, there is enough reason to celebrate the departure of Flash in the near future since time has proven the statement of Steve Jobs who said that once it gets deleted, we will not be missing Flash much.", "topics": ["Adobe", "Flash", "Google", "internet", "Microsoft", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Adobe to Completely Disable Flash Player by 2020", "date": "July 26, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "ATMs (automated teller machines) have remained a preferred target of hackers around the world. Last year, ATMs in over a dozen locations across Europe were attacked. There was widespread hacking of ATMs across Taiwan, Thailand, and Pakistan whereas Bangladesh\u2019s central bank experienced world\u2019s largest digital heist when SWIFT system was attacked, and $81 million (\u00a364.95 million) were stolen. This is why it has become the priority of security firms and experts to find out vulnerabilities in ATMs to prevent hack attacks.A security expert at Positive Technologies has joined the bandwagon by researching and identifying how hackers can extract cash simply from ATMs by drilling a hole around the keypad.Leigh-Anne Galloway claims that ATMs can be hacked pretty easily if hackers drill a hole in the front, just where the keypad is located. Ms. Galloway explained that since a majority of cash machines are Windows XP systems that are linked with a safe, therefore, the trick makes a varied range of machines vulnerable to hack attack.While speaking with Spencer Kelly from BBC Click, Ms. Galloway stated: \u201cIt\u2019s just a safe with a computer on top.\u201dAll a hacker need to do is create a hole, and a USB port will be exposed. By attaching a USB cable, hackers can dispense money conveniently. Moreover, if details of someone\u2019s card are stored in a hacked machine, the data will spread across a network of ATMs and cash would be withdrawn without the knowledge of the owner.Ms. Galloway demonstrated the trick to BBC by hacking an ATM manufactured by the world\u2019s largest ATM maker NCR. The cash machines from NCR, a Georgia based firm, are perceived to be most reliable and secure, so it was quite a surprise that it was instantly hacked.The video below shows how a hacker can locate the USB port. For security purposes, the rest of the act has not been shown.As evident, the process takes only a minute.Ms. Galloway further revealed that by infecting the system with malware, data from the card could be collected as well and all the information held on our cards will be exposed.Sunday prep for #INFOSEC17 @PTsecurity_UK come see @a66at talking about banking security pic.twitter.com/wcdQ4iXvKy\u2014 Leigh-Anne Galloway (@L_AGalloway) June 4, 2017Users can avoid getting their cards hacked and money stolen by using ATMs that are installed inside a bank with security cameras present.NCR has urged banks to make security their priority and \u201cstay current with all security defenses, operating system upgrades, and industry recommendations.\u201dRegarding the security of their machines, NCR\u2019s spokesperson stated that the company provides comprehensive information about security measures and recommendations for addressing threats like these.\u201cWe help our customers prevent attacks, and help them to assess and improve their security infrastructure,\u201d claims NCR.However, we cannot ignore the fact that threats to ATMs are regularly growing as hackers are coming out with more complex and sophisticated methods to attack the machines.

The hack seemed to be very sophisticated, but there is at least one corporate partner that may have dropped the ball and be liable. We\u2019ll let the lawyers sort that out if it goes that far. Although I hate to see assets stolen, and I hate thieves, the incident proved both the resilient demand for our tokens and the utility of the decentralized exchange EtherDelta. The hacker(s) made away with $8.4M worth of tokens and dumped all of them within a few hours into a heavy cacophony of demand. This is without the public knowing anything about our last traction. I would like to make it known that we had the option to fork VERI, but chose not to. At the end of the day, the amount stolen was minuscule (less than 00.07%) although the dollar amount was quite material. Another point that I would like to make clear is that Veritaseum tokens are software that represents our knowledge, advisory and consulting skills, products and capabilities. Without the Veritaseum team, the tokens are literally worthless! If someone were to someone confiscate 100% of the available tokens, all we need to do is refuse to stand behind them and recreate the token under a new contract. Again, we aren\u2019t selling currencies; we aren\u2019t selling securities. We are selling capabilities, and the ability for those capabilities to connect parties P2P for the autonomous transfer of value. You can get away with a large securities heist or a large currency heist. The Veritaseum team is what powers the value behind the Veritas token. A large theft of those tokens after a fork is as valuable as stealing 90M empty plastic cups.\u201dThe hack is still being investigated, and so far there is limited information out there.

Researchers are required to find flaws involving remote code execution, attack methods that might help in obtaining crypto data on clients or relays, local privilege escalation and illegal access to user data.The prize money offered per flaw is certainly the real attraction. The organization is offering an amount between $2000 and $4000 for high severity bugs and between $500 and $2000 for medium severity flaws. If the vulnerability affects third-party libraries used by the Tor Project will also be rewarded with $500 to $2000 depending on severity.

This is how they can link their phone with the profile so that when a user forgets the password, they can prove his authenticity and receive a new password on their smartphone.However, in case the user stops using the phone number linked to their Facebook profile and changes it to another one, there are chances that the previous number can be assigned to someone else. This is where the problem begins.According to the research conducted by a computer programmer James Martindale, Facebook accounts can be easily hacked using your old phone number. Because if the new owner of your previous number performs password reset while attempting to logging in to Facebook, it is very much possible to gain full control of your account.The account recovery system of Facebook is to be blamed for this mishap. When a user forgets his/her password, it becomes the responsibility of Facebook\u2019s account recovery system to help the user access the account by sending an SMS message on their phone number containing a unique code. This code allows the user to regain access to the account and set a new password. So, when your old number is acquired by someone else, using the unique code the new owner of your previous phone number can hijack the Facebook account. It does not require any social engineering skills to perform the hack.Martindale himself tried this trick by buying a new SIM and was surprised to receive a message from Facebook as soon as he inserted the SIM into his phone. He shared his findings in a blog post on Medium, where he wrote:\u201cI was curious. I knew Facebook by default lets people find your account with your phone number, so I typed the number into the search bar and see what came up.\u201dTo receive the password recovery option, he typed in a password and then received a code on his newly bought phone number to login to the account. As per the analysis of Martindale, this trick is fairly simple, but its consequences are quite drastic since hackers can use Facebook accounts for spreading various kinds of scams or may sell the accounts on the black market. They can also blackmail the original user for money in exchange of profile.This also poses a threat to other contacts of the hacked account as every friend of the user can be threatened, specifically extorted for money. Another startling revelation made by Martindale was that FreedomPop VoIP carrier that he uses allows him to modify his phone number by showing him a list of available number for just $5. All you have to do is to try all the numbers to log in to Facebook and once a match is found the hacker can hijack a Facebook account, explained Martindale.What\u2019s even more troubling is that Facebook, despite considering it a real threat, did not include this issue in its bug bounty program. \u201cFacebook doesn\u2019t have control over telecom providers who reissue phone numbers or with users having a phone number linked to their Facebook account that is no longer registered to them\u201d is the excuse provided by their website.However, the trick can only work if your account is still linked to your old phone number. If you keep on updating your contact details, your account will remain protected. To keep your account safe, you need to remove any old phone number(s) and email IDs from your account and also use two-step login authorization feature.PS: Isn\u2019t that common sense?Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Facebook", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Social Engineering", "Social Media"], "title": "Your Old Phone Number Can Be Used To Hack Facebook Account", "date": "July 21, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Exclusive: The Bank of America is the 2nd largest bank in the United States by assets which makes it a lucrative target for cyber criminals. Today, HackRead has identified a phishing scam targeting the Bank of America customers.Cyber criminals are sending emails to unsuspecting users pretending to be representatives of the Bank of America. In the email, the sender is informing users that for their security, the bank has put limits on their account and the only way to get rid of limits is to confirm that they own the account.Whoever has sent the email has a terrible grammar, but it\u2019s our responsibility to inform users therefore here\u2019s the full preview of the phishing email.\u201cDear User: You have \u201csame\u201d usage limits in order to protect your \u201cpriority.\u201d The limits will be lifted after confirming your \u201cinformations.\u201d You \u201cneed just\u201d to confirm your information by \u201cfollow\u201d the next steps: Click the link below to open a secure browser window. Confirm that you\u2019re the owner of the account, and then follow the instructions.\u201dThe supposed confirmation can only be done when the victim clicks on the link given in the email to sign in. However, in reality, clicking on the link will redirect the victim to another fake page asking them to sign in with their Online ID and passcode.Once signed in, the cyber criminals already have victim\u2019s login credentials, but they want more, therefore, the victim has to fill a form with their personal and financial information and click continue. The details a victim needs to enter include first and last name, address, city, zip code, mobile number, email address, credit card number, card expiry date and CVV number.Upon clicking the continue tab, the victim is taken to yet another fake page which shows a message stating that \u201cPlease synchronize your BOA account with your email to secure every transaction by card.\u201dIn reality clicking the Synchronize tab is the second part of this phishing scam in which cyber criminals aim to steal the victim\u2019s email account credentialsAlthough, this is enough to identify that it\u2019s a phishing scam if an unsuspecting user decides to \u201cSynchronize\u201d their account and log in with their email it will result in losing their account. But to make things look real, the cyber criminals have designed the Hotmail page in a way that by clicking the \u201cLogin\u201d tab they will be taken to the official Outlook page.HackRead has identified that this scam is being run through a Russian hosting provider \u201cBeget.\u201d The scammers are using [http://sgfreef7.beget.tech] domain to host the scam.We have informed the hosting provider about the scam and hopefully, it will soon be shut down. However, one has to give credit to scammers who, despite their terrible grammar, did an excellent job in designing these fake login pages.The login and security page looks like the official BOA page, and without any doubt, if correct English grammar was used the scam would have tricked a lot of unsuspecting users since the email is delivered directly to the inbox and not the spam folder.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Banking", "hacking", "internet", "Phishing", "Phishing Scam", "Scam", "security"], "title": "Beware: New Bank of America Phishing Scam Stealing Card Data", "date": "July 21, 2017"}, {"authur": "Carolina", "body": "Without a doubt, hoverboards are the latest fad. Hoverboards are indeed very useful as these aren\u2019t only easy to use but make traveling so much fun. The recent trend of trying to make every device internet connected has not spared hoverboards; they even come with rider applications. The app allows the user to perform cool tasks like modifying the colors of light, controlling the hoverboard remotely and checking the remaining battery life and mileage. Resultantly, the latter half of 2016 recorded an unprecedented surge in the use of smart hoverboards. However, this is exactly why hoverboards are not very safe to be used anymore.According to the latest research from IOActive, a renowned and reliable cyber-security firm, the Segway MiniPro \u201cself-balancing personal transporter\u201d can be hacked through a Bluetooth connection. IOActive\u2019s security researcher Thomas Kilbride said that it is possible to control the device without using any \u201cspecial hardware\u201d from a 30feet distance. On the other hand, with special hardware, hackers can control the scooter from hundreds of feet away. The damage caused by this vulnerability is also quite serious. Apart from putting the rider in danger, hackers can identify the location of other riders using the app and control more than one hoverboard simultaneously.Segway MiniPro quasi-hoverboard is the current favorite among consumers and riders. It lets the rider control the scooter using the official app. However, it is quite upsetting that the firmware is vulnerable to hacking simply through Bluetooth. As per IOActive research, the scooter can be hacked while it is in use by the rider.IOActive informed Segway about the vulnerability in its app back in January after which the maker introduced another version of its official app in April.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Gadget", "hacking", "Hoverboard", "internet", "IoT", "security"], "title": "Remotely Controllable Hoverboards Latest Target of Hackers", "date": "July 20, 2017"}]
