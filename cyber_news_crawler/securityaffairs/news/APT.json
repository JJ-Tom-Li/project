We attribute this activity to TEMP.Zagros (reported by Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro as MuddyWater), an Iran-nexus actor that has been active since at least May 2017.\u201d reads the analysis published by the experts at FireEye. \n\n\u201cThis actor has engaged in prolific spear phishing of government and defense entities in Central and Southwest Asia. The spear phishing emails and attached malicious macro documents typically have geopolitical themes. When successfully executed, the malicious documents install a backdoor we track as POWERSTATS.\u201d \n\nThe TEMP.Zagros was first spotted by researchers at PaloAlto Networks in 2017, the hackers targeted various industries in several countries with spear-phishing messages.\n\nAttackers used weaponized documents typically having geopolitical themes, such as documents purporting to be from the National Assembly of Pakistan or the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology.\n\nLast week expert at Trend Micro also attributed the new wave of attacks to the MuddyWater threat actor.\n\n\u201cWe discovered a new campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan and Tajikistan that has some similarities with an earlier campaign named MuddyWater, which hit various industries in several countries, primarily in the Middle East and Central Asia.\u201d states the analysis published by Trend Micro.\n\nAccording to FireEye report, TEMP.Zagros attackers are adopting a new backdoor dubbed POWERSTATS for backdoors and the reuse of a known technique for lateral movements.\n\nEach of these macro-based documents used similar techniques for code execution, persistence, and communication with the command and control (C2) server.\n\nHackers re-used the AppLocker bypass and lateral movement techniques for the purpose of indirect code execution. The IP address in the lateral movement techniques was substituted with the local machine IP address to achieve code execution on the system.\n\n\u201cIn this campaign, the threat actor\u2019s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) shifted after about a month, as did their targets.\u201d continues FireEye.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe campaign started on Jan. 23 involved a macro-based document that dropped a VBS file and an INI file containing a Base64 encoded PowerShell command.\n\nThe Base64 encoded PowerShell command will be decoded and executed by PowerShell using the command line generated by the VBS file on execution using WScript.exe.\n\nAttackers used a differed VBS script for each sample, employing different levels of obfuscation and different ways of invoking the next stage of the process tree.\n\nStarting from Feb. 27, 2018, hackers used a new variant of the macro that does not use VBS for PowerShell code execution. The new variant uses a new code execution techniques leveraging INF and SCT files.\n\nResearchers at FireEye also found Chinese strings in the malicious code used by TEMP.Zagros that were left as false flags to make hard the attribution.\n\n\u201cDuring analysis, we observed a code section where a message written in Chinese and hard coded in the script will be printed in the case of an error while connecting to the C2 server:\u201d states FireEye.\n\nIndicators of compromise (IoCs) and other info are included in the report published by FireEye.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 MuddyWater, APT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/muddywater", "topic_name": "MuddyWater"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/temp-zagros", "topic_name": "TEMP.Zagros"}]}, {"news_name": "Russia-linked Sofacy APT targets an unnamed European Government agency", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70391/apt/sofacy-apt-european-government.html", "title": "Russia-linked Sofacy APT targets an unnamed European Government agency\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 18, 2018", "body": "Last week the US Government announced sanctions against five Russian entities and 19 individuals, including the FSB, the military intelligence agency GRU.\n\nDespite the sanctions, Russian hackers continue to target entities worldwide, including US organizations.\n\nThe Russian spy agencies and the individuals are accused of trying to influence the 2016 presidential election and launching massive NotPetya ransomware campaign and other attacks on businesses in the energy industry.\n\nLast year, the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a joint technical alert to warn of attacks on US critical infrastructure powered by Russian threat actors.

One of the differences was a particularly clever evasion technique.\u201d\n\nThe attacks uncovered by PaloAlto aimed at a government organization in Europe used a spear phishing email referencing the \u201cUnderwater Defence & Security\u201d conference, which will take place in the U.K. later this month.\n\nWhile previous versions of DealersChoice loaded a malicious Flash object as soon as the bait document was opened, the samples analyzed by PaloAlto that were related to the last attacks include the Flash object on page three of the document and it\u2019s only loaded if users scroll down to it.\n\n\u201cThe user may not notice the Flash object on the page, as Word displays it as a tiny black box in the document, as seen in Figure 1.

Most of the identified victims were in the United States, some of them located in Europe and at least one in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe campaign is linked to a group of suspected Chinese cyber espionage actors we have tracked since 2013, dubbed TEMP.Periscope.

The APT32 is also targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations, and security firms that may have connections with foreign investors.\n\nResearchers at Volexity has been tracking the threat actor since May 2017, they observed attacks aimed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and media, human rights, and civil society organizations.\n\nVietnamese APT32 group is today one of the most advanced APTs in the threat landscape, Volexity researchers compared the APT with the dreaded s Russia-linked Turla APT.\n\nThe group is well-resourced, it continues to use along with old techniques.\n\n\u201cA great deal of research about this group was published last year, including\npapers such as those from CyberReason, a lengthy global view from FireEye and the watering-hole explanation from Volexity. We see that this group keeps updating their backdoors, infrastructure, and infection vectors.\u201d reads the analysis published by ESET.\n\n\u201cOceanLotus continues its activity particularly targeting company and government networks in East-Asian countries. A few months ago, we discovered and analyzed one of their latest backdoors. Several tricks are being used to convince the user to execute the backdoor, to slow down its analysis and to avoid detection.\u201d\n\nThe threat actors started adopting a new backdoor that provides them with remote access and full control on the infected systems.\n\nOceanLotus\u2019s attack is carried on in two stages, in the first phase the hackers leverage a dropper, delivered via spear-phishing messages, to gain the initial foothold on the targeted system, then the malicious code prepares the stage for the backdoor.\n\n\u201cOver the past few months, a number of decoy documents have been used. One of them was a fake TrueType font updater for the Roboto Slab regular font. This choice of font seems a bit odd since it does not support a lot of East-Asian languages.\u201d reads the analysis.\n\n\u201cWhen executed, this binary decrypts its resource (XOR with a 128-byte, hardcoded key) and decompresses the decrypted data (LZMA). The legitimate RobotoSlab-Regular.ttf file is written into the %temp% folder and run via Win32 API function ShellExecute.\n\nThe shellcode decrypted from the resource is executed. After its execution, the fake font updater drops another application whose sole purpose is to delete the dropper. This \u201ceraser\u201d application is dropped as %temp%\\[0-9].tmp.exe.\u201d\n\n\n\nAttackers also powered watering hole attacks using fake installers posing as updates for popular applications.\n\nOne of the installers used by the APT is the repackaged Firefox installer described by 360 Labs on Freebuf (Chinese language).\n\nResearchers noticed that attackers\u2019 dropper package includes several components, the whole process of installation and execution relies heavily on multiple layers of obfuscation to prevent detection. The dropper also included garbage code to avoid being detected and code designed to delete the bait document.\n\nThe dropper gain persistence by creating a Windows service if administrator privileges are available, or modifies the operating system\u2019s registry if executed with normal privileges.\n\nThe backdoor is able to execute tens of commands, including fingerprint the system, create a process, call the PE Loader, drop and execute a program and run shellcode in a new thread.\n\n\u201cOnce again, OceanLotus shows that the team is active and continues to update its toolset. This also demonstrates its intention to remain hidden by picking its targets, limiting the distribution of their malware and using several different servers to avoid attracting attention to a single domain or IP address.\u201d concludes ESET.\n\n\u201cThe encryption of the payload, together with the side-loading technique \u2013 despite\nits age \u2013 is a good way to stay under the radar, since the malicious activities look like they come from the legitimate application.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 OceanLotus , APT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt32", "topic_name": "APT32"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oceanlotus", "topic_name": "OceanLotus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "China-Linked APT15 used new backdoors in attack against UK Government\u2019s service provider", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70140/hacking/apt15-uk-gov-contractor.html", "title": "China-Linked APT15 used new backdoors in attack against UK Government\u2019s service provider\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 12, 2018", "body": "Last week Ahmed Zaki, a senior malware researcher at NCC Group, presented at the  Kaspersky\u2019s Security Analyst Summit (SAS), details of a malware-based attack against the service provider for the UK Government launched by the APT15 China-linked group (aka Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda and Playful Dragon).\n\n\u201cIn May 2017, NCC Group\u2019s Incident Response team reacted to an ongoing incident where our client, which provides a range of services to UK Government, suffered a network compromise involving the advanced persistent threat group APT15.\u201d reads a blog post published by NCC Group.\n\nNCC stop the investigation in June 2017 on explicit request of the victim but resumed it in August after the APT15 hackers managed to regain access to the victim\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cAPT15 managed to regain access a couple of weeks later via the corporate VPN solution with a stolen VPN certificate, which they had extracted from a compromised host.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe attack is likely part of a wider operation aimed at contractors at various UK government departments and military organizations.\n\nAPT15 has been active since at least 2010, it conducted cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide.

All of these attacks are focused on destruction and disruption of equipment not exfiltration of data or other, more subtle attacks. Using legitimate tools such as PsExec and WMI the attackers are specifically targeting the pyeongchang2018.com domain attempting to steal browser and system credentials to move laterally in the network and then wiping the victim computer to make it unusable.\n\n\u201cDisruption is the clear objective in this type of attack and it leaves us confident in thinking that the actors behind this were after embarrassment of the Olympic committee during the opening ceremony.\u201d reads the analysis published by Talos.\n\nKaspersky experts found samples of the malware at several ski resorts in South Korea, even if they analyzed the malicious code they were not able to attribute the attack to a specific actor.\n\n\n\nThe experts identified a unique \u201cfingerprint\u201d associated with the North Korea-linked Lazarus APT, but other evidence collected by the experts revealed important inconsistencies suggesting a false flag operation.\n\n\u201cWhat we discovered next brought a big shock. Using our own in-house malware similarity system we have discovered a unique pattern that linked Olympic Destroyer to Lazarus. A combination of certain code development environment features stored in executable files, known as Rich header, may be used as a fingerprint identifying the malware authors and their projects in some cases. In case of Olympic Destroyer wiper sample analyzed by Kaspersky Lab this \u201cfingerprint\u201d gave a 100% match with previously known Lazarus malware components and zero overlap with any other clean or malicious file known to date to Kaspersky Lab.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\nKaspersky also found evidence that would suggest the malicious code was developed by the Russia-linked Sofacy APT  (aka Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, APT28, Sednit, Tsar Team, and Strontium.).\n\n\u201cwe have seen attackers using NordVPN and MonoVM hosting. Both services are available for bitcoins, which make them the perfect tool for APT actors. This and several other TTPs have in the past been used by the Sofacy APT group, a widely known Russian-language threat actor.\u201d continues Kaspersky.\n\nIs it possible that Russian APT attempted to frame Lazarus?  Maybe.\n\nAnother possible scenario sees Lazarus using false flag in the Olympics attack.\n\n\u201cThere are some open questions about the attacker\u2019s motivation in this story. We know that the attackers had administrative accounts in the affected networks. By deleting backups and destroying all local data they could have easily devastated the Olympic infrastructure. Instead, they decided to do some \u201clight\u201d destruction: wiping files on Windows shares, resetting event logs, deleting backups, disabling Windows services and rebooting systems into an unbootable state.\u201d concluded Kaspersky.\n\n \u201cWhen you add in the multiple similarities to TTPs used by other actors and malware, intentional false flags and relatively good opsec, it merely raises more questions as to the purpose of all this.\u201d \n\nThis case demonstrates the difficulty in the attribution of APT attacks.\n\nFurther details are available in the Kaspersky\u2019s report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Olympic Destroyer, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-games", "topic_name": "'Olympic Games'"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus", "topic_name": "Lazarus"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/olympic-destroyer", "topic_name": "Olympic Destroyer"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sofacy", "topic_name": "Sofacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-atatcks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored atatcks"}]}, {"news_name": "Bitcoin-linked heist: thieves stolen 600 powerful computers in Iceland", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69805/security/600-powerful-computers.html", "title": "Bitcoin-linked heist: thieves stolen 600 powerful computers in Iceland\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 3, 2018", "body": "Cyber criminal organization continue to show a great interest in cryptocurrencies, the number of crimes against cryptocurrency industry is on the rise.\n\nNews of the day is that crooks have stolen 600 powerful computers from data centers in Iceland to use in Bitcoin mining.

The OopsIE Trojan communicates with the C&C over HTTP by using the InternetExplorer application object.\n\n\u201cBy using the InternetExplorer application object, all C2 related requests will look as if they came from the legitimate browser and therefore will not contain any anomalous fields within the request, such as custom User-Agents. The OopsIE Trojan is configured to use a C2 server hosted at:\n\nwww.msoffice365cdn[.]com\u201d states the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe Trojan will construct specific URLs to communicate with the C2 server and parses the C2 server\u2019s response looking for content within the tags <pre> and </pre>. The initial HTTP request acts as a beacon\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Trojan can run a command, upload a file, or download a specified file.\n\nOilrig will continue to adapt its tactics, the experts believe that it will remain a highly active threat actor in the Middle East region.\n\n\u201cThis group has repeatedly shown evidence of a willingness to adapt and evolve their tactics, while also reusing certain aspects as well. We have now observed this adversary deploy a multitude of tools, with each appearing to be some form of iterative variation of something used in the past. However, although the tools themselves have morphed over time, the plays they have executed in their playbook largely remain the same when examined over the attack life cycle,\u201d Palo Alto concludes.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 OilRig, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oilrig", "topic_name": "OilRig"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oopsie-trojan", "topic_name": "OopsIE trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Russia-linked Sofacy APT group shift focus from NATO members to towards the Middle East and Central Asia", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69365/apt/sofacy-apt-east.html", "title": "Russia-linked Sofacy APT group shift focus from NATO members to towards the Middle East and Central Asia\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 21, 2018", "body": "The Russia-linked APT28 group (aka Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit, Tsar Team and Strontium.) made the headlines again, this time security experts from Kaspersky highlighted a shift focus in their interest, from NATO member countries and Ukraine to towards the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\n\u201cSofacy, one of the most active APT we monitor, continues to spearphish their way into targets, reportedly widely phishes for credentials, and infrequently participates in server side activity (including host compromise with BeEF deployment, for example). KSN visibility and detections suggests a shift from their early 2017 high volume NATO spearphish targeting towards the middle east and Central Asia, and finally moving their focus further east into late 2017.\u201d states Kaspersky.\n\nThe experts analyzed the infections of the Sofacy backdoor tracked as SPLM, CHOPSTICK and X-Agent, the APT group had been increasingly targeting former Soviet countries in Central Asia. The hackers mostly targeted telecoms companies and defense-related organization, primary target were entities in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe researchers observed several attacks leveraging the SPLM and the Zebrocy tool between the second and fourth quarters of 2017 against organizations in Asia. The list of targeted countries included China, Mongolia, South Korea and Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis high level of cyber-espionage activity goes back years. In 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as \u201cSofacy\u201d or SOURFACE) as their first stage malware, which at the time had similarities with the old Miniduke implants.\u201d states Kaspersky.\n\n\u201cThis made us believe the two groups were connected, although it looks they split ways at a certain point, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant in 2014. The division in malware was consistent and definitive at that point.\u201d\n\nThe Zebrocy tool was used by attackers to collect data from victims, researchers observed its involvement in attacks on accounting firms, science and engineering centers, industrial organizations, ministries, embassies and consulates, national security and intelligence agencies, press and translation services, and NGOs.\n\nThe researchers highlighted that the attack infrastructure used in the last attacks pointed to the Sofacy APT, the group has been fairly consistent throughout even if their TTPs were well documented by security firms across the years. Researchers at Kaspersky expect to see some significant changes this year.\n\n\u201cSofacy set up and maintained multiple servers and c2 for varying durations, registering fairly recognizable domains with privacy services, registrars that accept bitcoin, fake phone numbers, phony individual names, and 1 to 1 email address to domain registration relationships. Some of this activity and patterns were publicly disclosed, so we expect to see more change in their process in 2018. Also, throughout the year and in previous years, researchers began to comment publicly on Sofacy\u2019s fairly consistent infrastructure setup.\u201d continues Kaspersky.\n\nFurther details are included in the analysis published by Kaspersky, including Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Sofacy APT, Asia)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt28", "topic_name": "APT28"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/asia", "topic_name": "Asia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sofacy", "topic_name": "Sofacy"}]}, {"news_name": "North Korean APT Group tracked as APT37 broadens its horizons", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69339/apt/apt37-broadens-horizons.html", "title": "North Korean APT Group tracked as APT37 broadens its horizons\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 21, 2018", "body": "Here we are to speak about a nation-state actor dubbed APT37 (aka Reaper, Group123, ScarCruft) that is believed to be operating on behalf of the North Korean government.\n\nAPT37 has been active since at least 2012, it made the headlines in early February when researchers revealed that the APT group leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player to deliver malware to South Korean users.\n\nCyber attacks conducted by the APT37 group mainly targeted government, defense, military, and media organizations in South Korea.\n\nFireEye linked the APT37 group to the North Korean government based on the following clues:\n\nResearchers from FireEye revealed that the nation-state actor also targeted entities in Japan, Vietnam, and even the Middle East in 2017. The hackers targeted organizations in the chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, aerospace, healthcare, and automotive sectors.\n\n\u201cAPT37 has likely been active since at least 2012 and focuses on targeting the public and private sectors primarily in South Korea.

The VBS campaign is composed of 4 steps with additional payloads and 3 distinct functions that are: Reconnaissance, Persistence, and Pivoting.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report the first stage starts with a VBScript named  \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627.vbs (\u201cFrom inside Iran\u2019s secret war in Syria.vbs\u201d) that is aimed to create in the second stage a PowerShell script that will generate a Microsoft Office document named Report.doc and to open it. On the third stage, the opened document contains a macro that creates a WSF (Windows Script File) file to be executed. On the fourth stage the script contains configuration information such as: The hostname of the command and control server, the port used 2095 and the User-Agent.\n\nAs the report notice, the User-Agent strings are being used to the identification of targets, while the command and control server filter these strings to only allow connections based in these criteria. The script tries to register the infected system with an HTTP request, which in turn executes an infinite loop to further download and use other payloads. The researchers discovered three types of additional payloads that are the following: s0, s1, and s2. These payloads for WSF scripts are VBScript functions that are loaded and executed in ExecuteGlobal() and GetRef() APIs. The difference between the payloads resides on the number of arguments supplied to execute the function.\n\nThe researchers found out a reconnaissance function in the earlier steps of the campaign that was intended to acquire information on the targeted system, verify if it contained significant information or if it was a sandbox machine. The hackers layered out a methodology composed of these steps: first acquiring the serial number of disk volume, and then using a payload to acquire information on any anti-virus software present on the system. Next, by querying ipify.org the hackers tried to obtain the IP address of the infected machines to further obtain the computer name, username, operating system and architecture.\n\nA second function is used to list the drives on the system and its type.\n\nFinally, the researchers cover the remaining two functions: Persistence and Pivoting. Persistence functions were used alongside the reconnaissance functions linked to the WSF script. While the first script was used to persist, the second was used to clean the infected system to cover its tracks. Regarding the Pivoting function, it receives an argument where the PowerShell script executes a second base64 encoded script intended to download shellcode from 176.107.185.246 to be mapped in the memory and then executed.\n\nAs the researchers noticed, the hackers behind the campaign had been very careful to protect their infrastructure and their code against the leak. The command and control server was protected by CloudFlare to avoid tracking and difficult the analysis. Furthermore, by using filters on the User-Agents the hackers selected requests that only meet their criteria.\n\nThe Threat Actor was only seen active during the morning, on the Central European Time zone, to unleash their attacks and payloads. Once infected the operating system receives the pivot function to disable the firewall and allow the unique IP to receive the shellcode. Next, the server becomes unreachable. The researchers point out: \u201cThis high level of OPSEC is exceptional even among presumed state-sponsored threat actors\u201d.\n\nThe researchers also noticed some similarities with Jenxcus (Houdini/H-Worn), but it was not clear if it is a new version or an adaption. They for sure agree that it is far more advanced in the resources it presents. The researchers state:\n\n\u201cThis document is a weekly report about the major events occurring during the 1st week of November 2017, talking about the most important events happening in Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Russia, ISIS and the ongoing Gulf Countries conflict with Qatar. These campaigns show us that at least one threat actor is interested in and targeting the Middle East. Due to the nature of the decoy documents, we can conclude that the intended targets have an interest in the geopolitical context of the region\u201d.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.securityweek.com/actor-targeting-middle-east-shows-excellent-opsec\n\nhttp://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/02/10/targeted-attacks-middle-east/\n\nhttp://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/02/targeted-attacks-in-middle-east.html\n\nhttps://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east\n\nhttps://cyware.com/news/targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east-8e454752\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and an enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

The country does not have any global technological franchises, such as Apple or Samsung, and its citizens continue to have limited access to any basic internet or smartphone apps.\n\nHowever, the regime of Kim Jong Un has become increasingly adept at entering computer systems across the globe for the strategic benefit and financial gain.\n\nAccording to statistics, North Korea\u2018s \u2018cyber-soldiers\u2019 have been linked to the stolen US-South Korean military plans, alleged theft of $60 million from a Taiwanese bank, and the collapse of the Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nEven as the US begins to concentrate on the North Korean development of nuclear weapons, Kim Jong Un is attacking from the rear with aggressive NK hackers.\n\nThe North Korean nation has experienced limited access to the free flow of online information. The majority of citizens can view only a few websites within the country, but with close government and media agency monitoring.\n\nA select few of these agencies have international access, but the activities are carefully monitored to avoid any unwanted interactions.\n\nFor several years, North Korea had a single link to the global internet via the state-owned China United New Communications corporation; however, it recently secured a second link via Russian telecommunications company in October 2017.\n\nAccording to Fergus Hanson, the head of the International Cyber Policy Center at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, North Korea currently employees an estimated 1,700 state-sponsored hackers to deal with online interactions.\n\nKim Jong Il, the father of current leader Kim Jong Un, was an early proponent of technology to be used as a form of modern weaponry.\n\nThe military worked on several methods for disrupting GPS systems and setting off electromagnetic pulses to obstruct computer capabilities in other countries.\n\nIt is thought that North Korea set up Unit 121 \u2013 an early cyber-warrior squad approximately twenty years ago as part of the NK\u2019s military.\n\nThe unit started to draw attention to its existence in 2004 during allegations of alleged \u2018tapping\u2019 into South Korea\u2019s military wireless communication and for testing malicious computer coding.\n\nIn 2011, South Korea arrested five hackers allegedly working as North Korean hackers for stealing several millions of dollars via an online game.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s \u2018cyber-warriors\u2019 began to draw international attention during 2014 when headlines stated an alleged intrusion into the Sony Corporation\u2019s film business.\n\nSony was preparing to release a movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco called \u2018The Interview\u2019 \u2013 a comedy about meeting the leader of North Korea.\n\nAll efforts of the intrusion seemed to be the protection of Kim\u2019s image and punishment of the studio.\n\nLeaked documentation of the hack-damaged careers in Hollywood resulted in Sony having to compensate over $8 million in damages.\n\nOnce North Korea got publicly identified as the perpetrator, the NK government denied involvement and publicly declared the US as slandering them.\n\nDespite several accusations being made of hacking attacks, North Korea continues to deny their involvement.\n\n\n\nCurrently, North Korea has improved the cyber attacks among rising tensions with the US and rest of the globe.  In 2016, a hacking group associated with North Korea getting accused of the theft of $81 million from a central bank account in Bangladesh.\n\nIn May 2017, cyber-security researchers linked the WannaCry ransom-ware attack to a North Korean hacking group known as Lazarus.\n\nThis hack resulted in the intrusion of over 300,000 computers and threatened the loss of data unless a \u2018ransom\u2019 was paid \u2013 typically, $300 in bitcoin within three days.\n\nAccording to Europol, this is one of the most unprecedented hacks to date.\n\nDespite the association with Lazarus, North Korean hackers have increased efforts to secure cryptocurrency, which could be used to avoid trade restrictions in recent sanctions approved by the UN.\n\nSouth Korea is currently investigating the possible North Korean involvement of the cryptocurrency exchange eight months after the country hacked the target.\n\nNot exactly.\n\nIt was seen in October that a South Korean legal maker stated that Kim\u2019s cyber-warriors stole military plans produced by South Korea in a case of armed conflict.\n\nThe plans included a classified section known as \u2018decapitation strike, which was aimed at removing the North Korean leader.  The lawmaker attacked the South Korean armed forces for allowing the breach in military enforcement causing a mistake in the service.\n\nRhee Cheol-hee agrees that he had worked with defense officials and they are not supposed to save such vital data on PC files.\n\nA US military aide stated that, despite the alleged hack, the UK continues to place confidence in South Korea and their ability to deal with the challenges of North Korea. Some suspect that North Korea may ramp up money counterfeiting to also help fund the regime.\n\nBelieve it or not, the US has not been standing by as North Korea regains its connection to the internet.  North Korea has restored an online relationship via Russia after China\u2019s faltering strategy.\n\nThe link was reportedly distributed under a denial of service attack with a flood of data traffic being produced to overwhelm and obstruct computer systems in the US.\n\nMeanwhile, US president Donald Trump has criticized the North Korean leader for this development of nuclear weapons stating that the US may use military force against the regime.\n\nNorth Korea has, however, warned that nuclear war by occurring at any moment with South Korea and the UK being joined naval drills.\n\nAll hacking efforts appear to be continuing amidst the current political tensions.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s hackers continue to push for valuable intelligence and harder currently, while traditional military forces engage with the chance of war.\n\nWhile Lazarus may have been associated with the theft of $60 million from Taiwan\u2019s Far Eastern International Bank, the malware used bore features of Lazarus and was an international highlight.\n\n \n\nWritten by Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at Cyberogism.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is a privacy and cyber security enthusiast, his work has been featured in many major tech and security blogs including InfosecInstitute, Hackread, ValueWalk, Intego, and SecurityAffairs to name a few.

Designed to make website development easier and providing additional features not supported by standard web browsers, it also adds complexity and a much broader attack surface. Web browsers no longer support Flash by default, but users often re-enable it for convenience. And just having it installed on your system may be enough for this latest zero-day Adobe Player vulnerability to be exploited.\n\nKISA, the South Korean CERT issued a security bulletin on January 31, 2018, warning of a \u201cuse-after-free\u201d vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player being actively exploited in the wild. The following day, Adobe issued Security Advisory APSA18-01 confirming CVE-2018-4878 as a potential remote code vulnerability and announcing plans to release a security patch on February 5, 2018. The attack is carried out with a malicious SWF file embedded inside a Microsoft Office or Hancom Hangul document or spreadsheet. Once opened, the victim\u2019s computer executes the malicious SWF through Adobe Flash if it is installed.\n\n\u201cUpon opening and successful exploitation, a decryption key for an encrypted embedded payload would be downloaded from compromised third-party websites hosted in South Korea,\u201d according to FireEye.\n\nThe embedded payload is likely to be DOGCALL malware which facilitates the installation of ROKRAT command and control trojan which gives the remote attackers access to the victim\u2019s system.\n\nExperts warn that while waiting for the patch from Adobe on February 5th, users should be very cautious opening unexpected spreadsheets and document files. In reality, one should always be wary of any unexpected or suspicious document, especially ones that support embedding since they can hide all kinds of malware. You should also strongly consider uninstalling Adobe Flash. Even if it is disabled in your browser, having it installed on your system is enough for this latest exploit to execute successfully. Chances are you don\u2019t need Adobe Flash any more.

Called TEMP.Reaper by FireEye and Group 123 by Cisco, the group with ties to North Korea was very active in 2017.\n\nAccording to FireEye: \u201cHistorically, the majority of their targeting has been focused on the South Korean government, military, and defense industrial base; however, they have expanded to other international targets in the last year.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition to expanding their targets, the hacking group appears to have been expanding its skills, utilizing a variety of different techniques to deploy destructive wiper malware and the command and control trojans.\n\nThere have been many hacking accusations pointed at North Korea in the past few years. With tensions rising in 2017 and the impending Olympics in South Korea this month there is a lot of opportunities and potential motivation for something significant. This latest attack shows that this hacking group is poised to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAs described by Cisco\u2019s Talos security team, \u201cGroup 123 have now joined some of the criminal elite with this latest payload of ROKRAT. They have used an Adobe Flash 0 day which was outside of their previous capabilities \u2013 they did use exploits in previous campaigns but never a net new exploit as they have done now. This change represents a major shift in Group 123s maturity level, we can now confidentially assess Group 123 has a highly skilled, highly motivated and highly sophisticated group.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 North Korea, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flash-zero-day", "topic_name": "Flash Zero-Day"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/group-123", "topic_name": "Group 123"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hangul-word-processor", "topic_name": "Hangul Word Processor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hwp", "topic_name": "HWP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rokrat-rat", "topic_name": "ROKRAT RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese Iron Tiger APT is back, a close look at the Operation PZChao", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68581/apt/operation-pzchao.html", "title": "Chinese Iron Tiger APT is back, a close look at the Operation PZChao\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 2, 2018", "body": "Malware researchers from Bitdefender have discovered and monitored for several months the activity of a custom-built backdoor capable of password-stealing, bitcoin-mining, and of course to gain full control of the victim\u2019s machine.\n\nThe campaign, dubbed by Bitdefender, Operation PZChao is targeting government, technology, education, and telecommunications organizations in Asia and the US.\n\n\u201cThis is also the case of a custom-built piece of malware that we have been monitoring for several months as it wrought havoc in Asia.

Instead, the developer created RGDoor using C++, which results in a compiled dynamic link library (DLL).\u201d states the analysis from PaloAlto Networks.\n\n\u201cThe DLL has an exported function named \u201cRegisterModule\u201d, which is important as it led us to believe that this DLL was used as a custom native-code HTTP module that the threat actor would load into IIS.\u201d \n\nThe attackers exploited the IIS 7 functionality that allows developers to create modules in C++ to extend IIS\u2019 capabilities, in this way they could carry out custom actions on requests\n\nThe \u201cnative-code modules can be installed either in the IIS Manager GUI or via the command-line using the \u2018appcmd\u2019 application,\u201d Palo Alto has explains.\n\n\n\nMalware researchers from Paloalto Networks discovered that the code calls the RegisterModule function with arguments that ignore inbound HTTP GET requests, but act on all HTTP POST requests.\n\nWhen the IIS server receives an inbound HTTP POST request, the backdoor parses the requests searching for the string in HTTP \u201cCookie\u201d field.\n\nThe find was used to issue cmd$ [command to execute], upload$ [path to file], or download$ [path to file] commands.\n\n\u201cRGDoor then constructs its own HTTP response by first setting the \u201cContent-Type\u201d field within the HTTP header to \u201ctext/plain\u201d.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe choice of the Cookie fields makes it hard to analyze inbound requests related to RGDoor backdoor because IIS does not log the values within these specific fields of inbound HTTP requests by default.\n\n\u201cThis backdoor has a rather limited set of commands, however, the three commands provide plenty of functionality for a competent backdoor, as they allow an actor to upload and download files to the sever, as well as run commands via command prompt.

Security researchers from Cisco\u2019s Talos group who have monitored the situation for 12 months have identified a North Korean threat actor tracked by the experts as Group 123 that conducted numerous malware attacks against entities in the South.\n\nIn three differed phishing campaigns tracked as \u201cGolden Time\u201d, \u201cEvil New Year\u201d and \u201cNorth Korean Human Rights\u201d South Korean victims were specifically infected with the Remote Access Trojan ROKRAT.\n\n\u201cOn January 2nd of 2018, the \u201cEvil New Year 2018\u201d was started. This campaign copies the approach of the 2017 \u201cEvil New Year\u201d campaign.\n\nThe links between the different campaigns include shared code and compiler artifacts such as PDB (Program DataBase) patterns which were present throughout these campaigns.\u201d reads the analysis published by Talos.\n\n\u201cBased on our analysis, the \u201cGolden Time\u201d, both \u201cEvil New Year\u201d and the \u201cNorth Korean Human Rights\u201d campaigns specifically targeted South Korean users.\u201d\n\nThe ROKRAT RAT was used to target Korean targets using the popular Korean Microsoft Word alternative Hangul Word Processor (HWP). In the past, we saw other attacks against people using the HWP application.\n\n\n\nThe three campaigns leveraged on a payload in the Hancom Hangul Office Suite, North Korean hackers exploited vulnerabilities such as the CVE-2013-0808 EPS viewer bug to deliver the RAT.\n\nThe attackers also used specially crafted files to trigger the arbitrary code execution vulnerability CVE-2017-0199. Group 123 also launched the FreeMilk campaign against financial institutions outside South Korea.\n\nThe hackers in this campaign used phishing message with a weaponized Microsoft Office document that was able to trigger the vulnerability CVE-2017-0199.\n\n\u201cGroup 123 used this vulnerability less than one month after its public disclosure.

In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla.\n\nIn the most recent attacks, the group is packaging its macOS backdoor with a real Adobe Flash installer and downloading the malware on victim systems from endpoint systems that use a remote IP belonging to Akamai, the Content Delivery Network that is also used by Adobe for its supply chain. Legitimate Flash installer, in fact, are also distributed through the Akamai network.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, we have observed a strange, new behavior, leading to compromise by one of Turla\u2019s backdoors. Not only is it packaged with the real Flash installer, but it also appears to be downloaded from adobe.com.\u201d reads the report published by ESET.\n\n\u201cFrom the endpoint\u2019s perspective, the remote IP address belongs to Akamai, the official Content Delivery Network (CDN) used by Adobe to distribute their legitimate Flash\ninstaller. \u201c\n\nResearchers noted that Turla installers were exfiltrating information to get.adobe.com URLs since at least July 2016, data were sent back to legitimate URLs at Adobe.com. The download attempts observed by ESET observed were made through HTTP and not via HTTPS, the researchers state with confidence that Adobe was not compromised.\n\nThe social engineering technique adopted by Turla group to trick victims into believing they are downloading a legitimate software from Adobe server is very ingenious.\n\nData collected by the experts revealed that most of the victims belong to the former USSR, targeted entities include embassies and consulates located in East Europe.\n\nAt the time of the report is still unclear how the Turla APT group distributed the backdoor through Adobe.com.\n\nExperts speculate that this is possible by compromising a machine on the victim\u2019s network to perform a local man-in-the-middle attack. In this attack scenario, the threat actors redirect traffic from a target system through the compromised server and modifying it on the fly. Another possibility is to leverage on a compromised local gateway that could allow the attackers to potentially intercept and modify traffic for the whole organization.\n\nOther attacks scenarios see Turla executing a man-in-the-middle attack at the ISP level, or BGP hijacking.\n\n\u201cWe quickly discarded the hypothesis of a rogue DNS server, since the IP address corresponds to the servers used by Adobe to distribute Flash.\u201d continues the report. \u201cThus, these are the hypotheses that remain: \u278a a Man-in-theMiddle\n(MitM) attack from an already-compromised machine in the local network, \u278b a compromised gateway or proxy of the organization, \u278c a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers.\u201d\n\n\n\nResearchers believe the most likely scenario sees attackers controlling the router for the traffic hijacking.\n\nSuch kind of attack is any way possible because the files are downloaded via HTTP, for this reason, it is important to avoid installing any update or software that was downloaded through unsecured connections.\n\nAdministrators must also check that Flash Player installers downloaded are properly signed with a valid Adobe certificate.\n\nFurther information, including the IOCs are included in the report published by ESET.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\nLazarus is believed to be the first nation state attacker that is targeting a point-of-sale using a framework to steal payment card data.\n\nThe timing is perfect, the hackers are intensifying their operation around Christmas shopping season.\n\nThe arsenal of the Lazarus APT group includes sophisticated custom-made malware, DDoS botnets, and wiper malware.\n\nThe research paper published by the experts detail a new implant dubbed PowerRatankba, a PowerShell-based malware variant that closely resembles the original Ratankba implant.\n\nExperts also documented a new and emerging threat dubbed RatankbaPOS targeting the point-of-sale systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Lazarus Group is a sophisticated, state-sponsored APT group with a long history of successful destructive, disruptive, and costly attacks on worldwide targets.

The targeted systems provided emergency shutdown capability for industrial processes.\u201d reads the analysis published by FireEye.\n\n\u201cWe assess with moderate confidence that the attacker was developing the capability to cause physical damage and inadvertently shutdown operations. This malware, which we call TRITON, is an attack framework built to interact with Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to report published by ICS cyber security firm Dragos, which tracked the threat as \u201cTRISIS\u201d, the victim was an industrial asset owner in the Middle East.\n\nThe Triton malware is designed to target Schneider Electric\u2019s Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers that are used in industrial environments to monitor the state of a process and restore it to a safe state or safely shut it down if parameters indicate a potentially hazardous situation.\n\nTRITON is designed to communicate using the proprietary TriStation protocol which is not publicly documented, this implies that the attackers reverse engineered the protocol to carry out the attack.\n\nNow, security experts at CyberX who analyzed samples of the malware provided further details on the attack, revealing that Triton was likely developed by Iran and used to target an organization in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIranian hackers are becoming even more aggressive, but experts always highlighted that  they are not particularly sophisticated.\n\nIn October, the OilRig gang was spotted using a new Trojan in attacks aimed at targets in the Middle East.\n\nOilRig is just one of the Iran-linked hacker crews, other groups tracked by security experts are APT33, Rocket Kitten, Cobalt Gypsy (Magic Hound), Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef) and CopyKittens.\n\nIn February, researchers at Palo Alto Networks have discovered a new cyber espionage campaign linked to Iran that targeted several organizations in the Middle East.\n\nThe espionage campaign dubbed Magic Hound, dates back at least mid-2016. Hackers targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology industries, all the targets are located or have an interest in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran was responsible for destructive attacks on Saudi Aramco systems in 2012.\n\nAccording to the experts, the shutdown was likely an accident during the reconnaissance phase conducted by the threat actors whose final goal was the sabotage.\n\nSchneider Electric is investigating the attack to discover if the threat actors exploited any vulnerability in the Triconex product.\n\nSchneider published a security advisory to warn its customers, it suggests avoiding leaving the front panel key position in \u201cProgram\u201d mode when the controller is not being configured. The malicious code can only deliver its payload if the key switch is set to this mode.\n\n\u201cSchneider Electric is aware of a directed incident targeting a single customer\u2019s Triconex Tricon safety shutdown system. We are working closely with our customer, independent cybersecurity organizations and ICSCERT to investigate and mitigate the risks of this type of attack.\u201d reads the security advisory.\n\n\u201cThe modules of this malware are designed to disrupt Triconex safety controllers, which are used widely in critical infrastructure. The malware requires the keyswitch to be in the \u201cPROGRAM\u201d mode in order to deliver its payload. Among others, the reported malware has the capability to scan and map the industrial control system environment to provide reconnaissance and issue commands directly to Tricon safety controllers.\u201d\n\nAccording to  Phil Neray, OT environments are \u2018vulnerable by design\u2019 for this reason they are a privileged target for hackers that could use them as an entry point in industrial environment.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little comical that Schneider Electric felt obliged to state that the attack did not leverage any vulnerabilities in the Tritex product,\u201d Phil Neray told SecurityWeek. \u201cOT environments are \u2018vulnerable by design\u2019 because they lack many of the controls we now take for granted in IT networks such as strong authentication. As a result, once an attacker gets into the OT network \u2014 by stealing credentials or connecting an infected laptop or USB, for example \u2014 they have almost free reign to connect to any control device they choose, and then reprogram them with malicious ladder logic to cause unsafe conditions.

This malware, which we call TRITON, is an attack framework built to interact with Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce gained access to the SIS system, the threat actor deployed the TRITON malware, a circumstance that indicates that attackers had a knowledge of such systems. According to FireEye the attackers pre-built and tested the tool which would require access to hardware and software that is not widely available. TRITON is also designed to communicate using the proprietary TriStation protocol which is not publicly documented, this implies that the attackers reverse engineered the protocol to carry out the attack.\n\nThe Triton malware interacts with Triconex SIS controllers., it is able to read and write programs and functions to and from the controller.\n\n\u201cTRITON was deployed on an SIS engineering workstation running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The malware was named to masquerade as the legitimate Triconex Trilog application. This application is used for reviewing logs and is a part of the TriStation application suite.\u201d continues FireEye.\n\n\u201cThe malware was delivered as a Py2EXE compiled python script dependent on a zip file containing standard Python libraries, open source libraries, as well as the attacker-developed Triconex attack framework for interacting with the Triconex controllers. Along with the executable, two binary files, inject.bin (malicious function code) and imain.bin (malicious control logic), were deployed as the controller\u2019s payload. These file names were hard coded in the Py2EXE compiled python script.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe hackers deployed the Triton malware on a Windows-based engineering workstation, the malicious code added its own programs to the execution table. In case of a failure, the malware attempts to return the controller to a running state, it also overwrites the malicious program with junk data if the attempt fails, likely to delete any track of the attack.\n\nThe attack against a SIS controller is very dangerous, once it has been compromised, the attacker can reprogram the device to trigger a safe state with a dramatic impact on the operations of the targeted environment. Attackers could also reprogram the SIS controller to avoid triggering actions when parameters assume dangerous values.\n\n\u201cThe attacker targeted the SIS suggesting an interest in causing a high-impact attack with physical consequences. This is an attack objective not typically seen from cyber-crime groups.\u201d continues FireEye.\n\n\u201cIf the SIS and DCS controls fail, the final line of defense is the design of the industrial facility, which includes mechanical protections on equipment (e.g. rupture discs), physical alarms, emergency response procedures and other mechanisms to mitigate dangerous situations.\u201d\n\nBack to the attack detected by FireEye, hackers shut down operations after causing the SIS controllers to initiate a safe shutdown, but experts believe they may have inadvertently triggered it during a reconnaissance phase.\n\nSchneider Electric is investigating the attack to discover if the threat actors exploited any vulnerability in the Triconex product.\n\nSchneider published a security advisory to warn its customers, it suggests to avoid leaving the front panel key position in \u201cProgram\u201d mode when the controller is not being configured.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\nThe malicious code used in this last campaign is an Android malware delivered as an APK file that has been designed to mimic a Korean bible app that was published in the Google Play by a developer named GODpeople.\n\nThe malicious APK wasn\u2019t available on the Google Play store and it is still unclear how the APT distributed it.\n\n\u201cThe McAfee Mobile Research team recently examined a new threat, Android malware that contains a backdoor file in the executable and linkable format (ELF). The ELF file is similar to several executables that have been reported to belong to the Lazarus cybercrime group.

Unless we receive a legitimate request originating from the owner of that system or a higher legal authority, we cannot release such information.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the computer there the archive was found revealed that it was already infected with malware.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\nIn June, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) issued a technical alert about the activity of the North Korea\u2019s \u2018Hidden Cobra\u2019 APT group.\n\nMany experts believe the WannaCry ransomware was developed by the Lazarus Group due to similarities in the attack codes. UK Government also linked the WannaCry attack that crippled NHS to North Korea.\n\nThe DHS and FBI issued a joint alert that reveals a remote administration tool (RAT) known as FALLCHILL was used by the North Korean hackers to target companies in the aerospace, finance, and telecommunications sectors.\n\n\u201cWorking with U.S. government partners, DHS and FBI identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with a remote administration tool (RAT) used by the North Korean government\u2014commonly known as FALLCHILL.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cAccording to trusted third-party reporting, HIDDEN COBRA actors have likely been using FALLCHILL malware since 2016 to target the aerospace, telecommunications, and finance industries. The malware is a fully functional RAT with multiple commands that the actors can issue from a command and control (C2) server to a victim\u2019s system via dual proxies. \u201c\n\nThe US experts identified 83 network nodes in the FALLCHILL infrastructure, including countries in which the infected IP addresses are registered.\n\nThe report includes a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), Network Signatures associated with the threat and Yara rules for its detection.\n\n\n\nThe US DHS also published a separate report on another threat, the Volgmer Trojan used by the North Korean government. The Volgmer is a backdoor Trojan \u201cdesigned to provide covert access to a compromised system,\u201d it has been used since 2013.\n\n\u201cVolgmer is a backdoor Trojan designed to provide covert access to a compromised system. Since at least 2013, HIDDEN COBRA actors have been observed using Volgmer malware in the wild to target the government, financial, automotive, and media industries.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cIt is suspected that spear phishing is the primary delivery mechanism for Volgmer infections; however, HIDDEN COBRA actors use a suite of custom tools, some of which could also be used to initially compromise a system. Therefore, it is possible that additional HIDDEN COBRA malware may be present on network infrastructure compromised with Volgmer\u201d\n\nThis second report also includes details of the infrastructure associated with the malware and IoCs.\n\nThe DHS tracked at least 94 static IP addresses along with dynamic IP addresses registered across various countries, most of them in India (772 IPs \u2013 25.4 percent), Iran (373 IPs \u2013 12.3 percent), and Pakistan (343 IPs \u2013 11.3 percent).\n\nThe Volgmer malware was used by Pyongyang in attacks against the government, financial, automotive, and media industries since at least 2013, The threat was delivered via spear-phishing emails.\n\nThe DHS warned of the Hidden Cobra availability of a suite of custom tools that the North Korean hackers used to hack into the companies.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Hidden Cobra, FALLCHILL)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fallchill", "topic_name": "FALLCHILL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hidden-cobra", "topic_name": "Hidden Cobra"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/jta", "topic_name": "JTA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarous-apt", "topic_name": "Lazarous APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/volgmer-trojan", "topic_name": "Volgmer Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Russia-Linked APT28 group observed using DDE attack to deliver malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65318/hacking/dde-attack-apt28.html", "title": "Russia-Linked APT28 group observed using DDE attack to deliver malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 9, 2017", "body": "Security experts at McAfee observed the Russian APT group APT28 using the recently reported the DDE technique to deliver malware in targeted attacks.\n\nThe cyber spies were conducting a cyber espionage campaign that involved blank documents whose name referenced the recent terrorist attack in New York City.\n\n\u201cDuring our monitoring of activities around the APT28 threat group, McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts identified a malicious Word document that appears to leverage the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique that has been previously reported by Advanced Threat Research. This document likely marks the first observed use of this technique by APT28.\u201d reported McAfee.\n\nThe Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a protocol designed to allow data transferring between applications, attackers have devised a method to achieve the execution of malicious code embedded in Office documents without user\u2019s interaction by using DDE.\n\nThe DDE protocol allows an Office application to load data from another Office application, it was replaced by Microsoft with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), but it is still supported.\n\nThe DDE technique was implemented by several threat actors such as the FIN7 APT group in DNSMessenger malware attacks, and the operators behind the Hancitor malware campaign spotted and detailed by Internet Storm Center (ISC) handler Brad Duncan.\n\nRecently the technique was used by threat actors behind the Necurs botnet to deliver the Locky ransomware.\n\nUnfortunately, Microsoft doesn\u2019t plan to introduce security countermeasures to mitigate the DDE attack because the tech giant considers the feature as legit.\n\nIn the recent campaign conducted by APT28, hackers used a document referencing the New York City attack to deliver the first-stage payload tracked as Seduploader.\n\nThe Seduploader malware, also known as GAMEFISH backdoor, Sednit, JHUHUGIT and Sofacy, is a strain of malware that has been already used by the threat actor in other campaigns against NATO representatives.\n\nThe Seduploader is a reconnaissance malware that was used for years by APT28, it is composed of 2 files: a dropper and a payload.\n\nThe malware is downloaded from a remote server using PowerShell commands, experts\n\nThe analysis of the malware and command and control (C&C) domains used in the campaign revealed the campaign involving DDE started on October 25.\n\nAccording to the experts, the recent attacks are part of a campaign that also involved documents referencing Saber Guardian, a multinational military exercise involving approximately 25,000 military personnel from over 20 participating nations. The military exercise was conducted by the U.S. Army in Eastern Europe in an effort to deter an invasion (by Russia) into NATO territory.\n\n\n\nJust two week ago, researchers with Cisco Talos have spotted another cyber espionage campaign conducted by the APT28 group targeting individuals with spear-phishing messages using documents referencing a NATO cybersecurity conference.\n\nThe hackers targeted individuals with a specific interest in the CyCon US cybersecurity conference organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in collaboration with the Army Cyber Institute at West Point on November 7-8 in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cAPT28 is a resourceful threat actor that not only capitalizes on recent events to trick potential victims into infections, but can also rapidly incorporate new exploitation techniques to increase its success. Given the publicity the Cy Con U.S campaign received in the press, it is possible APT28 actors moved away from using the VBA script employed in past actions and chose to incorporate the DDE technique to bypass network defenses.\u201d concluded McAfee. \u201cFinally, the use of recent domestic events and a prominent US military exercise focused on deterring Russian aggression highlight APT28\u2019s ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations.\u201d\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DDE attack, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt28", "topic_name": "APT28"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dde-attack", "topic_name": "DDE attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fancy-bear", "topic_name": "FANCY BEAR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Symantec uncovered a new APT, the cyber espionage Sowbug\u00a0group", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65293/apt/sowbug-group-apt.html", "title": "Symantec uncovered a new APT, the cyber espionage Sowbug\u00a0group\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 8, 2017", "body": "A new cyber espionage group dubbed Sowbug appeared in the threat landscape, according to the experts it has been active since 2015 and was involved in highly targeted attacks against a host of government organizations in South America and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\u201cSymantec has identified a previously unknown group called Sowbug that has been conducting highly targeted cyber attacks against organizations in South America and Southeast Asia and appears to be heavily focused on foreign policy institutions and diplomatic targets.

The emails were sent from free email services.\u201d\n\nThe patch was released on Monday, October 16, at that time Kaspersky detected attacks leveraging the CVE-2017-11292 allegedly conducted by the BlackOasis APT group.\n\nResearchers believe that APT28 was also in possession of the exploit (whether purchased, discovered on their own, or reverse engineered from the BlackOasis attack), and is trying to use it in targeted attacks.\n\nThe APT28 rushed to assemble the exploit and the distribution campaign, reusing code from past attacks, the APT28 hackers did the same in May after Microsoft patched three zero-days flaws exploited by the Russian APT group.\n\nBack to the present, researchers believe the APT28 found a way to exploit the CVE-2017-11292, it is unclear if they purchased the zero-day or reverse engineered it from the BlackOasis attack.\n\nThe researchers noticed that the recent attacks exploiting the CVE-2017-11292 flaw employed the same old DealersChoice malware, a Flash exploit framework also used by the APT28 group against Montenegro.\n\nWhen the target user opens these the weaponized files, DealersChoice contacts the remote server to download the CVE-2017-11292 exploit code and execute it.\n\n\u201cThe document \u201cWorld War 3.docx\u201d contacts DealersChoice.B, APT28\u2019s attack framework that allows loading exploit code on-demand from a command and control (C&C) server. DealersChoice has previously been used to exploit a variety of Flash vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-7645, CVE-2016-1019, CVE-2016-4117, and CVE-2016-7855 via embedded objects in crafted Microsoft Word documents.\u201d continues the report.\n\n\n\nThe Proofpoint researcher Kafeine, confirmed his company currently trying to take down C&C servers associated with the DealersChoice attack framework used in the CVE-2017-11292 attacks.\n\n\u201cAPT28 appears to be moving rapidly to exploit this newly documented vulnerability before the available patch is widely deployed. Because Flash is still present on a high percentage of systems and this vulnerability affects all major operating systems, it is critical that organizations and end users apply the Adobe patch immediately. \u201d concluded Proofpoint.\n\nFurther technical details are available in the report published by Proofpoint, including the IOCs.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT28, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe-flash", "topic_name": "Adobe Flash"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2017-11292", "topic_name": "CVE-2017-11292"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hacking", "topic_name": "state-sponsored hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber espionage \u2013 China-Linked group leverages recently patched .NET Flaw", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64499/apt/china-cyber-espionage-group.html", "title": "Cyber espionage \u2013 China-Linked group leverages recently patched .NET Flaw\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 19, 2017", "body": "The hackers have been using a recently patched .NET vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-8759, in attacks aimed at organizations in the United States.\n\n\u201cProofpoint researchers are tracking an espionage actor targeting organizations and high-value targets in defense and government.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\nThe Lazarus group, tracked by the U.S. government as Hidden Cobra, seems to be behind recent attacks against U.S. defense contractors, likely in cooperation with other hacker groups.\n\nBack to the recent attack, hackers exploited the SWIFT global financial network to steal roughly $60 million from Taiwan\u2019s Far Eastern International Bank.\n\nReports of $60M being stolen are not correct, the overall amount actually stolen by the hackers were considerably lower.\n\nThe hackers transferred the money outside the island, but the bank claimed it had managed to recover most of it.\n\nThe Sri Lanka police have recently arrested two men allegedly involved in the cyberheist, the suspects are accused to have hacked into computers at a Taiwan bank and stole millions of dollars\n\nResearchers at BAE Systems have identified some of the tools used in the cyber heist and linked them to the Lazarus\u2018s arsenal.\n\nResearchers believe attackers used a piece of ransomware known as Hermes as a distraction tactic. According to researchers at McAfee, the Hermes variant used in the attack on the Taiwanese bank did not display a ransom note, a circumstance that suggests it wasn\u2019t used for a different purpose, distraction.\n\n\u201cWas the ransomware used to distract the real purpose of this attack? We strongly believe so,\u201d McAfee researchers said. \u201cBased on our sources, the ransomware attack started in the network when the unauthorized payments were being sent.\u201d\n\nLazarus operators likely used the Hermes ransomware on the bank\u2019s network to interfere with the investigations and destroy evidence of their attack.\n\n\u201cThe Hermes strain used on FEIB\u2019s network did not change the infected computer\u2019s wallpaper and didn\u2019t leave a flashy ransom note behind, like the original Hermes note, portrayed below.\u201d reported Bleeping computer.\n\n\u201cInstead, the Hermes version used in the FEIB attacks only showed a popup with the text \u201cfinish work\u201d and left a file named \u201cUNIQUE_ID_DO_NOT_REMOVE\u201d in every directory.\u201d \n\nThe Hermes samples analyzed by researchers at BAE Systems drop a ransom note in each encrypted folder.\n\nThe experts also analyzed another strain of malware used in the attack dubbed Bitsran, it is a loader used to spreads a malicious payload on the targeted network. The analysis of its code revealed the presence of hardcoded credentials for the network of the Far Eastern International Bank. The malware was likely used in a reconnaissance phase.\n\n\u201cSample #2 [Bitsran] is designed to run and spread a malicious payload on the victim\u2019s network.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cThe malware then enumerates all processes, searching for specific anti-virus processes and attempts to kill these using the command line tool taskkill.\u201d\n\nOther malware used by the attackers are the same used by the Lazarus group, including in attacks aimed at financial organizations in Poland and Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe malicious code contains string written in the Russian Language, but researchers believe is a false flag to deceive them.\n\nThe sample of Hermes ransomware analyzed by the experts checks the infected machine\u2019s language settings and stopped running if use Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian languages. This feature widely adopted by Russian and Ukrainian vxers who often avoid targeting machines in their country. However, experts speculate this could also be a false flag.\n\n\u201cThe ransomware calls GetSystemDefaultLangID() to obtain language identifier for the system locale. It contains a list of three system language codes: 0x0419 (Russian), 0x0422 (Ukrainian), and 0x0423 (Belarusian). However, it only checks against the last two, and, if matching, the malware quits. Whether this is a false-flag or not is unknown.\u201d states the analysis.\n\nBelow the hallmarks of the Lazarus group that were recognized by BAE experts in the attack on the Taiwanese Far Eastern International Bank:\n\n\u201cDespite their continued success in getting onto payment systems in banks, the Lazarus group still struggle getting the cash in the end, with payments being reversed soon after the attacks are uncovered,\u201d concluded BAE Systems.\n\n\u201cThe group may be trying new tricks to disrupt victims and delay their ability to respond \u2013 such as different message formats, and the deployment of ransomware across the victim\u2019s network as a smokescreen for their other activity. It\u2019s likely they\u2019ll continue their heist attempts against banks in the coming months and we expect they will evolve their modus operandi to incorporate new ways of disrupting victims (and possibly the wider community) from responding,\u201d \n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus, North Korea)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus-group", "topic_name": "Lazarus Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/taiwans-far-eastern-international-bank", "topic_name": "Taiwan\u2019s Far Eastern International Bank"}]}, {"news_name": "BlackOasis APT leverages new Flash zero-day exploit to deploy FinSpy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64383/apt/blackoasis-apt-finspy.html", "title": "BlackOasis APT leverages new Flash zero-day exploit to deploy FinSpy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 17, 2017", "body": "Security researchers from Kaspersky Labs have discovered a new zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe Flash, tracked as CVE-2017-11292, which was being actively exploited by hackers in the wild to deliver the surveillance software FinSpy.\n\n\n\nHackers belonging to the APT group known as BlackOasis are leveraging the Adobe Flash zero-day exploit in attacks against high-profile targets.\n\nThe critical type confusion vulnerability affects Flash Player 21.0.0.226 for Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Chrome OS.\n\n\u201cOn October 10, 2017, Kaspersky Lab\u2019s advanced exploit prevention systems identified a new Adobe Flash zero day exploit used in the wild against our customers.

The payload embedded within the ISMInjector sample delivered in this attack is a variant of the ISMAgent backdoor that we had discussed in detail in our blog discussing a targeted attack on a Saudi Arabian technology company.\u201d reads the analysis published by PaloAlto Networks.\n\n\n\nThe ISMInjector tool has a modular architecture and implements sophisticated anti-analysis techniques that were not previously exploited by the OilRig group.\n\nIn the attack against the UAE government, OilRig hackers delivered their malware using spear-phishing emails with weaponized documents, the emails were having the subject line \u201cImportant Issue.\u201d\n\nAn interesting aspect of the attack against the UAE government, it that the spear-phishing messages were sent from the targeted organization\u2019s own domain. The hackers used a compromised Outlook Web Access (OWA) account whose credentials attackers obtained in a previous phishing attack.\n\n\u201cThis string in the header suggests that the OilRig actor is likely to have used the targeted organization\u2019s Outlook Web Access (OWA) to send the phishing email using Firefox 36.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cUsing information from our research in the Striking Oil blog, we know the OilRig group has conducted credential harvesting campaigns specifically by emulating OWA login sites. Based on that research and this observation, we postulate that the OilRig group gathered credentials to a legitimate user\u2019s OWA account and logged into the user\u2019s account to send phishing attacks to other individuals within the same, targeted organization.\u201d\n\nThe weaponized documents delivered the ISMInjector Trojan, which in turn dropped a variant of the ISMAgent backdoor by injecting it into a remote process it created.\n\nThe malware implements a \u201cstate machines\u201d approach to create a new process and inject the malicious payload into that process.

When executed, the CMD file writes JScript to \u201ctt.txt\u201d under the current user\u2019s home directory. The batch script then copies itself to \u201cpp.txt\u201d, also under the current user\u2019s home directory, before running WScript using the JScript engine on the file. This JScript code will read from the file \u201cpp.txt\u201d, skipping the first four lines (the CMD code itself), but otherwise evaluating anything after the first character for each line in the file.\u201d reads the analysis published by security experts.\n\n\u201cBoth CMD and LNK file formats result in code execution, but the shift towards using CMD files may indicate a desire to stay ahead of detection authors.\u201d\n\nThe shift towards using OLE embedded CMD files results in code execution on the victim\u2019s machine.\n\nThe FIN7 hackers also implemented a series of changes to the obfuscation technique for their unique backdoor, HALFBAKED, that was continuously improved over the years.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the past year, the actor\u2019s unique backdoor, HALFBAKED, has continued to morph to improve capabilities and reduce detection surface. In the newest observed version, ICEBRG observed a slight tweak in the obfuscation strategy.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cPreviously, different stages of the HALFBAKED codebase utilized base64 encoding, stored in a string array variable called \u201csrcTxt\u201d. The attacker now obfuscates that name and continues to break up the base64 string into multiple strings within an array\u201d\n\nICEBRG discovered the HALFBAKED backdoor now includes a built-in command called \u201cgetNK2\u201d which was designed to retrieve the target\u2019s Microsoft Outlook email client auto-complete list. The presence of getNK2 suggests the FIN7 group aims to launch phishing attacks within a victim organization.\n\nExperts noticed NK2 files are used only for Microsoft Outlook 2007 and 2010, newer versions of outlook no longer use them, so FIN7 hackers leveraged a custom-functionality to handle newer versions of Outlook within the same \u201cgetNK2\u201d command.\n\n\n\nThe changes in the FIN7 attack techniques demonstrate that they are highly adaptable.\n\n\u201cDetection authors must make trade-offs to optimize signature performance; narrow signatures lead to high fidelity detections, but risk missing changes in actor behaviors, meanwhile broader detection patterns provide better coverage, at the risk of more false positives. Combatting a well-resourced and adaptive adversary requires a layered approach of both signature styles,\u201d concludes ICEBRG.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 FIN7, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anunak", "topic_name": "Anunak"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fin7", "topic_name": "FIN7"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}]}, {"news_name": "CSE CybSec ZLAB Malware Analysis Report: APT28 Hospitality malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63835/cyber-warfare-2/cse-zlab-apt28-hospitality-malware.html", "title": "CSE CybSec ZLAB Malware Analysis Report: APT28 Hospitality malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 5, 2017", "body": "The Russian hacker group APT28, also known as Sofacy or Fancy Bear, is believed to be behind a series of attacks in last July against travelers staying in hotels in Europe and Middle East.\n\nThis attack is performed by sending spear phishing emails to the victims, masquerading as a hotel reservation form that, if opened and macros are enabled, installs a malware in the machine\u2019s victim.\n\nWhy should Fancy bear do this?

It has been estimated that between August 15 and September 12, over 2.27 million users downloaded the tainted version of CCleaner application.\n\nThe experts at Cisco Talos team that investigated the incident, while analyzing the command-and-control (C2) server used by the threat actor discovered a lightweight backdoor module (GeeSetup_x86.dll) that was delivered to a specific list of machines used by certain organizations.\n\nThe experts discovered that the threat actor that recently compromised the supply chain of the CCleaner software to distribute a tainted version of the popular software targeted at least 20 major international technology firms with a second-stage malware.\n\nThe experts analyzed a backup of a deleted database containing information on the infected machines, they discovered that the malicious code infected a total of 1,646,536 machines (based on MAC addresses), but just 40 of them received the second-stage backdoor.\n\nSecurity experts who investigated the case discovered a link with a Chinese group of hackers.\n\nNow, researchers from Intezer speculate that the attack was powered by nation-state actor, likely Chinese hackers belonging to the Axiom group, also known as APT17 or DeputyDog.\n\nThe most popular campaign attributed to the APT17 group is the attack on the Google\u2019s infrastructure, also known as Operation Aurora. For almost a decade the APT17 targeted government organizations in several Southeast Asian countries and the US, NGOs, defense contractors, law firms, IT firms, and mining companies.\n\nAccording to malware experts at Intezer, the first payload has many similarities with the code used by the Axiom group.\n\n\u201cNot only did the first payload have shared code between the Axiom group and CCBkdr, but the second did as well.\u201d reads the analysis published by Intezer.\n\nThe stage 2 payload contains the same portion of code found in APT17 malware and that isn\u2019t included in any public repository.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe author probably copied and pasted the code, which is what often happens to avoid duplicative efforts: rewriting the same code for the same functionality twice. Due to the uniqueness of the shared code, we strongly concluded that the code was written by the same attacker,\u201d said Intezer.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the level of complexity of the attack suggests the involvement of a state-sponsored actor, likely the APT17 group.\n\n\u201cThe complexity and quality of this particular attack has led our team to conclude that it was most likely state-sponsored. Considering this new evidence, the malware can be attributed to the Axiom group due to both the nature of the attack itself and the specific code reuse throughout that our technology was able to uncover,\u201d concluded Intezer.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 CCleaner, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt17", "topic_name": "APT17"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ccleaner-version-5-33", "topic_name": "CCleaner version 5.33"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Even More Evidence That Russian Was Meddling in the 2016 US Election", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63433/apt/even-evidence-russian-meddling-2016-us-election.html", "title": "Even More Evidence That Russian Was Meddling in the 2016 US Election\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 26, 2017", "body": "In February of 2017, several States accused the DHS of trying to hack their state electoral systems during the previous months.

Based on a review of the C2 tracking database, which only covers four days in September, we can confirm that at least 20 victim machines were served specialized secondary payloads. Below is a list of domains the attackers were attempting to target.\u201d reads the analysis published by Cisco Talos.\n\nThe list of domains targeted by hackers is long and included:\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the C&C server revealed that nearly 700,000 machines were infected by the tainted version of CCleaner, and at least 20 machines were infected with the second-stage payload. The machines infected with the secondary malware were targeted based upon their Domain name, IP address, and Hostname, this circumstance suggests that attackers most likely were conducting an industrial espionage operation.\n\n\u201cThe C2 MySQL database held two tables: one describing all machines that had reported to the server and one describing all machines that received the second-stage download, both of which had entries were dated between Sept. 12th and Sept. 16th. Over 700,000 machines reported to the C2 server over this time period, and more than 20 machines have received the second-stage payload. It is important to understand that the target list can be and was changed over the period the server was active to target different organizations.\u201d continues Talos.\n\n\u201cDuring the compromise, the malware would periodically contact the C2 server and transmit reconnaissance information about infected systems. This information included IP addresses, online time, hostname, domain name, process listings, and more.

Below some of the tactics employed by the hackers:\n\nThe experts noticed most attacker activity in organizations in the US, Turkey, and Switzerland.\n\n\n\nDragonfly 2.0 continues to use a wide range of attack vectors, from spear phishing messages to watering holes.\n\nIn the first attacks spotted by Symantec in December 2015, attackers used emails disguised as an invitation to a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\n\nOther campaigns conducted during 2016 and 2017 used spear phishing messages specifically designed with content related to the energy sector.\n\nPhishing emails spotted by Symantec were created with the Phishery toolkit in the attempt to steal victims\u2019 credentials via a template injection attack.\n\nThe attackers also used watering hole attacks to harvest network credentials, they targeted websites likely to be visited by personnel involved in the energy sector.\n\nSymantec reported that at least in one case, the watering hole attack was used to deliver the Goodor backdoor via PowerShell 11 days later.\n\n\u201cSymantec also has evidence to suggest that files masquerading as Flash updates may be used to install malicious backdoors onto target networks\u2014perhaps by using social engineering to convince a victim they needed to download an update for their Flash player. Shortly after visiting specific URLs, a file named \u201cinstall_flash_player.exe\u201d was seen on victim computers, followed shortly by the Trojan.Karagany.B backdoor.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (Dragonfly, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dragonfly", "topic_name": "Dragonfly"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/energetic-bear", "topic_name": "Energetic Bear"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/energy", "topic_name": "energy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/havex", "topic_name": "Havex"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isc", "topic_name": "ISC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/symantec", "topic_name": "Symantec"}]}, {"news_name": "ShadowBrokers are back demanding nearly $4m and offering 2 dumps per month", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62770/hacking/shadowbrokers-return.html", "title": "ShadowBrokers are back demanding nearly $4m and offering 2 dumps per month\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 6, 2017", "body": "The notorious group ShadowBrokers is back with announcing new interesting changes to their Dump Service.\n\nThe hackers published a new message on the Steemit platform announcing new changed to their service.\n\n\u201cMissing theshadowbrokers?

The attackers hit different organizations as explained by the researchers at FireEye and appear to operate from the Guangdong Province. The group hit entities working in the defense industry in the United States.\n\nA second team, dubbed DragonOK, conducted corporate espionage operations on high-tech and manufacturing companies in Japan and Taiwan.\n\nEarly this year, DragonOK targeted Japanese organizations in several industries, including manufacturing, technology, energy, higher education, and semiconductor.\n\nThe recent campaign featuring the KHRAT RAT targets victims located in Cambodia.\n\n\u201cUnit 42 recently observed activity involving the Remote Access Trojan KHRAT used by threat actors to target the citizens of Cambodia.\u201d reads the blog post published by PaloAlto networks.\n\n\u201cSo called because the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure from previous variants of the malware was located in Cambodia, as discussed by Roland Dela Paz at Forecpoint here, KHRAT is a Trojan that registers victims using their infected machine\u2019s username, system language and local IP address. KHRAT provides the threat actors typical RAT features and access to the victim system, including keylogging, screenshot capabilities, remote shell access and so on.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe KHRAT RAT provides attackers with the typical set of RAT features, including remote access to the victim system, keylogging, and remote shell access.\n\nResearchers from PaloAlto Networks noticed the threat actor has updated the spear phishing techniques and themes used in its campaign.\n\nThe hackers are using multiple methods to download and execute additional payloads using built-in Windows applications, they also started mimicking Dropbox.\n\nBelow Key findings provided by PaloAlto networks:\n\nThe experts observed an increase in the usage of this specific RAT over the past couple of months, the attacks against Cambodian entities were discovered in June.\n\nResearchers observed the DragonOK group using weaponized files referencing in the title the \u201cMIWRMP\u201d (Mekong Integrated Water Resources Management Project), a multi-million dollar project regarding water resources and fisheries management in North Eastern Cambodia.\n\n\u201cThe weaponized document, with the filename \u201cMission Announcement Letter for MIWRMP phase 3 implementation support mission, June 26-30, 2017(update).doc\u201d, was shown in AutoFocus as contacting a Russian IP address 194.87.94[.]61 over port 80 in the form of a HTTP GET request to update.upload-dropbox[.]com \u2013 a site that could (erroneously) be thought of as belonging to the well-known cloud-based file hosting service, Dropbox, and as such is intended to trick victims and network defenders into thinking, at least at first glance, the C2 traffic is legitimate.\u201d states the analysis.\n\nThe document trick victims into enabling macros to run malicious operations, including creating new scheduled tasks and calling functions to run JavaScript code.\n\nPaloAlto experts observed hackers using the domain name update.upload-dropbox[.]com that has been hosted on a compromised Cambodian government\u2019s website.\n\nThe sample hosted on the compromised government servers would launch the legitimate regsvr32.exe program to bypass included Windows protections.\n\n\u201cIndex.ico would create three scheduled tasks with the more subtly named \u201cWindows Scheduled Maintenance1\u201d (Maintenance2 and Maintenance3), although three services with incremented numbers in their names is also a little suspicious, and use regsvr32.exe to download and execute three other .ico files \u2013 reg.ico, reg_salt.ico and reg_bak.ico \u2013 the purposes of which are currently unknown.\u201d continues the analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting each service has different running frequencies \u2013 every 4 minutes, 20 minutes and 10 minutes, respectively, which could indicate a dependency on reg.ico, as it is more aggressively sought after, or that is a more critical component to have running.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also noticed that threat actor used a JavaScript code that allows it to monitor who is visiting their site. The code would gather data such as user-agent, domain, cookie, referrer and Flash version, and appears almost identical to that found on a blog hosted on the Chinese Software Developer Network (CSDN) website.\n\nThe malware researchers conclude that the DragonOK APT has updated both the malware and their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in the last months probably, because it was planning to intensify its activity.months probably, because it was planning to intensify its activity.\n\n\u201cThe threat actors behind KHRAT have evolved the malware and their TTPs over the course of this year, in an attempt to produce more successful attacks, which in this case included targets within Cambodia.\u201d concluded PaloAlto.\n\n\u201cThis most recent campaign highlights social engineering techniques being used with reference and great detail given to nationwide activities, likely to be forefront of peoples\u2019 minds; as well as the new use of multiple techniques in Windows to download and execute malicious payloads using built-in applications to remain inconspicuous which is a change since earlier variants,\u201d \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DragonOK APR, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/corporate-espionage", "topic_name": "corporate espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dragonok", "topic_name": "DragonOK"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sysget", "topic_name": "Sysget"}]}, {"news_name": "APT group leverage Gazer backdoor to spy on embassies and consular operations", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62518/apt/gazer-backdoor-apt-turla.html", "title": "APT group leverage Gazer backdoor to spy on embassies and consular operations\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 31, 2017", "body": "\u201cFrom February to September 2016, WhiteBear activity was narrowly focused on embassies and consular operations around the world.

While in previous campaigns, the Turla APT group leveraged Carbon and Kazuar backdoors during the second-stage of the attack, recently the group opted for the Gazer backdoor.\n\n\u201cThe second-stage backdoor receives encrypted instructions from the gang via C&C servers, using compromised, legitimate websites as a proxy.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nTo remain stealthy and evade detection, the threat actor leveraged compromised, legitimate websites as a proxy, most of them running WordPress CMS.\n\n\u201cThe list of C&C servers is encrypted and embedded in Gazer\u2019s PE resources. They are all compromised, legitimate websites (that mostly use the WordPress CMS) that act as a first layer proxy. This is also a common tactic for the Turla APT group.\nAnother interesting linkage is that one of the C&C servers embedded in a Gazer sample was known to be used in a JScript backdoor documented by Kaspersky as Kopiluwak\u201d reads the research paper published by ESET.\n\n\n\nGazer\u2019s authors heavily leverage on encryption, they are using a custom library for 3DES and RSA instead of the Windows Crypto API.\n\u201cThe RSA keys embedded in the resources contains the attacker\u2019s public key which is used to encrypt the data sent to the C&C server, and a private key to decrypt resources embedded in its binaries.

Furthermore, the LNK filename used in one of the campaigns this year is almost identical to the campaigns in 2014: Party00[1-35].jpg.lnk (2017) vs. Party-00[1-5].jpg.lnk (2014). Finally, the theme of party pictures and stock-JPGs used in both the 2017 and 2014 campaigns are extremely similar.\u201d states the analysis. \u201cAnother possible similarity is the use of some of the code from the Java Reverse Metasploit-Stager [6] in the exploits previously analyzed by FireEye [7] as well as the PhotoShow.jar payload.\u201d\n\nThe most popular campaign attributed to the APT17 group is the attack on the Google\u2019s infrastructure, also known as Operation Aurora. For almost a decade the APT17 targeted government organizations in several Southeast Asian countries and the US, NGOs, defense contractors, law firms, IT firms, and mining companies.\n\nThe APT17 attempted to exploit the attention of the media on the HBO hack and the Game of Thrones leaks to increase the efficiency of their hacking campaign.\n\n\u201cBased on similarities in code, payload, file names, images, and themes, it is possible that this attack was carried out by a Chinese state-sponsored actor known as Deputy Dog.\u201d concluded Proofpoint. \u201cThe use of a Game of Thrones lure during the penultimate season of the series follows a common threat actor technique of developing lures that are timely and relevant, and play on the human factor \u2013 the natural curiosity and desire to click that leads to so many malware infections. While Proofpoint systems blocked this attack, the use of such lures, combined with sophisticated delivery mechanisms and powerful tools like the latest version of the 9002 RAT can open wide doors into corporate data and systems for the actors behind these attacks\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT17, Game of Thrones)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt17", "topic_name": "APT17"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deputy-dog", "topic_name": "Deputy Dog"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/game-of-thrones", "topic_name": "Game of Thrones"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spearphishing", "topic_name": "spearphishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Fancy Bears release data on soccer players\u2019 TUE drug use and doping cases", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62302/data-breach/fancy-bears-doping.html", "title": "Fancy Bears release data on soccer players\u2019 TUE drug use and doping cases\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 24, 2017", "body": "A self-styled hacker group that calls itself Fancy Bears has set up the website fancybear.net to leak emails and medical records related to football players who used doping substances under a campaign dubbed OpOlympics.\n\nThe group who claims to be associated with the Anonymous collective is believed to be operating out of Russia.\n\n\u201cToday Fancy Bears\u2019 hack team is publishing the material leaked from various sources related to football,\u201d the hackers said. \u201cFootball players and officials unanimously affirm that this kind of sport is free of doping.

The experts discovered a newly dropper for the KopiLuwak backdoor, KopiLuwak is a JavaScript malware that was spotted early this year while the APT was delivering it to at least one victim leveraging a document containing an official letter from the Qatar Embassy in Cyprus to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cyprus.\n\nThe KopiLuwak uses multiple JavaScript layers to avoid detection, the malicious code gain persistence on the targeted machine by creating a registry key. Once infected a system, the malicious code is able executes a series of commands to collect information and exfiltrate data. Stolen data are temporarily stored in a file that is deleted after it\u2019s encrypted and stored in memory.\n\nThe KopiLuwak JavaScript malware is controlled through a collection of compromised websites, the IP address of those websites are hardcoded into the malicious code.\n\nThe C&C can send arbitrary commands to the infected system using Wscript.shell.run().\n\nTurla is the name of a Russian cyber espionage APT group (also known as Waterbug, Venomous Bear and KRYPTON) that has been active since at least 2007 targeting government organizations and private businesses.\n\nThe list of victims is long and includes also the Swiss defense firm RUAG and the US Central Command.\n\nThe Turla\u2019s arsenal is composed of sophisticated hacking tools and malware tracked as Turla (Snake and Uroburos rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla. In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla. In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using Icedcoffee, a JavaScript payload delivered via macro-enabled Office documents.\n\nBack to the present, the APT group appears to be actively targeting G20 participants and those interested in its activities including politicians, member nations, and journalists.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the dropper is being delivered with a benign and possibly stolen decoy document inviting recipients to a G20 task force meeting on the \u201cDigital Economy\u201d. The Digital Economy event is actually scheduled for October of this year in Hamburg, Germany. \u201d states  Proofpoint. \u201cThe dropper first appeared in mid-July, suggesting that this APT activity is potentially ongoing, with Turla actively targeting G20 participants and/or those with interest in the G20, including member nations, journalists, and policymakers.\u201d\n\nResearchers at Proofpoint recently discovered the dropper on a public malware repository, hackers are delivering it to targets via spear phishing emails that use weaponized attachment titled \u201cSave The Date\u201d invitation to the October G20 taskforce meeting.\n\nThe invitation is an executable Program Information File (PIG) that appears as a PDF document, it includes a set of instructions for delivering KupiLuwak. When the victim double-clicks on the PDF icon, the PIF opens the decoy document normally while in the background it delivers the backdoor.\n\nOnce installed on a system, KupiLuwak allows the attackers to fully control it.\n\n\n\nThe experts believe the decoy document is a genuine invitation to the G20 task force meeting and was likely stolen.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are aware, this document is not publicly available and so may indicate that an entity with access to the invitation was already compromised. Alternatively, the document may have been legitimately obtained from a recipient.\u201d continues ProofPoint.\n\n\u201cProofpoint researchers ascertain with medium confidence that the document is legitimate and not fabricated.\u201d\n\nThe subject of the weaponized documents used by the hackers suggests the Turla APT is gathering information related to G20 event and its participants.\n\nAnyway, we have to consider that the samples analyzed by Proofpoint were obtained from a public malware repository and were not observed in the wild, this means that it is quite impossible to estimate the full scope and impact of the attack.\n\nThe high profile of potentially targeted individuals associated with the G20 and early reconnaissance nature of the tools involved bear further watching.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\n\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\nThe Lazarus group, tracked by the U.S. government as Hidden Cobra, seems to be behind recent attacks against U.S. defense contractors, likely in cooperation with other hacker groups.\n\nThe last campaign conducted by the Lazarus APT leverages spear phishing emails containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents. The documents are written in English and embed malicious macros to deliver a malware.\n\nThe hackers used decoy documents describing job openings at some U.S. defense contractors, the hackers used the text of job descriptions available on the legitimate company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cUnit 42 researchers at Palo Alto Networks have discovered new attack activity targeting individuals involved with United States defense contractors. Through analysis of malicious code, files, and infrastructure it is clear the group behind this campaign is either directly responsible for or has cooperated with the group which conducted Operation Blockbuster Sequeland, ultimately, Operation Blockbuster (originally outlined by researchers from Novetta).\u201d reads the analysis published by PaloAlto networks.\n\nThe macros used in this last campaign presents many similarities with other cyber espionage attacks attributed to the Lazarus APT, experts also found many links between the nature of the decoy document used, the payloads and the command and control (C&C) servers.\n\n\u201cRecently, we\u2019ve identified weaponized Microsoft Office Document files which use the same malicious macros as attacks from earlier this year. Based on the contents of these latest decoy documents which are displayed to a victim after opening the weaponized document the attackers have switched targets from Korean language speakers to English language speakers. Most notably, decoy document themes now include job role descriptions and internal policies from US defense contractors.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cThis reuse of macro source code, XOR keys used within the macro to decode implant payloads, and the functional overlap in the payloads the macros write to disk demonstrates the continued use of this tool set by this threat group. The use of an automated tool to build the weaponized documents would explain the common but not consistent reuse of metadata, payloads, and XOR keys within the documents,\u201d \n\nThe experts highlighted that the tools and tactics used by the group have changed only little compared to previous cyber espionage campaigns, they have no doubt about the fact that threat actors will continue their operations.\n\nI suggest reading the analysis that also includes Indicators of Compromise.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus APT, North Korea)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dhs", "topic_name": "DHS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hidden-cobra", "topic_name": "Hidden Cobra"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/jta", "topic_name": "JTA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarous-apt", "topic_name": "Lazarous APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}]}, {"news_name": "APT28 hackers are leveraging NSA Hacking tool to spy on Hotels guests", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/61924/apt/apt28-hotels-guests.html", "title": "APT28 hackers are leveraging NSA Hacking tool to spy on Hotels guests\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 11, 2017", "body": "According to FireEye, the notorious Russia-linked APT28 group (Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit and Strontium) is behind an ongoing campaign targeting hotels in several European countries.\n\nThe researchers observed many attacks targeting the networks of hotels to gain access the devices of government and business travelers via the guest Wi-Fi.\n\nThe hackers targeted several companies in the hospitality sector, including hotels in seven European countries and at least one in the Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe attack chain starts with a spear phishing email sent to a hotel employee, the messages use weaponized document named \u201cHotel_Reservation_Form.doc.\u201d The embedded macros decode a dropper that delivers the GameFish malware. Experts noticed that the backdoor is the same used by the APT28 in a recent campaign that targeted Montenegro after the state officially joined NATO alliance despite the strong opposition from Russian Government that threatened to retaliate.\n\nOnce the hackers accessed the target network, they used the NSA-linked EternalBlue SMB exploit for lateral movements. According to the malware researchers at FireEye, this is the first time APT28 hackers had used this NSA exploit.\n\n\u201cAPT28 is using novel techniques involving the EternalBlue exploit and the open source tool Responder to spread laterally through networks and likely target travelers. Once inside the network of a hospitality company, APT28 sought out machines that controlled both guest and internal Wi-Fi networks. No guest credentials were observed being stolen at the compromised hotels; however, in a separate incident that occurred in Fall 2016, APT28 gained initial access to a victim\u2019s network via credentials likely stolen from a hotel Wi-Fi network.\u201d reads the analysis published by FireEye.\n\n\n\nThe APT28 hackers also used the open source penetration testing tool Responder for NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning.\n\n\u201cUpon gaining access to the machines connected to corporate and guest Wi-Fi networks, APT28 deployed Responder. Responder facilitates NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning.\n\nThis technique listens for NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts from victim computers attempting to connect to network resources. Once received, Responder masquerades as the sought-out resource and causes the victim computer to send the username and hashed password to the attacker-controlled machine. APT28 used this technique to steal usernames and hashed passwords that allowed escalation of privileges in the victim network,\u201d continues FireEye.\n\nThe researchers reported details about an intrusion occurred in 2016, a user connected to a hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi and 12 hours later APT28 hackers used stolen credentials to access his network and his Outlook Web Access (OWA) account.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time hackers targeted travelers, the most important case is represented by the DarkHotel APT. The APT group targeted European hotels hosting participants in Iranian nuclear negotiations, and according to some reports, hackers spied on high-profile people visiting Russia and China.\n\n\u201cCyber espionage activity against the hospitality industry is typically focused on collecting information on or from hotel guests of interest rather than on the hotel industry itself, though actors may also collect information on the hotel as a means of facilitating operations,\u201d FireEye said. \u201cBusiness and government personnel who are traveling, especially in a foreign country, must often rely on less secure systems to conduct business than at their home office, or may be unfamiliar with the additional threats posed while abroad.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 sinkhole, Fancy Bear)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt28", "topic_name": "APT28"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/darkhotel", "topic_name": "Darkhotel"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/eternalblue", "topic_name": "ETERNALBLUE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hotels", "topic_name": "Hotels"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}]}, {"news_name": "Experts found a link between the KONNI attacks and DarkHotel campaigns against NK", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/61882/apt/konni-darkhotel-links.html", "title": "Experts found a link between the KONNI attacks and DarkHotel campaigns against NK\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 10, 2017", "body": "In May, Cisco Talos team discovered a RAT dubbed KONNI malware that targets organizations linked to North Korea.\n\nThe malware, dubbed by researchers \u201cKONNI,\u201d was undetected for more than 3 years and was used in highly targeted attacks.

Investigators suspected that Russian-speaking individuals were responsible for the Operation Emmental due clues discovered in the source code analyzed.\n\nThe hackers behind the Operation Emmental have continued to improve their malicious codes. The hackers used on Android malware and a Windows banking Trojan tracked as Retefe and WERDLOD.\n\nThe novelty in the operation of the group is represented by the usage of a new variant of the Dok malware in a new wave of attacks against the Swiss banks.\n\nThe malicious code is delivered via email, once the DOK malware infects a macOS system, it gains administrative privileges and installs a new root certificate. The root certificate allows the malicious code to intercept all victim\u2019s communications, including SSL encrypted traffic.\n\nAccording to researchers at Trend Micro, the malware variant tracked as OSX_DOK.C is configured to hijack traffic only if the victim\u2019s external IP is located in Switzerland.  OSX_DOK.C redirects users to bogus login pages for the financial organizations whose domain is included in a hardcoded list.\n\n\u201cThe OSX_DOK malware (Detected by Trend Micro as OSX_DOK. C)  showcases sophisticated features such as certificate abuse and security software evasion that affects machines using Apple\u2019s OSX operating system.\u201d reads the analysis published by Trend Micro.\n\nThe Dok sample detected by Trend Micro was considered by the malware researchers the Mac version of Retefe/WERDLOD.\n\n\u201cWhile WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C use different codes (since they target different operating systems), they have similar proxy settings and script formats.\u201d\n\n\u201cComparing it to OSX_DOK.C, we can see that it uses the same script format\u201d Trend Micro researchers said in a blog post.\n\n\u201cGiven the connection between WERDLOD and OSX_DOK.C, it is reasonable to assume that the latter is also a part of the Operational Emmental campaign,\u201d \n\n\n\nThe researchers observed that the latest versions of the Dok malware leverage a bug in the Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX) tool to pack the Trojan and avoid detection.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dok Malware, Operation Emmental)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking", "topic_name": "banking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dok-malware", "topic_name": "DOK malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-emmental", "topic_name": "Operation Emmental"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/two-factor-authentication", "topic_name": "two-factor authentication"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI and DHS warn of targeted attacks on US Nuclear Facilities", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60845/apt/nuclear-facilities-hacking.html", "title": "FBI and DHS warn of targeted attacks on US Nuclear Facilities\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 10, 2017", "body": "According to a joint report issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI published last week, since May, hackers have been penetrating the networks of businesses that operate nuclear power stations, manufacturing plants and energy facilities in the United States and other countries.\n\nThe Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation is one of the companies hit by hackers, it runs a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan.\n\n\n\nThe news was disclosed by The New York Times that obtained the report, the attack was also confirmed by security experts involved in the incident response procedures.\n\nThe document doesn\u2019t provide information related to the motivation of the attacks (sabotage or cyber espionage), it is not clear if attackers were able to fully compromise the target network and access the control systems of the facilities.\n\nThe attackers appear as part of a reconnaissance activity of the target infrastructure aimed to gather information for future attacks.\n\n\u201cThere is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks.\u201d reads the joint statement from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security,\n\n\u201cIn most cases, the attacks targeted people \u2014 industrial control engineers who have direct access to systems that, if damaged, could lead to an explosion, fire or a spill of dangerous material, according to two people familiar with the attacks who could not be named because of confidentiality agreements.\u201d states The New York Times.\n\nThe experts have not doubt, the attackers belong to an \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d group linked to a foreign government.\n\nThe hackers launched spear phishing attacks on senior industrial control engineers that have access to the critical industrial control systems in the target plants.

Victims of the group were also located in Israel, Egypt and the United States.\n\nMalware experts at threat intelligence firm ThreatConnect have recently discovered tens of sample of the Kasperagent malware that had been compiled in April and May.\n\nThese samples dropped various decoy files associated with the Palestinian Authority tha is the body that governs the Palestinian Territories in the Middle East.\n\nThe documents are designed to appear as legitimate and most of them are publicly available on news websites or social media.\n\nTo trick victims into opening the documents, attackers used subjects such as the assassination of Hamas military leader Mazen Fuqaha, and banning of the Palestinian political party Fatah from Gaza.\n\n\u201cThe first document \u2013 dated April 10, 2017 \u2013 is marked \u201cVery Secret\u201d and addressed to Yahya Al-Sinwar, who Hamas elected as its leader in Gaza in February 2017.

The experts focused their analysis on the payloads (IEC 60870-5-101 (aka IEC 101), IEC 60870-5-104 (aka IEC 104), IEC 61850, OLE for Process Control Data Access (OPC DA)) the core components of the malware in the attacks that allow controlling electric circuit breakers.\n\nThe Industroyer backdoor allows attackers to execute various commands on the targeted system, the C&C server is hidden in the Tor network and it can be programmed to be active only at specified times, making hard its detection.\n\nThe backdoor installs the launcher component, which initiates the wiper and the payloads, it also drops a second backdoor disguised as a trojanized version of the Windows Notepad application.\n\nThe wiper component is used in the final stage of the attack to hide tracks and make difficult to restore the targeted systems.\n\nThe payloads allow the malware to control circuit breakers, it implements industrial communication protocols. Researchers at ESET believe the malware\u2019s developers have a deep knowledge of power grid operations and industrial network communications.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn addition to all that, the malware authors also wrote a tool that implements a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a particular family of protection relays, specifically the Siemens SIPROTEC range\u201d continues ESET. \u201cThe capabilities of this malware are significant. When compared to the\ntoolset used by threat actors in the 2015 attacks against the Ukrainian power grid which culminated in a black out on December 23, 2015 (BlackEnergy, KillDisk, and other components, including legitimate\nremote access software) the gang behind Industroyer are more advanced, since they went to great lengths to create malware capable of directly controlling switches and circuit breakers\u201d\n\nBoth ESET and Dragos collected evidence that suggests Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE was involved in the 2016 power outages in Kiev region, which was attributed to Russia state-sponsored hackers.\n\nResearchers at Dragos believes the ELECTRUM APT group is directly linked to the Sandworm APT group, ESET highlighted that while there are no code similarities between the malware used in the 2015 and 2016 attacks in Ukraine, some components are similar in concept.\n\n\u201cThe CRASHOVERRIDE malware impacted a single transmission level substation in Ukraine on December 17th, 2016. Many elements of the attack appear to have been more of a proof of concept than what was fully capable in the malware. The most important thing to understand though from the evolution of tradecraft is the codification and scalability in the malware towards what has been learned through past attacks\u201d states the report published by Dragos.\n\nResearchers at Dragos published the description of theoretical attacks, hackers used the Industroyer malware to open closed breakers in an infinite loop, causing the substation to de-energize.\n\n\u201cThe command then begins an infinite loop and continues to set addresses to this value effectively opening closed breakers. If a system operator tries to issue a close command on their HMI the sequence loop will continue to re-open the breaker. This loop maintaining open breakers will effectively de-energize the substation line(s) preventing system operators from managing the breakers and re-energize the line(s).\u201d states the Dragos report.\n\nThe operators of the targeted facility cannot close the breakers from the HMI, in order to restore the situation they need to interrupt communications with the substation and manually fix the problem.\n\nIn another possible attack scenario, hackers initiate an infinite loop where breakers continually open and close, which can trigger protections and cause the substation to shut down.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 SCADA , Industroyer malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/blackenergy", "topic_name": "BlackEnergy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crashoverride", "topic_name": "CRASHOVERRIDE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ics", "topic_name": "ICS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/industroyer", "topic_name": "Industroyer"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/industroyer-malware", "topic_name": "Industroyer malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scada", "topic_name": "SCADA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}]}, {"news_name": "Platinum hackers leverages Intel Active Management tools to bypass Windows firewall", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59876/hacking/platinum-hackers-amt.html", "title": "Platinum hackers leverages Intel Active Management tools to bypass Windows firewall\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 9, 2017", "body": "Microsoft is warning users of a new attack that leverage Intel\u2019s Active Management Technology to to evade firewalls and other endpoint-based network monitoring.\n\nThe technique has been already used by a threat actor in Southeast Asia dubbed PLATINUM, it could be exploited only if the attackers gain administrative credentials.\n\n\u201cSince the 2016 publication, Microsoft has come across an evolution of PLATINUM\u2019s file-transfer tool, one that uses the Intel\u00ae Active Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) channel for communication.\u201d reads a security advisory published by Microsoft. \u201cThis channel works independently of the operating system (OS), rendering any communication over it invisible to firewall and network monitoring applications running on the host device.

We confirmed that the tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself, but rather misused AMT SOL within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications.\u201d continues Micorsoft.\n\n\u201cThe updated tool has only been seen in a handful of victim computers within organizational networks in Southeast Asia\u2014PLATINUM is known to customize tools based on the network architecture of targeted organizations. The diagram below represents the file-transfer tool\u2019s updated channel and network flow.\u201d\n\nAttackers misuse the AMT\u2019s Serial-over-LAN (SOL) feature, it\u2019s independent of the host operating system and allow communication over the LAN if a physical connection exists, regardless of whether networking is enabled on the target.\n\nAnother feature of interest for attackers is that the embedded processor is designed to provide remote out-of-band capabilities including an IP-based KVM (keyboard/video/mouse) solution, The KVM solution enables a remote user to send mouse and keyboard input to a machine and see what\u2019s on its display.\n\n\u201cThe AMT SOL feature is not enabled by default and requires administrator privileges to provision for usage on workstations. It is currently unknown if PLATINUM was able to provision workstations to use the feature or piggyback on a previously enabled workstation management feature. In either case, PLATINUM would need to have gained administrative privileges on targeted systems prior to the feature\u2019s misuse.\u201d continues Microsoft.\n\n\n\nSummarizing the Platinum group has devised a method then exploited SOL to transfer malware over the LAN and the process is totally transparent to the operating system.\n\nMicrosoft worked with Intel to analyze the Platinum variant and confirmed that Windows Defender ATP can detect the attack.\n\n\u201cThe PLATINUM tool is, to our knowledge, the first malware sample observed to misuse chipset features in this way. While the technique used here by PLATINUM is OS independent, Windows Defender ATP can detect and notify network administrators of attempts to leverage the AMT SOL communication channel for unauthorized activity, specifically when used against a computer running Windows.\u201d concludes Microsoft.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Active Management Technology, Platinum attack)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/active-management-technology", "topic_name": "Active Management Technology"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/amt", "topic_name": "AMT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/platinum", "topic_name": "Platinum"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sol", "topic_name": "SOL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/windows-firewall", "topic_name": "Windows firewall"}]}, {"news_name": "Russia-linked hacker group APT28 continues to target Montenegro", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59820/apt/apt28-targets-montenegro.html", "title": "Russia-linked hacker group APT28 continues to target Montenegro\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 7, 2017", "body": "On June 5 Montenegro officially joined NATO alliance despite the strong opposition from Russian Government that threatened to retaliate.\n\nCybersecurity experts believe that a new wave of attacks from the cyberspace will hit the state.

Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind recent attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nAccording to security experts, the group was behind, other large-scale cyber espionage campaigns against targets worldwide, including the Troy Operation, the DarkSeoul Operation, and the Sony Picture hack.\n\n\n\nAccording to the experts from Group-IB, the attacks against the SWIFT systems used by banks worldwide left the most clues.\n\nThe Lazarus APT group conducted massive reconnaissance operations before the banks attack in order to gather information on the infrastructure of the targets.\n\n\u201cWe have detected and thoroughly analyzed the C&C infrastructure used by Lazarus,\u201d explained Dmitry Volkov, Head of Threat Intelligence Department. \u201cOur research shows how hackers gained access to the banks\u2019 information systems, what malware they used, and who their attempts were aimed at.\u201d\n\nInvestigating the Group-IB activity the researchers analyzed the complex botnet infrastructure used by the hackers.\nTo make harder the investigation of the attribution of the attacks, the cyberspies used a three-layer architecture of compromised servers that communicate through SSL encrypted channels.\n\n\u201cIn addition to encrypted traffic, data sent through SSL channel was additionally encrypted. The attackers achieved anonymity by employing a legitimate VPN client \u2013 SoftEther VPN. In some cases, they also used corporate web servers that were part of the attacked infrastructure.\u201d states the report published by Group-IB.\n\n\n\nAccording to the researchers, the APT group changed its TTPs after the publication of the Operation Blockbuster report that revealed much information about the activity of the crew.\n\n\u201cAccording to our investigation of the Lazarus infrastructure, the threat actors connected to the end C&C layer (Layer3) from two North Korean IP addresses 210.52.109.22 and 175.45.178.222. The second IP-address relates to Potonggang District, perhaps coincidentally, where National Defence Commission is\nlocated \u2014 the highest military body in North Korea\u201d continues the report.\n\nInvestigating the Lazarus attack, Group-IB discovered the hackers used two IP addresses belonging to the C&C server infrastructure.\n\nThe first is 210.52.109.22 is assigned to a company in China named China Netcom, but according to Group-IB\u2019s sources the range of IPs 210.52.109.0/24 was assigned to North Korea\n\nThe second IP address, 175.45.178.222, points to  North Korean Internet service provider because it is allocated to the Potonggang District. This is the same District where the military National Defence Commission is located.\n\n\u201c210.52.109.22 belongs to an autonomous system China Netcom. However, some sources indicate that the set of IPs 210.52.109.0/24 is assigned to North Korea. 175.45.178.222 refers to a North Korean Internet service provider. The Whois service indicates that this address is allocated to the Potonggang District, perhaps coincidentally, where Natinal Defence Commission is located \u2014 the highest military body in North Korea\u201d\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the Lazarus APT Group is masquerading its operations as Russian hackers. The group used false flags in its malware to deceive the investigators and to attribute the attack to the Russian hackers.\n\nGroup-IB experts, like peers from security firm BAE, discovered Russian words in the source code of the malware, but they noticed an incorrect use of the words.\n\nHackers also leveraged Flash and Silverlight exploits used by Russian state-sponsored hackers, they also used the Enigma Protector, an anti-tampering system for executable files developed by a Russian company.\n\n\u201cThey added specific debugging symbols and strings containing Russian words to a new version of Client_TrafficForwarder, a\nmodule designed to proxy network traffic.\u201d continues the report. \u201cTo protect their executables, they used Enigma Protector, a commercial product, which was created by a Russian software developer. They also used exploits for Flash and SilverLight from sets of exploits created by Russian-speaking hackers. These masquerade techniques did initially mislead some researchers who conducted express analysis of malicious code.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to tell you more, for more details on the Group-IB investigation give a look at the interesting report that also includes IOCs about the malware used in recent operations attributed to the Lazarus Group.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus APT Group, North Korea)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus-apt", "topic_name": "Lazarus APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/north-korea", "topic_name": "North Korea"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sony-hack", "topic_name": "Sony hack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Flashpoint experts believe WannaCry authors speak Chinese after a linguistic analysis", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59458/breaking-news/wannacry-linguistic-analysis.html", "title": "Flashpoint experts believe WannaCry authors speak Chinese after a linguistic analysis\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 26, 2017", "body": "Malware researchers at threat intelligence firm Flashpoint conducted a linguistic analysis of 28 ransom notes displayed by the WannaCry ransomware.\n\nFlashpoint analyzed 28 WannaCry ransom notes written in various language including Chinese (both simplified and traditional), Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nAccording to the experts, authors of the malware are fluent Chinese speakers and they also appear to know English.\n\nRecently the security researcher at Google Neel Mehta, the experts at Kaspersky Lab and Symantec linked the threat to the North Korea-linked Lazarus APT due to similarities in a portion of code that Neel noticed in a very early variant of WannaCry ransomware found in February 2017 and in one of the malware used by the notorious APT group dated back February 2015.\n\nThe Chinese notes appear well written and more accurate of others.\n\n\u201cA number of unique characteristics in the note indicate it was written by a fluent Chinese speaker. A typo in the note, \u201c\u5e2e\u7ec4\u201d (bang zu) instead of \u201c\u5e2e\u52a9\u201d (bang zhu) meaning \u201chelp,\u201d strongly indicates the note was written using a Chinese-language input system rather than being translated from a different version. More generally, the note makes use of proper grammar, punctuation, syntax, and character choice, indicating the writer was likely fluent or at least native. There is, however, at least one minor grammatical error which may be explained by autocomplete, or a copy-editing error.\u201d reads the analysis published by Flashpoint.\n\nExperts highlighted that at least one of the words used in the Chinese note is more common in South China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, while another term is more widely adopted in China mainland.\n\n\u201cThe text uses certain terms that further narrow down a geographic location. One term, \u201c\u793c\u62dc\u201d for \u201cweek,\u201d is more common in South China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Singapore.

It is worth noting that characteristics marking the Chinese note as authentic are subtle. It is thus possible, though unlikely, that they were intentionally included to mislead.\u201d\n\nThe Flashpoint analysis suggests attackers may have used the Lazarus code as a false flag to deceive investigators, a second scenario sees North Korean APT recruiting freelance Chinese hackers to conduct the campaign.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Wannacry ransomware, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linguistic-analysis", "topic_name": "linguistic analysis"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/microsoft", "topic_name": "Microsoft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wannacry-ransomware", "topic_name": "wannacry ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "At least 3 different groups have been leveraging the NSA EternalBlue exploit, what\u2019s went wrong?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59331/malware/eternalblue-exploit.html", "title": "At least 3 different groups have been leveraging the NSA EternalBlue exploit, what\u2019s went wrong?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 22, 2017", "body": "In the last days, security experts discovered numerous attacks that have been leveraging the same EternalBlue exploit used by the notorious WannaCry ransomware.\n\nThe Shadow Brokers hacker group revealed the exploit for the SMB vulnerability in April, but according to malware researchers, other threats used it such as the Adylkuzz botnet that is active since April 24.\n\nSecurity experts at Cyphort found evidence on a honeypot server that threat actors in the wild were already exploiting the SMB flaw in early May to deliver a stealth Remote Access Trojan (RAT) instead of ransomware.\n\nThe RAT didn\u2019t show worm network worm capabilities like the WannaCry ransomware.\n\nThe malware is delivered from an IP (182.18.23.38) located in China.\n\n\u201cOnce the exploitation is successful, the attacker will send an encrypted payload as a shellcode.

We believe that the group behind this attack is the same group that spreads Mirai via Windows Kaspersky discovered in February.

FireEye named the threat group APT3 which has also been described as TG-0100, Buckeye, Gothic Panda, and UPS and described them as \u201cone of the most sophisticated threat groups\u201d being tracked at the time.\n\nSince then, APT3 has been actively penetrating corporations and governments in the US, UK and most recently Hong Kong \u2014 and everyone has been trying to figure out who they are. APT3 functions very differently than 3LA, the former Chinese military hacking organization leading to the assumption that APT3 is not part of the military complex. At least not officially.\n\nOn May 9th, 2017, an unknown party using the alias \u2018intrusiontruth\u2019 published a series of blogs posts describing connections between the Pirpi RAT command and control components and shareholders of the Chinese security contractor Guangzhou Boyu Information Technology Company, aka Boyusec.\n\n\u201cOn May 9, a mysterious group calling itself \u201cintrusiontruth\u201d identified a contractor for the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) as the group behind the APT3 cyber intrusions.\u201d states the analysis published by Recorder Future.\n\nThe names of two specific shareholders of Boyusec appear in the domain registration for the Pirpi C&C servers.  This is particularly interesting because Boyusec supports the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) by collecting civilian human intelligence. Think of them as an outsourcer for a government agency like the United States\u2019 National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nAlso interesting is that in 2016 a Pentagon report described the relationship between Boyusec and network equipment manufacturer, Huawei. According to the report, the two companies were colluding to develop security equipment with embedded backdoors which would likely be used by Boyusec to compromise Huawei customers.\n\n\u201cIn November 2016, the Washington Free Beacon reported that a Pentagon internal intelligence report had exposed a product that Boyusec and Huawei were jointly producing.\u201d continues the analysis.\u201dAccording to the Pentagon\u2019s report, the two companies were working together to produce security products, likely containing a backdoor, that would allow Chinese intelligence \u201cto capture data and control computer and telecommunications equipment.\u201d The article quotes government officials and analysts stating that Boyusec and the MSS are \u201cclosely connected,\u201d and that Boyusec appears to be a cover company for the MSS.\u201d\n\nTo protect our networks, it is important to assess the threats. An important part of threat assessment is to anticipate the motivation of the attackers. APT3 has demonstrated above average skills and has been active for a long time. Add ties to the network vendor supply chain and you have the makings of a dangerous adversary. As part of the Chinese MSS structure you can start to guess at motivation. With this new information, it is a good time to reassess your threat model.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe implications are clear and expansive.

The attack disrupted the operations but did not cause blackouts.\n\nAccording to the same source, alleged Russian hackers had launched a DDoS attack against a Baltic petrol-distribution system to disrupt petrol deliveries from storage tanks to a network of petrol stations.\n\nThe Reuters reported also a malware-based attack against a Baltic grid.\n\n\u201cIn a separate malware attack on another undisclosed Baltic grid, also around end-2015, hackers targeted network communication devices, serial-to-ethernet converters (STEC), which link sub-stations to central control, two other sources said.

Instead, because the NSA stood by and did nothing, we have ended up in the scary world where American cyberweapons are being used to potentially kill British citizens in their hospital beds.\n\n\n\nThe WannaCry infection that caused global chaos on Friday relied upon a Windows exploit called EternalBlue which was originally written by the NSA. Instead of responsibly disclosing the vulnerability when it was discovered, the NSA instead weaponized it and sought to keep it secret, believing that this weapon could be safely kept hidden.\n\nPredictably, this was not the case, and in August 2016, the NSA was itself compromised, and their entire arsenal of illicit cyberweapons stolen. It\u2019s rather ironic that the world\u2019s largest surveillance agency believed that they would never be compromised.\n\nIt has become abundantly clear over the past decade that the notion of keeping attackers out forever is fundamentally flawed. Compromises are not a matter of if, but a matter of when (in fact, this is why we designed ProtonMail to be the first email service that can protect data even in the event of a compromise). If there\u2019s anybody that should know this, it should be the NSA.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that in weaponizing a vulnerability instead of responsibly disclosing it (so hospitals and transportation infrastructure can be protected), the NSA made a critical error in judgment that put millions of people at risk. However, one would think that after learning 10 months ago that their entire cyberweapon arsenal had been stolen and was now out \u201cin the wild\u201d, the NSA would have immediately taken action and responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities so systems around the world could be patched.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no indication that they did so. If we read carefully the statement from Microsoft today, it appears the NSA deliberately withheld the information that would have allowed critical civilian infrastructure like hospitals to be protected. In our view, this is unforgivable and beyond irresponsible.\n\nInstead, the Windows engineering team was left to work by themselves to find the vulnerabilities, which they finally did in March 2017, 8 months after the NSA learned the exploits had been stolen. More critically, Microsoft only managed to patch the vulnerabilities 2 months before last Friday\u2019s attacks, which is not nearly enough time for all enterprise machines to be updated.\n\nWe think that US Congressman Ted Lieu is spot on when he wrote on Friday: \u201cToday\u2019s worldwide ransomware attack shows what can happen when the NSA or CIA write malware instead of disclosing the vulnerability to the software manufacturer.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s attack is a clear demonstration of the damage that just a SINGLE exploit can do. If we have learned anything from the NSA hack, and the more recent CIA Vault7 leaks, it\u2019s that potentially hundreds of additional exploits exist, many targeting other platforms, not just Microsoft Windows. Furthermore, many of these are probably already out \u201cin the wild\u201d and available to cyber criminals.\n\nAt this point, the NSA and CIA have a moral obligation to responsibly disclose all additional vulnerabilities. We would say that this goes beyond just a moral obligation. When your own cyber weapons are used against your own country, there is a duty to protect and defend, and responsible disclosure is now the only way forward.\n\nAnybody working in online security will tell you that protecting against the bad guys is hard enough. The last thing we need is for the supposed \u201cgood guys\u201d to be wreaking havoc. An undisclosed vulnerability is effectively a \u201cback door\u201d into supposedly secure computing environments, and as Friday\u2019s attack aptly demonstrates, there is no such thing as a back door that only lets the good guys in.\n\nThis is the same fundamental issue that makes calls for encryption backdoors counterproductive and irresponsible. Despite repeated warnings from security industry experts, government officials in both the US and the UK have repeatedly called for encryption backdoors, which could grant special access into end-to-end encrypted systems like ProtonMail.\n\nHowever, Friday\u2019s WannaCry attacks clearly demonstrate that when it comes to security, there can be no middle ground. You either have security, or you don\u2019t, and systems with backdoors in them are just fundamentally insecure. For this reason, we are unwilling to compromise on our position of no encryption backdoors, and we will continue to make our cryptography open source and auditable to ensure that there are no intentional or unintentional backdoors.\n\nWe firmly believe this is the only way forward in a world where cyberattacks are becoming increasingly common and more and more damaging, both economically and as a threat to democracy itself.\n\nAbout the Author: Dr. Andy Yen\n\nAndy is the Co-Founder and CEO of ProtonMail.

The APT32 is also targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations, and security firms that may have connections with foreign investors.\n\n\u201cAPT32 leverages a unique suite of fully-featured malware, in conjunction with commercially-available tools, to conduct targeted operations that are aligned with Vietnamese state interests.\u201d states the analysis published by FireEye.\n\nFireEye highlighted that currently, it is impossible to precisely link the group to the Vietnamese government even if the information gathered by the hackers would be of very little use to any other state.\n\nAccording to the experts, the cyber attacks seemed to be assessing the victims\u2019 adherence to Vietnamese regulations but the Vietnamese government denies its involvement.\n\n\u201cThe government of Vietnam does not allow any form of cyber-attacks against organizations or individuals,\u201d said foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang. \u201cAll cyber-attacks or threats to cybersecurity, must be condemned and severely punished in accordance with regulations and laws.\u201d\n\nBack to the last wave of attacks, the APT32 hackers use phishing emails containing a weaponized attachment. It is interesting to note that the attachment is not a Word document, instead, it is an ActiveMime file containing an OLE file containing malicious macros.\n\nAnother element of innovation for this campaign is that attacker tracked the success of the phishing emails, using legitimate cloud-based email analytics. The phishing attachments contain an HTML image tags.\n\n\u201cWhen a document with this feature is opened, Microsoft Word will attempt to download the external image, even if macros were disabled. In all phishing lures analyzed, the external images did not exist.\u201d reads the analysis. \u201cMandiant consultants suspect that APT32 was monitoring web logs to track the public IP address used to request remote images. When combined with email tracking software, APT32 was able to closely track phishing delivery, success rate, and conduct further analysis about victim organizations while monitoring the interest of security firms.\u201d\n\nThe embedded macros create two scheduled tasks to gain persistence for the backdoors used by the hackers.\n\nThe first task executes the Squiblydoo application to enable the download of a backdoor from APT32 infrastructure. The second leads to a secondary backdoor delivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script configured to communicate with the domains blog.panggin[.]org, share.codehao[.]net, and yii.yiihao126[.]net.\n\n\n\nAPT32 threat actors regularly cleared select event log entries in order to conceal their operations, they also heavily obfuscated their PowerShell-based tools and shellcode loaders with Daniel Bohannon\u2019s Invoke-Obfuscation framework.\n\nThe arsenal of APT32 includes a custom suite of backdoors such as Windshield, Komprogo, Soundbite, Phoreal, and Beacon.\n\nFireEye warns of the increasing number of nation-state actors using cyber operations to gather intelligence.\n\n\u201cFireEye assesses that APT32 is a cyber espionage group aligned with Vietnamese government interests,\u201d Concluded FireEye. \u201cAs more countries utilize inexpensive and efficient cyber operations, there is a need for public awareness of these threats and renewed dialogue around emerging nation-state intrusions that go beyond public sector and intelligence targets.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT32, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt32", "topic_name": "APT32"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vietnam", "topic_name": "Vietnam"}]}, {"news_name": "Security experts link WannaCry ransomware to Lazarus Group", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59139/apt/wannacry-ransomware-lazarus-group.html", "title": "Security experts link WannaCry ransomware to Lazarus Group\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 16, 2017", "body": "The security researcher at Google Neel Mehta published a mysterious tweet using the #WannaCryptAttribution hashtag.

In a post I have published on the Infosec Institute I have summarized what has happened in the last weeks and what has been disclosed by the organization.\n\nBelow the list of previous batches published by Wikileaks:\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks, the AfterMidnight malware framework allows CIA operators to dynamically load and execute malicious payload on a target system.\n\nThe principal payload is disguised as a self-persisting Windows Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file and executes small payloads dubbed \u201cGremlins\u201d that are able to subvert the functionality of targeted software, gather target\u2019s information, or providing services for other gremlins.\n\n\u201c\u2018Gremlin\u2019 is the term for an AM payload that is meant to run hidden on target and either:\n\n\n\nThe documents include the AfterMidnight user guide, below the description provided by the manual for the malware platform:\n\n\u201cAfterMidnight is a DLL that self-persists as a Windows Service DLL and provides secure execution of \u201cGremlins\u201d via a HTTPS based LP. Once installed on a target machine AM will call back to a configured LP on a configurable schedule, checking to see if there is a new plan for it to execute.\u201d reads the user guide.\u201dIf there is, it downloads and stores all needed components before loading all new gremlins in memory. All local storage is encrypted with an \u201cLP\u201d key that is not stored on the client. If AM is unable to contact the LP it will be unable to execute any payload.\u201d\n\nThe local storage used by the AfterMidnight is encrypted with a key which is not stored on the target machine.\n\nCIA operators can schedule a custom task using a custom script language included in a special module \u201cAlphaGremlin.\u201d\n\nThe second Malware Framework, so-called Assassin, is described with the following statement by Wikipedia.\n\n\u201c\u201dAssassin\u201d is a similar kind of malware; it is an automated implant that provides a simple collection platform on remote computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. Once the tool is installed on the target, the implant is run within a Windows service process. \u201cAssassin\u201d (just like \u201cAfterMidnight\u201d) will then periodically beacon to its configured listening post(s) to request tasking and deliver results.\u201d states WikiLeaks. \u201cCommunication occurs over one or more transport protocols as configured before or during deployment.

The most recent attack allegedly attributed to this group is the one to French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron\u2019s campaign. Incident response to this Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and damage limitation heavily relies on network traffic investigation.\n\nIn late 2016, Redsocks security identified one expired domain attributed to APT28. Our effort to sinkhole APT28 based on using this domain was impeded by the encrypted communication channel. Although many published white papers concerning APT28 such as ESET mentions RC4 encryption algorithm, they do not dig into the details of the used key and the details of APT28 implementation of RC4; whether the key is static and breakable. In this report, we aim to reveal the result of our comprehensive dynamic analysis of x-agent malware towards decrypting its traffic. We started our investigation by using one of the APT28 droppers (see Table 1).\n\n\n\nThe focus of our investigation has been decrypting APT28 communicated traffic. Thus, this report elaborates more on encryption functionality of x-agent and reports our finding on cracking x-agent communicated traffic. That said, our report is not limited to encryption cracking and sheds light on following:\n\nFollowing the encryption-decryption scheme we present, and by vast internet scanning and searching for the URL pattern we introduce in this white paper, current active APT28 servers and victims can be found. Communication to these servers for further investigation can be established.\n\nThe dropper functions in two steps. In the first step, it only unpacks a dll to the Windows folder. The name of the file is fixed (static) and it does not change by multiple executions or on different workstations. In the second step, the dropper loads the dll by calling ShellExecuteW function of shell32 library. This function is called by rundll32.exe, and \u201c\u201dC:\\Windows\\83D2CDE2-8311-40CB-B51D-EBE20FA803D1.dll\u201d,init\u201d as arguments. This means the trace of the malware, later, should be looked in rundll32 execution. The dropper also creates \u201cose00000.exe\u201d file in the windows folder and calls it with arguments to the dll and the dropper path address. In summary, the dropper creates two files \u201c83D2CDE2-8311-40CB-B51D-EBE20FA803D1.dll\u201d and \u201cose00000.exe\u201d in windows directory with hidden attribute (see Table 1 for the corresponding hashes) and loads one with rundll32.exe. The result of the dropper execution is rundll32.exe and ose00000.exe as two separate processes. No network activity was observed during dropper execution.\n\nThe dropper goal was to transfer control to 83D2CDE2-8311-40CB-B51D-EBE20FA803D1.dll (see Table 1 for SHA256 hash) which is a rootkit with keylogging and remote code execution capabilities.\n\nX-agent architecture\n\nx-agent has a sophisticated architecture; it has a modular structure in both functionalities and the communication channel implementation. Figure 1 presents the x-agent architecture of the sample we analyzed.\n\n\n\nX-agent execution\n\nThe execution starts from init function of the loaded dll by rundll32. The first interesting event after transferring control to Init is a call to KERNEL32.GetVolumeInformationW. After this call, the Init function initializes the global variables:\n\n\n\nNext, the init function initializes the available modules for execution (see ESET report on the explanation of modules). Our malware sample had 3 modules:\n\nAfter initializing the data structure of these modules, CHOPSTICK creates different threads for different tasks. Modules are created in a loop based on their configuration and AgentKernel is created differently:\n\n\n\nAfter creation of the threads, execution is transferred to AgentKernel and Module threads. Agent Kernel module initially prepares a message for the server and then waits for the server to respond with a command. The message intends to introduce the victim by an agent ID to the server and report the supported modules for execution. This message is written to edg6EF885E2.tmp file in the temp folder. The sample we analyzed communicates over HTTP channel. The implementation is using WININET APIs.\n\nBefore sending data, the channel thread checks the connectivity to the server. It, first, tries to resolve \u201cadobeincorp.com\u201d domain name. If it fails, it tries connecting to two hardcoded IP addresses. After successful connection to the server, it creates the URL request and post data based on the data prepared by other modules.  X-agent first sends a get request and then a post request. The communication is always encrypted. We explain the nature of communicated data and the encryption method in the next section.\n\nIn summary, these sequences of actions happen in every execution of x-agent:\n\nX-agent traffic communication\n\nIn order to explain how to decrypt APT28 traffic, we first need to understand the traffic pattern of the malware. The x-agent version 1 we analyzed communicates by sending an initial GET request following by HTTP post requests. The http header values of the requests are hardcoded except one query string of the request. The URL of a x-agent traffic looks like:\n\n/webhp?rel=psy&hl=7&ai=L2Bd93t_o-jl022K1Og4Bm9mSk8QO88K_3ZQZuKcoPwur-5Q7Y=\n\n\u201c/webhp?rel=psy&hl=7&ai=\u201d part of the URL and the final \u201c= \u201csign are persistent in different executions. As a matter of fact, \u201c/webhp?rel=psy&hl=7&ai=\u201d is hardcoded in the code. The next 51 bytes are not in plaintext; briefly, it contains the timestamp of the request and the ID of the agent. The initial POST data of x-agent is 71 bytes and ends with a = as well. The data is encrypted and when decrypted is equal to:\n\n56 34 4D 47|4E 78 5A 57|6C 76 63 6D|68 6A 4F 47|39 79 5A 51|6B 30 84 F2|01 00 00 01|00 23 01 10|\n\n23 01 11 23|01 13 23\n\nThe blue part is the ID of the agent (the victim). The yellow part is the ID of the module who sent the data. And finally, the green part is actually the list of modules separated by # character (0x23) that are installed and ready to be used by the server (see Figure 4 for more explanation).\n\nBelow is the Http implementation of the channel by x-agent:\n\n\n\n\n\nEncryption module\n\nThe encryption procedure is called with two arguments. The pointers are to two data structures. These data structures provide a reference to the two following data for the encryption class:\n\nThe seed is hardcoded and, among others, the init function copies it to the data segment using immediate constants:\n\n\n\nLater, in the code, 4 random bytes are appended to the seed and these altogether form the key for encryption. The seed is 50 bytes and the key length in total is 54 bytes. The data can be of variable size. For instance, the default initial request from AgentKernel is 39 bytes (see Figure 4) in total and includes: agent ID, module ID (the sender of the message) and the supported modules. The data is always appended to a 20 bytes data token, agent ID and the sender module ID. This data token is used for decryption result verification by the server. After creating the cypher using RC4 (see the next section), the encryption procedure adds a 8 random value to the message and then converts the whole binary string to URL compatible BASE64. . Next, the encryption procedure adds a 7-byte time stamp to the message. In summary the encryption class does the following:\n\nRC4 function\n\nRC4 is a stream cypher algorithm and is based on byte permutation. The elaborate explanation of RC4 is out of the scope of this paper. The below code is the implementation of RC4 algorithm by x-agent. The arguments to the function are 4 bytes random value, seed and the plaintext data:\n\nCPU Disasm\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to decrypt x-agent data\n\nAs mentioned briefly, the only randomness in the x-agent encryption is a 4 random bytes appended to a 50 bytes seed that has been given in the previous section. Since RC4 is a synchronous stream cypher, one can decrypt the traffic only with the same key that is used for encryption. A decryption algorithm for x-agent must use the same RC4 function for decryption with the same arguments. The cypher input must be the same data byte stream from the http request i.e. the timestamp and random bytes must be stripped. The RC4 function must be called in a bruteforced way with all possible values from 0 to -1. This is a known plain-text attack since the result must contain \u201cV4MGNxZWlvcmhjOG9yZQ\u201d. The encryption must be broken in a matter of seconds with a normal personal computer.\n\nAbout the Author REDSOCKS By Sina Davanian\nRedSocks is a Dutch company specialised in malware detection.

When the target believes that the phishing site is the real login site of the internet service he was using, he might reenter his credentials on the phishing site.\u201d reads the analysis shared by Trend Micro.\n\n\n\nThe technique was used to swap inactive open tabs with an illegitimate site, in this way attackers tricked victims into providing sensitive information while thinking to visit a legitimate website.\n\n\u201cPawn Storm has been using a variant of tabnabbing.15 In this attack scenario, the target gets an email supposedly coming from a website he might be interested in\u2014maybe from a conference he is likely to visit or a news site he has subscribed to. The email has a link to a URL that looks very legitimate. When the target reads his email and clicks on the link, it will open in a new tab. This new tab will show the legitimate website of a conference or news provider after being redirected from a site under the attackers\u2019 control. The target is likely to spend some time browsing this legitimate site. Distracted, he probably did not notice that just before the redirection, a simple script was run, changing the original webmail tab to a phishing site. When the target has finished reading the news article or conference information on the legitimate site, he returns to the tab of his webmail.

The attacker controlling the light source can be located far away from the targeted scanner\u201d\n\nIn order to transfer data from an air-gapped network, researchers use a light source near the scanner that then receives the commands.\n\nThe scanner detects reflected light on its glass pane and translates it into binary and convert it into an image. Scanners are sensitive to any changes of light in the surrounding environment, even when a paper is on the glass or when the light source is infrared.\n\n\n\nThe researchers transmitted the signal to the scanner by pointing a light at its glass pane. the commands are sent with a binary encoding obtained by turning on and off the light. The commands are included between specific binary sequences (1001).\n\nAccording to the researchers, the attacker can also send messages to the malicious code by hijacking an existing light source installed in the vicinity of the scanner, let\u2019s think of a smart bulb.\n\nIn the test conducted by the researchers, the team of experts was able to delete a file on the target system by sending the command \u201cerase file xxx.doc\u201d via a laser positioned on a stand outside a glass-walled building from 900 meters away.\n\nIn a real attack scenario, it is possible to use a drone equipped with a laser gun while flying outside an office window.\n\nIn order to successfully conduct such kind of attacks, it is necessary the presence of the malware on the target machine, and to receive the light a scanner with at least partially open lid must be connected to the PC.\n\nIn a real attack scenario, a malicious code could infect the target network, then scans it searching for scanners. In order to avoid detection, the scan could start at nighttime or during the weekend when the office is empty.\n\nLet\u2019s give a look at the speed of transmission obtained with this technique, it took 50 milliseconds to transmit each bit of the command.\n\nThis means that a 64-bit message took about three seconds to be transmitted, and the malware read the signal in real-time and acknowledged receipt by triggering a second scan once the command sequence ended.\n\nIn the test conducted by the Israeli researchers, the team used the technique to trigger a ransomware attack, sending the command to encrypt data from a car in the parking lot. The attacker controlled the fluctuating lightbulb via Bluetooth from a Samsung Galaxy S4.\n\n\u201cThe driver held a Samsung Galaxy S4 while driving in order to perform the attack from, a dedicated application that we wrote and installed on the Galaxy. The application scans for a MagicBlue smart bulb and connects to it. After connection, the application modulates a given command as light sequence using a series of \u201con\u201d (1 bit) and \u201coff\u201d (0 bit) signals sent from over a BLE channel\u201d continues the paper.\n\n\n\nThe scanners used in the attack could detect changes in brightness from the smart bulb, a 5 percent reduction of light, and in sequences that lasted less than 25 milliseconds. An attack with this characteristic goes undetected to the human eyes.\n\nThe researchers say that a possible countermeasure to disconnect scanners from internal networks, but this solution is not feasible due to the impact on the ordinary work of the employees of a target company.\n\nThe best countermeasure consists in the setting up a proxy system whereby the scanner is connected by wire to a computer on the organization\u2019s network that processes data from the scanner, in this way the scanner isn\u2019t directly connected to the network.\n\n\u201cHowever, we believe that a proxy based solution will prevent the attacker from establishing such a covert channel without the need to apply extreme changes. The scanner will be connected by a wire directly (e.g., using a USB interface) to a computer (proxy) within the organization\u2019s network instead of being connected to the network. The proxy will provide an API. When a scanning request is received, the computer initiates a scan and processes the output in a classifier in order to detect malicious scan\u201d concluded the researchers.\n\nBelow the PoC videos of the attacks:\n\n\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013scanners, air-gapped network)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/air-gapped-network", "topic_name": "air-gapped network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/scanner", "topic_name": "scanner"}]}, {"news_name": "Callisto APT Group exploited Hacking Team surveillance tools to hack Government targets", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58051/hacking/callisto-apt-hacking-team-tools.html", "title": "Callisto APT Group exploited Hacking Team surveillance tools to hack Government targets\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 16, 2017", "body": "According to F-Secure Labs, The Callisto APT Group used the HackingTeam leaked surveillance software to gather intelligence on foreign and security policy in eastern Europe and the South Caucasus.\n\nThe Callisto APT group targeted government officials, military personnel, journalists and think tanks since at least 2015.\n\nF-Secure is still investigating the case, the experts of the company reported that the Callisto Group\u2019s infrastructure has links with entities in China, Russia, and Ukraine.\n\nThe researchers speculate the attacker is a nation-state actor:\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances.\u201d reads the report published by F-Secure. \u201cWhile the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group\u2019s activity is a nation state with a specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal element.

Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn\u2019s tools for the past three years and has continued to track the group in order to learn more about its tools, tactics, and procedures.\u201d reads the analysis published by Symantec.\n\n\u201cThe tools used by Longhorn closely follow development timelines and technical specifications laid out in documents disclosed by WikiLeaks.\u201d\n\nSymantec believes Longhorn is a North American hacking group that has been active since at least 2011. The group is very sophisticated and used zero-day exploits and complex malware to conduct targeted attacks against governments and organizations in almost every industry, including financial, energy, telecommunications and education, aerospace.\n\nThe Longhorn group is a well-resourced hacking team that operated on a standard Monday to Friday working week in an American time zone. The nature of the targets and its Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs) suggests the Longhorn group is a state-sponsored crew.\n\nThe targets were all in located in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one case, the researchers observed the Longhorn group compromising a computer in the US, following infection, an uninstaller was quickly executed, which demonstrates that this victim was infected unintentionally.\n\n\u201cThe Longhorn group shares some of the same cryptographic protocols specified in the Vault 7 documents, in addition to following leaked guidelines on tactics to avoid detection.\u201d continues Symantec. \u201cGiven the close similarities between the tools and techniques, there can be little doubt that Longhorn\u2019s activities and the Vault 7 documents are the work of the same group.\u201d continues Symantec.\n\nDigging the precious Vault 7 archive the experts discovered the Fluxwire cyber espionage malware. The documents related to this malware include a changelog of dates for when new features were added to the malicious code, the features, the timeline are coherent with the development cycle of the Corentry malware created by Longhorn APT.\n\n\u201cThese dates align closely with the development of one Longhorn tool (Trojan.Corentry) tracked by Symantec. New features in Corentry consistently appeared in samples obtained by Symantec either on the same date listed in the Vault 7 document or several days later, leaving little doubt that Corentry is the malware described in the leaked document.\u201d reads Symantec.\n\n\u201cEarly versions of Corentry seen by Symantec contained a reference to the file path for the Fluxwire program database (PDB) file. The Vault 7 document lists removal of the full path for the PDB as one of the changes implemented in Version 3.5.0.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cUp until 2014, versions of Corentry were compiled using GCC [GNU Compiler Collection]. According to the Vault 7 document, Fluxwire switched to an MSVC compiler for version 3.3.0 on February 25, 2015. This was reflected in samples of Corentry, where a version compiled on February 25, 2015, had used MSVC as a compiler.\u201d\n\nA second document in the Vault 7 archive details Fire and Forget, a specification for user-mode injection of a payload by a tool called Archangel.\n\nThe specification of the malicious code and the interface used to load it matches the Longhorn tool called Backdoor.Plexor.\n\nThe experts discovered many other similarities, another leaked CIA document outlined cryptographic protocols that should be implemented in the malware development.\n\n\u201cA third document outlines cryptographic protocols that malware tools should follow. These include the use of inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, key exchange once per connection, and use of AES with a 32-bit key. These requirements align with the cryptographic practices observed by Symantec in all of the Longhorn tools.\u201d continues Symantec.\n\nanother Vault 7 document recommends using of in-memory string de-obfuscation and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for communicating with the command and control (C&C) servers.\n\nAll the above techniques and protocols were implemented in all the hacking tools of the Longhorn group.\n\nResearchers from Symantec discovered a number of indicators that confirm Longhorn was from an English-speaking, North American country.\n\n\u201cThe acronym MTWRFSU (Monday Tuesday Wednesday ThuRsday Friday Saturday SUnday) was used to configure which day of the week malware would communicate with the attackers. This acronym is common in academic calendars in North America.\u201d reads Symantec.\u201dSome of the code words found in the malware, such as SCOOBYSNACK, would be most familiar in North America. In addition to this, the compilation times of tools with reliable timestamps indicate a time zone in the Americas.\u201d\n\nSummarizing, there is no doubt Longhorn group has the same abilities and hacking tools of the CIA operators documented in the Vault 7 documents.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Longhorn group, CIA Vault 7)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia-vault-7", "topic_name": "CIA Vault 7"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/longhorn-group", "topic_name": "Longhorn group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wikileaks", "topic_name": "Wikileaks"}]}, {"news_name": "Operation Cloud Hopper \u2013  APT10 goes after Managed Service Providers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57781/apt/operation-cloud-hopper-apt10.html", "title": "Operation Cloud Hopper \u2013  APT10 goes after Managed Service Providers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 6, 2017", "body": "Security experts from PwC UK and BAE Systems have uncovered a widespread hacking campaign, tracked as Operation Cloud Hopper, targeting managed service providers (MSPs) in multiple countries worldwide.

Penguin Turla was designed to compromise Linux machines with a backdoor based on the open-source LOKI2 backdoor that was released in Phrack magazine in September 1997.\n\n\u201cThe revelation that the Moonlight Maze attacks were dependent on a Solaris/*NIX toolkit and not a Windows one as is the case with most of Turla, actually revived our hopes.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.  \u201cIn 2014, Kaspersky announced the discovery of Penquin Turla, a Linux backdoor leveraged by Turla in specific attacks. We turned our attention once again to the rare Penquin samples and noticed something interesting: the code was compiled for the Linux Kernel versions 2.2.0 and 2.2.5, released in 1999. Moreover, the statically linked binaries libpcap and OpenSSL corresponded to versions released in the early 2000s. Finally, despite the original assessment incorrectly surmising that Penquin Turla was based on cd00r (an open-source backdoor by fx), it was actually based on LOKI2, another open-source backdoor for covert exfiltration written by Alhambra and daemon9 and released in Phrack in the late 1990s.\u201d\n\nGuerrero-Saade explained that of the 45 Moonlight Maze binaries that were detected by experts at Kaspersky, nine of them were examples of the LOKI2 backdoor.\n\nThis discovery is amazing because it demonstrates a 20-year-old hacking tool is still effective against high-value targets.\n\n\u201cThis speaks to the state of Linux security and the lack of awareness\u2014and even hubris\u2014that goes into some Linux system administration, an ill-advised approach for government and corporate settings,\u201d Guerrero-Saade said. \u201cThese guys (Moonlight Maze) didn\u2019t have to play the cat-and-mouse game with antivirus companies or rewrite their toolkit 30 times to get it through VirusTotal and still hope it works. It\u2019s terrifying to see that the evolved Penquin Turla samples are based on 20 year old code and still linked to libraries built in 1999-2004 and they still work on modern machines. You\u2019d never see that on Windows.\u201d\n\nSummarizing the possible link between the Moonlight Maze\u2019s early UNIX and Solaris toolkits and modern Turla Windows attacks is the LOKI2 backdoor used in the Penguin Turla attacks.\n\nThe researchers conducted an intriguing a lucky investigation, they have found the original artifacts thanks a system administrator in the U.K. named David Hedges who in cooperation with the London Metropolitan Police and the FBI logged every keystroke happening on a server targeted by the Moonlight Maze. The researchers were able to find Hedges because of a redaction error in an FBI FOIA release.\n\nHedges confirmed that the server was still running and he provided access to logs that include evidence of the Moonlight Maze operation, along with the a toolkit with 43 binaries used in their attacks.\n\nThe investigation revealed further details, the researchers focused on a little-known operation codenamed \u2018Storm Cloud\u2019.

In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using Icedcoffee, a JavaScript payload delivered via macro-enabled Office documents.\n\nLast time the researchers reported Turla\u2018s activities was February 2017, when experts at Kaspersky Lab have discovered a new piece of JavaScript malware linked to the group targeting organizations in Greece, Qatar, and Romania.\n\nTurla has been active since at least 2007, the hackers launched several high-profile attacks against targets worldwide, including the ones aimed at Swiss defense firm RUAG and the U.S. Central Command.\n\nCarbon, aka Pfinet, is once of the tool in the arsenal of the hacking crew, researchers from ESET described it as a lite version of Uroburos.\n\nCarbon is a second-stage backdoor that is typically deployed after the reconnaissance phase of an attack, it has several components, including a dropper, a command and control (C&C) communications element, an orchestrator, and a loader that executes the orchestrator.\n\nThe orchestrator is used to inject the C&C communications library into a legitimate process, and dispatch the tasks received via the C&C library to other bots that are located on the network.\n\n\n\nESET has identified several versions of Carbon compiled last year; the most recent one was compilated on October 21, 2016. The newer versions of the Carbon malware make a massive use of encryption.\n\nAlmost any component is a DLL file, except for the loader, which is an EXE file.\n\n\u201cThe Turla group is known to be painstaking and work in stages, first doing reconnaissance on their victims\u2019 systems before deploying their most sophisticated tools such as Carbon. \n\nA classic Carbon compromise chain starts with a user receiving a spearphishing email or visiting a previously compromised website, typically one that the user visits regularly \u2014 a technique known as a watering hole attack.\u201d reads the analysis shared by ESET.\n\n\u201cAfter a successful attack, a first stage backdoor \u2014 such as Tavdig or Skipper \u2014 is installed on the user machine. Once the reconnaissance phase is over, a second stage backdoor, like Carbon, is installed on key systems.\u201d\n\nThreat actor behind Turla have modified their tools everytime they were detected in the wild. Researchers observed that in the case of Carbon, the hackers changed file names and mutexes in the version 3.8 released in the summer of 2016.\n\nExperts noticed that before the malware start communicating with C&C, it checks the infected system for the presence of packet capture software, such as Wireshark and Tcpdump.\n\n\u201cBefore communicating with the C&C server or with other computers, the malware ensures that none of the most common packet capture software is running on the system:\n\nStay Tuned \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Turla APT group, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "APT29 group used domain fronting to evade detection long before these techniques were widely known", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57456/apt/apt29-group-domain-fronting.html", "title": "APT29 group used domain fronting to evade detection long before these techniques were widely known\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 28, 2017", "body": "Security firm FireEye continues to follow APT29 group (aka The Dukes, Cozy Bear and Cozy Duke), on Monday it revealed that the cyber spies have been using a technique called \u201cdomain fronting\u201d to make hard the attribution of their attacks.\n\nIn December, the Signal development team introduced the \u2018domain fronting\u2019 technique to circumvent censorship.\n\nThe astonishing news is that the APT29 group adopted domain fronting long before these techniques were widely known in the IT security community.\n\nThe domain fronting is a technique that relies on the use of different domain names at different application layers to evade censorship.\n\n\n\nThe domain fronting techniques \u201chides the remote endpoint of a communication. Domain fronting works at the application layer, using HTTPS, to communicate with a forbidden host while appearing to communicate with some other host, permitted by the censor,\u201d as described in a paper published by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Psiphon, and Brave New Software.\n\n\u201cThe key idea is the use of different domain names at different layers of communication. One domain appears on the \u201coutside\u201d of an HTTPS request\u2014in the DNS request and TLS Server Name Indication\u2014while another domain appears on the \u201cinside\u201d\u2014in the HTTP Host header, invisible to the censor under HTTPS encryption.\u201d continues the paper.\u201dA censor, unable to distinguish fronted and nonfronted traffic to a domain, must choose between allowing circumvention traffic and blocking the domain entirely, which results in expensive collateral damage\u201d \n\nThe Domain fronting technique is easy to deploy and use and doesn\u2019t require special activities by network intermediaries.\n\nThe APT29 group has used the Domain fronting technique for at least two years, the hackers leveraged the Tor network to communicate with infected machines. In order to disguise Tor traffic as apparently legitimate traffic, the cyberspies used Meek, a Tor plugin that was specific designed to implement the domain fronting technique and allows users to send traffic to Tor inside a harmless-looking HTTPS POST request to google.com.\n\n\n\n\u201cAPT29 has used The Onion Router (TOR) and the TOR domain fronting plugin meek to create a hidden, encrypted network tunnel that appeared to connect to Google services over TLS.\u201d reads the analysis published by FireEye. \u201cThis tunnel provided the attacker remote access to the host system using the Terminal Services (TS), NetBIOS, and Server Message Block (SMB) services, while appearing to be traffic to legitimate websites. The attackers also leveraged a common Windows exploit to access a privileged command shell without authenticating.\u201d\n\nThe attackers installed the Tor client and the Meek plugin on the targeted system by using a PowerShell script and a .bat file.\n\nThe APT29 group leveraged the Sticky Keys exploit to replace the legitimate executable with the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) file and gain a shell on the targeted system with SYSTEM-level privileges. In this way, the attackers were able to execute several commands, including adding new accounts.\n\n\u201cThe attacker executed the PowerShell script C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Google\\start.ps1 to install the TOR services and implement the \u201cSticky Keys\u201d exploit. This script was deleted after execution, and was not recovered.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe script that executes the Sticky Keys exploit is also used to gain persistence on the target machine, it creates a Windows service named \u201cGoogle Update.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy employing a publicly available implementation, they were able to hide their network traffic, with minimal research or development, and with tools that are difficult to attribute. Detecting this activity on the network requires visibility into TLS connections and effective network signatures.\u201d concluded the analysis.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT29 group, domain fronting)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "US blames North Korea for the $81 million Bangladesh cyber heist", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57396/cyber-crime/bangladesh-cyber-heist.html", "title": "US blames North Korea for the $81 million Bangladesh cyber heist\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 24, 2017", "body": "The news was reported by The Wall Street Journal, prosecutors suspect the involvement of Chinese middlemen who helped the Government of Pyongyang to organize the cyber theft.\n\nIn February 2016, unknown hackers transferred the funds from the Bangladesh\u2019s account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank to accounts in the Philippines through the SWIFT system.\n\nIn reality, the hackers attemted to steal much more, they tried to complete dozens of transfers for an overall amount of $850 million.\n\nThe disaster was avoided by accident because the bank\u2019s security systems and typos in some requests allowed the identification of the theft attempts, investigators discovered that hackers failed 35 transfer attempts.\n\n\u201c$81 million was transferred from the Federal Reserve Bank to Filipino accounts while attempts to claim $850 million were foiled by the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s security system,\u201d Razee Hassan, deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, told AFP.\n\n\u201cAttempts to transfer money to Sri Lanka by the hackers were foiled as their transfer requests contained typos,\u201d he added.\n\nThe hackers exploited gaps in communication between banks at weekends, the operation started on a Friday because the Bangladesh Bank is closed, on the following days, Saturday and Sunday, the Fed Bank in New York was being closed.\n\n\n\nThe choice of the Philippines as the landing country for the bank transfers was not casual, banks were also closed on the Monday due to the Chinese New Year.\n\nA top police investigator in Dhaka told Reuters in December that some Bangladesh Bank officials deliberately exposed its computer systems allowing hackers to penetrate the systems.\n\nThe Justice Department and the New York Fed declined to comment on the report.\n\nThe suspect of the involvement of the North Korea behind the cyber heist is not a novelty\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation believes that North Korea is responsible for the heist, an official briefed on the probe told Reuters.

Attackers operated with the intent to cause a sort of political scandal.\n\nWe have the reason to believe the attackers aimed to make the opponent losing integrity or popularity in the political landscape.\n\nStates are sponsoring cyber attacks leveraging specific kind of malware, injecting them in the computer of the victims with methods and techniques ever more sophisticated and spying on the victims to gather sensitive information and power further lethal spear phishing attacks.\n\nIt is even more clear that the National CERTs are becoming mandatory in the defence line of any States, they are assuming the role of the front line against such kind of state sponsored activities.\n\nThe real questions are:\n\nActually, the situation is very complex, we have states with quite different cyber capabilities.

But this attack is the prosecution of the long string of cyber attacks occurred in the past and that are targeting the reputation of the targets and their ability to \u201cinfluence\u201d the political dialogue.\nBy the way, the malware formed and wrapped tells a lot about what is happening, let\u2019s try to summarize key findings:\n\nA: The usage of the PowerSploit is an important sign for us, it shows that a vector to inject process under an adjustable permitted privilege can be done in Windows system (and, well, in other OS too).\nBut, this case shows us to be alerted to the abuse by the usage of powershell.exe (which is a good tool). The powershell.exe injected shellcode is all the PoisonIvy malware itself, that was where the fileless works are coming.\nAnd it is not necessarily \u201cby powershell.exe\u201d, if you know what I mean.\nFor APT the countermeasure itself, it is a matter of the action time. We, in security ring in Japan know this. APT is designed not to be easily detected. When you think an APT is spotted and reported, don\u2019t wait until security products releasing the blocking signature, but read reference analysis, historical facts and confirm those all by yourself, is a must for CERT. In this case, Yahoo Incident Team is doing SUPER great response, also our JP-CERT/CC good folks.\n\nA: Many abuses using the malware that is used for the similar purpose nowadays.

The investigations started after Polish banks had been infected with a sophisticated strain of malware.\n\nPolish banks confirmed their systems were infected with a malware after their staff visited the site of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority.\n\nIn order to avoid spreading the malware, the authorities took the decision to shut down the entire network at the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) \u201cin order to secure evidence.\u201d\n\nBoth security firms BAE Systems and Symantec started their investigation on the attacks. According to Symantec, the threat actor behind the attack is the same that targeted financial organizations in 31 countries since at least October 2016.\n\nAccording to Symantec, the Polish website used to target the Polish banks delivered a strain of malware known to be part of the toolkit of the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe attackers exploited \u201cwatering holes\u201d in order to infect the machines of a specific audience with previously unknown malware.\n\n\u201cSymantec has blocked attempts to infect customers in Poland, Mexico and Uruguay by the same exploit kit that infected the Polish banks. Since October, 14 attacks against computers in Mexico were blocked, 11 against computers in Uruguay, and two against computers in Poland.\u201d reads the analysis published by Symantec.\n\nAt the time, Symantec said it had \u201cweak evidence\u201d to blame the Lazarus APT, but now the data gathered by the experts confirm the involvement of the group.\n\nThe malicious code was instructed to infect visitors whose IP address showed they were from 104 specific organizations in 31 countries.\n\nThe largest number of victims were in Poland, followed by the United States, and Mexico.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus APT, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/financial-supervision-authority", "topic_name": "Financial Supervision Authority"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/knf", "topic_name": "KNF"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus-group", "topic_name": "Lazarus Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/polish-banks", "topic_name": "Polish banks"}]}, {"news_name": "New APT Campaign based on Poison Ivy RAT with C&C in China has been reversed by MalwareMustDie", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57212/apt/poison-ivy-rat-china.html", "title": "New APT Campaign based on Poison Ivy RAT with C&C in China has been reversed by MalwareMustDie\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 17, 2017", "body": "Our travel along the great analysis of a fresh, new insidious APT China campaign.\n\nAt the beginning, it seemed always the same story: a Word document probably infected, an ordinary story of phishing and nothing more.\n\nIf we check at the top of the long analysis of MalwareMustDie we can see the pictures of an ordinary mail, with the boring, ordinary infected Office Word attachment, nothing new under the sun.\n\nThe strange fact was that the suspect document was on a common blog web site like Geocities delivering a multi-layered base64 encoded VBScript script which manually decoded at the first layer have given the resulted below:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The VBScript encoded with \u201cpowershell.exe\u201d command.\n\nThe classical vbscript \u201ccreatebject\u201d instruction is followed by a Powershell command: \u201cpowershell.exe \u2013w hdden \u2013ep bypass \u2013Enc with a long encoded string\u201d\n\nPoweshell? Encoded command? \u201cBypass\u201d option used for what?\n\nSomething not so \u201cordinary nor boring\u201d rises from the underground of the investigation and here the analysis of MalwarareMustDie starts to become interesting and surprising step after step.\n\nDigging into the details of the functions decoded in the other layers of VBScript in a looping process revealed a complex source code fully executable by Powershell: and we have to admit that following MalwareMustDie in his analysis it\u2019s like riding the roller coaster, the same enjoyment.\n\nHere it is an example of the base 64 manually decoded code that revealed another nested base 64 encoded code. The functions represented in the picture are self-explaining as said in the analysis and it is clear that something dangerous is going on the victim computer.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The VBScript base 64 decoded code.\n\nAfter different loops decoding base 64 layers the result is clear: beyond the Word attachment document, hidden in the VBScript file, there is a long and dangerous script ready to be executed by Powershell: but \u201cwhere I have already seen this source code\u201d?\n\nThe code in the VBScript running the Powershell command is a \u201ccopy pasta\u201d of an infamous malware based on Powershell PowerSploit/CodeExecution PoC code which is publicly available on GitHub, same file, extension .ps1.\n\nHere it is the main web page of the exploit with the documentation:\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The PowerSploit / CodeExecution web page on GitHub.\n\nThe documentation of the exploit states: \u201cInject shellcode into the process ID of your choosing or within the context of the running PowerShell process\u201d. Easy: this is hacking pret-a-porter.\n\nAnd here we have the first Lesson Learnt of this investigation: how big is the damage to the community of the users keeping the malware code publicly available on GitHub: we will not stress enough repeating how would be important not to have this source code ready to use.\n\nBut let give a look to the Shellcode, because the most important task now is reverse it and understand what is the main purpose of its use, why is injected on the computer victims, which technics and mechanisms adopted for doing what, connecting where. The story is getting exciting!\n\nBut again the Shellcode is encoded using base 64: when decoded it appears as reported in the picture below:\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The Shellcode.\n\nThe reverse activity seems to be a long task and again \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 we discover a great trick from MalwareMustDie in order to compile the shellcode and have an executable file to run safely:\n\n\u201cSaving the shellcode data in the .textsection  of the assembly file and the entry point(EP) will be \u201cadjusted\u201d by the compiler during compilation process therefore you can execute this shellcode as a binary PE file. This method is very useful when analysing shellcodes. And by using a Unix environment you can create this PE without risking an infection.\u201d\n\nWe report the figure of the adopted process here:\n\n\n\nFigure 5. How handle the shellcode to build up a useful .exe file\n\nThe result of this process is to have a \u201cbeautiful\u201d stupid-shellcode.exe file ready to run in order to understand the behaviour for further investigations.\n\nRunning the malware discovered the behavior can be discovered: it extracts the information from the victim\u2019s computer calling back its C2 server with the target to perform all the malicious actions. The analysis of the payload behavior has always fascinated and the security researchers can spend days \u201cfollowing the money\u201d.\n\nAt the end it is sure we are fronting the famous \u2013 or infamous \u2013 Poison Ivy.\n\nRunning the Shellcode it is possible to observe that it uses a lot of system calls involving DLLs mostly related to the kernel of the system: and at the first stage of trace-assemby of the Shellcode provides a fake process named userint.exe used to inject the malicious code, that is executed in this way.\n\nHere an image from the MalwareMustDie analysis reported above:\n\n\n\nFigure 6. The fake process userinit.exe created and injected.\n\nThe great knowledge in malware by MalwareMustDie rise up in all his strength: he is able to find many elements that can be traced back to Poison Ivy.\n\nThe combination of the usage of certain DLL, he says, \u201cis showing a typical pattern of the threat too. Moreover, the date stamped in the MUTEX name is mostly used by Poison Ivy\u201c.\n\nThen other operations are performed by the malware:\n\nYes, no doubts that is Poison Ivy.\n\nThe last answer to close the loop is: where is the Command and Control server located?\n\nIf we give a look closer to the WS2_32.DLL we see that there are some interesting calls like:\n\nThese revealed hostname and IP address for the callback to the Command and Control server, which is based in Seul, Korea.\n\n\n\nFigure 7. C&C server based in Korea.\n\nNetwork/BGP Information\u2192\u300c61.97.243.15||4766 | 61.97.243.0/24 | KIXS-AS | KR | kisa.or.kr | KRNIC\u300d\n\nBut looking to the hostname we see that is web.outlooksysm.net on which is possible to invoke a WHOIS command that gives back, among other info, who is the Registrar: is a company based in Shanghai.\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Whois of the C&C server of the Poison Ivy malware.\n\nThe conclusion is that this APT campaign, which utilized multiple accounts on Geocities Japan, leading to the possibility that there is a larger APT campaign being conducted targeting Mongolian victim is\n\nThe information provided here is referred to the MalwareMustDie research and analysis linked above.\n\nThis kind of campaign has been renamed \u201cFree Hosting (pivoted) APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy\u201d (FHAPPI) by the gentleman who provided us the translation from the Japanese language, Mr. El Kentaro, making up very F-Happy to learn new methods and techniques.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nOdisseus is an Independent Security Researcher involved in Italy and worldwide in topics related to hacking, penetration testing, and development.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT, Poison Ivy RAT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/poison-ivy-rat", "topic_name": "Poison Ivy RAT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rat", "topic_name": "RAT"}]}, {"news_name": "Who is spying on communications in the Washington area?

The experts spotted a new sophisticated strain of malware dubbed StoneDrill that is linked to Shamoon 2 and Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef). StoneDrill can be used for both cyber espionage and sabotage, like Shamoon it wipes the infected computer.\n\nThe malware was used by threat actors against entities in Saudi Arabia and at least one organization in Europe.\n\n\u201cWhile investigating the Shamoon 2.0 attacks, Kaspersky Lab also discovered a previously unknown wiper malware which appears to be targeting organizations in Saudi Arabia.

This makes us believe the threat actor behind StoneDrill is expanding its wiping operations from the Middle East to Europe.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the time the report was published by Kaspersky, there are no reports of StoneDrill attacks that caused damage.\n\nThe discovery of the new threat was causal, researchers were using a set of Yara rules developed to identify the Shamoon malware.\n\nEven if StoneDrill and Shamoon don\u2019t share portions of code, the experts discovered many similarities between malware styles and malware components in Shamoon, StoneDrill, and NewsBeef.\n\nThe researchers are still investigating the infection process, they confirmed that StoneDrill implements sophisticated techniques to evade security applications.\n\nWhile Shamoon uses drivers during deployment, StoneDrill implements memory injection mechanisms of the wiping module into the victim\u2019s browser.\n\nThe wiper feature has been implemented using a new technique.\n\nThe wiper is able to target both physical and logical drives and reboots the system once the wipe process is completed.\n\n\u201cDepending on the configuration, this module wipes with random data one of following possible targets:\n\nThe researchers at Kaspersky have detected a StoneDrill sample that was specifically designed to establish a backdoor on the infected system.

According to the company, Shamoon infected more than 30,000 workstations.\n\nOn December 2016, security experts observed a new wave of attacks leveraging on the Shamoon malware. The malware experts from Palo Alto Networks and Symantec both reported an attack on a single Saudi company.\n\nThe new variant of Shamoon, so-called Shamoon 2, can rewrite the MBR on affected computers with an image of a three-year-old Syrian boy named Alan Kurdi that lay dead on a Turkish beach.\n\n\u201cWhy Shamoon has suddenly returned again after four years is unknown. However, with its highly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take notice,\u201d reported Symantec.\n\nIn January, researchers at Palo Alto Networks discovered a new strain of the Shamoon 2 malware that was targeting virtualization products.\n\nThe researchers at IBM\u2019s X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) believe Shamoon malware is pivot element in the information warfare between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nThe malware experts have identified servers used to deliver Shamoon, they have broken onto the server used by the attackers and gathered more information to study the threat and its attack chain.\n\n\u201cThis research led them to believe that the actor using Shamoon in recent attacks relied heavily on weaponized documents built to leverage PowerShell to establish their initial network foothold and subsequent operations:\u201d IBM reports.\n\n\n\nThe attackers launched a spear-phishing campaign against the potential targets, they used to impersonate a trusted person, for example, the Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and Investment or the Egyptian software company IT Worx.\n\nThe messages come with a Word document marked as a resume, health insurance paperwork, or password policy guidelines, anyway something of interest for the potential victim.\n\nThe documents include a malicious macro that starts the attack. When the victim executes the macro it launches two Powershell scripts.\n\n\u201cBased on observations associated with the malicious document, we observed subsequent shell sessions probably associated with Metasploit\u2019s Meterpreter that enabled deployment of additional tools and malware preceding deployment of three Shamoon-related files: ntertmgr32.exe, ntertmgr64.exe and vdsk911.sys,\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe researchers identified two web domains used to host malicious executables and launch the attacks.\n\n \n\nThis information is precious for system administrators that could check any connection to these domains and block it.\n\nThe experts discovered that attackers once infected the machine use them for reconnaissance, gathering information on the network and stealing sensitive information. Once completed this phase the attackers deploy the Shamoon payload.\n\nSaudi Arabia is warning local organizations about the Shamoon malware, experts believe that the threat actor behind these operations will continue its activity temporarily disappearing and changing tactic.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 shamoon, cyber weapon)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/saudi-arabia", "topic_name": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shamoon", "topic_name": "Shamoon"}]}, {"news_name": "Russian hacker Rasputin breaches over 60 Universities and Government Agencies", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56312/hacking/russian-hacker-rasputin-attacks.html", "title": "Russian hacker Rasputin breaches over 60 Universities and Government Agencies\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 15, 2017", "body": "According to the threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, a Russian-speaking black hat hacker, known as \u2018Rasputin\u2018, hacked systems of more than 60 universities and U.S. Government agencies.\n\n\n\nWe met Rasputin in December 2016, when he was offering for sale stolen login credentials for a U.S. agency that tests and certifies voting equipment, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC). Rasputin uses to exploit SQL injection flaws to gain access to sensitive information that he can sell on cybercrime marketplaces.\n\nRasputin uses SQL injection vulnerabilities to compromise target systems and steal sensitive information that he offers for sale cybercrime black markets.\n\nRecord Future has been following Rasputin since 2015, according to the security firm he may also have tried to sell details about the SQL injection to a broker working on behalf of a Middle Eastern government.\n\nBased on Rasputin\u2019s historical criminal forum activity, the experts exclude he is sponsored by a foreign government.\n\nResearchers at Recorded Future identified many of the Rasputins\u2019 victims, including ten universities in the United Kingdom, over two dozen universities in the United States, and many US government agencies.\n\nThe hacker breached the systems of government agencies includes local, state and federal organizations.

During our analysis, we determined that Komplex was used in a previous attack campaign targeting individuals running OS X that exploited a vulnerability in the MacKeeper antivirus application to deliver Komplex as a payload.\u201d reads the analysis published by PaloAlto in September 2016. \u201cKomplex shares a significant amount of functionality and traits with another tool used by Sofacy \u2013 the Carberp variant that Sofacy had used in previous attack campaigns on systems running Windows. In addition to shared code and functionality, we also discovered Komplex command and control (C2) domains that overlapped with previously identified phishing campaign infrastructures associated with the Sofacy group.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe Komplex malware has numerous similarities with the Carberp trojan, it was improved to gain access on PC and OS X systems and use the same command-and-control server.\n\nThe researchers noticed that Komplex\u2019s C2 domain appleupdate[.]org was not used in the past by the group, while both the apple-iclouds[.]net and itunes-helper[.]net domains have direct ties to the activity of the APT 28.\n\nThe new MAC OS X-Agent leverages domain names similar to the one used by Komplex Trojan, they only differ for the TLD.

The attackers dropped on the servers the malicious files that were used in the attacks against the Polish banks.\n\nIn order to avoid spreading the malware, the authorities took the decision to shut down the entire network at the KNF \u201cin order to secure evidence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe malware-based attack was confirmed by a number of banks that are currently investigating the security breach.\n\nAt the time I was writing there is no evidence that attackers successfully stolen money from Polish banks or their customers, but some of the target organizations confirmed to have noticed large outgoing data transfers.\n\nBoth security firms BAE Systems and Symantec started their investigation on the attacks. According to Symantec, the threat actor behind the attack is the same that targeted financial organizations in 31 countries since at least October 2016.\n\nAccording to Symantec, the Polish website used to target the Polish banks delivered a strain of malware known to be part of the toolkit of the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe activity of the Lazarus Group surged in 2014 and 2015, its members used mostly custom-tailored malware in their attacks and experts that investigated on the crew consider it highly sophisticated.\n\nThis threat actor has been active since at least 2009, possibly as early as 2007, and it was involved in both cyber espionage campaigns and sabotage activities aimed to destroy data and disrupt systems.\n\nThe experts at Symantec have spotted in the past at least three strains of malware used by the group, Backdoor.Fimlis, Backdoor.Fimlis.B, and Backdoor.Contopee, which have been used in targeted attacks against financial institutions.\n\nThe attackers exploited \u201cwatering holes\u201d in order to infect the machines of a specific audience with previously unknown malware.\n\n\u201cSymantec has blocked attempts to infect customers in Poland, Mexico and Uruguay by the same exploit kit that infected the Polish banks. Since October, 14 attacks against computers in Mexico were blocked, 11 against computers in Uruguay, and two against computers in Poland.\u201d reads the analysis published by Symantec.\n\nMalware researchers at Symantec have identified roughly 150 targeted IPs associated with more than 100 organizations across 31 countries. The attackers focused their activities on the banks, but the list of victims also includes ISPs and telecom operators.\n\n\u201cThe attackers appear to be using compromised websites to redirect visitors to a customized exploit kit, which is preconfigured to only infect visitors from approximately 150 different IP addresses. These IP addresses belong to 104 different organizations located in 31 different countries. The vast majority of these organizations are banks, with a small number of telecoms and internet firms also on the list.\u201d continues Symantec.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nExperts at Kaspersky have linked the group to the hacking operations Dark Seoul and Operation Troy. Kaspersky Lab, alongside with a number of security firms  including Novetta, AlienVault, Invincea, ThreatConnect, Volexity, Symantec, and PunchCyber have published reports related to the activities of the Lazarus Group.\n\nThe group of security firms formed an alliance called Operation Blockbuster that issued the detection signatures to neutralize the hacking tools used by the APT.\n\nIn June 2016, the analysis of SWIFT attacks revealed five additional pieces of malware containing portions of code shared by Lazarus Group.\n\nAccording to the analysis published by BAE Systems, one of the domains used in the Poland attack was also involved in a watering hole attack targeting the National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico (cnbv.gob.mx), the Mexican organization that is equivalent of Poland KNF.\n\n\u201cThe eye-watch[.]in domain appears to have been used in watering-hole attacks on other financial sector websites. On 2016-11-08 we observed connections to the site referred from:\n\nhxxp://www.cnbv.gob[.]mx/Prensa/Paginas/Sanciones.aspx\n\nThis is the page for the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico), specifically the portion of their site that details sanctions made by the Mexican National Banking Commission. This organisation is the Mexican banking supervisor and the equivalent of Poland\u2019s KNF.\u201d reads the analysis published by BAE Systems.\n\nBelow the key findings of the analysis conducted by BAE Systems:\n\nThere has been a series of watering hole attacks on bank supervisor websites in Poland & Mexico, and a state owned bank in Uruguay in recent months. These leverage Silverlight and Flash exploits to deliver malware.\n\nInvestigators in Poland have identified known Lazarus group implants on bank networks and associated this with the recent compromise of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority\u2019s website.\n\nThe technical/forensic evidence to link the Lazarus group actors (who we believe are behind the Bangladesh Bank attack and many others in 2016) to the watering-hole activity is unclear. However, the choice of bank supervisor / state-bank websites would be apt, given their previous targeting of Central Banks for Heists \u2013 even when it serves little operational benefit for infiltrating the wider banking sector.  \n\nGive a look at both reports, they are full of information and also includes IoCs.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Polish banks, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/financial-supervision-authority", "topic_name": "Financial Supervision Authority"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/knf", "topic_name": "KNF"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lazarus-group", "topic_name": "Lazarus Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/polish-banks", "topic_name": "Polish banks"}]}, {"news_name": "Russia suspected over cyber espionage campaign on the Italian foreign ministry", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56157/intelligence/italian-foreign-ministry-hacked.html", "title": "Russia suspected over cyber espionage campaign on the Italian foreign ministry\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 10, 2017", "body": "The Italian Foreign Ministry was the victim of a targeted cyber espionage campaign, according to The Guardian newspaper who cited a diplomatic source that has spoken on condition of anonymity.\n\nAccording to the source, the attack was launched by a nation-state actor, likely Russia.\n\n\u201cRussia is suspected by Italian officials of being behind a sustained hacking attack against the Italian foreign ministry last year that compromised email communications and lasted for many months before it was detected, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d reported The Guardian.\n\nThe source revealed that after the experts discovered the attack, the foreign ministry has introduced further security measures to improve its online \u201carchitecture\u201d and the internal security.

Anyway, at the time of writing the analysis, MacDownload is undetected by virus scanning engines on VirusTotal, while at the time I was writing just a dozen vendors have recognized the bogus Flash Player and Bitdefender apps as a threat.\n\nOnce the MacDownloader infects a device, the malware collects information about the host, including passwords stored in the Keychain.\n\n\u201cMacDownloader seems to be poorly developed and created towards the end of 2016, potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer. In multiple cases, the code used has been copied from elsewhere. The simple activity of downloading the remote file appears to have been sourced from a cheat sheet. The main purpose of MacDownloader seems to be to perform an initial profiling of the infected system and collection of credentials from macOS\u2019s Keychain password manager \u2013 which mirrors the focus of Windows malware developed by the same actors.\u201d reads the analysis published by the security duo.\n\nThe malicious code was first spotted on a fake website of the aerospace firm United Technologies Corporation, that same site that was used in the past to spread a Windows malware and the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF).\n\nThe malware researchers linked the MacDownloader with the activity of an Iranian threat actor known as Charming Kitten (aka Newscaster and NewsBeef).\n\nNewscaster group made the headlines in 2014 when experts at iSight issued a report describing the most elaborate net-based spying campaign organized by Iranian hackers using social media.\n\nIranian Hackers used a network of fake accounts (NEWSCASTER network) on principal social media to spy on US officials and political staff worldwide, this is reported in an analysis done by iSIGHT Partners. The Charming Kitten group is also known for the abuse of Open Source Security Tools, including the BeEF.\n\nThe analysis of the malware revealed that the authors have attempted to implement remote update and persistence capabilities, but both features don\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the application contains an unused attempt to install persistent access to the victim host. One segment provides a poorly-implemented shell script to save a response from the C2 and mark it for persistence by writing an entry in the /etc/rc.common file. In theory, every time the infected computer would start up, the shell script would be launched to download a file from a remote location, check if it changed from the previous iteration, and if so execute that new implant. While we haven\u2019t managed to obtain a proper response from the server before it was taken offline, our initial investigation did not find a subsequent implant.\u201d states the analysis.\n\nThe experts have collected evidence that links the malware to other Iranian threat actors, including the Iran Cyber Security Group and Flying Kitten (aka Rocket Kitten).\n\n\n\n\u201cOf particular note are wireless networks named Jok3r and mb_1986. Jok3r corresponds with a member of a defacement group, Iran Cyber Security Group, who continues to be fairly active in vandalizing sites. Iran Cyber Security Group also, as with many other defacement groups later identified as involved in state-aligned campaigns, purports to provide commercial security services and penetration testing training.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cThe \u201cmb_1986\u2033 wireless name is more interesting, as it provides a connection to earlier Iranian campaigns, overlapping with the Flying Kitten

Yahoo! In a 2016 report, disclosed that more than 1 billion accounts have been stolen. $400 billion was reportedly lost to cyber attacks across all industries this year. With this trend, the losses are set to top out at around $2.1 Trillion by 2019.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the top 4 incidences of bots that altered history in 2016.\n\n\n\nBrexit: Automated social media accounts produced by both sides of the debate created these bots to have a massive influence on the referendum vote; especially on those last-minute \u2018undecideds\u2019 Researchers from Oxford University have found that bots played a strategic role during the debate. The social media bots helped to circulate \u2018repetitive\u2019 political content to manipulate the thinking of the general public. Social media bots had a very simple role to play during Brexit, they had to tweet pro or anti Brexit tweets over and over again or just retweet /share messages of influencers on either side.  This helped them float the message they wanted for a much longer time, on the social media platforms than required.\n\nUS elections: As per Twitter Audit, Donald Trump\u2019s twitter account had almost 40% inactive, fake and spam followers, while Hillary Clinton had around 37%. The number roughly adds up to more than 7 million fake/inactive bot accounts that were circulating messages across the globe. These bot accounts helped in propagating messages for both the candidates involved and heavily influenced the undecided voter.\n\nUnder the scanner, Impact of Twitter, Facebook, and other social media might be not be considered a serious threat. But the bots spreading propaganda are usually encountered by journalists who use social media. Journalists, in-turn, interpret these bot propagated messages as a trend among people and report it. This increases the influence of such bad social media bots even more. It is crazy how bots can influence and change the course of history for 2 major nations last year, and it\u2019s just the beginning. German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s apprehensions on bots manipulating the upcoming German elections are not unfounded.\n\nGood chatbots went bad: When Microsoft launched Tay (AI Twitter chat bot) on March 23, 2016, it was the start of a new era. Tay was programmed to learn from its interactions with real users on twitter. Tay, however, ended up becoming a vulgar, racist bot within a few hours. The bot, however, was taken down by Microsoft within 16 hours. By and by, Tay tweeted 96,000 times before it went offline.\n\nAccording to a famous online ticket selling website, TicketMaster. In 2016, bots tried to buy 5 billion tickets, or 10,000 a minute, on their website. This resulted in 60% of the tickets getting scalped by bots.\n\nWith the surge in malicious bots, there is a need to stop them before they could harm your online businesses. Bots have been increasingly malicious and damaging for all online businesses.\n\nSo, have you thought about how your online business may be silently targeted by bad bots? How is your 2017 IT roadmap poised to address bot threats?\n\nAbout the Author Benjamin Raj Kumar\n\nDigital Marketing Specialist, ShieldSquare, LinkedIn | Twitter | ShieldSquare Website\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 bots, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bots", "topic_name": "bots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}]}, {"news_name": "Thousands of unpatched Magento shops hacked in the last two years", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55257/cyber-crime/magento-shops-hacked.html", "title": "Thousands of unpatched Magento shops hacked in the last two years\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 11, 2017", "body": "According to the Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security, more than 6,000 online stores running eBay\u2019s Magento platform have been hacked across the last two years.

The BSI is currently not aware of the extent of the payment data already passed through these attacks.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Office reported the attacks to the victim, but many of them failed in fixing the issue. The security expert Willem de Groot first reported carding attacks against unpatched Magento shops in October. The Dutch expert analyzed a cyber attack against the website belonging to the National Republican Senatorial Committee allowed people to make donations. According to de Groot, who analyzed the traffic on the platform, hackers roughly accessed data related to 3,500 transactions per month between March 16 and October 5, 2016.\n\nCard data was sent back to Russian IP addresses, the expert suspected that some 21,000 credit cards were stolen at the time.\n\nde Groot believes that the attacks against Magento shops at the time that had compromised some 6,000 sites spanning 18 months.The experts also published a free vulnerability scanning service that could be used by operators of Magento shops to check their websites.\n\nIt is not clear if there are the same threat actors behind the attacks against the unpatched Magento shops\n\n\n\nThe German Federal office now tried again to warn operators of Magento shops that were compromised by hackers.

Operators must fulfill their customer responsibilities and ensure their services are fixed quickly and consistently.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe BSI has at this point out that the obligation to secure systems not only for companies but also for all other businesslike operators of websites apply. This includes, for example, websites from private individuals or associations, if their operation is to generate revenues permanently. This is already assumed when banners placed on websites are placed in the form of banners.\u201d states the BSI. \u201cCustomers and operators of online -Shops based on Magento can use the free service MageReportcheck whether your shop system has known vulnerabilities and is affected by the current attacks.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Magento Shops, hacking)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ecommerce", "topic_name": "ecommerce"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/magento-shops", "topic_name": "Magento Shops"}]}, {"news_name": "ShadowBrokers offers for sale the stolen NSA Windows Hacking Tools", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55240/cyber-crime/shadowbrokers-windows-hacking.html", "title": "ShadowBrokers offers for sale the stolen NSA Windows Hacking Tools\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 11, 2017", "body": "The ShadowBrokers is the hacker crew that leaked a portion of the arsenal of the NSA-Linked Equation Group, a precious archive containing hacking tools and exploits.\n\nAt the end of October,  the hackers leaked a fresh dump containing a list of servers that were hacked by the NSA-linked group known as Equation Group.\n\nThe Equation group compromised these targets using the hacking tools codenamed as INTONATION and PITCHIMPAIR.

Also in this case, the tool is signed with an AI Squared certificate.\n\n\n\nIn December 2015, researchers at Symantec detailed the activities of two Iran-based hacker groups, dubbed Cadelle and Chafer, that used the backdoor.Cadelspy and backdoor.Remexi to spy on Iranian individuals and Middle Eastern organizations.\n\nThe IP address 83.142.230.138 mentioned in the Symantec report linked to the C&C infrastructure used by the Chafer group is the same used by the OilRig.\n\n\u201cBackdoor.Remexi, one of the malware in use by Chafer, had the following  command and control host:\n\n87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com\n\nInterestingly, IP address  83.142.230.138, which serve as a command and control address for an OilRig related sample (3a5fcba80c1fd685c4b5085d9d474118), was pointed to by 87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com as well.\u201d\n\nThis circumstance suggests that the Chafer and Oilrig are the same Iranian entity.\n\nFurther technical details and Indicators of Compromise are available in the ClearSky report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 OilRig Campaign, Helminth Backdoor)\n\nUPDATE\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "China-Linked DragonOK APT Group continues updating tools and tactics", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55113/apt/china-linked-dragonok.html", "title": "China-Linked DragonOK APT Group continues updating tools and tactics\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 7, 2017", "body": "It was September 2014, when security researchers at FireEye spotted for the first time the cyber espionage activities of a Chinese state-sponsored group dubbed DragonOK.\n\nAt the time, FireEye discovered two hacking campaigns conducted by distinct groups operating in separate regions of China that seem to work in parallel.\n\nThe first team of hackers named Moafee, targeted military and government organizations which were in some way involved in South China sea dispute. The attackers hit different organizations as explained by the researchers at FireEye in a blog post, and appears to operate from the Guangdong Province and hit entities working in the defense industry in the United States.\n\nThe second team, dubbed DragonOK, conducted corporate espionage operations on high-tech and manufacturing companies in Japan and Taiwan.\n\nDragonOK is back and recently targeted Japanese organizations in several industries, including manufacturing, technology, energy, higher education and semiconductor.\n\nWhile Japan is considered the main target of the APT, hackers also targeted individuals or organizations in Taiwan, Tibet, and Russia.\n\nAccording to the experts at Palo Alto Networks, one of the malware used by the DragonOK APT was dubbed Sysget and was used to target entities in Taiwan.\n\nThe Sysget malware was delivered both directly via phishing emails, as well as in RTF documents triggering the CVE-2015-1641 flaw that in turn leveraged a unique shellcode. The experts observed three distinct new versions of Sysget malware that were improved to make harder the detection and the analysis by security solutions.\n\nPaloAlto also observed DragonOK hackers using other two families malware, the IsSpace and TidePool.\n\n\n\n\u201cIsSpace\u201d is an evolution of the NFlog backdoor used by both DragonOK and Moafee. The second malware TidePool was observed earlier this year in targeted attacks powered by a different Chinese APT group, dubbed Operation Ke3chang.\n\nBack in 2013, the security researchers at FireEye spotted a group of China-Linked hackers that conducted an espionage campaign on foreign affairs ministries in Europe. The campaign was named \u2018Operation Ke3chang,\u2019 the same threat actors were spotted targeting personnel at Indian embassies across the world earlier this year.\n\nDragonOK now used the TidePool malware in targeted attacks against organizations in Russia and Tibet.\n\nThe analysis published by Palo Alto Networks researchers included links between the C&C domains of the various malware used by the DragonOK (i.e. TidePool, IsSpace and Sysget), and other Indicators of Compromise.\n\n\u201cThe DragonOK group are quite active and continue updating their tools and tactics. Their toolset is being actively developed to make detection and analysis more difficult. Additionally, they appear to be using additional malware toolsets such as TidePool.\u201d states Palo Alto Networks. \u201cWhile Japan is still the most-targeted region by this group, they look to be seeking out victims in other regions as well, such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Russia.\u201d \n\nEnjoy the report!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DragonOK, China)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/corporate-espionage", "topic_name": "corporate espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberespionage", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dragonok", "topic_name": "DragonOK"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/moafee", "topic_name": "Moafee"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sysget", "topic_name": "Sysget"}]}, {"news_name": "President Putin ordered cyber attacks and propaganda to influence US Election", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55130/reports/putin-cyber-attacks.html", "title": "President Putin ordered cyber attacks and propaganda to influence US Election\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 7, 2017", "body": "The US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has released an unclassified version of intel community\u2019s findings on activities conducted by the Russian Government in the attempt to influence the 2016 US Presidential Election through cyber attacks and online propaganda.\n\n\u201cWe assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.

In this way, the malware fills the machine with junk files, the URL is hardcoded in the source code of the malware.\n\nThe DDoS component analyzed by the researchers targets the official portal of Pakistan\u2019s Telecommunication Authority (http://www.pta.gov(.)pk/index.php) and downloads the content to a file in the %Temp% folder.\n\nThe FireCrypt ransomware is created with a malware builder dubbed BleedGreen and leverages a command-line application that automates the process of putting FireCrypt samples together. BleedGreen allows to rapidly customize the ransomware generating a unique executable with a custom name and a file icon chosen by the creator.\n\nAccording to the malware researchers the ransomware builder is very trivial.\n\n\u201cCompared to other ransomware builders, this is a very low-end application. Similar builders usually allow crooks to customize a wider set of options, such as the Bitcoin address where to receive payments, the ransom demand value, contact email address, and more.\u201d states a blog post published by Bleepingcomputer.com.\n\n\n\nThe builder is able to disguise the FireCrypt executable under a PDF or DOC icon, it is also able to make small changes to the binary to make harder the ransomware detection.\n\nThe infection process starts when a victim\u2019s launches the executable (EXE file) generated by the builder. The ransomware first kills the Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) process and starts encrypting user\u2019s files with AES-256 encryption.\n\nFiles encrypted by FireCrypt are easy to recognize because the malware appends the .firecrypt extension the file name.

This is the first time that the JAR attributes a malicious cyber activity to specific countries or threat actors.\n\n\u201cIn foreign countries, RIS actors conducted damaging and/or disruptive cyber-attacks, including attacks on critical infrastructure networks. In some cases, RIS actors masqueraded as third parties, hiding behind false online personas designed to cause the victim to misattribute the source of the attack. This JAR provides technical indicators related to many of these operations, recommended mitigations, suggested actions to take in response to the indicators provided, and information on how to report such incidents to the U.S. Government.\u201d States the report.\n\nDespite the vast majority of information reported in the JAR were known to the experts I invite you to focus on the first statement of the above excerpt, because according to the President Obama\u2019 executive order issued in April 2015, an attack against critical infrastructure can trigger an unpredictable cyber response of the US Government.\n\nThe JAR reports the activity of two different RIS actors, the APT28 and the APT29, that participated in the cyber attacks on a US political party. The APT29 known as (Cozy Bear, Office Monkeys, CozyCar, The Dukes and CozyDuke) broke into the party\u2019s systems in summer 2015. The APT28 known as (Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit and STRONTIUM) entered in spring 2016.\n\nBoth groups and their activities were well known to security firms and intelligence agencies due to their cyber espionage campaigns that targeted organizations and companies worldwide.\n\nThe nation-state actors conducted numerous attacks leveraging spear phishing messages containing web links to a malicious dropper, also APT28 group relied heavily on shortened URLs in their spearphishing email campaigns. These take advantage of neutral space for setting up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAPT29 has been observed crafting targeted spearphishing campaigns leveraging web links to a malicious dropper; once executed, the code delivers Remote Access Tools (RATs) and evades detection using a range of techniques. APT28 is known for leveraging domains that closely mimic those of targeted organizations and tricking potential victims into entering legitimate credentials\u201d reads the JAR. \u201cOnce APT28 and APT29 have access to victims, both groups exfiltrate and analyze information to gain intelligence value. These groups use this information to craft highly targeted spearphishing campaigns. These actors set up operational infrastructure to obfuscate their source infrastructure, host domains and malware for targeting organizations, establish command and control nodes, and harvest credentials and other valuable information from their targets,\u201d\n\nGovernment experts explained both groups used multiple malware in their campaigns, including the XTunnel malware, the Fysbis backdoor, the Komplex Trojan, the Carberp malware.\n\nExperts observed two waves of attacks against US targets starting in the summer of 2015 and in November 2016.\n\nAccording to the FBI-DHS JAR report, nation-state hackers designated as Grizzly Steppe targeted more than US recipients in  April 2015 as part of a spear phishing campaign.\n\n\u201cIn summer 2015, an APT29 spearphishing campaign directed emails containing a malicious link to over 1,000 recipients, including multiple U.S. Government victims. APT29 used legitimate domains, to include domains associated with U.S. organizations and educational institutions, to host malware and send spearphishing emails.\u201d Continues the report.\n\nIn Spring 2016, hackers belonging to the APT28 hacker group, targeted the same political party via spear phishing email aimed to trick victims into changing their email credetianls. The hackers used a fake webmail domain hosted on operational infrastructure used by the APT28. Then APT28 used the stolen credentials to gain access target systems and exfiltrate sensitive information. The APT28 breached U.S. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).\n\n\u201cIn the spring of 2016, attackers were again successful when they tricked a spear phishing recipient to change their password through a fake web domain controlled by the attackers. \u201cUsing the harvested credentials, APT28 was able to gain access and steal content, likely leading to the exfiltration of information from multiple senior party members.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe JAR report confirmed information stolen by hackers was released to the press and publicly disclosed in the attempt to interfere with Presidential Election. The report does not explicitly refers the DNC, but almost any security firm that analyzed the attack confirmed that the DNC was the primary target of the Russian hackers.\n\n\n\n\u201cActors likely associated with RIS are continuing to engage in spearphishing campaigns, including one launched as recently as November 2016, just days after the U.S. election\u201d\n\nThe JAR report also include a Recommended Mitigations section with best practices and mitigation strategies to improve cyber security posture of organizations.\n\n\u201cDHS encourages network administrators to implement the recommendations below, which can prevent as many as 85 percent of targeted cyber-attacks. \u201d states the report.\n\nAbout the Authors:\n\n Pierluigi Paganini and @GranetMan\n\nGranet is a young and Junior IT Security Researcher, he is passionate in Linux, Arduino, Digital Forensics, Cyber Security, Free software and Malware Analysis\n\n \n\n \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 APT28, APT29, JAR Report)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt28", "topic_name": "APT28"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt29", "topic_name": "APT29"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/grizzly-steppe", "topic_name": "GRIZZLY STEPPE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/presidential-election", "topic_name": "presidential election"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ris", "topic_name": "RIS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-civilian-and-military-intelligence-services", "topic_name": "Russian civilian and military intelligence Services"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "The OSCE organization was victim of a major cyber attack", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54860/intelligence/osce-cyber-attack.html", "title": "The OSCE organization was victim of a major cyber attack\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 29, 2016", "body": "Hackers targeted the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the news was confirmed on Wednesday by a spokeswoman for the organization.\n\nThe OSCE is a security and human rights watchdog, clearly the attack is part of a cyber espionage operation, unfortunately, the organization confirmed that it did not have the capability to investigate the incident.\n\n\n\nAccording to the French newspaper Le Monde, Russian hackers are responsible for the attack.\n\n\u201cThere was an attack.

The APK contains a number of Russian language artifacts that were military in nature.  Hackers used an implant for a legitimate app, but there is no evidence the application was made available in the Android app store.\n\n\u201cFrom late 2014 and through 2016, FANCY BEAR X-Agent implant was covertly distributed on Ukrainian military forums within a legitimate Android application developed by Ukrainian artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk.\u201d states the report published by Crowdstrike. \u201cThe original application enabled artillery forces to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces reducing targeting time from minutes to under 15 seconds. According to Sherstuk\u2019s interviews with the press, over 9000 artillery personnel have been using the application in Ukrainian military.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cInitial research identified that the filename suggested a relationship to the D-30 122mm towed howitzer, an artillery weapon first manufactured in the Soviet Union in the 1960s but still in use today.\u201d states the report.\n\nIf the analysis published by the experts it correct, it means that the Kremlin military strategy made a large use of hacking campaigns to influence internal affairs of foreign governments and to support military operations.\n\nExperts believe the Fancy Bear hacker group operates on behalf of the Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, GRU. According to the US intelligence, the group was responsible for hacks during the 2016 Presidential Election, its hacking operations aimed to support Donald Trump.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied hacking accusations.\n\nThe malicious code developed by Fancy Bear to track Ukrainian artillery units has many similarities with the one used in the hack of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIs the malicious implant effective?\n\nAccording to open source data cited in the report, Ukrainian artillery forces have lost over 50% of their weapons in the 2 years of conflict and over 80% of D-30 howitzers. This represents the highest percentage of loss of any other Ukrainian artillery units.\n\nOne aspect very interesting of the story is the implant, an unseen variant of the X-Agent. The use of a malware with its characteristic demonstrates \u201cFANCY BEAR\u2019s expansion in mobile malware development from iOS-capable implants to Android devices\u201d\n\nFurther details are available on the CrowdStrike report.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Fancy Bear, Ukrainian artillery units)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cozy-bear", "topic_name": "COZY BEAR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fancy-bear", "topic_name": "FANCY BEAR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russian-hackers", "topic_name": "Russian hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sofacy-group", "topic_name": "Sofacy Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsor-hackers", "topic_name": "state-sponsor hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukraine", "topic_name": "Ukraine"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ukrainian-artillery-units", "topic_name": "Ukrainian artillery units"}]}, {"news_name": "PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM APTs used same Zero-Day to Target Turkish citizens", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54451/apt/promethium-neodymium-apts.html", "title": "PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM APTs used same Zero-Day to Target Turkish citizens\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 16, 2016", "body": "Security researchers have discovered two distinct APT groups, PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM, that exploited the same Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2016-4117) in cyber espionage campaigns on Turkish citizens living in Turkey and various other European countries. Both groups exploited the flaw before its public disclosure and against the same type of targets.\n\nWe have already read about the activities of the PROMETHIUM APT group in a report published by Kaspersky Lab that named it StrongPity. In October, Kaspersky published a report on cyber espionage activities conducted by StrongPity APT that most targeted Italians and Belgians with watering holes attacks.\n\nThe experts noticed many similarities in the operation of both groups, a circumstance that suggests a possible link between them. The ATP groups used different infrastructure and malware, but there are some similarities that indicate a possible connection at a higher organizational level.\n\nThe flaw was patched by Adobe on May 12, but according to the experts from the firm Recorded Future published a report on the most common vulnerabilities used by threat actors in the exploit kits.\n\nThe PROMETHIUM APT has been active since at least 2012, the hackers used instant messaging applications as the attack vector and shared malicious links that pointed to documents to exploit the CVE-2016-4117 vulnerabilities. Microsoft observed that the attacker used a specific strain of malware dubbed Truvasys that was designed to compromise target devices with Turkish locale settings.\n\n\u201cThe attack itself began with certain individuals receiving links in instant messenger clients. These links led to malicious documents that invoked exploit code and eventually executed a piece of malware called Truvasys on unsuspecting victims\u2019 computers\u201d states the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report.\n\nThe PROMETHIUM APT also used another malware dubbed Myntor in targeted attacks.\n\nThe NEODYMIUM also exploited the CVE-2016-4117 flaw in targeted attacks in May via spear-phishing messages. This second APT leveraged a backdoor, dubbed Wingbird, that shows many similarities with surveillance software FinFisher.\n\n\u201cNEODYMIUM used a backdoor detected by Windows Defender as Wingbird, whose characteristics closely match FinFisher, a government-grade commercial surveillance package. Data about Wingbird activity indicates that it is typically used to attack individuals and individual computers instead of networks\u201d continues the Report.\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of the NEODYMIUM victims was located in Turkey (80%), but several infections were also detected in the U.S., Germany and the U.K.\n\nLet me suggest reading the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report to have more details on PROMETHIUM and NEODYMIUM, including indicators of compromise (IoC).\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NEODYMIUM APT, PROMETHIUM APT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apt", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/neodymium", "topic_name": "NEODYMIUM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/promethium", "topic_name": "PROMETHIUM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/strongpity", "topic_name": "StrongPity"}]}, {"news_name": "BlackEnergy hackers, now TeleBots, target Ukrainian banks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54415/cyber-warfare-2/telebots.html", "title": "BlackEnergy hackers, now TeleBots, target Ukrainian banks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 15, 2016", "body": "The BlackEnergy hacker group that targeted the Ukrainian grid one year ago causing a power outage in the country are now targeting Ukrainian banks. The Ukrainian government accused Russia of being involved in the attack, but further analysis revealed that the BlackEnergy malware was not directly responsible for the outages.\n\nAccording to the experts at the ESET firm, the gang is exploiting the TeleBots malware against banks in Ukraine. The malicious code shares a number of similarities with the malware used by the BlackEnergy group. ESET speculates that the BlackEnergy group crew has evolved across the time into the threat actors called TeleBots group.\n\n\u201cIn the second half of 2016, ESET researchers identified a unique malicious toolset that was used in targeted cyberattacks against high-value targets in the Ukrainian financial sector. We believe that the main goal of attackers using these tools is cybersabotage.

However it\u2019s important to say that these attackers, and the toolset used, share a number of similarities with the BlackEnergy group, which conducted attacks against the energy industry in Ukraine in December 2015 and January 2016. In fact, we think that the BlackEnergy group has evolved into the TeleBots group.\u201d\n\nThe hackers are leveraging on spear phishing message with Microsoft Excel documents containing malicious macros.\n\nOnce a victim clicks on the Enable Content button, the macro in TeleBots documents drops a malicious binary using the explorer.exe filename and then to execute it.

The campaign was named \u2018Operation Ke3chang,\u2019 now threat actors behind the attacks were spotted targeting personnel at Indian embassies across the world.\n\nThe researchers speculate the threat actors behind the Operation Ke3chang had been active since at least 2010, and the bad news is that they are still active. The attackers evolved their arsenal over the time, initially, they had been using three different strains of malware codenamed by BS2005, BMW, and MyWeb.\n\n\n\nRecently security experts at Palo Alto Networks detected a new piece of malware, dubbed \u2018TidePool,\u2019  that seems to be linked to the group\u2019s activity in the ongoing attacks against the Indian embassies.\n\nThe hackers launched spear phishing attacks leveraging on an annual report filed by more than 30 Indian embassies as a decoy. The attackers used spoofed email addressed to send out the malicious email.\n\nThe phishing attacks relied on email with attached an MHTML document that was specifically crafted to trigger the Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2015-2545) and drop the TidePool malware.\n\nThe malware implements RAT features and presents many similarities with the BS2005, but it appears to be its evolution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve discovered a new malware family we\u2019ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide.\u201d reads a report published by Palo Alto Networks. \u201cTidePool contains many capabilities common to most RATs. It allows the attacker to read, write and delete files and folders, and run commands over named pipes\u201d\n\nThe experts from the Unit 42 noticed that the TidePool and BS2005 malware share 11 similar registry modifications, they implement the same C2 obfuscation and use the same set of library functions.\n\n\u201cThese samples are quite similar when looking at the library functions used, but the most notable features they have in common are the timeline of behaviors executed. Ke3chang and TidePool both modify the IEHarden registry key, as well as the following list of keys. \u201d continues the report.\n\nThe experts noticed that the binaries included resources, encoding was 0x04 (LANG_CHINESE) indicating the systems used by the attackers are likely running a software with Chinese as the default display language.\n\nIndia is the country with the largest number of infections, a circumstance that highlights the country is a high priority target for the attackers.\n\nThe experts closed the report confirming that the Operation Ke3chang is still ongoing and the malware factory is producing new evolving threats.\n\n\u201cDespite going unreported on since 2013, Operation Ke3chang has not ceased operations and in fact continued developing its malware,\u201d concluded the post.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

However, the use of zero-days, multi-platform malware as well as other techniques makes us believe it\u2019s a powerful entity engaged in espionage, possibly for economic reasons,\u201d said Kaspersky\n\nThe Morpho team exploited a Flash Player zero-day in its attacks and digitally signed its malicious code by using stolen Acer Incorporated digital certificates.\n\nThe hackers were able to remain undetected within the targeted infrastructure for nearly a year.\n\nThe criminal crew also targeted Bitcoin companies, law firms, real estate and investment companies, individual users, and numerous firm in the IT and healthcare industries.\n\nKaspersky reported that the Morpho group infected organizations with its Wild Neutron backdoor in 11 countries, including France, Russia, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Palestine, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, UAE, Algeria and the United States.\n\n\u201cA powerful threat actor known as \u201cWild Neutron\u201d (also known as \u201cJripbot\u201d and \u201cMorpho\u201c) has been active since at least 2011, infecting high profile companies for several years by using a combination of exploits, watering holes and multi-platform malware.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Symantec the Morpho group infected systems in a larger number of countries, they have discovered a total of 49 victims spread across 20 countries since March 2012.\n\n\u201cMorpho is a group of highly capable, professional attackers who perform corporate espionage with a laser-like focus on operational security.

Analyzing the logs from the command servers security the experts have found 59 unique victims in 23 countries.\n\nCosmicDuke: In April 2014, experts at F-Secure, while investigating on MiniDuke malicious code discovered a link to a new strain of malware, dubbed CosmicDuke, belonging to Cosmu family. The malware family discovered was using the same loader as MiniDuke stage 3.\n\n\n\nOnionDuke: In November 2014, experts Josh Pitts of Leviathan Security Group identified a Russian Tor exit node that was patching the binaries downloaded by the users with malware. Experts at F-Secure discovered a link between the crew operating the rogue Tor node that was used to spread the OnionDuke malware and the MiniDuke APT. The malware was any way different from the ones used in the past by the threat actor behind the MiniDuke crew. The OnionDuke has been used in attacks against government agencies and mass infection campaigns against Tor and torrent users.\n\nThe researchers at F-Secure have analyzed malicious documents uploaded to the Free Online Virus, Malware and URL Scanner service VirusTotal, and have discovered that at least one the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Europe has been the victim of a targeted attack. The documents used for the cyber espionage campaign against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Europe reference the EU sanctions against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine, the attackers used social engineering tactics to trick users into enabling macros, a necessary step to allow the CosmicDuke infection.\n\n\n\nThis sample of CosmicDuke analyzed by the experts was specifically designed to install MiniDuke malware on infected systems.\n\n\u201cIn our analysis released in July we mentioned that CosmicDuke seems to be connected to MiniDuke because both malware families use the same loader which has been exclusively used by the MiniDuke group. The CosmicDuke samples that infect the system with MiniDuke give us further evidence that the same actor is behind both malware families.\u201d reports F-Secure in a Blog post.\n\nInitially CosmicDuke was initially linked to MiniDuke because the researchers discovered that the two malicious code was using the same loader, the new discovery confirms the suspect.\n\n\u201cCosmicDuke and MiniDuke complement each other. CosmicDuke is an infostealer \u2013 ideal for reconnaissance and data exfiltration. MiniDuke is a backdoor \u2013 it gives the attacker full control of the computer,\u201d Timo Hirvonen, senior researcher at F-Secure explained to SecurityWeek.\n\nThe experts highlighted that CosmicDuke has been observed in operations targeting government entities, high-profile organizations, and users involved in the trafficking of controlled and illegal substances.\n\nThe researchers at F-Secure revealed that in APT campaigns, the attackers used a dedicates infrastructure for OnionDuke that\u2019s shared with MiniDuke. In these cases, the threat actors used a full version of the malware. The experts also noticed that in the mass infection campaigns, the C&C infrastructure was relying on compromised servers and free hosting services, and in these cases, the attackers have used a lighter version of OnionDuke.\n\nWho is behind the cyber espionage campaigns?\n\nThe experts speculated that CosmicDuke, MiniDuke and OnionDuke are the products of Russian state-sponsored hackers because the campaigns targeted governments with an interest in Russian affairs. The fact that CosmicDuke operations targeted users of illegal substances may also indicate the involvement of law enforcement agencies of the Russian Government.\n\nStay Tuned.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  MiniDuke, CosmicDuke , OnionDuke)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cosmicduke", "topic_name": "CosmicDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/f-secure", "topic_name": "F-Secure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/miniduke", "topic_name": "MiniDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/onionduke", "topic_name": "OnionDuke"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}]}, {"news_name": "Iranian hackers behind most elaborate spying campaign on social media", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/25355/hacking/iranian-hackers-social-media.html", "title": "Iranian hackers behind most elaborate spying campaign on social media\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 30, 2014", "body": "Iranian Hackers use a network of fake accounts (NEWSCASTER network) on principal social media to spy on US officials and political staff worldwide, this is reported in an analysis done by iSIGHT Partners.\n\nA few days ago company FireEye published a report titled \u201cOperation Saffron Rose\u201d to document the activities of the Iranian hacking group named Ajax Security Team. a group of hackers specialized in cyber espionage.
