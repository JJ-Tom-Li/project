Swisscom also plans to institute two-factor authentication in 2018 for any data required by sales partners.\n\nSwisscom explains in its release that\u00a0 third-party partners need access to certain customer data \u201cto enable them to identify and advise customers and conclude or amend contracts with them,\u201d adding that system access for such information is \u201cprotected by specific user logins and passwords.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Swisscom breach demonstrates clearly that companies must pay close attention to the cybersecurity controls of any organization that they interact with or are affiliated with.

However, he assured lawmakers that the extortion payment was a highly atypical transaction for the bug bounty program, which normally rewards only\u00a0white-hat researchers who ethically and responsibly discover vulnerabilities in Uber's systems and software.\n\n\"First, I would like to echo statements made by new leadership, and state publicly that it was wrong not to disclose the breach earlier,\" stated Flynn in written testimony submitted to the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security -- a branch of the\u00a0U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. \"The breach should have been disclosed in a timely manner. The company is taking steps to ensure that an incident like this does not happen again, with personnel changes and additional remedial actions.\"\n\nCurrent Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\u00a0revealed the 2016 breach incident\u00a0on Nov. 22, 2017, roughly three months after taking over the chief executive role from Travis Kalanick, who was ousted following a series of corporate scandals.\n\nIn separate, oral testimony, Flynn said that Uber ultimately capitulated to the intruders' financial demands in order to protect its consumers' data. (In turn, the attackers agreed to delete the stolen information.) \"However, this was not done consistent with the way our bug bounty program normally operates,\" he remarked.\n\n\"We recognize that the bug bounty program is not an appropriate vehicle for dealing with intruders who seek to extort funds from the company,\" he also stated in written testimony.\n\nFlynn testified alongside several other panelists at a subcommittee hearing that addressed the advent of bug bounty programs. Opening the hearing, subcommittee chairman Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) expressed measured concern that bug bounty programs that lack strong policies could be abused as extortion payout mechanisms.\n\nHowever, he noted that these concerns \"should not completely outweigh the overall utility of this innovative crowd-sourced approach that many industry actors have taken to proactively identify chinks in their technological armor to effectively administrator bug bounty programs in other cyber vulnerability disclosure efforts.\"\n\nMoran's comments reflected a recurring theme during the hearing, in which experts and lawmakers alike attempted to distinguish the differences between legitimate bug bounty payouts and blackmail.\n\n\"It's the difference between a security consultant who says about your home: 'You have this vulnerability to force entry' and the criminal who says, 'You have this vulnerability to force entry, and I have your child. Pay me $100,000,\" said subcommittee ranking member Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) \"That's ransom; it's a crime.\"\n\nLuta Security CEO Katie Moussouris, who spearheaded the creation of bug bounty programs at Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Defense, testified at the hearing that large extortion payments damage the security industry by muddying the bug-hunting profession, eroding corporate and government trust in legitimate ethical hackers, and influencing more researchers to focus their talents on bug hunting when help is so desperately needed in secure code development.\n\n\"I want to point out that the ecosystem for rewarding bug hunting is skewing the markets toward more bug hunters, but not necessarily more bug fixers. This imbalance that is being created in these markets may very well shift the ecosystem towards rewarding more data theft than bug hunting,\" said Moussouris in written testimony. \"Already, we are facing a global shortage of talent in cybersecurity, and while more legal ways to report bugs is good, the creation of an overall defense workforce is necessary, in the United States and worldwide.\"\n\nMoussouris strongly recommended that companies with bounty programs place a hard ceiling on their rewards and refuse to negotiate payouts. And based on his own company's mistakes, Flynn recommended that all companies have set policies in place in the event of an extortion demand involving sensitive data.\n\nJustin Brookman, director of privacy and technology policy at the Consumers Union,\u00a0stated in written testimony that because bug bounties are a relatively new development, \"expectations, norms, and best practices are still developing in this area.\" Therefore, he continued, Acompanies may want to reconsider the circumstances before reporting an incident to authorities, as it may scare off legit researchers from finding other bugs.\n\nDespite widespread agreement that the actions on the part of the Uber hackers were malicious,\u00a0Brookman had a more ambiguous take on the matter: \"At some point, a request for more money may convey an implicit -- or explicit -- threat to sell the exploit or compromised data elsewhere if the demands are not met,\" wrote Brookman in his testimony. \"However, from the publicly reported facts, it is not clear that that happened in this case. In any event, Uber had invited persons... to look for precisely the type of vulnerabilities that [the attackers] found.\"\n\nNevertheless, Brookman agreed that Uber had an obligation to disclose its breach sooner -- a sentiment that was commonly expressed at the hearing.\n\nAsked point blank by Moran what Uber's justification was for waiting so long to notify victims of the hack, Flynn responded: \"Senator, there's no justification for that. We should have notified our customers at the time when this did occur, and it was a mistake not to do so,\" adding that a key issue was that \"we didn't have the right people in the room making that evaluation and making the right decision and making right by our customers.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Flynn noted that Uber has also taken additional steps to prevent a similar breach in the future, including instituting multifactor authentication protocols, enhancing third-party cloud data storage security, improving authentication and authorization when users attempt access a third-party database, and using auto-expiring credentials.\n\nIn his own testimony, HackerOne CEO Marten Mickos defended the bug bounty industry, asserting that an \"Internet that enables privacy and protects consumers\" is not achievable \"without ethical hackers taking an active role in safeguarding our collective security and, that in turn requires a safe legal environment encouraging all individuals to come forward with vulnerability information, no matter the circumstances.\"\n\nAccording to Flynn, Uber's bug bounty program through HackerOne has resolved more than 800 vulnerabilities and paid out roughly $1.3 million since it commenced in 2016. \"It has achieved very significant improvements for a relatively modest expenditure, including addressing a bug in the SSH authentication system and a remote code execution bug in one of our websites,\" he said.\n\n\"Today's hearing spotlights the ethical considerations around how Uber responded to its recent breach. This was not a bug bounty payout. This was extortion, and the difference between the two is unambiguous. Extortion happens when a company is approached by an attacker that has gained valuable information and demands payment to keep the discovery quiet. Extortion is initiated by the attacker, and the attacker holds the power. Bug bounty programs operate in a controlled environment with secure communication on all ends to facilitate interactions between businesses and the researcher community for safe and effective security testing. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat's more, this hearing calls attention to a much bigger issue about the perception of the hacker community. Years ago, hackers were viewed strictly in a negative light. Over the past five or so years, the industry has progressed in understanding of the white-hat \u201cdigital locksmiths\u201d who are here to help, and foster a productive and healthy relationship between the hackers and organizations. \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Massachusetts attorney general adds online data breach report portal", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/massachusetts-attorney-general-adds-online-data-breach-report-portal/article/742269/", "title": "Massachusetts attorney general adds online data breach report portal", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "February 06, 2018", "body": "Massachusetts is trying to make it easier for businesses and organizations to report a data breach by setting up an online portal.\n\nThe Data Breach Reporting Online Portal is available through the state attorney general's website and is intended to replace the written notifications that those hit with a data breach must file with the state under the Massachusetts Data Breach Notification Law, said Attorney General Maura Healey.

legislation introduced by two Democratic U.S. senators aims to impose stiff, mandatory penalties on credit reporting agencies (CRAs) like that fail to protect consumers' sensitive information from data breaches.\n\nHad such a law been in place when Equifax acknowledged a massive 2017 breach impacting more than 145 million Americans, the agency would have been required to pay at least $1.5 billion in penalties, half of which would have gone toward compensating victims, according to a Jan. 10 press release issued by the bill's creators, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Mark Warner (D-Virg.).\n\nUnder the terms of the senators' Data Breach Prevention and Compensation Act,\u00a0the Federal Trade Commission would create an Office of Cybersecurity, responsible for\u00a0promulgating CRA data security regulations, and\u00a0conducting annual inspections and oversight of these agencies.\n\nThe legislation further dictates that breached CRAs must shell out $100 for each consumer who has one piece of personally identifying information compromised, and an additional $50 for every additional piece of PII per consumer \u2013 with a maximum payout set at 50 percent of the agency's gross revenue from the previous year.\u00a0\n\nHowever, in cases where a CRA fails to meet FTC data security standards or doesn't notify the FTC of a breach within 10 days, the penalties would double and the maximum payout would increase to 75 percent of the prior year's gross revenue.\n\nThis financial penalty would be distributed to the FTC, which would allocate 50 percent of the funds toward restitution of aggrieved consumers, and the remaining 50 percent toward\u00a0cybersecurity research and inspections.\n\n\u201cEquifax allowed personal data on more than half the adults in the country to get stolen, and its legal liability is so limited that it may end up making money off the breach,\u201d said Warren in the press release. \u201cOur bill imposes massive and mandatory penalties for data breaches at companies like Equifax, and provides robust compensation for affected consumers which will put money back into peoples' pockets and help stop these kinds of breaches from happening again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill will ensure that companies like Equifax \u2013 which gather vast amounts of information on American consumers, often without their knowledge \u2013 are taking appropriate steps to secure data that's central to Americans' identity management and access to credit,\u201d added Warner, in the release.\n\nThe legislation has already garnered the endorsement of officials at multiple consumer advocacy bodies, including the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and the Consumer Federation of America.\n\n\u201cThis bill establishes much-needed protections for data security for the credit bureaus,\u201d said\u00a0National Consumer Law Center staff attorney Chi Chi Wu, in the senators' press release. \u201cIt also imposes real and meaningful penalties when credit bureaus, entrusted with our most sensitive financial information, break that trust.\u201d\n\nIn September 2017, Warren co-introduced another bill, the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation (FREE) Act, which would give consumers more control over their credit and personal data and help prevent future incidents, as well as put strictures in place to keep credit monitoring companies from profiting off breaches in part by preventing them from selling information during a credit freeze.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

It also requires that affected companies report any such incident to\u00a0the public and the AG's office within 15 days.\n\nAdditionally, the bill also requires businesses that own or license consumers' personal information to execute reasonable security procedures and practices to protect said data, including medical records and insurance account numbers.\n\nIf a company fails to uphold its responsibilities, it will be considered a violation of the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

India started collecting the information into a centralized government database called Aadhaar to create a voluntary identity system in 2010.\n\nThe publication was also able to purchase software\u201d that could enable a user to print Aadhaar cards after entering the Aadhaar number of any individual.\n\nLast November UIDAI, the\u00a0Unique Identification Authority of India, asserted the database is safe and secure and that no leak or breach had occurred. When the Tribune contacted the government agency about the breach, officials expressed shock and admitted it seemed to be a major national security breach before consulting UIDAI technical consultants.\n\nThe Tribune estimates that a racket may have started around six months ago when anonymous groups were created on WhatsApp to target more than 300,000 village-level enterprise (VLE) operators hired by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (ME&IT) under the Common Service Centres Scheme (CSCS) across India. The operators would have had access to the UIDAI data and any compromised operators would have provided a potential entry point for the breach.\n\nMore than 100,000 village-level enterprise operators are suspected to have gained illegal access to UIDAI data to provide \u201cAadhaar services\u201d to common people for a charge, including the printing of Aadhaar cards, the publication said.\n\nThe database was also vulnerable as anyone can access or become admins of the official Aadhaar database\u00a0as long as they are invited by someone who is already an admin, according to The Quint.\n\nThe Tribune's report was dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d by India's Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party. UIDAI denied the Tribune report and told BuzzFeed \u201cAadhaar data including biometric information is fully safe and secure.\u201d\n\nThe incident has since sparked a police probe into the incident. Even if the database wasn't breached, researchers advise against aggregated databases such as Aadhaar as they pose a risk to the privacy of citizens.\n\n\"Regardless of whether the Indian Government is correct and no biometric information was included in the database accessed by The Tribune of India, the opportunity for fraud stemming from this incident is immense,\u201d Netskope Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Beri told SC Media. \u201cSure, criminals may not be able to create exact duplicates of an individual's Aadhaar ID card, but they still have all the data necessary to conduct highly targeted phishing attacks and other identity fraud.\u201d\n\nEven if hackers only have access to the databases non-biometric information could easily imitate the agency in order to convince unsuspecting citizens to turn over additional data like their banking information, Beri added.

The unprotected data recorded by these devices were then subsequently stored on devices designed to log payment transaction authorizations. Unfortunately, the attackers had gained unauthorized access to the retailer's network, allowing them to infect some of these devices with malware capable of reading payment card magstripe track data, including card numbers, expiration dates, internal verification codes, and occasionally even cardholders' names.\n\n\u201cSo if encryption was off on a POS device prior to April 3, 2017 and that data was still present in the log file at one of these stores, the malware could have found that data,\u201d Forever 21 stated in its disclosure. \u201cIn some stores, this scenario occurred for only a few days or several\u00a0weeks, and in some stores this scenario occurred for most or all of the timeframe,\u201d the retailer warned.\n\nIn most cases, only one or a few POS devices in an affected location were infected, the company added.\n\nForever 21 also said that it is actively collaborating with its payment processors, its POS device provider, and third-party experts \u201cto address the operation of encryption on the POS devices in all Forever 21 stores,\u201d and that it is striving to enhance its security measures.

(All other impacted individuals will receive 12 months of free monitoring.)\n\nJustin Higgs, a senior manager of corporate communications at PayPal, later clarified to SC Media via email that \u201cpotential information that was compromised includes data such as payment card information or bank account information, usernames and passwords for online accounts, and Social Security.\u201d Higgs also stressed that PayPal has \u201cnot found actual proof of data being taken from the TIO network.\u201d However, the company \u201cfound enough evidence of potential exposure to treat this incident as a data breach\u201d and alert the authorities and relevant parties.\n\nThe company says it is actively working to directly notify all potentially affected individuals and their billers, retailers and agents. PayPal also has emphasized that its own corporate systems were not impacted by the breach situation and that its customers' data remains secure.\n\nPayPal Holdings\u00a0on Friday acknowledged that a data breach at recently acquired payments processor TIO Networks compromised the data of roughly 1.6 million customers.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}]}, {"news_name": "Stanford University server exposes data of 10,000 staffers", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/stanford-servers-on-three-separate-occasions-exposed-student-and-staff-data/article/711336/", "title": "Stanford University server exposes data of 10,000 staffers ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "December 01, 2017", "body": "The University of Stanford announced that it has left sensitive student and staff data exposed on three separate occasions over the last year. \u00a0\n\nA misconfigured Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) server exposed the data of 10,000 non-teaching staff employed throughout the university exposing names, birthdays, salaries and Social Security numbers.\n\nThe mishap exposed data spanning between 2008 and 2015 to the business school's community for about six months before being locked and secured March 3, 2017 after they were spotted by campus privacy investigators, according to Poets & Quants who first reported on the incident Dec. 1. \n\nThe university told the publication the files were accidently made available on a shared server starting in June 2016 and that other files on the same server were accessible starting September 2016. The business school's IT team was made aware of the breach in February 2017 but reportedly failed to report the problem to the Stanford GSB Dean Jon Levin.\n\n\u201cAt that time, the GSB IT team recognized there was a permission problem and promptly secured all of the files on the drive,\u201d university spokesperson Lisa Lapin said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cBut they failed to understand the scope of the exposure and did not report it to the GSB dean or relevant university offices for further investigation.\u201d\n\nSeparately The Stanford Daily found another university file sharing platform, AFS\u00a0(Andrew File Sharing)\u00a0exposed information from several campus offices including Clery Act reports of sexual violence and confidential student disciplinary information from six to 10 years ago. The exposure was spotted on Nov. 9\u00a0and most of the files were from between 2005 and 2012 and were managed by six different campus offices. \n\nEarlier this year, the GSB reported a data exposure that revealed confidential financial aid files on a shared server maintained by the GSB that were accidentally made available to the GSB community starting in June 2016 while other files on the same server were accessible starting in September 2016. All files were also secured by March. \n\nThe Information Security office has contacted file-sharing owners throughout the university to request that campus units urgently review all file-sharing permissions and those whose personal information was exposed are being notified and offered Credit monitoring and fraud protection services.\n\nDespite the university's actions privacy advocates are criticizing the three misconfigurations spotted within a relatively short amount to time. \n\nInfinite Global President Zach Olsen said these events happen every day at institutions and organizations around the world and the only way to reduce the chance of repeating these organizations shortcomings is to take steps to prevent unforced errors like the one at Stanford.

In a public statement the company said there is a chance the person or group that perpetrated the incident will release some confidential data in the near future. This has led to the belief that the company has refused to pay a ransom in order to hush up the breach.\n\n\u201cThe description of the means by which a hacker or group of hackers gained access to Clarksons' systems makes me think that the attack may not have exploited a software vulnerability, but rather that a legitimate account holder had their login credentials compromised,\u201d Graham Cluley wrote for ESET.\n\nThe massive breach Uber suffered earlier this month was also traced back to a pilfered set of login credentials used by Uber software engineers that were then used to access an infrastructure account that handled computing tasks for the company.\n\n\u201cIf I were getting a startup off the ground, I would go passwordless without a second thought. However, it is a difficult endeavor for many organizations, as many have spent decades building up enormous databases of credentials.

For example, a system recognizes the user based on factors such as behavior patterns, typing speed, and websites typically visited. We are breaking ground on these technologies now, and they will soon be commonplace,\u201d AlertSec CEO Ebba Blitz suggested.\n\nCorey Williams, Centrify's senior director of products and marketing, told SC Media that while the fact that Uber attempted to cover up the breach by making a payout to the attackers, the true heart of the story is the attack was preventable.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, companies continue to rely on a system of trust. Trust that a simple username and password is enough to know who is accessing their network and systems. Trust that perimeter security has eliminated all of the bad actors within the network. A simple password is simply not enough. The time has come to no longer trust in too-easily stolen passwords for ensuring that users are who they say they are,\u201d he said.\n\nJim Libersky, owner of The Barrier Group and Barrier 1, told SC Media that a layered approach is always needed to protect cyber assets in case the attacker is able to make an initial entry.\n\n\"The key to cyber protection requires checks and balances in the process. In the case of password cracking, someone didn't just type in the correct password out of the blue. They were scanning and trying different combinations. That is unless it was an inside job or they had inside help. If they do get past that there should be other behavioral activity that would show up and thus caught. That can be testing various protocols.

Khosrowshahi revealed the breach incident on Nov. 22, roughly three months after taking over the chief executive role from Travis Kalanick, who was ousted following a series of corporate scandals. Although the company withheld news of the breach for a full year, Krosrowshahi claims he only recently learned of the attack.\n\nOne of the letters to Krosrowshahi was sent on Monday by four Republican senators who chair a committee or subcommittee relevant to the investigation: John Thune (R-S.D., Committee on Commerce, Science, And Transportation), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah, Committee on Finance), Jerry Moran (R-Kan., Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security), and Bill Cassidy (R-La., Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy).\n\nCollectively, the four GOP senators posed 11 questions about the breach and Uber's subsequent response, imposing a deadline of Dec. 11 for a response. \u201c\u2026The nature of the information currently acknowledged to have been compromised, together with the allegation that the company concealed the breach without notifying affected drivers and consumers, and prior privacy concerns at Uber, makes this a serious incident that merits further security,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe letter suggests that Uber's attempts to cover up the incident run contrary to data security and incident response measures that the company detailed in a January 2015 corporate report, following an assessment conducted by outside counsel. The report had stated that Uber \u201chas put in place and continues to develop a data security program that is reasonable designed to protect Consumer Data from unauthorized access, use disclosure, or loss.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more seriously, the GOP letter also said Uber's actions may have violated an August 15, 2017 consent order that prevents Uber from misrepresenting to the federal government how it keeps consumer data private, confidential, and secure. The order, which also requires Uber to institute a comprehensive data privacy program, was the result of a settlement between Uber and the Federal Trade Commission, following a separate 2014 breach that compromised more than 100,000 names and driver's license numbers that were also stored via AWS third-party services.\n\nAlso on Monday, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) sent Khosrowshahi a letter expressing \u201cgrave concerns\u201d over the company's handling of the breach. Warner cautioned that Uber's conduct \u201craises serious questions about the company's compliance with relevant state and federal regulations,\u201d singling out a corporate statement acknowledging that Uber informed potential investor SoftBank of the incident before U.S. regulators or the public found out.\n\nWarner posed six of his own questions, one of which asks if Uber may have committed an illegal act by hacking back the attackers in order to identify them. The senator also wants to know why Uber didn't share the intelligence it collected on the hackers with law enforcement.\n\nOther questions from Warner include why more robust access management protections like two-factor authentication weren't used for the third-party cloud storage, and what proof does Uber have that the cyberthieves truly deleted the stolen data.\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP Senators are asking for a comprehensive timeline of events, details on Uber's attempts to mitigate the incident, steps taken since the breach to ensure FTC compliance, and assurances that Social Security numbers were not stolen.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}]}, {"news_name": "UK public won't trust a breached company yet fail to protect their own data", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/uk-public-wont-trust-a-breached-company-yet-fail-to-protect-their-own-data/article/709508/", "title": "UK public won't trust a breached company yet fail to protect their own data", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "November 28, 2017", "body": "The public are about to get a rude awakening when data breaches reported under GDPR become public as 70 percent of people say that they would stop doing business with companies following a data breach, yet it is clear within the industry that there is currently huge under-reporting of breaches.\n\nPerhaps more realistically, just a quarter (27 percent) of respondents globally to the Gemalto survey feel businesses take security very seriously.\u00a0 Yet even when companies \u00a0do offer greater security measures, such as two factor authentication, sixty percent of consumers do not use them.\n\nSpecifically for the UK, the figures were slightly lower with 63 percent of UK consumers who would stop doing business with a company where financial and sensitive information was stolen.

Although the data breach took place years ago, the company at least earned praise for its quick response once it became aware of the issue.\n\nImgur first learned of the incident on Thanksgiving, Nov. 23, 2017, when Hunt provided the company with the stolen data, which the company quickly verified belonged to its user community. The next day, Imgur began notifying impacted users via email, requiring affected individuals to update their passwords.\n\nIn a small discrepancy, Hunt states on his website that the breach appears to have taken place in September 2013, as opposed to 2014, as Imgur claims on its website. However, via Twitter, Hunt told a commenter that this inconsistency is \u201crelatively inconsequential,\u201d noting that Imgur may have revised the date of attack that Hunt provided after further internal investigation.\n\n\u201cI want to recognize @imgur's exemplary handling of this: that's 25 hours and 10 mins from my initial email\u2026 to them mobilizing people over Thanksgiving, assessing the data, beginning password resets and making a public disclosure,\u201d Hunt said via Twitter in praise of the company.\n\n\"This is really where we're at now: people recognze that data breaches are the new normal, and they're judging organizations not on the fact that they've had one, but on how they've handled it when its happened,\" Hunt added.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Uber's delayed breach notification would run afoul of GDPR", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ubers-delayed-breach-notification-would-run-afoul-of-gdpr/article/709361/", "title": "Uber's delayed breach notification would run afoul of GDPR ", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 22, 2017", "body": "If the Global Data Protection Rules (GDPR) had been in effect during the latest Uber hack, the ride-sharing company would have faced stiffed consequences \u2013 or maybe it would have chosen a more prudent, secure route by promptly revealing the attack that compromised the personal data of 57 million customers and drivers, and by taking bold steps to mitigate the damage.\n\nGDPR, which takes effect next May, is \u201cdesigned specifically to deal with such occurrences.\u00a0Under [GDPR], Uber would have had to notify the regulator\u00a0within 72 hours\u00a0of being aware of the hack (not the year or so in this case). And assuming the regulator found them in breach of the regulations, they would have to pay a fine of four percent of global annual turnover, or 20 million Euros, whichever is higher,\u201d said Dean Armstrong QC, cyber law barrister at Setfords Solicitors. \u201cAs Uber hasn't released its figures, we can't speculate as to the potential final cost of the fine, but it is fair to say the regulator would come down hard, and under the regulations it would likely be in the tens of millions.\u201d\n\nBut the company will likely feel the biggest impact on \u201creputation, which although harder to quantify than a fine could far outstrip any penalty handed to them by a regulator,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cThe U.K. and Europe are adopting stricter rules on personal data protection for precisely this kind of event.\"\n\nAttackers lifted a set of login credentials from a GitHub coding site that Uber software engineers used, then accessed an infrastructure account where computing tasks are handled, only to find a treasure trove of archived driver and rider data. \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe hack wasn't sophisticated \u2013 the digital thieves broke into the accounts of two Uber engineers on Github, where they found the passwords to some online data storage that contained the personal info, according to the report,\u201d said Imperva CTO Terry Ray.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be a prime example of good intentions gone bad. Using an online collaboration and coding platform isn't necessarily wrong, and it isn't clear if getting your accounts hacked on these platforms is even uncommon,\u201d said Ray, who flagged as problematic the use of live production data \u201cin an online platform where credentials were accessible in Github. \u201cSadly, it's all too common that developers are allowed to copy live production data for use in development, testing and QA. This data is almost never monitored or secured, and as we can see here, it is often stored in various locations and is often easily accessed by nefarious actors.\u201d\n\nContending that Uber \u201cplayed a risky game\u201d by concealing the incident and paying the hackers $100,000 to delete the purloined data, which will likely embolden bad actors to steal personal information from other organizations, Armstrong said GDPR's eminent arrival pointed to \u201ca huge shift in thinking towards this issue.\u201d \n\nNow Uber is left \u201cto navigate a labyrinth of financial and state breach notification laws given a user base spanning the globe,\u201d particularly GDPR, said Mark Sangster, vice president and industry security strategist at eSentire.\n\nSitting on the breach for a year could cause untold damage for the company, its employees and customers. \u201cWhile comedians and senators are finding out that they can't keep sexual harassment under wraps, companies are learning that they can't bury the news when they get hacked,\u201d said Jeff Williams, CTO and cofounder of Contrast Security.\u00a0\u201cIn this case, Uber was legally required to disclose this breach, and I'm sure there will be repercussions.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWilliams called the breach likely \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d While some incidents \u201cdon't legally require disclosure,\u201d they \u201cwould outrage consumers if they knew,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAnd most organizations are sitting on mountains of unfixed vulnerabilities that don't require disclosure. Another outrage.\u201d \u00a0\n\nSangster finds Uber's response baffling, after a series of mega-breaches that rocked organizations should have been wake-up calls. \u201cIt's fascinating that even in light of the mega-breaches of 2016 and 2017, companies consider non or delayed breach disclosure as an option,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of records compromised in the Uber hack far exceeds the entire population of Canada. We're not talking small beans, here.\u201d\n\nMaintaining that \u201ccompanies today have no excuse when it comes to cybersecurity controls,\u201d since they have an abundance of tools and guidelines to choose from, Sangster said, \u201cin Uber's case, you have a company already enduring a PR firestorm. Mix in a significant one-year-old, non-disclosed breach, and that storm suddenly becomes a hurricane.\u201d\n\nSangster fully expects that the Uber breach \u201cwill set new precedents when it comes to regulatory compliance and disclosure mandates.\u201d\n\nIndeed, after the GDPR takes effect in May, \u201c\u2018doing an Uber' will be unacceptabl,e so organizations need to be working overtime now to get their technology, people and processes ready for compliance,\u201d said Simon Townsend, chief technologist, EMEA, for Ivanti\u00a0and an expert in GDPR best practices.\n\n\n\nThe decisions of the ride-sharing company to delay notification and pay hackers not only stands to sully Uber, but security organizations on whole. \u201cWhile I suspect most will rest the blame squarely on Uber as a corporation and its well-known lack of leadership, it's the choices made by the Chief Security Officer [Joe Sullivan] and one of his deputies that are the most shocking part of this data breach,\u201d said AsTech Chief Security Strategist Nathan Wenzler, who said that legitimate security professionals know better.\n\n\u201cThe community at large is built upon integrity in all matters,\u201d said Wenzler. \u201cWhen you act as the front line of defense for an organization, it is imperative that your security team operates in the most honest and forthright manner possible.\u201d\n\nMark Orlando, CTO for cyber services at Raytheon, noted that \u201cany time companies suffer a large data breach, they\u00a0run the risk of making things worse, both for their customers and for the larger community.\u201d\n\nSince \u201chackers talk to each other,\u201d Uber in its silence \u201chas empowered them for a year, where they could have brought this into the light, raised public awareness of the threat and made some good come of this,\u201d said Orlando. \u201cInstead, the company gave its attackers exactly what they wanted \u2013 a lot of money, and a reason to try this again and again.\u201d\u200b\n\nThe morality of paying the hackers might be up for debate, but \u201cthe lack of responsible disclosure in reporting the incident to regulators is something every security professional should consider to be an unforgivable crime,\u201d Wenzler said. \u201cWe're here to protect people's identities and critical data, and when the worst happens, we must do all we can to mitigate the damage; inform people that their data may be compromised, so they can be more aware and vigilant of misuse; and ultimately, help educate them on what they can do to protect themselves.\u201d \n\nUber must account for its actions, the pros said. \u201cSome of the questions that should be answered include: Why did engineers have access to 57 million records of personally identifiable information? Did they go through an approval workflow to move that data online? Did Uber security have any monitoring in place to alert them when such vast amounts of data were accessed?,\u201d said Ray. \u201cControls to alert on suspicious data access do exist, but my guess is that they were not used, which is all too typical in today's enterprises.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Uber is not alone in security foibles and its massive breach underscores the need for all organizations to be accountable and step up their security. \u201cWhen a company places data in the public cloud, they are ultimately responsible for the security of that data. Reminiscent of when, in the movie The Blues Brothers, John Belushi yelled at Carrie Fisher, \u2018It wasn't my fault,' it was in fact very much his fault,\u201d explained Bob Noel, director of strategic relationships and marketing for Plixer. \u201cCompanies can no longer brush off responsibility for the loss of personally identifiable information (PII)\u201d and should \u201cbegin to require documentation providing best practice security controls are in place\u201d from their third-party cloud providers. \u00a0\n\n\u201cUntil businesses stop saying that they take security seriously and actually start doing it, we will continue to see the list of breaches grow,\u201d said Wayne Reynolds, vice president of security at Armor, noting the low impact and ease of implementing basic blocking and tackling of security controls. \u201cThreat actors are fully aware that development/engineering environments typically have the weakest security within a business. These malicious actors will continue to target these areas until we response by stepping up the game and start securing them as production assets.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "Uber hid massive hack compromising data of 57M for a year", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/uber-hid-massive-hack-compromising-data-of-57m-for-a-year/article/709144/", "title": "Uber hid massive hack compromising data of 57M for a year", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 22, 2017", "body": "For more than a year, even as it negotiated with regulators in the U.S. over privacy infractions, Uber hid a massive hack that resulted in cyberthieves pilfering the personal information of 57 million customers and drivers and prompted the company to fire two executives, including its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan.\n\n\u201cWe know that the two attackers accessed a GitHub coding site used by Uber software engineers, found a set of login credentials, and used those credentials to access an infrastructure account that handled computing tasks for the company,\u201d said Corey Williams, senior director of products and marketing at Centrify. \u201cWithin that infrastructure, the attackers discovered the archive of rider and driver information.\u201d\n\nThe information stolen in October 2016 included names, phone numbers and email addresses of the company's customers, according to a report by Bloomberg.\u00a0\n\nAround seven million drivers had their data compromised - approximately 600,000 driver's license numbers were compromised. \u00a0\n\nWhile Uber told Bloomberg it did not believe the purloined data was used in any way, the company did admit to paying the hackers $100,000 to get rid of it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cObviously, $100,000 is probably considered \u201ccheap\u201d these days,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Roberts, chief security architect at Acalvio, who expressed dismay that \u201cone of our own\u201d orchestrated a cover-up. \u201cThe company keeps it reputation (for whatever it's worth in the case of Uber), the company can keep doing what it does (using risky applications) and the hackers get a decent payday and can move onto the next target and see if they can do the same to them as they did to Uber.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,\u201d Uber's new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was cited in the the report as saying.\u00a0\n\nKhosrowshahi said the company is \u201cchanging the way we do business.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCentrify's Williams said \u201cif Uber had followed standard breach protocol by notifying authorities and impacted users, remediated the problem and laid out steps that they were taking to avoid future breaches, the impact would have been much less.\u201d Uber, he said, \u201cwas under a legal obligation to notify regulators and to the impacted users and drivers. Instead they took extreme measures to hide the hack, paying $100k to the hackers to remain quiet and actively took steps to keep the truth under wraps.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the company \u201cwas already in hot water for a breach in 2014 for a compromise of Uber's database running on AWS. Uber agreed to 20 years of privacy audits. It misrepresented the extent of the breach and the extent of their security controls in place to protect information,\u201d said Chris\u00a0Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra.\n\n\u201cThis was clearly not the case as the systems compromised in 2016 are still in AWS hosting much of the same information, only on a much bigger scale,\u201d Morales said. \u201cThis breach happened at the same time Uber was already under investigation by U.S regulators for the 2014 breach.\u201d\n\nHe found the coverup \u201cmore\u00a0concerning\u201d than the attack. \u201cThere are many breach notification laws, especially in California, that would have required immediate notification to consumers,\u201d he said, calling for a broader conversation on national breach and notification legislation. \u201cWe are the ones put at risk here, not Uber.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe Uber hack strikes an all too familiar chord. \u00a0\u201ci'm not sure how many times we will need to see this story play out before companies get it right,\u201d said Curtis Sparrer, principal of Bospar, whose recent survey of 1005 adults in the U.S. found that only 6.2 percent admire Uber. \u201cWhen companies make a mistake they need to reveal it quickly and simply to their customers and the public.\u00a0 It's always the coverup that's worse than the crime.\u201d\n\nIndeed, \u201cwho watches the watchers? The truly scary thing here is that Uber paid a bribe, according to news reports, essentially a ransom to make this breach go away and they acted as if they were above the law,\u201d said Sam Curry, CSO at Cybereason. \u201cThose people responsible for the integrity and confidentiality of the data, in-fact covered it up.\u201d\n\nCurry commended\u00a0Khosrowshahi's efforts. \u201cTo all outward appearances, the new CEO and management team are doing the right thing and making the difficult choices,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, difficult consequences still have to follow.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThose consequences are already beginning to roll in. New York Attorney General Eric Schneideman has opened a probe into the hack.\u00a0\n\nThe hack and subsequent coverup are \u201ca wake up call to the industry that CSO's have a responsibility not just to the companies that they work for, but the people who's data is affected,\u201d said Curry. \u201cIn other words, Joe Sullivan and crew, should have acted in the interest of the public good and public safety and made these tough choices far, far sooner. It's time not to let another Equifax, Deloitte, etc happen and to leave no gray area to security officers as to what the right thing to do is.\"\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "House committees ask for more information from Equifax", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/house-committees-ask-for-more-information-from-equifax/article/709004/", "title": "House committees ask for more information from Equifax", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 21, 2017", "body": "Two U.S. House committees appear to be diving deeper into their investigation of the Equifax breach that exposed the personal information of 145.5 million people earlier this year with a letter to the company requesting detailed information regarding the its cybersecurity personnel and communications with the government\n\nThe House Science, Space, and Technology and the House Oversight and Government Reform committee's chairmen sent Equifax a bipartisan letter\u00a0on November 20 requesting a slew of additional information by December 6.

Among them are England's Queen Elizabeth II; Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chief fundraiser Stephen Bronfman; and more than\u00a0a\u00a0dozen individuals linked to President Donald Trump, including advisers, Cabinet members, and major donors.\n\nThe ICIJ noted that the use of offshore tax havens is not inherently illegal. However, the organization adds, \"the built-in secrecy attracts money launderers, drug traffickers, kleptocrats, and others who want to operate in the shadows.\" Moreover, \"Offshore companies, often 'shells' with no employees or office space, are also used in complex tax-avoidance structures that drain billions from national treasuries.\"\n\nNotably, the papers shed light on another tie between a key Trump political appointee and Russia. Specifically, the ICIJ reported via its website that U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross owns a stake in Navigator Holdings, a shipping company that since 2014 has received more than $68 million in revenue from Kremlin-linked energy company Sibur, which is owned Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law,\u00a0Kirill Shamalov.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing whatsoever improper about Navigator having a relationship with Sibur,\u201d said Ross in an interview that the BBC published via Twitter. \u201cThe fact that [Sibur] happens to be called a Russian company does not mean there's any evil in it.\u201d Politico also reported that a Ross spokesman said the commerce secretary never met the Sibur owners in question and that he had recused himself from such matters.\n\nMeanwhile, NBC News has reported that although Ross claims he properly disclosed his Russian business ties to Congress, the ICIJ report asserts the information he provided was incomplete and therefore misleading.\n\nThe ICIJ said that in addition to Appleby, the leaked documents also were sourced from Estera, a\u00a0corporate services provider that previously operated in conjunction with Appleby, as well as from \"19 corporate registries maintained by governments in jurisdictions that serve as way stations in the global shadow economy.\"\n\nThe Paradise Papers has already been compared to the 2015 Panama Papers leak, which resulted from the data breach\u00a0of law firm Mossack Fonseca.\u00a0\n\n\"...Beyond the shock factor of the leaked data itself, what's more alarming is the depth and magnitude of this breach. Law and accounting firms should raise the alarm when it comes to their firm's cybersecurity rigor,\" said Mark Sangster, VP and industry security strategist at cybersecurity company eSentire, in emailed comments.\n\nWhile the mechanics of the breach itself have yet to be revealed, this was clearly a targeted attack,\" Sangster continued. \"Law and\u00a0accounting firms are particularly susceptible to ethical hacking and really, every firm should assume they'll be breached... These firms house a treasure trove of sensitive data that, when compromised, can result in sometimes irrecoverable damage.\u201d\n\nIlia Kolochenko, CEO of web security company High-Tech Bridge, agreed that law firms are an attractive target for cybercriminals. \"Hacking of their clients is quite costly, will likely be detected and investigated, and almost certainly will cause very serious counteractions,\" said Kolochenko, in emailed comments.\u00a0\"It may be a good moment to think about imposing obligatory data security standards on law firms and practicing attorneys. Their data deserves at least the same level of protection as data of companies under PCI, DSS or HIPAA compliance. Otherwise, visiting attorneys will become a very risky practice.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}]}, {"news_name": "2.7M Verticalscope credentials compromised", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/27m-verticalscope-credentials-compromised/article/705717/", "title": "2.7M Verticalscope credentials compromised", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 06, 2017", "body": "The Canadian web forum manager Verticalscope has again been hacked with 2.7 million user accounts being affected this time.\n\nThe latest incident takes place about one year after the company reported that 45 million user credentials had been compromised.

The URL brought up one of the ubiquitous fake Flash Player Update screens.\u201d\n\nNoting that Equifax isn't likely to help consumers upgrade Flash, Abrams said his discovery shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.\n\n\"We are aware of the situation identified on the equifax.com website in the credit report assistance link,\" Reuters cited Equifax spokesman Wyatt Jefferies as saying. \"Our IT and security teams are looking into this matter, and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline.\"\n\nChris Olson, CEO of The Media Trust referred to the whole situation as \"ridiculous\" and called for companies to improve their security postures. \"This is yet another misstep by a major U.S. enterprise in handling its website breach,\u201d said Olson. \u201cEquifax, and for that matter any enterprise, should first identify and manage all third parties contributing code to their websites and get their own house in order!\u201d\n\nJoseph Carson, chief security scientist at Thycotic, said it was \"common to see many ripples and after-effects\" following a large breach. \u201cHowever, Equifax appears to be stuck on a huge wave,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nNoting that hackers typically exploit fear, Carson said that after Equifax's CEO \u201cblamed a single employee in front of congress for causing the major data breach at Equifax, cybercriminals are exploiting employees with fear of being the next victim.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Equifax could experience additional breaches in the future \u201cdue to human failure to detect cyber threats,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe problem with blaming the Equifax data breach on a single employee is that we have to remember that employees are, in most cases, victims themselves.\u201d\n\nThe latest potential breach demonstrates that the \u201ccurrent flow of threats is now exploiting that the original data breach resulted from an unpatched web server and now employees are getting prompted that their own systems are missing a major patch for Adobe Flash,\u201d said Carson. \u201cBecause they fear hackers gaining access, they are going to click on the update. Unfortunately, it's a fake update trying to infect their systems. This opens the door again into Equifax for hackers to continue disclosing sensitive data.\u201d\n\nThe newest incident \"happened because Equifax trusted a different piece of third-party code (Fireclick Web Analytics javascript library) and didn't put in the work to make sure it stayed secure,\u201d said Jeff Williams, CTO and co-founder of Contrast Security.\u00a0\u201cBasically, a very similar problem [to the first breach] with two quite different pieces of code.\u201d\n\nThe Fireclick library was included on the Equifax site, \u201cbut it pulls in some javascript from another site, netflame.cc, that appears to have been hacked,\u201d said Williams.\u00a0\u201cWhen the Equifax site loads Fireclick, which loads netflame.cc code, the victim's browser is redirected to malware.\u201d\n\nAnyone that uses the Fireclick library could feel the impact of the second breach, but \u201cthe attackers may not even know that they compromised Equifax,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cA more targeted attack could have used the netflame.cc code to access victim's data from the Equifax page, submit false data on behalf of the victim, or deface the Equifax page.\u201d\u00a0 If the attack had been hidden from the victim, he said, it \u201ccould have been much more difficult to detect.\u201d\n\nIt's time for organizations to stop viewing third-party code as \u201c'free functionality that saves the cost of having to write, test, and deploy that code themselves,\u201d Williams said.\u00a0\u201dWe need to accept the fact that using third-party code creates an obligation to analyze for vulnerabilities continuously and respond to new vulnerabilities/attacks within hours.\u201d\u00a0\n\nStressing that \u201ccybersecurity is no longer just a technology challenge\u201d but rather \u201ca challenge for everybody who uses and interacts with technology daily,\u201d Carson said, \u201cThe protection and security of both your work and personal life are no longer separated and they have been intertwined with evolving trends of social networks, the internet of things and unlimited connectivity.\u201d\n\nAs a result\u00a0\u201ccybersecurity is no longer just the responsibility of the company IT department but it is now the responsibility of every employee not just to protect your work assets but your personal data as well,\u201d he said, and puts people on the frontline of cybersecurity attacks and threats that \u201cstart from our personal social footprint including your personal data and devices potentially even corrupting your family photos or stealing your own money all to use you as a mule to gain further access.\u201d\n\nHe called for\u00a0\u201ca balance between technology and people to increase our cybersecurity awareness to help us protect and secure both our personal assets and our company assets.\u201d\n\nMatt Schulz, CreditCards.com's senior industry analyst, said the latest potential Equifax breach \u201cis just Reason No. 10,000 why consumers should assume their personal information is already out there and act accordingly.\u201d\n\nCalling it \u201ca scary thing to wrap your brain around,\u201d Schultz said, \u201cthe truth is that you're better off assuming the worst\u201d then taking action to protect sensitive information.\n\n\"This is a forever thing. Once information is out there, it's out there for good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd bad guys can be very patient, so don't assume that you're safe just because your information hasn't yet been used fraudulently.

The culprit in this case \u2013 the $32.9 billion consulting and professional services company Accenture \u2013 was found to be insecurely storing data that, ironically, has to do with its own cloud-based enterprise solution, the Accenture Cloud Platform.\n\nChris Vickery, director of cyber risk research at cyber firm UpGuard, discovered the problem last September, after determining that Accenture was using four publicly downloadable AWS S3 storage buckets to store sensitive information such as API data, authentication credentials, certificates, decryption keys, configurations, and customer information \u2013 all pertaining to the consulting firm's multi-cloud management platform, including its customers and inner workings.\n\nAccording to an Oct. 11 UpGuard blog post, attackers could have leveraged any of this information \u2013 accessible via a simple URL address \u2013 to attack any of Accenture's clients, which include 94 companies on the Fortune Global 100 list. For instance, post author Dan O'Sullivan noted that malicious actors could have used exposed credentials to impersonate Accenture, conduct reconnaissance on the corporate network, and launch password reuse attacks.\n\n\"In a worst-case scenario, it is not unforeseeable that complete enterprise-level swaths of data could have been at risk for many clients,\" said Vickery in an email interview with SC Media.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson from Accenture claimed to ZDNet that UpGuard was the only outside entity to access the servers, which were reconfigured as private the day after Vickery reported his findings to the Dublin, Ireland-based company. Accenture has also attested that the credentials found on the servers were old and inactive.\n\nAn Accenture spokesperson further elaborated in a statement provided to SC Media: \u201cNone of our clients' confidential information was involved and there was no risk to any of our clients,\" the statements reads. \"No active credentials were compromised. We have a multi-layered security model, and the data in question would not have allowed anyone that found it to penetrate any of those layers.\u00a0The information involved could not have provided access to client systems and was not production data or applications.\u201d\n\nUpGuard's analysis of the cloud-based storage revealed four subdomains: \"acp-deployment,\" \"acpcollector,\" \"acp-software\" and \"acp-ssl\" \u2013 all of which were maintained by an account named \u201cawsacp0175.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cacp-deployment\u201d bucket apparently contained internal access keys, credentials, and configuration files linked to an API used for authentication purposes. Also included in this bucket was a plaintext document with the master access key for Accenture's AWS Key Management Service account. Additionally, there were encrypted \u201cclient.jks\u201d files, the nature of which is unknown, along with a plaintext password needed to decrypt these files, as well as private signing keys.\n\nUpGuard further reported that the \u201cacpcollector\u201d bucket appeared to \u201ccontain data necessary for visibility into and maintenance of Accenture's cloud stores,\u201d including \u201cVPN keys used in production for Accenture's private network,\u201d as well as internal logs.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cacp-software\u201d bucket included hashed credentials and 40,000 plaintext passwords, access keys for a cloud infrastructure management platform, information about Accenture's ASGARD database, data dumps from an event tracker solution, and apparent credentials for Google and Azure accounts.\n\nFinally, the \u201cacp-ssl\u201d was found to contain keys for gaining access to various Accenture environments, as well as certificates.\n\nUpGuard and Vickery have a history of finding organizations' exposed AWS S3 servers, and have recently disclosed similar incidents involving Viacom,\u00a0Dow Jones, the\u00a0Department of Defense,\u00a0Verizon, voting machine firm\u00a0Election Systems & Software, and Deep Root Analytics, a data analytics firm contracted by the Republican party.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud-security/topic/49913/", "topic_name": "Cloud Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Oilpro.com founder sentenced to prison after pleading guilty for hacking competitor", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/the-oilprocom-founder-hacked-a-competitors-database-to-boost-own-companys-value/article/699598/", "title": "Oilpro.com founder sentenced to prison after pleading guilty for hacking competitor ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "October 11, 2017", "body": "The founder of a professional networking site was sentenced to a year and one day in prison after hacking into a competitor's database and attempting to sell his site to the same company whose database he hacked. \n\nOilpro.com Founder David W.

the number of affected accounts previously reported demonstrates the far-reaching and ongoing impact of an undetected hack, underscores the cost of unexamined risk, points to the dangers of neglecting vulnerabilities and will likely renew calls for federal data breach notification legislation, information security professionals said in the aftermath of the revelation by Verizon Communications, which acquired Yahoo earlier this year.\n\nThe breach \u201cis now the unfortunate poster child for unexamined risk, as its networks contained long-neglected vulnerabilities for years that eventually led it to becoming the largest global data breach of all time, said Joe Fantuzzi, CEO of RiskVision, who said that Yahoo is \u201cfar from the only enterprise that has consistently overlooked critical factors in its risk environment.\u201d\n\nHe noted that risk factors, \u201clike a fix engine light that is all too often ignored,\u201d simply don't \u201cdisappear\u201d if organizations overlook them. \u201cIf your risk environment is like a roadmap, risk factors are literally red flags \u2013 a harbinger for the potential of exploitation or a breach down the road,\u201d said Fantuzzi. \u201cWhile organizations like Yahoo are staffed by armies of security personnel, their risk environment is also incredibly complex and multifaceted, making it easy to overlook critical vulnerabilities if proper due diligence isn't thoroughly conducted.\u201d\n\nThe countless assets of global enterprises, too, make them \u201cglaring targets for hackers,\u201d he said, explaining that \u201cgoing forward, taking shortcuts around risk won't be an option for these organizations, and assessing and prioritizing risk won't be a luxury \u2013 it will be mandatory in preventing these kinds of devastating breaches down the road.\u201d\n\nYahoo has paid a steep price for seemingly poor security practices. \u201cYahoo is now learning for the third time that the most dangerous hack is often the one that goes undetected,\u201d said Vishal Gupta, CEO at Seclore. \u201cAs we saw last year, their security protocols deeply impacted business negotiations with Verizon, and yet again, we are seeing Yahoo's name in the headlines for the same breach.\u201d The breach, Gupta said, should serve as \u201ca reminder for all organizations responsible for safeguarding large amounts of user information to shift to a data-centric security model, as they remain highly-valuable targets for hackers, who will continue to come up with inventive ways to infiltrate systems.\u201d\n\nLeigh-Anne Galloway, cybersecurity resilience lead at Positive Technologies, said that while \u201cthe identity of the hackers, and exactly how they managed to breach Yahoo remains unknown\u2026it's safe to say that this one breach has security implications for more people than ever before.\n\nThough the Yahoo hack \u201cmay not have included clear text passwords, or \u2018valuable' data such as card details, as we recently saw in the Equifax hack, the accounts are still at risk, and hackers can do a lot of damage with very little information,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cWhether you continue to use these accounts today or not, changing your passwords is the only way to guarantee your personal information is secure.\u201d\n\nShe encouraged Yahoo users to change their passwords and those \u201cof all other accounts linked to Yahoo\u201d as well as \u201cYahoo-owned properties, such as Flickr and Tumblr.\u201d\n\nIt's even more important to practice good password hygiene since \u201cconsumer-facing breaches can extend beyond personal accounts, potentially exposing the enterprise as well.\u201d SailPoint CEO Mark McClain said. \u201cData breaches like this can create a domino effect across multiple organizations through the reuse of credentials across personal and business accounts.\u201d\n\nConsumers should \u201cgo long\u201d and \u201cbe unique\u201d to \u201cmake things harder for the bad guys,\u201d McClain advised. \u201cAlways be aware of where you are on the Internet and take specific note of anything and anybody that asks you to \u2018login' or provide any \u2018secrets' or personal information. Opt-in for multi-factor authentication where available.\u201d\n\nThe Yahoo breach's expanded victim pool is likely to compel lawmakers and regulators to take action, said Willy Leichter, vice president of marketing at Virsec Systems. \"This news will add more fuel to fire for having legal standards on how quickly breach information is revealed and how much detail is required\u201d Leichter said. \u201cAs we've seen with the Equifax hearings, even conservatives are calling for legislation moving in the direction of the European GDPR.\"\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}]}, {"news_name": "128,000 Arkansas Oral & Facial Surgery Center patients compromised", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/128000-arkansas-oral-facial-surgery-center-patients-compromised/article/698227/", "title": "128,000 Arkansas Oral & Facial Surgery Center patients compromised", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 05, 2017", "body": "In late July the Arkansas Oral & Facial Surgery Center was hit with a ransomware attack that not only locked up patient records, but may have also exposed their personal information.\n\nThe attack,which was discovered on July 26, encrypted the facilities imaging files, such as x-rays, related documents and rendered inaccessible all electronic data gathered during patient visits from the preceding three weeks, the company reported.

Smith also claimed to have no knowledge of the total extent of the problem until July 31 when the issue was brought to him by his cybersecurity team.\n\nIn Smith's prepared remarks he said U.S. CERT notified Equifax of the problem on March 8 and the following day the news was given to the security team. As per company policy these workers had 48 hours to search for and then patch any problems.\n\n\u201cApache Struts within Equifax was not identified or patched in response to the internal March 9 notification to information technology personnel,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAdditional scans were run on March 15 again searching for the Apache Struts vulnerability, but came up empty.\n\n\u201cEquifax's efforts undertaken in March 2017 did not identify any versions of Apache Struts that were subject to this vulnerability, and the vulnerability remained in an Equifax web application much longer than it should have,\u201d he said.\n\nPravin Kothari, Founder and\u00a0CEO of\u00a0CipherCloud, called the CERT notification something that should have triggered an all hands on deck response, but he believes the company's focus was elsewhere and not on cybersecurity.\n\n\"A good security process would have identified vulnerable systems\u00a0within 24 hours\u00a0and patch must have been applied. But the Equifax process was \u201cweak and broken\u201d because it failed to identify the vulnerable systems. This process is supposed to run every day; not only did they not identify the vulnerability immediately, it went unidentified until they found the breach. It was too late,\" he told SC Media.\n\nIn a bipartisan reaction none of the committee members were satisfied with Smith's comments and raked him over the coals with Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., saying it would be hard to pass legislation that would prevent this from happening in the future.\n\n\u201cI don't think we can pass a law that, excuse me for saying this, fixes stupid,\" said Walden.\n\nIt also came out in Smith's testimony that if the Equifax information security team had found the vulnerability in March the entire incident could have been avoided. The recently completed forensic investigation revealed that the hackers did not access any sensitive information until May 13 and that between that date and July 30 the hackers continued to have access to the system exploiting the Apache Struts vulnerability all while Equifax remained in the dark.\n\nThe first clue that something was amiss, Smith said, took place on July 29 when the IT staffers noted suspicious activity in the Consumer Dispute Portal. That day the illegal traffic was blocked, but it was again spotted on July 30 when the application was taken offline.\n\nSmith said he was first informed of the problem on July 31 by Equifax's, now former, CIO David Webb, but he claimed at that time he was unaware \u201cthat personal identifying information had been stolen, or have any indication of the scope of this attack.\u201d\n\nOn August 2 Equifax retained the cybersecurity group at the law firm of King & Spalding to handle the investigation and provide legal advice and the company contacted the FBI. By August 11 it was known that the hackers may have accessed a data table containing\u00a0 customer personal information, and then revealed on August 15 that the information was not only accessed but stolen.\n\n\u201cOn August 17, I held a senior leadership team meeting to receive the detailed briefing on the investigation. At that point, the forensic investigation had determined that there were large volumes of consumer data that had been compromised. Learning this information was deeply concerning to me, although the team needed to continue their analysis to understand the scope and specific consumers potentially affected,\u201d Smith testified.\n\nThe first member of the company's board of directors was not notified until August 22 and the full board not for another two days. The board met for the first time to discuss the matter on September 1. \n\nRep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., asked Smith why he took so long to loop in the board. Smith replied that the situation was fluid and he wanted it to settle down first.\n\nOne of the reasons Smith cited for holding off on going public was the fear that once the news broke it would open the company to further cyber intrusions and the need to further harden their systems.\n\nThe news was released on September 7.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}]}, {"news_name": "Indian government and corporate credentials found for sale on DarkNet", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/indian-government-and-corporate-credentials-found-for-sale-on-darknet/article/697493/", "title": "Indian government and corporate credentials found for sale on DarkNet", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 03, 2017", "body": "The login credentials and other inside information of more than 6,000 Indian ISPs, government departments and businesses is being advertised for sale on DarkNet.\n\nSeqrite Cyber Intelligence Labs and seQtree InfoServices came across the content, each of which has been identified through the India National Internet Registry, reported The Economic Times.

According to The Guardian, six clients have so far been notified \u2013 possibly, but not necessarily, including major banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms, and government agencies. The news outlet further reports that the breach was \u201cU.S.-focused\u201d and was so sensitive in nature \u201cthat only a handful of Deloitte's most senior partners and lawyers were informed.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Deloitte says it has reached out to governmental authorities, initiated a review using both internal and external experts, and implemented a \u201ccomprehensive security protocol\u201d in response to the incident.\n\nThe actors behind the breach reportedly accessed the Azure cloud service by compromising an administrator's account with unrestricted access to content. Sources told The Guardian that the account required the user to enter only a single password, and did not have \u201ctwo-step\u201d verification set up \u2013 a revelation that drew some sharp criticism.\n\n\"Deloitte\u00a0provides a security consultancy service to enterprise and government clients, which includes recommendations against having administrator accounts without multi-factor authentication.

Experts have noted that by attacking just one organization \u2013 the SEC \u2013 the culprits were able to accumulate intelligence on many companies in one fell swoop. A similar strategy also be at play in the case of Deloitte.\n\n\u201cAbove all, professional hackers want to compromise strategic sites that yield exponential rewards. In a hack of this scale, criminals or spies will continue to reap dividends years down the road,\u201d said Kenneth Geers, senior research scientist at\u00a0Comodo Group, and an ambassador with NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.\n\nCalling the lack of 2FA \u201cinexcusable,\u201d Geers said that the attackers, who could easily be a sophisticated cybercriminal group or foreign intelligence service, have had months to \u201ccover their tracks and/or install backdoors for future use\u2026 The irony is that Deloitte must have a first-class cybersecurity staff, and yet still was hacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeloitte's customers were relaying non-public information, which could have been used to facilitate \u2018competitive intelligence,' or front-run the merger or acquisition strategy of the victim, or conduct digital insider trading,\u201d said Kellermann. \u201cImplicit trust is given to companies like Deloitte vis-a-vis their capacity to secure sensitive data, and by breaching an entity like them you can island-hop into her constituency.\u201d\n\nMcDonald also believes the breach could have dire consequences for some clients. \u201cCommunications from auditing and consultancy tend to highlight the vulnerabilities of an organization from financial to security issues,\" he said. \"With months of access to sensitive communiques, an attacker could have the keys to the kingdom of many large entities.\"\n\nBen Johnson, co-founder and CTO of Obsidian Security, said that any organization that stores and manages the sensitive information of other companies is a prime target. \"If you are looking for political gain, you will want information won citizens as well as corporations.

The flaw was quickly patched upon discovery, but not before malicious actors may have capitalized on a bounty of sensitive information on publicly traded companies.\n\nEDGAR, which stands for Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval, contains not only public documents like annual reports, but also private filings related to proposed mergers and acquisitions and other matters that could persuade a trader to buy or sell. In this case, however, the breach appears that it may be limited to only documents entered as test filings.\n\n\"We believe the intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the Commission, or result in systemic risk,\" wrote Clayton in his statement, which summarized the SEC's efforts to bolster its cybersecurity preparedness since the chairman ordered an ongoing assessment of the agency's cyber risk profile back in May 2017. \"Our investigation of this matter is ongoing, however, and we are coordinating with appropriate authorities.\"\n\nAdditionally, Clayton said that other actors have planted fake filings in the EDGAR system in order to profit from the market's reaction.

Ethical investors, including pension and sovereign funds, without the insider information could have lost fortunes as a result.\"\n\nJeff\u00a0Hill, director of product Management at third-party risk management firm\u00a0Prevalent, drew a parallel between the SEC incident and a previous case involving hackers who pleaded guilty to breaching wire services Business Wire, PR Newswire and Marketwired in order to view corporate announcements before they were released to the general public. This allowed them to rake in more than $100 million from insider trading.\n\n\"The EDGAR episode is also tantalizingly efficient for bad actors: Penetrate once, compromise many,\" said Hill. \"Rather than hacking multiple public companies to illicitly gather valuable insider information, the EDGAR perpetrators could parlay a single breach into a potential monetizable data bonanza.\"\n\nAcknowledging that cybersecurity is \"critical to the operations of our markets,\" SEC Chairman Clayton in his statement further elaborated on the progress of his agency's ongoing cybersecurity assessment, a key component of which is the establishment of a a senior-level working group to coordinate information sharing, risk monitoring, and incident response efforts.\n\nTo protect sensitive SEC data, which can include personally identifiable information, proposed rules filings, drafts of applications for exemptive relief, and records related to internal and external investigations, \"the Commission employs an agency-wide cybersecurity detection, protection and prevention program for the protection of agency operations and assets,\" Clayton explained. \"This program includes cybersecurity protocols and controls, network protections, system monitoring and detection processes, vendor risk management processes, and regular cybersecurity and privacy training for employees.\"\n\nClayton also said that the agency expects to hire additional cybersecurity expertise.\n\nJake Olcott,\u00a0VP at security ratings firm BitSight, believes that the statement may possibly portend a change at the regulatory body.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe SEC's statement is remarkable for a number of reasons and might suggest that the agency is considering changes in a number of approaches, from data collection to vendor risk management to regulatory oversight,\" said Olcott, a\u00a0former legal adviser to the Senate Commerce Committee and former counsel to the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee. \"Though the disclosure lacks specifics around the damage caused by the incident, the thoroughness of the descriptions of its efforts to secure its own systems, the standards it follows, and the involvement of external 3rd parties is very unique for a government agency.
