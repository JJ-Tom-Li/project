Facebook was collecting such kind of data, this is not a surprise for tech-savvy people because we have discussed it in the past.\n\nIn January, the popular Italian expert Simone Margaritelli wrote a blog post (Italian) on Medium inviting users to uninstall  Facebook and Whatsapp.\n\nThe programmer Dylan McKay was able to find data, including logs of calls and SMS messages, in an archive he downloaded (as a ZIP file) from Facebook.\n\nMat Johnson, a Professor at the University of Houston Creative Writing Program, also made the same disturbing discovery.\n\nOh wow my deleted Facebook Zip file contains info on every single phone cellphone call and text I made for about a year- cool totally not creepy.\n\n\u2014 Mat Johnson (@mat_johnson) March 23, 2018\n\n\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica case has is giving users another point of view regarding the collection of such kind of data made by Facebook and the real way they are using for.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson explained that the platform collects this data to improve the users\u2019 experience.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis [above] screen in the Messenger application offers to conveniently track all your calls and messages. But Facebook was already doing this surreptitiously on some Android devices until October 2017, exploiting the way an older Android API handled permissions.\u201d wrote Sean Gallagher, Ars Technica\u2019s IT and National Security Editor.\n\n\u201cFacebook began explicitly asking permission from users of Messenger and Facebook Lite to access SMS and call data to \u201chelp friends find each other\u201d after being publicly shamed in 2016 over the way it handled the \u201copt-in\u201d for SMS services. That message mentioned nothing about retaining SMS and call data, but instead it offered an \u201cOK\u201d button to approve \u201ckeeping all of your SMS messages in one place.\u201d\u201d\n\nFacebook denied to collect call data surreptitiously with an official blog post, the social network giant highlighted that it never commercialized the data and that users are in total control of the data uploaded to the platform.\n\n\u201cWhen you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history.\u201d reads the blog post published by Facebook. \u201cFor Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose \u2018learn more\u2019 or \u2018not now\u2019. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or \u2018skip\u2019.

This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provide you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off in settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only.\u201d continues Facebook.\n\nIf you want to stop Facebook from continuously upload your contacts to its server, you can turn off the uploading feature in the Messenger app. In this way, all previously uploaded contacts will be deleted.\n\niOS users are not affected by this issue.\n\nLesson leaned \u2026 every time we use an app it is essential to carefully read the documentation that details its work.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Facebook, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/big-data", "topic_name": "Big Data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cambridge-analytica", "topic_name": "Cambridge Analytica"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}]}, {"news_name": "A new massive cryptomining campaign target Linux servers exploiting old flaw", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70622/hacking/linux-servers-cryptomining.html", "title": "A new massive cryptomining campaign target Linux servers exploiting old flaw\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 25, 2018", "body": "Security firm Trend Micro uncovered new crypto mining campaign, a cybercriminal gang has made nearly $75,000 by installing a Monero miner on vulnerable Linux servers.\n\nThe hackers are exploiting a five-year-old vulnerability in the Cacti \u201cNetwork Weathermap\u201d plugin and according to Trend Micro this campaign is linked to a previous cryptocurrency-mining campaign that used the JenkinsMiner malware.\n\nIn this last campaign that is targeting Linux servers, hackers exploited the CVE-2013-2618 vulnerability in Cacti plugin which is an open-source network monitoring and graphing tool.\n\n\u201cThis campaign\u2019s operators were exploiting CVE-2013-2618, a dated vulnerability in Cacti\u2019s Network Weathermap plug-in, which system administrators use to visualize network activity.\u201d reads the analysis pulished by Trend Micro.\n\n\u201cAs to why they\u2019re exploiting an old security flaw: Network Weathermap only has two publicly reportedvulnerabilities so far, both from June 2014. It\u2019s possible these attackers are taking advantage not only of a security flaw for which an exploit is readily available but also of patch lag that occurs in organizations that use the open-source tool.\u201d\n\nThe flaw could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems, in this case, hackers downloaded and installed a customized version of XMRig, a legitimate Monero mining software (dada.x86_64 as of 01/28/2018, earlier named as xig or nkrb). XMRig supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux operating systems.\n\nTo gain persistence, hackers modified the local cron jobs to trigger a \u201cwatchd0g\u201d Bash script every three minutes, the script checked if the Monero miner was still active and restarted it in case it was down.\n\n\u201cCode is written in /etc/rc.local, which means that each time a system is restarted, watchd0g.sh is executed. The modification of /etc/crontab results in watchd0g.sh being run every three minutes. It then modifies the Linux kernel parameter vm.nr_hugepages to the recommended value for mining Monero (XMR). It also ensures that the watchd0g.sh process runs or re-downloads and executes the file if it terminates.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe researchers analyzed five malware samples that led them to two unique login usernames, matching the Monero wallets where the mining pool payments are sent.\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, hackers made approximately 320 XMR (roughly $75,000), most of the Linux servers were located in Japan (12%), China (10%), Taiwan (10%), and the US (9%).\n\n\n\nTrend Micro recommends keeping internal to the environment data from Cacti and also keeping systems updated with the latest patches.\n\n\u201cWhile this allows systems or network administrators to conveniently monitor their environments (with just a browser bookmark, for instance), it also does the same for threat actors.\u201d concluded Trend Micro.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cryptomining campaign, Linux servers)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptomining-campaign", "topic_name": "cryptomining campaign"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linux-servers", "topic_name": "Linux Servers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/miner", "topic_name": "miner"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monero", "topic_name": "Monero"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Supreme Court in Russia ruled Telegram must provide FSB encryption keys", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70491/laws-and-regulations/telegram-fsb-law.html", "title": "Supreme Court in Russia ruled Telegram must provide FSB encryption keys\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 20, 2018", "body": "Bad news for Telegram, a Supreme Court in Russia ruled the company must provide the FSB with encryption keys to access users\u2019 messaging data.

While we hoped to find zero leaks, we regretfully found that all of them leak sensitive data.\u201d reads a blog post published by VPNMentor.\n\nThe good news is that once reported the issued to the development teams behind the three VPN solutions, one of them, Hotspot Shield, promptly released a fix to address the issues.  The other vendors still haven\u2019t replied to VPNMentor, for this reason, the website decided the publicly disclose the results of the tests only for Hotspot Shield waiting other for fixing the flaws.\n\nThe vulnerabilities in Hotspot Shield affect the Chrome extension for the solution, meanwhile, the desktop and mobile applications are secure.\n\nThe first vulnerability tracked as CVE-2018-7879, allowed an attacker to hijack a user\u2019s traffic when he is tricked into visiting a malicious site.\n\n\u201cWe observed the following PAC script used in Hotspot Shield Chome extension:\n\n```\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) {\nif(url.indexOf('act=afProxyServerPing') != -1) {\nlet parsed = url.match(/act=afProxyServerPing&server=([^&]+)/);\nif(parsed && parsed[1]) return 'https '+parsed[1]+':443; DIRECT;';\n}\n```\n\nIt detects if the current URL has the query parameter act=afProxyServerPing, and if it does, it routes all traffic to the proxy hostname provided by the server parameter.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat issue seems to be related to internal test code that was not removed, it fails to validate what host is making this \u201ccall\u201d.\n\nAn attacker could craft a link with those parameters in an effort to redirect the traffic to a proxy server controlled by the attackers.\n\nThe IP leak is caused by whitelist used by the extension for \u201cdirect connection\u201d.\n\nThe tests revealed that any domain that includes localhost in the URL bypasses the proxy (for example, localhost.foo.bar.com), such as any URL with type=a1fproxyspeedtest.\n\nTo prove the IP leak the hackers visited the site with the unpatched version of Hotspot Shield.\n\n\n\nFor now, the details about bugs in Zenmate and VPN Shield are being kept under wraps because those vendors haven\u2019t responded to VPN Mentor. Both leaked user IPs.\n\nExperts confirmed that both PureVPN\u2019s and ZenMate\u2019s vulnerabilities could be currently exploited to unmask VPN users.\n\n\u201cIf you are a user of Zenmate or PureVPN, contact the support team and ask for the vulnerabilities to be fixed ASAP\u201d, the post said.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 VPN, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-leak", "topic_name": "data leak"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hotspot-shield", "topic_name": "Hotspot Shield"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vpn", "topic_name": "VPN"}]}, {"news_name": "Study confirms the trade of code-signing certificates is a flourishing business", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70170/digital-id/code-signing-certificates-trade.html", "title": "Study confirms the trade of code-signing certificates is a flourishing business\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 13, 2018", "body": "Code-signing certificates are precious commodities in the dark web, according to a new study conducted by American and Czech researchers and Symantec Labs technical director Christopher Gates their trade is a flourishing business.\n\nThe experts pointed out that the demand for code-signing certificates is increased because vxers have started using them to bypass security solutions such as Microsoft\u2019s Windows Defender SmartScreen.\n\n\u201cWhile prior studies have reported the use of code-signing certificates that had been compromised or obtained directly from legitimate Certification Authorities, we observe that, in 2017, these methods have become secondary to purchasing certificates from underground vendors.\u201d states the research paper published by the experts. \n\n\u201cWe also find that the need to bypass platform protections such as Microsoft Defender SmartScreen plays a growing role in driving the demand for  Authenticode certificates. Together, these findings suggest that the trade in certificates issued for abuse represents an emerging segment of the underground economy.\u201d\n\nThe experts conducted an in-depth analysis of this underground trade, considering vendors, malware developers, and certificate issuers, focusing their investigation on the vendor\u2019s market share and the factors that most of all drive the demand in the market. The experts inspected 28 forums, 6 link directory websites, 4 general marketplaces\nand dozens of websites treating black market goods.\n\nThey identified four leading vendors of code-signing certificates, one of them named Codesigning Guru set up his own e-shop in August 2017. The researchers regularly collected stock information in a 104 day-period and analyzed the sales. The e-shop obtained a new certificate every two days, on average, and collected $16,150 in revenue for selling these certificates. A new codesigning certificate generally trades for a few hundred dollars. Extended Validation (EV) code-signing certificates can also be purchased for a few thousand dollars each, sellers provide the 2FA hardware tokens they are bound to them being shipped by post.\n\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen is a reputation-based system, every time encounters a certificate for the first time, it will raise a warning the user has to click-through during installation.\n\nTo avoid warning being displayed the attackers need a positive reputation for the certificate, this could be obtained by first using it to sign benign programs and installing them on many client machines.\n\nThe price for Extended Validation code-signing certificates is higher because they came with a positive SmartScreen reputation. The prices for EV certificates range from $1,600 up to $7,000 for certificates with the best SmartScreen reputation.\n\n\u201cEV certificates are much more expensive. Earlier posts by vendor C list the price of $1600 while more up-to-date posts by the same vendor C offer EV certificates for $3000. Vendor B sells EV certificates for $2500 (both in the forums and in the Codesigning Guru e-shop).\u201d continues the paper. \n\n\u201cThis high price is probably due to the extensive vetting process and the fact that the 2FA hardware token needs to be send by post to the customer that buys the EV certificate.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also analyzed the publishers noted in the certificates using the beta version of the British public register of companies and the result was suspicious.\n\nThe doubt is that some companies were set up specifically for certificate abuse.\n\n\u201cAll of the publishers were rather young companies, some of them being incorporated around a month before their code-signing certificate was issued and most of those did not have software development as their primary focus.\u201d continues the paper.\n\nResearchers noticed that most of the activity was originated in Russia.\n\n\n\nCertificate Authorities have to vet applicants with care and once a malicious publisher is identified all certificates from that publisher should be revoked.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 code-signing certificates, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/code-signing-certificates", "topic_name": "Code-Signing certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Cryptocurrency mining operations target Windows Server, Redis and Apache Solr servers online", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/70117/malware/cryptocurrency-mining-operations.html", "title": "Cryptocurrency mining operations target Windows Server, Redis and Apache Solr servers online\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 12, 2018", "body": "Last week new mining campaigns targeted unpatched Windows Server, Apache Solr, and Redis servers, attackers attempted to install the cryptocurrency miner Coinminer.\n\nTwo campaigns were spotted by researchers from the ISC SANS group and the Anti-DDoS company Imperva.\n\nThe campaign observed by Imperva has been targeting Redis and Windows Server installs, the company tracked the operation as RedisWannaMine.\n\nCrooks are conducting an Internet mass-scanning for systems running outdated Redis versions, the attackers attempt to trigger the CVE-2017-9805 vulnerability.\n\n\u201cThis week we saw a new generation of cryptojacking attacks aimed at bothdatabase servers and application servers.

Aside, we have followed the steps of its Russian creator and found that his scam has been targeting other scammers themselves.\n\n\n\nBy the end of 2017, CryptoShuffle was a malware sample capable of reading the clipboard and modifying cryptocurrency addresses found there. Later, someone realized that there could be some business on providing these features as a service and started to sell the platform itself calling it \u201cEvrial\u201d. The product was formed by a .NET malware sample capable of stealing passwords from browsers, FTP clients, Pidgin and it could also modify the clipboard on the fly so as to change any copied cryptocurrency address to whatever address he wanted to.\n\nEvrial allows the attacker to control it all from a comfortable panel where the stolen data can be easily explored. When the attacker buys the application, he can set his \u201cname\u201d for logging into the panel which will be hardcoded in the code, so that the shipped Evrial version is unique for him.\n\nWhen you want to make a Bitcoin transfer, you usually copy and paste the destination address. In this sense, the attacker waits until the user, trusting in the clipboard action, sends a new transaction to the copied cryptocurrency address, without knowing that the recipient\u2019s address has been silently modified to one that belongs to the attacker. The malware performs this task in the background for different types of address including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Monero addresses as well as for Steam identifiers and Webmoney WMR and WMZ units.\n\n\n\nThe author exposes his username in Telegram: @Qutrachka. The account is in the source code in order to be able to contact him. Using this information and some other analysed samples, it has been possible to identify users in different deep web forums under the name Qutra whose main objective: sell this malicious software. There are also evidences that CryptoSuffer malware was linked to the same threat actor after identifying a publication in Pastebin explaining the functionalities of this family and published under the same user.\n\nWe are able to guess how much it is in every wallet. He has received a total of 21 transactions into the Bitcoin wallet, supposedly from his victims, collecting approximately 0.122 BTC. If ransomware wallets usually receive the same amount from its victims, here the range is wider because the legitimate payments that the victim wants to do are, of course, of different amounts.\n\n\n\nThe attacker has moved all the money to several addresses to try to blur the trail of his payments. The attacker has received 0.0131 Litecoins as well, but this amount is still available in his wallet. On the other hand, it has not been possible to track any payments related to his Monero account because of how this technology works so as to hide the information of which parties have been involved in each operation. At the same time, we could not find out any additional information linked to his various Webmoney accounts (WMR and WMZ).  Anyway, what is clear is that this type of malicious behavior is technically viable while it is being used in the wild.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nInnovation and laboratory Area at ElevenPaths\n\ninnovationlab@11paths.com\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Evrial , cryptocoin malwarehackers)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptocurrency-malware", "topic_name": "cryptocurrency malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/evrial", "topic_name": "Evrial"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Counterfeit Code-Signing certificates even more popular, but still too expensive", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69457/cyber-crime/code-signing-certificates-2.html", "title": "Counterfeit Code-Signing certificates even more popular, but still too expensive\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 25, 2018", "body": "Other precious commodities in the criminal underground are code-signing certificates, they allow vxers to sign the code for malware to evade detection. Operators of the major black markets in the darknets buy and sell code-signing certificates, but according to an interesting research conducted by threat intelligence firm Recorded Future, the prices for them are too expensive for most hackers.\n\nCybercriminals would use the Dark Web for selling high-grade code certificates -which they have obtained from trusted certificate authorities- to anyone that is interested in purchasing them.\n\nSales of code signing certificates have increased considerably since 2015 when experts from IBM X-Force researchers provided some best practice guides on checking for trusted certificates.\n\nDigital certificates allow companies to trust the source code of a software and to check its integrity, The certificates are issued by the certificate authorities (CAs) and are granted to companies that generate code, protocols or software so they can sign their code and indicate its legitimacy and originality.\n\nUsing signing certificates is similar to the hologram seal used on software packages, assuring they are genuine and issued from a trusted publisher. Users would receive alerts in an attempt to install files that are not accompanied by a valid certificate. This is why cybercriminals aim to use certificates for legitimizing the malware code they make.\n\nAccording to Andrei Barysevich, Director of Advanced Collection at Recorded Future, most of the code-signing certificates are obtained by hackers due to fraud and not from security breaches suffered by the CAs.\n\n\u201cRecorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group investigated the criminal underground and identified vendors currently offering both code signing certificates and domain name registration with accompanying SSL certificates.\u201d states the report published by Recorded Future.\n\n\u201cContrary to a common belief that the security certificates circulating in the criminal underground are stolen from legitimate owners prior to being used in nefarious campaigns, we confirmed with a high degree of certainty that the certificates are created for a specific buyer per request only and are registered using stolen corporate identities, making traditional network security appliances less effective.\u201d\n\nCybercriminals offer the precious commodity via online shops, when buyers place an order the shop\u2019s operators used stolen identities from a legitimate company and its employees to request the certificate for a fake app or website to the CAs (i.e. Comodo, Thawte, and Symantec).  The certificates are used to encrypt HTTPS traffic or sign apps.\n\nRecorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group investigated the criminal ecosystem and identified vendors currently offering both code signing certificates and domain name registration with accompanying SSL certificates.\n\nThe researchers identified four well-known vendors operating since 2011, only two vendors are currently still active in Russian-speaking crime forums.\n\n\u201cOne of the first vendors to offer counterfeit code signing certificates was known as C@T, a member of a prolific hacking messaging board.\u201d continues the report. \u201cIn March 2015, C@T offered for sale a Microsoft Authenticode capable of signing 32/64b versions of various executable files, as well as Microsoft Office, Microsoft VBA, Netscape Object Signing, and Marimba Channel Signing documents, and supported Silverlight 4 applications.

The company has about 500 million users globally.\n\nVPN services providers are used nowadays to protect the identity of individual users and against the eavesdropping of their browsing habits. In countries like North Korea and China they are popular among political activists or dissidents where internet access is restricted because of censorship or heavily monitored once these services hide the IP addresses of the real users, that can be used to locate the person real address.\n\nThe Great Firewall of China is an example. Locating a Hotspot Shield user in a rogue country could pose a risk to their life and their families.\n\nThe VPN Hotspot Shield developed by AnchorFree to secure the connection of users and protect their privacy contained flaws that allow sensitive information disclosure such as the country, the name of WIFI network connection and the user\u2019s real IP address, according to the researcher.\n\n\u201cBy disclosing information such as Wi-Fi name, an attacker can easily narrow down or pinpoint where the victim is located, you can narrow down a list of places where your victim is located\u201d. states Paulos Yibelo.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2018-6460 was published without a response from the company on Monday, but on Wednesday a patch was released to address the issue. The vulnerability is present on the local web server (127.0.0.1 on port 895) that Hotspot Shield installs on the user\u2019s machine.\n\n\u201chttp://localhost:895/status.js generates a sensitive JSON response that reveals whether the user is connected to VPN, to which VPN he/she is connected to what and what their real IP address is & other system juicy information. There are other multiple endpoints that return sensitive data including configuration details.\u201d continues the researcher. \n\n\u201cWhile that endpoint is presented without any authorization, status.js is actually a JSON endpoint so there are no sensitive functions to override, but when we send the parameter func with $_APPLOG.Rfunc, it returns that function as a JSONP name. We can obviously override this in our malicious page and steal its contents by supplying a tm parameter timestamp, that way we can provide a logtime\u201c.\n\nOnce running, the server hosts multiple JSONP endpoints, with no authentication requests and also with responses that leak sensitive information pertaining the VPN service, such as the configuration details. The researcher released a proof of concept (PoC) for the flaw, however, the reporter Zack Whittaker, from ZDNET, independently verified that flaw revealed only the Wi-Fi network name and the country, not the real IP address.\n\nThe company replied to the researcher allegation:\n\n\u201cWe have found that this vulnerability does not leak the user\u2019s real IP address or any personal information, but may expose some generic information such as the user\u2019s country. We are committed to the safety and security of our users, and will provide an update this week that will completely remove the component capable of leaking even generic information\u201d. \n\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://threatpost.com/hotspot-shield-vulnerability-could-reveal-juicy-info-about-users-researcher-claims/129817/\n\nhttps://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/02/07/hotspot-shield-vpn-flaw/\n\nhttps://irishinfosecnews.wordpress.com/2018/02/07/hotspot-shield-vulnerability-could-reveal-juicy-info-about-users-researcher-claims/\n\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/privacy-flaw-in-hotspot-shield-can-identify-users-locations/\n\nhttp://www.ubergizmo.com/2018/02/security-flaw-hotspot-shield-vpn-expose-users/\n\nhttps://betanews.com/2018/02/07/hotspot-shield-vpn-flaw/\n\nhttps://thehackernews.com/2018/02/hotspot-shield-vpn-service.html\n\nhttp://www.securitynewspaper.com/2018/02/07/flaw-hotspot-shield-can-expose-vpn-users-locations/\n\nhttp://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Feb/11\n\nhttps://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3604\n\nhttp://www.paulosyibelo.com/2018/02/hotspot-shield-cve-2018-6460-sensitive.html\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and an enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

Each of these major players is trying to find more about us. They even go to our friends, family and job network.\n\nThe big guns know when you are sad, happy, as well as your general internet spendings and many more.\n\nTechnology is changing so dramatically and has the power to find every bit of information about you. A perfect example of this is the Google Home Assistant or the new self-driving cars that shockingly knows where you want to go, or where\u2019s your home.\n\nIn quick succession, step by step these big guys are creating probably the most invasive surveillance population in time.\n\nIt is quite worrisome how a group of known criminals hack them pretty often. Take Uber as an example; the ride-sharing firm is accused of getting hacked for multiple times \u2013 not just once or twice.\n\nCalifornians, the world, and privacy\n\nFrom all of this, you might think Californians are often talking about the privacy policy not only in most private sector, where is believed that law is more occasionally meeting with people.\n\nBut they actually talk in the private sector, where they have the protection of the 4th Amendment if they encounter problems as \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches.\n\nI wish to have a talk at a coffee or a dinner with a tech investor and to ask him \u201cWhat is your company doing with all the information?\u201d For the moment, there is no possibility of a confrontation at this.\n\nEven if California, for the USA, is the center of everything. As for technology, investors, the most brilliant minds, residents and elected officials are the targeted ones when it comes to the privacy policy. And, for sure, as in everything, there are exceptions.\n\nI would love to see in the next US elections to prioritize this issue, or it can be an impactful subject in a ballot initiative.\n\nUnfortunately, not so many exceptions for tech employees to feel human again. However, the one pushing is the employer, who digs deep into the privacy and enjoys it.\n\n\n\nThe idea to do good is far to be reached\n\nAs I stated above, California might encounter the most impactful debate regarding privacy in the whole world in coming future. Do you consider letting companies keep user data forever? To move in a way and change the terms of service, so they breach privacy?\n\nShould they share information with governments? Would there be an option purge information after a while or to just request to anonymize? It\u2019s an option for only a company to sell information and meanwhile, they discharge the debt in bankruptcy?\n\nWhat obligation parents have regarding their children\u2019s privacy? It is awkward how Instagram tracks kids\u2019 behavior before reaching the age of consent. Should Instagram keep that information until they are adults?\n\nA very out of date law from California gives us a glimpse of how out of date they are: prohibiting someone to record a phone call without the consent of the other party.\n\nFor sure it is not a bad law, however, restricts everyone just for the idea of privacy. Sadly, this rule is not applied since data is gathered without shame. We can imagine revenging porn laws that protect us from unauthorized shops from centerfolds.\n\nAll in all, we exposed ourselves to comprehensive, intrusive, relentless surveillance at our daily activities.\n\nJohn Naughton an Irish academic affirmed, \u201cand we have no idea what the long-term implications of this (surveillance) will be.\u201d\n\nSome end thoughts\n\nSome of this is the threat when others are scared by the idea of imposed limits. Yet, people value privacy and having it updated can mean a better future. For sure it is impossible to stop privacy threats sometimes.\n\nBut in exchange shouldn\u2019t we prioritize and make things better? Californians have a high position here, more than anyone, yet they haven\u2019t made a bit of effort.\n\nAnd of course, not just the ones living in California \u2013 we all, no one, should keep their voice low against the surveillance.

According to security researchers at CrowdStrike, the malicious code is very sophisticated, it implements a spreading mechanism and persistence model similar to those used by state-sponsored APT groups.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike has recently seen several cases where mining has impacted business operations, rendering some companies unable to operate for days and weeks at a time. The tools have caused systems and applications to crash due to such high CPU utilization speeds.\u201d reads the analysis published by CrowdStrike. \n\n\u201cCrowdStrike has observed more sophisticated capabilities built into a cryptomining worm dubbed WannaMine. This tool leverages persistence mechanisms and propagation techniques similar to those used by nation-state actors, demonstrating a trend highlighted in the recent CrowdStrike Cyber Intrusion Services Casebook 2017, which states that \u201ccontemporary attacks continue to blur the lines between nation-state and eCrime tactics.\u201d\n\nWannaMine is a fileless that was first reported by researchers at Panda Security.\n\n\n\nThe malicious code implements so-called \u201cliving off the land\u201d techniques to gain persistence on the infected system leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) permanent event subscriptions. WannaMine registers a permanent event subscription that would execute every 90 minutes a PowerShell command located in the Event Consumer.\n\nExperts noticed that the malware uses credential harvester Mimikatz to collect users\u2019 credentials that could be used for lateral movements. It also relies on the EternalBlue exploit in case it is not able to move laterally with the above technique.\n\nWannaMine is able to infect systems running all Windows versions starting with Windows 2000, including 64-bit versions and Windows Server 2003.\n\n\u201cWhile the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) displayed in WannaMine did not require a high degree of sophistication, the attack clearly stands on the shoulders of more innovative and enterprising nation-state and eCrime threat actors.

Recently, Proofpoint researchers have been tracking the massive Smominru botnet, the combined computing power of which had earned millions of dollars for its operators.\u201d states the analysis published by Proofpoint\n\nWith the help of Abuse.CH and the ShadowServer Foundation, Proofpoint conducted a sinkholing operation that allowed to profile the botnet.\n\nThe command and control infrastructure of the Smominru botnet is hosted on DDoS protection service SharkTech, Proofpoint promptly notified the abuse to the service provider without receiving any response.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the Smominru botnet has been active at least since May 2017 and has already infected more than 526,000 Windows computers.\n\n\u201cBased on the hash power associated with the Monero payment address for this operation, it appeared that this botnet was likely twice the size of Adylkuzz,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThe operators had already mined approximately 8,900 Monero (valued this week between $2.8M and $3.6M). Each day, the botnet mined roughly 24 Monero, worth an average of $8,500 this week (Figure 2).\u201d\n\n\n\nThe researchers at Proofpoint discovered that crooks are using at least 25 hosts to scan the Internet for EternalBlue vulnerable Windows computers and also leveraging the NSA EsteemAudit (CVE-2017-0176) for compromising the target machines.\n\nThe machines all appear to sit behind the network autonomous system AS63199, further technical details and the IoCs are included in the analysis published by Proofpoint.\n\n\u201cBecause most of the nodes in this botnet appear to be Windows servers, the performance impact on potentially critical business infrastructure may be high, as can the cost of increased energy usage by servers running much closer to capacity. The operators of this botnet are persistent, use all available exploits to expand their botnet, and have found multiple ways to recover after sinkhole operations.\u201d concluded the Proofpoint.\n\n\u201cGiven the significant profits available to the botnet operators and the resilience of the botnet and its infrastructure, we expect these activities to continue, along with their potential impacts on infected nodes.

Experts believe the activity involved around 30 million systems worldwide to mine the Monero cryptocurrency using the open-source XMRig utility.\n\nThe threat actors used VBS files and URL shortening services to deploy the mining tool, the most commonly hit countries are Thailand (3,545,437), Vietnam (1,830,065), and Turkey (665,058).\n\n\u201cPalo Alto Networks Unit 42 has observed a large-scale cryptocurrency mining operation that has been active for over 4 months. The operation attempts to mine the Monero cryptocurrency using the open-source XMRig utility,\u201d states PaloAlto networks.\n\n\u201cBased on publicly available telemetry data via bitly, we are able to estimate that the number of victims affected by this operation is roughly around 15 million people worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe analysis of data from the Bit.ly URL shortening service revealed that at least 15 million people were impacted by the campaign.\n\nHackers also used the Adf.ly URL shortening service that remunerates users when someone clicks on the link.  When users clicked on these Adf.ly URLs, they were redirected and found themselves downloading the crypto-currency mining malware instead.\n\nThe Monero cryptocurrency mining operation is huge, researchers detected over 250 unique Microsoft Windows PE files, most of them were downloaded from online cloud storage provider 4sync.\n\nThe files have generic names and appear to originate from popular looking file-sharing services.\n\nThe miner used in this Monero cryptocurrency mining operation execute XMRig mining software via VBS files, and leverages XMRig proxy services to hide the ultimate mining pool destination.\n\nResearchers also noticed that threat actors use the Nicehash marketplace to trade hashing processing power.\n\nAccording to the experts from PaloAlto the date October 20, 2017, was a milestone in this operation. Before October 20, 2017, the attackers were using the Windows built-in BITSAdmin tool to download the XMRig mining tool from a remote location. Apart from a few exceptions, the final payload was primarily installed with the filename \u2018msvc.exe\u2019.\n\n\n\nAfter October 20, 2017, the experts observed attackers started using HTTP redirection services.\n\n\n\nSince November 16, 2017, threat actors stopped using the SFX files and adopted executables compiled in Microsoft .NET Framework.\n\n\u201cBeginning on November 16, 2017, the attackers yet again changed tactics regarding their malware. They no longer made use of SFX files, but instead transitioned to using an executable file compiled in Microsoft .NET Framework that would write a VBS file to disk and modify the victim\u2019s Run registry key to ensure persistence.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe last changes we\u2019ve seen took place in late December 2017, when the attackers yet again changed the dropper that was used to deploy the malware. Moving away from .NET, they instead create the necessary VBS file using a dropper compiled with Borland Delphi. Unlike the .NET droppers, this particular dropper will place the VBS file in the victim\u2019s startup folder in order to obtain persistence. Otherwise, the flow of execution remains the same.\u201d\n\nThe last samples that were using this dropper referenced a new IP address for XMRig communication( 5.23[.]48[.]207).\n\n\u201cMonero mining campaigns are certainly not a new development, as there have been various reported instances recently. However, it is less common to observe such a large-scale campaign go relatively unnoticed for such a long period of time. \u201d concluded Palo Alto.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Monero mining operation, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/miner", "topic_name": "miner"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mining", "topic_name": "mining"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monero-mining-campaigns", "topic_name": "Monero mining campaigns"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "A look into the cyber arsenal used by Lazarus APT hackers in recent attacks against financial institutions", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68221/apt/lazarus-apt-arsenal.html", "title": "A look into the cyber arsenal used by Lazarus APT hackers in recent attacks against financial institutions\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 25, 2018", "body": "Security experts at Trend Micro have analyzed the attacks conducted by the notorious Lazarus APT group against financial institutions.\n\nThe activity of the Lazarus Group surged in 2014 and 2015, its members used mostly custom-tailored malware in their attacks and experts that investigated on the crew consider it highly sophisticated.\n\nThis threat actor has been active since at least 2009, possibly as early as 2007, and it was involved in both cyber espionage campaigns and sabotage activities aimed to destroy data and disrupt systems.  Security researchers discovered that North Korean Lazarus APT group was behind attacks on banks, including the Bangladesh cyber heist.\n\nIn the last campaigns against financial firms, the cyber spies launched watering hole attacks and leveraged a variant of the Lazarus-linked RATANKBA Trojan.\n\n\u201cThe malware known as RATANKBA is just one of the weapons in Lazarus\u2019 arsenal. This malicious software, which could have been active since late 2016, was used in a recent campaign targeting financial institutions using watering hole attacks. The variant used during these attacks (TROJ_RATANKBA.A) delivered multiple payloads that include hacking tools and software targeting banking systems.\u201d reads the analysis published by Trend Micro.\n\n\u201cWe analyzed a new RATANKBA variant (BKDR_RATANKBA.ZAEL\u2013A), discovered in June 2017, that uses a PowerShell script instead of its more traditional PE executable form\u2014a version that other researchers also recently identified.\u201c\n\nThe researchers identified and hacked in some servers used by the cyber spies for temporarily storing stolen data, the analysis of the backend revealed that around 55% of the victims were located in India and neighboring countries.\n\nThe majority of the victims were not using enterprise versions of Microsoft software, less than 5% of the victims were Microsoft Windows Enterprise users.\n\nThe IP addresses of the victims don\u2019t belong to a large bank or a financial institution, according to Trend Micro victims are likely employees of three web software development companies in India and one in South Korea.\n\nThe RATANKBA Trojan is delivered via weaponized Office documents (containing topics related to cryptocurrencies and software development), CHM files, and script downloaders.\n\nExperts noticed that attackers don\u2019t implement a real-time communication with the malware. Once compromised a target machine, the attackers will use a Remote Controller tool to send jobs to the system, the queue of jobs is then processed by RATANKBA.\n\n\u201cDuring our analysis, we collected a copy of the RATANKBA malware\u2019s Lazarus Remote Controller tool. The remote controller provides a user interface that allows attackers to send jobs to any compromised endpoint. The controller gives the attackers the ability to manipulate the victims\u2019 host by queueing tasks on the main server. RATANKBA retrieves and executes the tasks, and retrieves the collected information.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe controller tools used by the Lazarus APT implements a graphical UI interface that allows hackers to push code to the server and download victim profiles from it.\n\n\n\nTrend Micro also provided a profile of the members of the Lazarus APT group, the hackers appear to be native Korean speakers and at least one of them is believed to also understand Chinese.\n\n\u201cGiven Lazarus\u2019 use of a wide array of tools and techniques in their operations, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the group will continue to use ever-evolving tactics in their malicious activities.\u201d concluded Trend Micro.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lazarus APT Group,

Civil rights and privacy advocates consider it as unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe bill increases spying powers of intelligence agencies and block safeguards, curiously it was passed by Republicans who always criticized the corruption of the Government.\n\n\u201cThere is a glimmer of light,\u201d \u201cThe last few weeks have demonstrated that bipartisan efforts to reform our surveillance laws continue on an arc of progress.\u201d wrote ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani in a blog post.\n\n\u201cWith only two more votes, reformers could have halted this bill from advancing and forced a floor debate over badly needed improvements. And an effort to pass the most comprehensive Section 702 reform bill introduced in Congress garnered the support of over 180 members in the House. With actual debate, real reform provisions likely would have passed.\u201d\n\nJust hours before the section 702 program was signed by the President, the Senate\u2019s intelligence committee approved the release of a confidential four-page memo alleging previous abuse of the FISA spying program to the rest of Congress.\n\n\u201cScores of Republicans have since viewed the document in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility on Capitol Hill. They left expressing shock, saying the special counsel investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign officials had improper contacts with Russia is based on politically motivated actions at the highest level of law enforcement.\u201d reported The Hill.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) called the memo \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cI\u2019m here to tell all of a America tonight that I\u2019m shocked to read exactly what has taken place,\u201d Meadows (R-N.C.) said in a speech on the House floor. \n\n\u201cI thought it could never happen in a country that loves freedom and democracy like this country. It is time that we become transparent with all of this, and I\u2019m calling on our leadership to make this available so all Americans can judge for themselves.\u201d\n\nPoliticians opposing the section 702 program are defining its contents \u201cworse than Watergate.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, this is a black page in the history of Americans. The 6-year extension of the regulation that allows the US government to monitor foreigners\u2019 communications abroad without a warrant has been approved. Moreover, the US  intelligence will also be able to spy on American citizens, politicians, businessmen, and journalists who communicate with them, despite the Fourth Amendment.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NSA surveillance, Section 702- FISA)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fisa", "topic_name": "FISA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa-surveillance", "topic_name": "NSA surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/prism", "topic_name": "PRISM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/section-702", "topic_name": "Section 702"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Blackwallet hacked, hackers stole $400,000 from users\u2019 accounts through DNS hijacking", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67753/cyber-crime/blackwallet-hacked-dns-hijacking.html", "title": "Blackwallet hacked, hackers stole $400,000 from users\u2019 accounts through DNS hijacking\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 15, 2018", "body": "The spike in cryptocurrency values is attracting cybercriminals, the last victim is the BlackWallet.co a web-based wallet application for the Stellar Lumen cryptocurrency (XLM).\n\nThe platform was victims of a DNS hijacking attack, on January 13 the attackers have stolen over $400,000 from users\u2019 accounts (roughly 670,000 Lumens).\n\nAccording to Bleeping Computer, the attackers collected 669,920 Lumens, which is about $400,192 at the current XML/USD exchange rate.\n\nStellar Lumen today is considered as the eight most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nThe attackers hijacked the DNS entry of the BlackWallet.co domain and redirected it to a server they operated, as result of the attack, the application suspended its service.\n\nTechnically users were logging to the bogus domain entering their credentials, then the attackers used them to access the account and steal the funds.\n\nBlackwallet (web wallet) has apparently been hacked pic.twitter.com/HhewwBXnD9\n\n\u2014 Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) January 14, 2018\n\n\n\nThe DNS hijack of Blackwallet injected code, if you had over 20 Lumens it pushes them to a different wallet. pic.twitter.com/Eiwb8UR1Nn\n\n\u2014 Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) January 14, 2018\n\n\n\n \n\nWell I know now why XLM is dipping\n\nBlackwallet got hacked and the worst part was that I laughed my ass off when reading the reddit\u2026their misery is my gain and for a moment, I felt nothing but joy.\n\nOkay maybe there's something wrong with me.\n\n\u2014 Colton Miles (@Omgflamethrower) January 14, 2018\n\n\n\nUsers on Reddit and other communities promptly spread the news of the hack.\n\nThe attackers immediately started moving funds from the XLM account to Bittrex, a cryptocurrency exchange, in the attempt to launder them by converting in other digital currency.\n\n\n\nThe situation is critical, admins are asking Bittrex to block the attackers\u2019 operations before is too late.\n\n\u201cI am the creator of Blackwallet.

No matter.\n\nIn the past months, security experts have collected evidence that links the Russian Government to massive propaganda operations through social networks aimed to influence the sentiment of Americans on the 2016 Presidential elections.\n\nI was analyzing requests for the submissions of White Papers for INSCOM (U.S. Army Intelligence & Security Command) Technology when I noticed a number of very interesting requests for a \u201cContent Translation of PAI,\u201d \u201cAutomated Sentiment Analysis (SA),\u201d and \u201cContent Generation Based off of PAI\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s give a look at the requirements for each requets:\n\n0001: Content Translation of PAI\n\nA. Capability to translate foreign language content (message text, voice, images, etc.) from the social media environment into English. Required languages are Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean.\n\nB. Identify specific audiences through reading and understanding of colloquial phrasing, spelling variations, social media brevity codes, and emojis.\n\n1. Automated capability for machine learning of foreign language content with accuracy comparable to Google and Microsoft Bing Translate. Must be able to incrementally improve over time.\n\n2. Recognize language dialect to ensure effectual communication.\n\n0002: Automated Sentiment Analysis (SA)\n\nA. Capability to derive sentiment from all social media content.\n\n1. At minimum, distinguish negative, neutral, and positive sentiment based on collective, contextual understanding of the specific audience.\n\na) Capability to determine anger, pleasure, sadness, and excitement.\n\n2. Capability to recognize local colloquial and/or slang terms and phrases, spelling variations, social media brevity codes, capitalization, and emojis will be included.\n\n3. Automated machine learning of SA must be able to incrementally improve over time.\n\na) Software should allow for heuristic updates to improve overall capability; e.g., manually suggest updates based on personal knowledge and experience.\n\nB. Capability to suggest whether specific audiences could be influenced based on derived sentiment.\n\n0003: Content Generation Based off of PAI\n\nA. Capability to translate English into Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean.\n\nB. Automated capability to generate/create at least three, and up to 10, unique statements derived from one (1) original social media statement, while retaining the meaning and tone of the original.\n\n1. Customize language in a dialect consistent with a specific audience including spelling variations, cultural variations, colloquial phrasing, and social media brevity codes and emojis.\n\n\n\nWell, considering that the INSCOM executes mission command of operational intelligence and security forces, this software could be used for both monitoring social media (with a specific focus on Arabic, French, Pashtu, Farsi, Urdu, Russian, and Korean contents).\n\nThe requirements specifically address the need to create a system to influence the public sentiment on specific topics (i.e. Capability to determine anger, pleasure, sadness, and excitement.)\n\nI have released this interview to explain my point of view on such kind of software:\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the need for such software?\n\nSuch kind of software could be used for social media monitoring. Not only, in this specific case, the project aims to build a machine learning system that is able to identify and influence the sentiment of a specific audience. No doubt, it is software that could be used in PSYchological OPerations (PSYOPs).\n\nWould such software be a threat, or would it be just for snooping?\n\nThis kind of software could be used also to influence the sentiment on specific topics. This software represents a serious threat to the privacy of citizens, but the most disconcerting aspect is that IA based system could be involved in operations to destabilize a political context. Social media are a powerful instrument to make propaganda and to promote mass demonstration, we have all in mind what has happened in the case of the Arab Spring.\n\nThe United States Army Intelligence and Security Command \u2013 collects intelligence for combat operations\u2026 so how would this new software be useful?\n\nIt is an essential software for any Army and Command and Intelligence agency involved in intelligence mission. These systems are essential to gather information from social media and represent a privileged tool for SOCMINT, Social media intelligence.\n\nSOCMINT could be used for several purposes, not only cyber-espionage but also for counterterrorism operations.\n\nClearly, the most disconcerting use is related to the influence of public sentiment on specific topics.\n\nThe U.S. has continually accused Russia of using bots and troll factories to influence U.S. social media\u2026 isn\u2019t this an attempt to do the same. What\u2019s your take on that?\n\nI believe that almost any government is involved in social media monitoring, many states use social media as a military weapon. The answer is that the risk is concrete, but at the moment we have no evidence of this. The software could be used also as a defense mechanism against PSYOPs conducted by foreign goverments through social media.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  US Army,  PSYOPS)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Never too late, Skype supports end-to-end encryption for new Private Conversations feature", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67654/security/skype-end-to-end-encryption.html", "title": "Never too late, Skype supports end-to-end encryption for new Private Conversations feature\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 12, 2018", "body": "The latest version of Skype implements end-to-end encryption and introduces the support for the Signal protocol. which is the protocol used by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Allo, and Signal.\n\nAttackers will not able to snoop on Skype Private Conversations will support text, audio calls, and file transfers, thanks to the introduction of the end-to-end encryption.\n\n\u201cWe know extra protection is important as you share sensitive information over Skype so we\u2019re excited to announce the preview of end-to-end encrypted Private Conversations, available now for Skype Insiders.\u201d states the announcement published by Microsoft.\n\n\u201cWith Private Conversations, you can have end-to-end encrypted Skype audio calls and send text messages or files like images, audio, or videos, using the industry standard Signal Protocol by Open Whisper Systems.

Very interesting the analysis proposed by Bleepingcomputer.com that reported the discovery made by the researcher Dimitrios Slamaris.\n\nThe security expert reported Internet wide Ethereum JSON-RPC scans.\n\nThe expert caught a JSON RPC call in his honeypot, someone was making requests to the JSON-RPC interface of Ethereum nodes that should be only exposed locally.\n\nThe access to the interface does implement any authentication mechanism and wallet apps installed on the PC can send command to the Ethereum client to manage funds. If the interface is exposed inline, attackers can send requests to this JSON-RPC interface and issue commands to move funds to an attacker\u2019s wallet.\n\nEarly November, Slamaris uncovered another massive scan that allowed the attacker to steal 8 Ethers (about $3,200 at current exchange).\n\nA user going by the name of \u201cjsmad\u201d noticed that the Electrum wallet app was also exposing a similar JSON RPC online.\n\n\u201cThe JSONRPC interface is currently completely unprotected, I believe it should be a priority to add at least some form of password protection.\u201d wrote the user.\n\n\u201cScans for the JSONRPC interface of Ethereum wallets have already started:\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/theres-some-intense-web-scans-going-on-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-wallets/\u201c\n\nThe knowledge of the Electrum password allowed attackers to interact through the JSON RPC interface with the wallers.\n\nThe Electrum developers were criticized by the claim of the popular Google white hat hacker Tavis Ormandy who contacted the company.\n\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m not a bitcoin user, a colleague pointed me at this bug report because localhost RPC servers drive me crazy \ud83d\ude1b.\u201d wrote Ormandy.\n\n\u201cI installed Electrum to look, and I\u2019m confused why this isn\u2019t being treated as a critical and urgent vulnerability? If this bug wasn\u2019t already open for months, I would have reported this as a vulnerability, but maybe I misunderstand something.\n\nThe JSON RPC server is enabled by default, it does use a random port but a website can simply scan for the right port in seconds.\n\nI made you a demo. It\u2019s very basic, but you get the idea. If you did set a password, some misdirection is required, but it\u2019s still game over, no?\n\nHere is how I reproduced:\n\n(Note: i dont use bitcoin, you can steal my empty wallet if you like)\u201d\n\nIn a real attack scenario, hackers could trick Electrum users into accessing a malicious website that could scan for the Electrum\u2019s random JSON RPC port and empty the wallet by issuing commands.\n\n\n\nBelow a video of such kind of attack shared by a Twitter user.\n\nUpdate your #electrum wallets.

The gathered data allow them to target advertising across different browsers and devices.\n\n\n\nOf course, the same flaw could be exploited by threat actors to steal saved login credential from browsers without requiring users interaction.\nEvery browser (i.e. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera) implements a built-in password manager tool that allows users to save login information for automatic form-filling.\n\nThe researchers from Princeton\u2019s Center for Information Technology Policy discovered that both AdThink and OnAudience are exploiting the built-in password managers to track visitors of around 1,110 of the Alexa top 1 million sites across the Internet.\n\n\u201cWe found two scripts using this technique to extract email addresses from login managers on the websites which embed them. These addresses are then hashed and sent to one or more third-party servers. These scripts were present on 1110 of the Alexa top 1 million sites.\u201d states the analysis of  the Princeton\u2019s Center for Information Technology Policy.\n\nThe experts have found third-party tracking scripts on these websites that inject invisible login forms in the background of the webpage, the password managers are tricked into auto-filling the form using these data.\n\nThe scripts detect the username and send it to third-party servers after hashing with MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 algorithms, these hashed values are used as an identifier for a specific user. Typically tracker used the hashed email as user\u2019s ID.\n\n\u201cLogin form autofilling in general doesn\u2019t require user interaction; all of the major browsers will autofill the username (often an email address) immediately, regardless of the visibility of the form.\u201d continue the researchers.\n\n\u201cChrome doesn\u2019t autofill the password field until the user clicks or touches anywhere on the page. Other browsers we tested don\u2019t require user interaction to autofill password fields.\u201d\n\n\n\nThird-party password managers like LastPass and 1Password are not exposed to this tracking technique because they avoid auto-filling invisible forms and anyway they require user interaction.\n\nUsers can test the tracking technique using a live demo page created by the researchers.\n\nBelow

Virtual currencies have a crucial role in facilitating illicit commerce, it is normal that their fluctuation could have a significant impact on the criminal ecosystem. The recent spike in the price of Bitcoin and the fees associated with each transaction are making Bitcoin a less useful payment method in the cybercrime underground.\n\nOriginally, one of the points of strength for Bitcoin was that payments would be fast, cheap, and convenient. This was true until the beginning of this year when Bitcoin fees were often less than $0.10.\n\n\n\nThe spike in the Bitcoin value and related fees per transaction has made Bitcoin far less attractive for conducting small-dollar transactions that represent the vast majority of payments in the criminal underground.\n\n\u201cAs a result, several major underground markets that traffic in stolen digital goods are now urging customers to deposit funds in alternative virtual currencies, such as Litecoin. Those who continue to pay for these commodities in Bitcoin not only face far higher fees, but also are held to higher minimum deposit amounts.\u201d wrote the popular investigator and security blogger Brian Krebs.\n\nKrebs cited as an example the case of the black marketplace \u201cCarder\u2019s Paradise\u201d that he recently analyzed, well its administrators admitted difficulties due to the spike in the value of Bitcoin.\n\nKrebs explained that the current minimum deposit amount on Carder\u2019s Paradise is 0.0066 BTCs (roughly USD $100). The deposit fee for each transaction is $15.14, this means that every time a user of the black market deposits the minimum amount into this shop is losing approximately 15 percent his deposit in transaction fees.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we send all your deposited funds to our suppliers which attracts an additional Bitcoin transaction fee (the same fee you pay when you make a deposit),\u201d Carder\u2019s Paradise explains. \u201cSometimes we have to pay as much as 5$ from every 1$ you deposited.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to take additionally a \u2018Deposit fee\u2019 from all users who deposit in Bitcoins. This is the amount we spent on transferring your funds to our suppliers. To compensate your costs, we are going to reduce our prices, including credit cards for all users and offer you the better bitcoin exchange rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe amount of the Deposit Fee depends on the load on the Bitcoin network. However, it stays the same regardless of the amount deposited. Deposits of 10$ and 1000$ attract the same deposit fee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Bitcoin price continues increasing, this business is not going to be profitable for us anymore because all our revenue is going to be spent on the Bitcoin fees. We are no longer in possession of additional funds to improve the store.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge you to start using Litecoin as much as possible. Litecoin is a very fast and cheap way of depositing funds into the store. We are not going to charge any additional fees if you deposit Litecoins.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the Carder\u2019s Paradise, the huge volume of transactions allowed the administrators to lower the price of stolen credit cards to compensate the increase of the transaction fees, but it is an exceptional scenario.\n\n\u201cOur team made a decision to adjust the previous announcement and provide a fair solution for everyone by reducing the credit cards [sic] prices,\u201d the message concludes.\n\nTransaction fees are too high and operators of black marketplaces could be forced to refuse payments in Bitcoin.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Bitcoin price, criminal underground)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin-price", "topic_name": "Bitcoin price"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-marketplace", "topic_name": "Black marketplace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/criminal-underground", "topic_name": "criminal underground"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}]}, {"news_name": "Three fake Bitcoin wallet apps were removed from the official Google Play", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67123/malware/fake-bitcoin-wallet-apps.html", "title": "Three fake Bitcoin wallet apps were removed from the official Google Play\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 26, 2017", "body": "Experts from mobile security firm Lookout have discovered three fake Bitcoin wallet apps in the official Play store.

Windows 10 facial recognition security feature dubbed Hello can be spoofed in the simplest way, using a photo of an authorized user.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft face authentication in Windows 10 is an enterprise-grade identity verification mechanism that\u2019s integrated into the Windows Biometric Framework (WBF) as a core Microsoft Windows component called Windows Hello. Windows Hello face authentication utilizes a camera specially configured for near infrared (IR) imaging to authenticate and unlock Windows devices as well as unlock your Microsoft Passport.\u201d\n\nThe bad news for the users is that even if they have installed the fixed versions shipped in October (builds 1703 or 1709) the technique is effective. In this scenario, users need to set up the facial recognition from scratch to make it resistant to the attack.\n\n\u201cDue to an insecure implementation of the biometric face recognition in some Windows 10 versions, it is possible to bypass the Windows Hello face authentication via a simple spoofing attack using a modified printed photo of an authorized person.\u201d states the security advisory published on Full Disclosure.\n\nThe attack devised by the researchers works on both the default config, and Windows Hello with its \u201cenhanced anti-spoofing\u201d feature enabled.\n\n\u201cThus, by having access to a suitable photo of an authorized person (frontal face photo), Windows Hello face authentication can easily be bypassed with little effort, enabling unauthorized access to the Windows system.\u201d reads the \n\n\u201cBoth, the default Windows Hello configuration and Windows Hello with the enabled \u201cenhanced anti-spoofing\u201d feature on different Windows 10 versions are vulnerable to the described spoofing attack and can be bypassed. If \u201cenhanced anti-spoofing\u201d is enabled, depending on the targeted Windows 10 version, a slightly different modified photo with other attributes has to be used, but the additional effort for an attacker is negligible. In general, the simple spoofing attack is less reliable when the \u201cenhanced anti-spoofing\u201d feature is enabled.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Proof of Concept (PoC) detailed by the researchers worked against a Dell Latitude running Windows 10 Pro, build 1703; and a Microsoft Surface Pro running 4 build 1607.\n\nThe experts tried to use the \u201cenhanced anti-spoofing\u201d feature on Surface Pro\u2019s , but claimed its \u201cLilBit USB IR camera only supported the default configuration and could not be used with the more secure face recognition settings.\u201d\n\nThey successfully bypassed the default Windows Hello configuration on both test devices running all tested Windows 10 versions.\n\nBelow the proof-of-concept videos published by the researchers.:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Windows 10 Hello, facial recognition)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/biometrics", "topic_name": "biometrics"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facial-recognition", "topic_name": "facial recognition"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hello", "topic_name": "Hello"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/windows-10", "topic_name": "Windows 10"}]}, {"news_name": "South Korea cryptocurrency exchange Youbit shuts down after second hack in 2017", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66933/cyber-crime/youbit-cryptocurrency-exchange-shutdown.html", "title": "South Korea cryptocurrency exchange Youbit shuts down after second hack in 2017\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 19, 2017", "body": "The South Korea Cryptocurrency Exchange Youbit shuts down after suffering a major cyber attack for the second time this year.

The law aims to allow law enforcement agencies to use backdoors to gather information during their investigations.\n\nThe law would target devices in any industry, including telecommunications, automotive and IoT products.\n\nAccording to local news outlet RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), German Officials are expected to submit their proposal for debate this week.\n\n\u201cThe acting Federal Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re (CDU) wants to oblige the industry, German security authorities to open digital gateway for the spying on private cars, computers and smart TVs.\u201d states the news outlet.\n\n\u201cThe application is overwritten with \u201cNeed for action on the legal obligation of third parties for measures of covert information gathering according to \u00a7\u00a7 100c and 100f StPO\u201d. De Maizi\u00e8re wants to drastically expand the so-called eavesdropping attack by \u201cusing technical means against individuals\u201d. Above all, large corporations and producers of digital security systems should be required to provide information and notification.\u201d\n\nThe proposal is strongly supported by the Federal Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re who cites the difficulty investigations have had in the past especially when fighting against terrorist organizations.\n\n\n\nThe Interior Minister explained that modern technology is able to alert suspects for every suspicious activity conducted by law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Minister cited the cases of smart cars that alert an owner as soon as the car is shaken or any other anomalous activity is conducted by police officers.\n\nWell the presence of a backdoor could allow investigators to operate stopping any warning is sent to the suspect.\n\nDe Maizi\u00e8re stressed out that companies have a \u201clegal obligation\u201d to introduce backdoors for the use of law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Minister aims to oblige hardware manufacturer to disclose their \u201cprogramming protocols\u201d for analysis of Government experts and consequently to force companies to disclose details about their encrypted communication practices.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, eavesdropping would in future be possible wherever devices are connected to the Internet. The industry should give the state exclusive access rights, such as private tablets and computers, smart TVs or digitized kitchen appliances. A precondition for all measures of the extended wiretapping attack, however, would remain a judicial decision.\u201d continues the news outlet.\n\nOne of the most disturbing aspects of the new law is that it would give German officials powers to hack back any remote computer that is suspected to be involved in attacks against the country infrastructure.\n\nSomething similar was discussed by the French Defense Minister Le Drian comments in January 2017 and by the US authorities, in both cases, the Government officials were referencing the cyber attacks conducted by the Russian intelligence.\n\nThe Minister says this is important to \u201cshut down private computers in the event of a crisis,\u201d such as is the case with botnet takedowns.\n\n\u201cDe Maizi\u00e8re also wants an authorization for the security authorities to shut down private computers in the event of a crisis. An \u201cBotnet takedown specialist concept\u201d will allow security authorities to use private data to alert end users in good time if hackers want to misuse their computers for criminal purposes. In the event that online providers refuse to cooperate, far-reaching penalties are provided for.\u201d continues the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland.\n\nPrivacy advocates believe the German law could open the door to a mass surveillance programs, Government officials will have full powers of snooping everyone\u2019s online communications.\n\nThe German authorities refused such kind of accusations and highlighted that any access to data gathered under these surveillance programs would be allowed only after law enforcement have obtained a court order.\n\nThe reality is that the presence of backdoor dramatically reduces the overall security of any system, the backdoors could be discovered and used by malicious actors such as a foreign government and a criminal syndicate with unpredictable consequences.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Germany, backdoors)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoors", "topic_name":

increasing interest at JavaScript-based cryptocurrency miners due to rapid increase in cryptocurrency prices.\n\nThese scripts exploit the CPU power of their visitor\u2019s PC to mine Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Some websites use a simple technique to keep their cryptocurrency mining JavaScript under the radar and secretly running in the background even when the users close his web browser.\n\nIn many cases the scripts are used as an alternative monetization model to banner ads. Recently, the Pirate Bay was spotted using the Coinhive browser-based cryptocurrency miner service.\n\nThe scripts can mine cryptocurrencies as long as the visitors are on their site, they lost access to the computer processor and associated resources when the Window is closed.\n\nExperts from security firm Malwarebytes have discovered that some websites use a simple trick to keep their cryptocurrency mining scripts running in the background even when the user has closed the browser window.\n\nThe technique leverages a hidden pop-under browser window that is opened by the mining window and that fits behind the taskbar and hides behind the clock on Microsoft\u2019s Windows computer.\n\nThis hidden window is used to run the crypto-miner code consumes CPU cycles and power from visitor\u2019s computer until he will not spot the window and close it.\n\n\u201cThe trick is that although the visible browser windows are closed, there is a hidden one that remains opened. This is due to a pop-under which is sized to fit right under the taskbar and hides behind the clock.\u201d reads the blog post published by MalwareBytes.\n\n\u201cThe hidden window\u2019s coordinates will vary based on each user\u2019s screen resolution, but follow this rule:\n\nIf your Windows theme allows for taskbar transparency, you can catch a glimpse of the rogue window. Otherwise, to expose it you can simply resize the taskbar and it will magically pop it back up:\u201d\n\nThe technique is simple as efficient, it is difficult to identify and able to bypass most ad-blockers. Experts observed that the cryptocurrency miners run from a crypto-mining engine hosted by Amazon Web Servers.\n\n\u201cThis type of pop-under is designed to bypass adblockers and is a lot harder to identify because of how cleverly it hides itself. Closing the browser using the \u201cX\u201d is no longer sufficient.\u201d continues the post.\n\n\u201cThe more technical users will want to run Task Manager to ensure there is no remnant running browser processes and terminate them. Alternatively, the taskbar will still show the browser\u2019s icon with slight highlighting, indicating that it is still running.\u201d\n\nTo remain under the radar, the code of cryptocurrency miners runs in the hidden browser maintains CPU usage threshold to a medium level.\n\nThese scripts work on the latest version of Google\u2019s Chrome web browser running on the most recent versions of Microsoft\u2019s Windows 7 and Windows 10.\n\n\n\nUsers can spot miner windows by looking for any browser windows in the taskbar or running the Task Manager on their computer to ensure there is no running browser processes that are consuming CPU resources.\n\nSome antivirus software block cryptocurrency miners, an alternative is represented by web browser extensions, like No Coin, that automatically block in-browser cryptocurrency miners.\n\nUnfortunately, No Coin still not support Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Internet Explorer.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 cryptocurrency miners, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crypto-currency", "topic_name": "crypto currency"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptocurrency-miners", "topic_name": "cryptocurrency miners"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "US Judge Orders Coinbase to hand over details of 14,355 US citizens to the IRS", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66189/breaking-news/coinbase-irs-tax-evasion.html", "title": "US Judge Orders Coinbase to hand over details of 14,355 US citizens to the IRS\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 30, 2017", "body": "In November 2016, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has filed a motion asking the US Federal Court of Northern California to force the US-based cryptocurrency exchange portal to hand over the personal details of all US users that have conducted Bitcoin trades between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015.\n\nThe motion is part of a tax evasion investigation launched by the US authorities and aimed to track people that currently maintains funds in Bitcoin or that were paid using the cryptocurrency to avoid paying US taxes.\n\nNow a federal judge in the California Northern district court has ruled that US-based cryptocurrency exchange portal Coinbase must hand over details of over 14,000 users to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The energy consumption has already exceeded the amount used on average by states such as Ireland and most African nations.\n\n\u201cAccording to Digiconomist\u2019s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, as of Monday November 20th, 2017 Bitcoin\u2019s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at 29.05TWh.\u201d states the research.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of 0.13% of total global electricity consumption. While that may not sound like a lot, it means Bitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries (as you can see from the map above). More than Ireland or Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBitcoin transactions use so much energy that the electricity used for a single trade could power a home for almost a whole month, according to a paper from Dutch bank ING.\n\n\u201cBy making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power,\u201d wrote ING senior economist Teunis Brosens.\n\n\u201cTogether, they will dominate the verification (mining) process. To make the verification (mining) costly, the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity.\u201d\n\nComparing the amount of energy used for a Bitcoin transaction to run his home in the Netherlands, Brosens says: \u201cThis number needs some context. 200kWh is enough to run over 200 washing cycles. In fact, it\u2019s enough to run my entire home over four weeks, which consumes about 45 kWh per week costing \u20ac39 of electricity (at current Dutch consumer prices).\u201d\n\nIt is amazing if we compare this data other payment systems, for example Visa takes about 0.01kWh (10Wh) per transaction which is 20000 times less energy.\n\nThe following graph shows the 159 countries whose energy usage is less than bitcoin-mining consumption.\n\nSource PowerCompare.co.uk\n\nWhich is the concept behind the mining process?\n\nTo prevent the falsification of the records or the ownership changing, participants of the Bitcoin network must sign off on transactions in \u201cblocks\u201d.\n\nThe process requests a significant computational capability and involves several computers to solve complex cryptographic problems, people who verify blocks are rewarded with freshly created bitcoin. This process is known as Bitcoin \u201cmining.\u201d\n\nAccording to the initial design of the Bitcoin virtual currency scheme, it limits the overall number of coins in circulation to 21 million, this is possible because the cryptographic problems involved in the mining process get progressively harder.\n\nOn the other side, miners are turning to more powerful computers to solve the complex problems behind the mining process.\n\nThe vast majority of \u201cmining\u201d activities is done in China because the energy costs are cheaper compared to Europe or US.\n\n\u201cThe top six biggest mining pools from Antpool to BTCC are all largely based in China,\u201d said Mati Greenspan, an analyst with trading platform eToro. \u201cSome rough estimates put China\u2019s hashpower at more than 80% of the total network.\u201d\n\nOf course, the environmental impact of all this electric usage is not negligible, don\u2019t forget that the electricity generated in China comes from CO2 emitting fossil fuels.\n\nBelow a few other interesting facts about Bitcoin mining and electricity consumption published:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 pollution, mining)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/energy", "topic_name": "energy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mining", "topic_name": "mining"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pollution", "topic_name": "pollution"}]}, {"news_name": "GOLDEN SAML attack technique forges authentication to cloud apps", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66002/hacking/golden-saml-hacking.html", "title": "GOLDEN SAML attack technique forges authentication to cloud apps\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 25, 2017", "body": "Security experts at CyberArk Labs have devised a post-intrusion attack technique dubbed Golden SAML that could be exploited by an attacker to create fake enterprise identities and forge authentication to gain access to valuable cloud resources in a federated environment.\n\nThe attackers can impersonate any users gaining the highest privileges by forging SAML \u201cauthentication object.\u201d\n\nSAML is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider.\n\n\u201cThe vector enables an attacker to create a golden SAML, which is basically a forged SAML \u201cauthentication object,\u201d and authenticate across every service that uses SAML 2.0 protocol as an SSO mechanism.\u201d states the analysis published by CyberArk.\n\n\u201cIn a golden SAML attack, attackers can gain access to any application that supports SAML authentication (e.g. Azure, AWS, vSphere, etc.) with any privileges they desire and be any user on the targeted application (even one that is non-existent in the application in some cases).\u201d\n\nThe Golden SAML name reminds us of another notorious attack known as golden ticket, devised by Benjamin Delpy who developed the popular hacking tool Mimikatz.\n\n\u201cThe name resemblance is intended, since the attack nature is rather similar. Golden SAML introduces to a federation the advantages that golden ticket offers in a Kerberos environment \u2013 from gaining any type of access to stealthily maintaining persistency.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe Golden Ticket attack could be launched by attackers to gain full control of an IT infrastructure by manipulating the Windows Server Kerberos authentication framework.\n\nIn a similar way, the Golden SAML attack leverages the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML) protocol. Each SAML assertion is trusted and signed via a specific RSA key stored with an identity provider environment.\n\nTo carry on the such attack, the attackers will need the private key that signs the SAML objects along with an Active Directory Federation Services user account, token-signing private key, an identity provider (IdP) public certificate and an IdP name.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a list of the requirements for performing a golden SAML attack. The mandatory requirements are highlighted in purple. For the other non-mandatory fields, you can enter whatever you like.\u201d\n\nThe prerequisites of such attacks are important and make this technique not easy to be used in a real attack scenario.\n\nThe experts explained that mitigate the Golden SAMLattack is not simple.\n\n\u201cThis attack doesn\u2019t rely on a vulnerability in SAML 2.0. It\u2019s not a vulnerability in AWS/ADFS, nor in any other service or identity provider.\n\nGolden ticket is not treated as a vulnerability because an attacker has to have domain admin access in order to perform it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not being addressed by the appropriate vendors. The fact of the matter is, attackers are still able to gain this type of access (domain admin), and they are still using golden tickets to maintain stealthily persistent for even years in their target\u2019s domain.\u201d concluded the researchers.\n\n\u201cAs for the defenders, we know that if this attack is performed correctly, it will be extremely difficult to detect in your network. \u201c\n\nCyberArk released a new tool dubbed shimit that implements Golden SAML attack.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Golden SAML, hacking)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/golden-saml", "topic_name": "Golden SAML"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Firefox will notify users who visit sites that suffered a data breach", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65959/digital-id/firefox-notification-data-breach.html", "title": "Firefox will notify users who visit sites that suffered a data breach\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 24, 2017", "body": "Firefox browser is going to introduce a new security feature to make the users\u2019 experience online more secure, it will warn users if they visit websites that have experienced data breaches.\n\nThe news was revealed by the Mozilla developer Nihanth Subramany and it was confirmed by the presence of a recently-released GitHub repo titled \u201cBreach Alerts Prototype.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an extension that I\u2019m going to be using as a vehicle for prototyping basic UI and interaction flow for an upcoming feature in Firefox that notifies users when their credentials have possibly been leaked or stolen in a data breach.\u201d states the description published on GitHub.\n\nThe developer has teamed with haveibeenpwned.com as data source related for data breaches.\n\nThe new feature is still not complete, the developer explained that in its current state it is in no way meant to represent actual production code, or how the feature will work or look like when it ships.\n\nHe also listed the following basic goals for the new security feature:\n\n\n\nThe developer also approached privacy concerns since the users would need to supply an email address to receive security notifications.\n\n\u201cThe third goal brings up some privacy concerns, since users would need to supply an email address to receive notifications.

The hackers tried to blackmail Uber and demanded $100,000 from the company in exchange for avoiding publish the stolen data.\n\n\u201cTwo attackers accessed a private GitHub coding site used by Uber software engineers and then used login credentials they obtained there to access data stored on an Amazon Web Services account that handled computing tasks for the company. From there, the hackers discovered an archive of rider and driver information. Later, they emailed Uber asking for money, according to the company.\u201d states Bloomberg.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Khosrowshahi said the intruders accessed cloud-hosted data stores:\n\n\u201cI recently learned that in late 2016 we became aware that two individuals outside the company had inappropriately accessed user data stored on a third-party cloud-based service that we use. The incident did not breach our corporate systems or infrastructure.\n\nAt the time of the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the data and shut down further unauthorized access by the individuals. We subsequently identified the individuals and obtained assurances that the downloaded data had been destroyed. We also implemented security measures to restrict access to and strengthen controls on our cloud-based storage accounts.\u201d reads a CEO\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cYou may be asking why we are just talking about this now, a year later.

The payout was disguised as a bug bounty prize complete with non-disclosure agreements signed. It is a good way to hide the payment, Uber is running a bug bounty program to encourage white hat hackers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities affecting  its services.\n\n\u201cUber acquiesced to the demands, and then went further. The company tracked down the hackers and pushed them to sign nondisclosure agreements, according to the people familiar with the matter. To further conceal the damage, Uber executives also made it appear as if the payout had been part of a \u201cbug bounty\u201d \u2014 a common practice among technology companies in which they pay hackers to attack their software to test for soft spots.\u201d reported The New York Times\u201c\n\n\u201cThe details of the attack remained hidden until Tuesday. The ride-hailing company said it had discovered the breach as part of a board investigation into Uber\u2019s business practices.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the new board investigation Sullivan and one of his lieutenants were ousted.\n\nThe CEO explained that such kind of thing will not happen again in the future because Uber put the customers\u2019 security and trust as the pillar of its business.\n\n\u201cWhile I can\u2019t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes. We are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers.\u201d added Khosrowshahi.\n\nThe CEO added that forensics experts haven\u2019t found evidence that data were downloaded, anyway the company is monitoring the affected account for fraudulent activities.\n\nBelow the list of actions the company has taken in response to the incident:\n\nThe New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has also launched an investigation into Uber data breach.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the company has experienced security breaches, it suffered the first data breach in May 2014, but the event was discovered on February 2015.\n\nIn the attack, the names and driver\u2019s licenses of more than 50,000 of the company\u2019s drivers were compromised.\n\nAt the time, the giant announced a data breach that resulted in unauthorized access to the driver partner license numbers of roughly 50,000 of its drivers.\n\nIn June 2016, security experts from the Integrity firm have found more than a dozen flaws in the Uber website that could be exploited by hackers to access driver and passenger data.

If yes, there is probably something that you need to know about it!\n\nThe Austrian developer and Google engineer, Felix Krause, has discovered a serious privacy issue in Apple iPhone that could be exploited by iOS app developers to silently take your photos and record your live video by enabling both front and back camera.\n\nThe iPhone users will never receive any notification from the device, technical details were shared by Krause in a blog post published Wednesday.\n\n\u201ciOS users often grant camera access to an app soon after they download it (e.g., to add an avatar or send a photo). These apps, like a messaging app or any news-feed-based app, can easily track the users face, take pictures, or live stream the front and back camera, without the user\u2019s consent.\u201d wrote Krause.\n\nAccording to Krause, the issue is the direct consequence of the way Apple software handles camera access. Today almost any application, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and Snapchat, requests access to your camera to allow users to take a photo within the app.\n\nOnce the users granted camera permission, a developer could perform the following operations:\n\n\n\nIt is enough to enable camera access just one time when the app asks for permission to gain full access to the camera without requiring any LED light or notification, it is scaring.\n\n\u201cAll without indicating that your phone is recording you and your surrounding, no LEDs, no light or any other kind of indication.\u201d continues the developer.\n\nKrause developed a proof-of-concept app only to demonstrate how a malicious app could silently abuse such permissions to take pictures every second or even live stream video of the surrounding environment.\n\n\u201cThis project is a proof of concept and should not be used in production. The goal is to highlight a privacy loophole that can be abused by iOS apps.\u201d continues the developer.\n\nBelow a video PoC of the issue, which shows how the demo app takes photographs of the users using it every second.

The code is placed in a secure memory area of execution dubbed \u201cenclave.\u201d\n\n\u201cModern Intel chips support a feature called Software Guard Extensions (SGX). SGX allows applications to provision a \u201csecure enclave\u201d that is isolated from the host operating system and kernel, similar to technologies like ARM\u2019s TrustZone. SGX enclaves also support a feature called remote attestation. Remote attestation provides a cryptographic guarantee of the code that is running in a remote enclave over a network.\u201d states Open Whisper Systems.\n\nThe idea of the Signal development team is to run contact discovery service in an SGX enclave.\n\nThe private contact discovery leveraging the SGX technology could be composed of the following steps at a high level:\n\nThe SGX also supports what \u201cremote attestation\u201d that allows the client to guarantee of the code that is running in a remote enclave over a network.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis would allow a server to stream media content to a client enclave with the assurance that the client software requesting the media is the \u201cauthentic\u201d software that will play the media only once, instead of custom software that reverse engineered the network API call and will publish the media as a torrent instead.\u201d continues Open Whisper Systems.\n\n\u201cSince the enclave attests to the software that\u2019s running remotely, and since the remote server and OS have no visibility into the enclave, the service learns nothing about the contents of the client request. It\u2019s almost as if the client is executing the query locally on the client device,\u201d .\n\nOpen Whisper Systems plans to integrate the feature in the next few months.\n\nIf you are interested in analyzing source code for the private contact discovery service you can visit the official GitHub repository.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 private contact discovery, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/private-contact-discovery", "topic_name": "private contact discovery"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/signal", "topic_name": "Signal"}]}, {"news_name": "iOS apps can access metadata revealing users\u2019 locations and much more", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63525/mobile-2/metadata-ios-apps.html", "title": "iOS apps can access metadata revealing users\u2019 locations and much more\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 28, 2017", "body": "The developer Felix Krause, founder of Fastlane.Tools, has discovered that iOS apps can access image metadata revealing users\u2019 location history.\n\nKrause published a detailed analysis on the Open Radar community, he explained that the app just needs to get permission to access the image library.\n\n\u201cIf an app gets permission to access the image library, it will get full access to all image metadata also, including the exact location.\u201d wrote Krause.\n\u201cThis is a serious privacy issue, as third party camera apps that want to just store a picture the user took, will also get full access to all photos and their locations in their image library.\u201d\n\nThe developer explained that it is too easy to access image metadata with the following procedure:\n\nThe expert also published a  proof-of-concept code at GitHub, he explained it was very easy to write it.\n\n\u201cDoes your iOS app have access to the user\u2019s image library?

The company is a contractor for Russian state surveillance, it was set up in 1992 to provide billing solutions, it is a major supplier of software to the mobile telecoms operators.\n\n\u201cThe technologies developed and deployed by PETER-SERVICE today go far beyond the classical billing process and extend into the realms of surveillance and control. Although compliance to the strict surveillance laws is mandatory in Russia, rather than being forced to comply PETER-SERVICE appears to be quite actively pursuing partnership and commercial opportunities with the state intelligence apparatus.\u201d reported Wikileaks\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact PETER-SERVICE is uniquely placed as a surveillance partner due to the remarkable visibility their products provide into the data of Russian subscribers of mobile operators, which expose to PETER-SERVICE valuable metadata, including phone and message records, device identifiers (IMEI, MAC addresses), network identifiers (IP addresses), cell tower information and much more. This enriched and aggregated metadata is of course of interest to Russian authorities, whose access became a core component of the system architecture.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that the leaked documents never reference the Russia intelligence agency, the FSB, but \u201cspeak only of state agencies.\u201d\n\nUnder Russia law operators must maintain a Data Retention System (DRS) that allows them to store data for up to three years.\n\n\u201cThe Peter-Service DRS system allows Russian state agencies to query the database of all stored data to search for information such as calls made by a certain telephone company customer, the payment systems used, the cell that served the specific mobile. The manuals published by WikiLeaks contain the images of the interfaces that allow agents to search within this huge trove of data, so access is simple and intuitive.\u201d wrote Stefania Maurizi, on the Italian media outlet La Repubblica.\n\nAccording to Wikileaks, Peter-Service\u2019s DRS solution can handle 500,000,000 connections per day in just one cluster, the system has high performance, the claimed average search time for subscriber related-records from a single day is ten seconds.\n\n\u201cThe data retention system is a mandatory component for operators by law; it stores all communication (meta-)data locally for three years. State intelligence authorities use the Protocol 538 adapter built into the DRS to access stored information.\u201d continues Wikileaks.\n\nThe Peter-Service has also developed a system called TDM (Traffic Data Mart), that records and monitors IP traffic for all mobile devices registered with the operator.\n\nThe system enables Russian agencies to track online activity of the targets, including visited sites, forums, social media.\n\nThe TDM maintains a list of categorized domain names \u2014 \u201cwhich cover all areas of interest for the state. These categories include blacklisted sites, criminal sites, blogs, webmail, weapons, botnet, narcotics, betting, aggression, racism, terrorism and many more\u201d.\n\n\u201cBased on the collected information the system allows the creation of reports for subscriber devices (identified by IMEI/TAC, brand, model) for a specified time range: Top categories by volume, top sites by volume, top sites by time spent, protocol usage (browsing, mail, telephony, bittorrent) and traffic/time distribution,\u201d.\n\nWikileaks points to a 2013 Peter-Service slideshow presentation that was published on the company website that focuses on a new product, called DPI*GRID; The product is a hardware equipment for Deep Packet Inspection that takes the form of \u201cblack boxes\u201d apparently able to handle 10Gb/s traffic per unit.\n\n\u201cHowever, the core of the presentation is about a new product (2013) called DPI*GRID \u2013 a hardware solution for \u201cDeep Packet Inspection\u201d that comes literally as \u201cblack boxes\u201d that are able to handle 10Gb/s traffic per unit.\u201d continues Wikileaks.\u201dThe national providers are aggregating Internet traffic in their infrastructure and are redirecting/duplicating the full stream to DPI*GRID units. The units inspect and analyse traffic (the presentation does not describe that process in much detail); the resulting metadata and extracted information are collected in a database for further investigation. A similar, yet smaller solution called MDH/DRS is available for regional providers who send aggregated IP traffic via a 10Gb/s connection to MDH for processing.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nPeter-Service argues that Moscow must be able to make better use of the power of data and reliance on itself. \u201cWho controls the information, controls the world,\u201d concludes Peter-Service, pointing out how much President Obama\u2019s power of America is based on NSA\u2019s mass surveillance, as revealed by Snowden.\n\n\u201cDrawing specifically on the NSA Prism program, the presentation offers law enforcement, intelligence and other interested parties, to join an alliance in order to establish equivalent data-mining operations in Russia,\u201d it adds \u2014 sticking its boot firmly back into U.S. government mass surveillance programs.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Peter-Service, Russia)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/peter-service", "topic_name": "Peter-Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sorm", "topic_name": "SORM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spy-file-russia", "topic_name": "Spy File Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Popular Sarahah App secretly uploads your phone contacts to the company\u2019s servers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62416/digital-id/sarahah-app-privacy-issue.html", "title": "Popular Sarahah App secretly uploads your phone contacts to the company\u2019s servers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 28, 2017", "body": "This summer, Sarahah became one of the most popular iPhone apps in the world for both iOS and Android.\n\nSarahah has been created by Saudi Arabian developer Zain al-Abidin Tawfiq, it implements a social network that lets users send and receive anonymous messages.\n\n\n\nIt reached the top of the App Store in many regions, including Australia, Ireland, the U.S, and the UK.\n\nCreated by Saudi Arabian developer Zain al-Abidin Tawfiq, the app is essentially a social network that lets you send and receive anonymous messages.\n\nSarahah means \u201cfrankness\u201d or \u201chonesty\u201d in Arabic, the name was chosen because the author believes that people are more willing to be honest when their messages are anonymized like the app does.\n\nToday the Sarahah app has more than 18 Million users that probably ignore that the app may not be as private as they believe.\n\nAccording to a report published by The Intercept, the app silently uploads users\u2019 phone contacts to the company\u2019s servers.\n\nThe discovery was made by the security analyst Zachary Julian, he discovered that once users have installed the Sarahah app for the first time, it harvests and uploads data in the address book.\n\n\u201cZachary Julian, a senior security analyst at Bishop Fox, discovered Sarahah\u2019s uploading of private information when he installed the app on his Android phone, a Galaxy S5 running Android 5.1.1. The phone was outfitted with monitoring software known as BURP Suite, which intercepts internet traffic entering and leaving the device, allowing the owner to see what data is sent to remote servers.\u201d reads the report published by The Intercept. \u201cWhen Julian launched Sarahah on the device, BURP Suite caught the app in the act of uploading his private data.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you log into the application, it transmits all of your email and phone contacts stored on the Android operating system,\u201d he said. He later verified the same occurs on Apple\u2019s iOS, albeit after a prompt to \u201caccess contacts,\u201d which also appears in newer versions of Android. Julian also noticed that if you haven\u2019t used the application in a while, it\u2019ll share all of your contacts again. He did some testing on the app on a Friday night, and when he booted the app on a Sunday morning, it pushed all of his contacts again.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Zain al-Abidin Tawfiq, the contacts functionality was initially implemented to allow you to \u201c\u2018find your friends\u2019 feature.\u201d anyway it would be removed in a future release.\n\nWhen first launched, this app harvests and uploads all phone numbers and email addresses in your address book. https://t.co/MOfzqQ9KmI\n\n\u2014 The Intercept (@theintercept) August 27, 2017\n\n\n\nZachary Julian highlighted that the privacy policy doesn\u2019t mention uploading data to a server.\n\n\u201cThe privacy policy specifically states that if it plans to use your data, it\u2019ll ask for your consent,\u201d Julian said. While the app\u2019s entry in Google\u2019s Play Store does indicate the app will access contacts, that\u2019s not \u201cenough consent\u201d to justify \u201csending all of those contacts over without any kind of specific notification,\u201d he added.\n\nThe good news is that users can block the app form accessing their contacts.\n\nSince Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS, users can limit permissions for apps, just go to\n\nSettings \u2192 Personal \u2192 Apps, now under Configuration App, open App permission and set the permission according to your needs.\n\nUnfortunatel, around 54 percent of Android users are using older versions that don\u2019t allow to limit permissions, and \u201cusers have to be savvy enough to know where to find the app permissions  and around 54 percent of Android users are using older versions that don\u2019t have these permissions, and users have to be savvy enough to know where to find the app permissions (Settings > Apps > Gear button > App permissions).\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Sarahah app, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/app-permissions", "topic_name": "app permissions"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sarahah", "topic_name": "Sarahah"}]}, {"news_name": "Misconfigured AWS S3 exposed 1.8 million US voter records", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/62116/hacking/voter-records-exposed.html", "title": "Misconfigured AWS S3 exposed 1.8 million US voter records\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 18, 2017", "body": "It has happened again, more than 1.8 million voter records belonging to Americans have been accidentally leaked online by a US voting machine supplier for dozens of US states.\n\nThe voter records were left openly accessible online due to a misconfiguration in AWS-hosted storage.\n\nOnce again, the huge trove of records was spotted by the popular UpGuard researcher Chris Vickery.

A friend of mine received an SMS message supposedly sent from his bank asking him to update his registration data through the given URL. Otherwise, he could have his account blocked, as seen in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 SMS message received\n\nTelling you the truth, my friend doesn\u2019t have any account on the informed bank and, even so, we know that those kinds of message are hardly ever sent by banks and are, most of the time, related to malware propagation and information stealing. However, instead of discarding the message, we decided to give it a try and the results, as you are going to read in this diary, surprised us. This campaign involves no malware propagation \u2013 just creativity in favor of evil.\n\nSMS Phishing analysis\n\nThe link in the message aims to take the victim to a fake and very simplistic mobile version of a well-known bank website. First, it asks for the \u201cCPF\u201d (a kind of social security card number) and a password, as seen in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Fake bank website asking for CPF and password\n\nIt is interesting noting that there is a data input validation. The user must obey to the CPF number composition rules otherwise he can\u2019t proceed. This validation is done by the JavaScript code shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 CPF validation rules\n\nThis kind of validation is certainly used to give a bit of legitimacy to the fake website and, perhaps, to do not overload crooks with much \u201cdata-mining\u201d work.\n\nIn the next page, the fake website informs that the device used on that connection needs to be authorized, as seen in Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Fake website: user must authorize the device\n\nBy clinking on \u201cHabilitar Aparelho\u201d which means \u201cenable device\u201d, a new page is shown asking for the victim to inform the 4-digit password, as seen in Figure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Fake website asking for the 4-digit password\n\nAgain, there is a minimum validation to avoid the user trying very simple passwords like \u201c1234\u201d as seen in Figure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 4-digit password \u201cvalidation\u201d code\n\nNext, the step that caught our attention. The fake website asks the victim to take a picture of its token card and upload it. To be precisely, asks to take a picture of the side with all security codes used to validate banking transactions as a second-factor authenticator, as seen in Figure 7.\n\n \n\n\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Asking for the token card picture\n\nBy clicking on \u201cFinalizar Habilita\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d which means \u201cproceed with the device authorization\u201d, the victim\u2019s smartphone will prompt the user to select a picture from its library or take a new one \u2013 which is exactly what the user is induced to do, as seen in Figure 8.\n\n\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Taking the token card picture\n\nOnce the victim ends up the whole process, including the token card picture, the criminals will have all the information needed to make fraudulent transactions on the compromised bank account and the user is forwarded to the real bank login page.\n\nFinal words\n\nUsing victim\u2019s smartphone to take pictures to steal information or, who knows, things, scares me a little bit. I can explain. Earlier this month, reading Bruce Schneier\u2019s blog I saw a post entitled \u201cNow It\u2019s Easier than Ever to Steal Someone\u2019s Keys\u201d [1] which says, \u201cThe website key.me will make a duplicate key from a digital photo.\u201d.\n\nWhile writing this diary, I was reported about similar SMS Phishing campaigns targeting other banks costumers here in Brazil.

And we really mean everyone, because consistent with our mission to make privacy and security accessible to every single person in the world, we\u2019re also releasing ProtonVPN as a free VPN service.\n\nIt has been a long and exciting journey to get here since our team first met at CERN in 2013. Back then, we had an ambitious vision to build an Internet that was free and could continue to reach its full potential as a tool for social progress. Indeed, that was the vision that inspired Tim Berners-Lee to create the World Wide Web at CERN in 1989.\n\nSince then, the Internet has met or even exceeded its promise in certain areas, but this has not come without a cost to society. While the Internet has done a great deal of good, over the course of this digital revolution, we have also lost control over our data, our most intimate secrets, and ultimately our privacy. In certain countries, the Internet has even become a tool for oppression and control, instead of the beacon of hope and freedom it once was.\n\nBack in 2013, we embarked on a journey to change this, by building the tools that could make privacy and security the default online. In 2014, on the 25th anniversary of the web, our efforts culminated with the release of ProtonMail, the world\u2019s first end-to-end encrypted email service. Since then millions of people around the world have embraced our vision, and thanks to your support (and the numerous donations along the way), email is much safer today than it was several years ago.\n\nHowever, when considering the scope of all that we do online, email is just a small piece of the online world. That\u2019s why we have decided to build ProtonVPN, to better protect the activists, journalists, and individuals who are currently using ProtonMail to secure their online lives. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows users to browse the web without being tracked, bypass online censorship blocks, and also increases security by passing all internet traffic through a strongly encrypted tunnel.\n\nThe importance of VPNs for online security and privacy is increasing day by day. Back in April of this year, Obama-era FTC rules designed to protect the privacy of internet browsing history were rolled back. Fast forward to today, and attempts are being made to dismantle net neutrality in the US, and several European governments are now calling for increased online surveillance. Last but not least, for over 1.5 billion people around the world, the Internet does not live up to its promise of freedom of information. Instead, the Internet is a highly restricted and censored place, constantly under surveillance, where making a wrong move could lead to imprisonment or worse.\n\nWe are also aware that as ProtonMail becomes a stronger force for digital freedom, the censorship of ProtonMail in certain countries is not a matter of if, but a matter of when. Earlier this year, we took the first steps to improve ProtonMail\u2019s availability under censorship by launching an Onion site. With ProtonVPN, we can ensure the accessibility of not only ProtonMail, but all of the world\u2019s digital knowledge and information. This is why we are committed to providing a free version of ProtonVPN.\n\nHowever, we have done more than make ProtonVPN free. We have also worked to make it the best VPN service ever created, by addressing many of the common pitfalls with VPNs. For example, ProtonVPN features a Secure Core architecture which routes traffic through multiple encrypted tunnels in multiple countries to better defend against network based attacks, and also features seamless integration with the Tor anonymity network. You can learn about all the steps we took to build a secure VPN here.\n\nLastly, we\u2019re building a VPN service that can be worthy of your trust. We understand that when it comes to VPNs, trust is paramount. Whether it is our transparent VPN threat model, our Swiss jurisdiction, our reputation, our relationship with the community, or the fact that you actually know who we are, we\u2019re committed to building and operating ProtonVPN with the same level of transparency that has come to characterize ProtonMail.\n\n\n\nTo all of you who have supported us over the years, thank you for your support. Unlike companies like Google and Facebook who abuse user privacy to sell advertisements, ProtonMail and ProtonVPN are entirely dependent on users upgrading to paid accounts to cover operating expenses. Without your support, these projects would not be able to thrive and grow. If you appreciate the security and privacy that ProtonVPN provides, and have the means to do so, please consider upgrading to a paid account. This allows us to support the millions around the world without these means.\n\nWith your help, the revolution we have started with ProtonMail will continue, and we will reach the day where the Internet serves all of us equally, and reaches its full potential as a tool for freedom.\n\nBest Regards,\nThe Proton Technologies Team\n\nYou can find our launch press release here: https://protonvpn.com/blog/launch-press-release\n\nFollow ProtonVPN on Social Media:\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/ProtonVPN\nTwitter: twitter.com/ProtonVPN\nReddit: reddit.com/r/ProtonVPN\n\nDr. Andy Yen\n\nAndy is the Co-Founder and CEO of Proton Technologies, the mother company of ProtonVPN and ProtonMail.

According to the journalists, the authorities used an Israeli spyware to hack their mobile devices. The surveillance software is the questionable Pegasus that is developed by the Israeli surveillance NSO Group and sold exclusively to the governments and law enforcement agencies.\n\nNSO Group is owned by US private equity firm Francisco Partners Management. it made the headlines after the investigation conducted by The New York Times.\n\nPeople familiar with the NSO Group confirmed that the company has an internal ethics committee that monitors the sales and potential customers verifying that the software will not be abused to violate human rights.\n\nOfficially the sale of surveillance software is limited to authorized governments to support investigation of agencies on criminal organizations and terrorist groups.\n\nUnfortunately, its software is known to have been abused to spy on journalists and human rights activists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no check on this,\u201d said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cOnce NSO\u2019s systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they\u2019re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place.\u201d\n\nThe discovery is the result of an investigation conducted by Mexican NGOs and the CitizenLab organization.\n\nR3D, SocialTic, Article 19 and CitizenLab published a report that details the surveillance illegally operated by the Mexican government through the spyware.\n\nAuthorities have been sending malicious links to individuals\u2019 phones, in order to trick victims into opening the messages they were specifically crafted and in some cases, the attack involved also family members if the victims were not compromised.\n\n\u201cThe targets received SMS messages that included links to NSO exploits paired with troubling personal and sexual taunts, messages impersonating official communications by the Embassy of the United States in Mexico, fake AMBER Alerts, warnings of kidnappings, and other threats.\u201d states the report. \u201cThe operation also included more mundane tactics, such as messages sending fake bills for phone services and sex-lines. Some targets only received a handful of texts, while others were barraged with dozens of messages over more than one and a half years. A majority of the infection attempts, however, took place during two periods: August 2015 and April-July 2016\u2033.\n\n\n\nThe Pegasus spyware leverages zero-day exploits to compromise both iOS and Android devices.\n\nThe government targeted individuals that exposed evidence on government corruption and activists who revealed human rights violations by the Mexican Government.\n\nThe researchers observed at least two periods of intense targeting:\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Times report, at least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased some $80 million of spyware from NSO Group since 2011.\n\nCompanies like the NSO Group operate in the dark, in a sort of \u201clegal gray area,\u201d despite the Israeli government exercises strict control of the export of such kind of software, surveillance applications could be abused by threat actors and authoritarian regimes worldwide.\n\nLet me close with Key Findings of the report\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Pegasus Spyware, Mexican government)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mexico", "topic_name": "Mexico"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nso-group", "topic_name": "NSO Group"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pegasus-spyware", "topic_name": "Pegasus Spyware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "DRA firm left 1.1 TB of data unsecured on an Amazon S3, 198 million US voter records exposed", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60243/data-breach/dra-data-leak.html", "title": "DRA firm left 1.1 TB of data unsecured on an Amazon S3, 198 million US voter records exposed\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 19, 2017", "body": "The voter files also include other attributes that could have been used for analysis based on ethnicity and religion.\n\nIn 2015, Vickery discovered an archive exposed online containing 191 million voter records.\n\n\n\nDRA is a Republican big data analytics firm, the popular expert discovered the huge trove of data on June 12, then he reported the issue to the authorities and the company secured it in two days.\n\nThe archive contains complete voter files compiled by DRA and at least two other contractors, Target Point Consulting Inc. and Data Trust.\n\nVoter information is considered public, but sometimes it is not easy to access them even if they are freely available.

They are the primary source of hacking incidents as we search, share, watch and download files from browsers. Moreover, various vulnerabilities exists in browsers, emphasizing the fact of using necessary tools to make your browser hacker-proof.\n\nEnsuring that browsers are secured with the essential protocols is important. After all, hackers are becoming exceedingly experienced, penetrating into numerous prominent companies and government agencies this year alone as witnessed from the WannaCry ransomware cyberattack.\n\nAlthough web browsers do a good job at ensuring security loopholes are rectified as early as possible, but more often than not, some updates arrive late and you can\u2019t rely on them alone. It could be that your browser isn\u2019t updating or you\u2019ve got extensions and plugins installed that have potential security loopholes.\n\nTo ensure your online safety, we\u2019ve come up with four online security tips that will help keep your browser safe hackers.\n\nKeeping your browser updated is the easiest way to ensure the safety of your browser. Browser updates carry necessary patches which secure you against hacking incidents and make your browser hack-proof on the web.\n\nGoogle Chrome, Firefox and Opera come packed with default settings for automatic updates. You need to click the \u2018install updates automatically\u2019 option for uninterrupted and smooth connectivity.\n\n\n\nFortunately, most browsers these days are automatically updated. For instance, if you installed Microsoft\u2019s new Windows 10 operating system, its default setting is to automatically update your software and issue patches, including for its Edge browser.\n\nNo matter how secure your browser might get, third-party plug-ins can never be completely trusted as plug-ins can read, make changes and access the websites you visit.\n\nThere are some plug-ins that come with the browser and might never be used. So, one way to give yourself an extra layer of protection is to delete unneeded plug-ins.\n\nThere is a misconception regarding plug-ins and extensions. While plug-ins handle video or other content that the browser does not support, extensions are small programs that add new features to your browser and personalize your browsing experience.\n\nYou can find numerous extensions on Google Chrome and Firefox which enhance your online browsing functionality. Having said that, extensions have their disadvantages. Some extensions need passwords so they can work to their full potential. That leaves an open door to hackers and other cyber criminals who install malware.\n\nWhile installing an extension, be mindful of the source \u2013 trustworthiness of the maker. You can read reviews for authenticity.\n\nWhen it comes to making your browser hack-proof, no other tool does it better than a VPN extension. This extension promises fast speed internet capability and does not maintain any logs of its users. In addition, you can evade censorship laws in any country by connecting to a server maintained in another country \u2013 all while being anonymous on the web.\n\nThere are numerous extensions that provide strong features needed to make the browser hacker-proof such as blocking ads, dodging online trackers, safeguarding against malware & providing WebRTC leak protection. With a Chrome VPN extension, you get an encrypted connection which masks your physical IP with a virtual IP \u2013 maintaining your online secrecy.\n\nAbout Author: Anas Baig\n\nAnas Baig is a Cyber Security Expert, a computer science graduate specializing in internet security, science, and technology.

JS code can record video\\audio without showing the graphical red dot in the tab when the record process is running. i.e. \u2013 after the permission is given the site can listen to the user whenever he want to. It is done because JS `window.open` method does not give visual indication on record init. \u201d reads the security advisory.\n\nWeb browser based audio-video communications use WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) protocol to enable real-time communication over peer-to-peer connections without the use of plugins.\n\nHowever, to protect unauthorised streaming of audio and video without user\u2019s permission, the web browser first request users to explicitly allow websites to use WebRTC and access device the camera and the microphone installed on the host. Once granted, a website will have the access to both camera and microphone until the user will explicitly revoke WebRTC permissions.\n\nModern browsers notify users when audio or video is being recorded in order to prevent abuses even by previously \u2018authorised\u2019 websites.\n\nIn Google Chrome, users are notified with a red dot icon that appears on the tab.\n\n\u201cActivating this API will alert the user that the audio or video from one of the devices is being captured. Chrome and Firefox implemented this alert (Recording media is not available in Edge yet).\u201d Bar-Zik wrote on a Medium blog post. \u201cThis record indication is the last and the most important line of defense. The general video\\audio device permission is required one time only and user can err and grant it by mistake. Once you granted it, that\u2019s it. The record alert is given on ANY stream record usage and will prevent any record without the user knowledge. \u201c\n\nThe researcher discovered that new HTML5 video\\audio API has privacy issues on desktop Chrome allowing to hackers to use the PC as a surveillance device.\n\nThe expert demonstrated that after granting the general access from the user it is possible to activate the MediaRecorder from a headless window opened.\n\n\n\n\u201cDevelopers can exploit small UX manipulation to activate the MediaRecorder API without alerting the users. The process is quite simple.\u201d reads the analsysis shared by the expert. \u201cAfter granting the general access from the user \u2014 Open a headless window and activate the MediaRecorder from that window. In Chrome there will be no visual record indication.\u201d\n\nThe issue is related to a design flaw in Chrome that doesn\u2019t display a red-dot indication on headless windows, allowing site developers to \u201cexploit small UX manipulation to activate the MediaRecorder API without alerting the users.\u201d\n\nBar-Zik also published a proof-of-concept (PoC) code and a demo website that asks the user for permission to use WebRTC, opens a pop-up, and then records 20 seconds of audio without giving any indication to the user.\n\nThe demo website has two buttons on a page, the first one is used to ask the device permission like many websites on the web. The second button launches the attack, after 30 seconds users can download MP3.\n\nIn a real attack, hackers can use very small pop-under and submit the data anywhere and close it when the user is focusing on it.\n\n\u201cIt can use very small pop-under and submit the data anywhere and close it when the user is focusing on it. It can use the camera for millisecond to get your picture. It can (In theory) use XSS to ride on legitimate sites and their permissions.\u201d Bar-Zik concluded. \n\nThe reported design issue affects Google Chrome, we cannot exclude its presence also in the implementation of other web browsers. The researcher reported the bug to Google on April 10, 2017, but the company doesn\u2019t classify the issue as a security vulnerability.\n\nit plans to fix the issue in the future, but not immediately.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t really a security vulnerability \u2013 for example, WebRTC on a mobile device shows no indicator at all in the browser,\u201d a Chromium member replied to the report. \u201cThe dot is a best-first effort that only works on the desktop when we have chrome UI space available.

We are less than one year until the impact of the GDPR is realized, no one is certain what will happen, and everyone is taking a different approach to mitigation.\n\nIn April 2016, the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it goes into effect in May 2018. The GDPR aims to \u201ccreate more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across EU nations.\u201d (https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-gdpr-general-data-protection-regulation-understanding-and-complying-gdpr-data-protection) One way to summarize the requirements is to say that companies that have operations or do business with EU citizens must know where EU citizens\u2019 data in their care is located, ensure it is being handled appropriately, remove the data when requested and notify citizens\u2019 promptly when their data has been compromised. As an individual, this seems an obvious expectation, but working in a company you learn information has a way of spreading among people and systems and trying to control it is very difficult.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most worrying about the findings,\u201d comments Matt Lock, director of sales engineers at Varonis, \u201cis that one in four organizations doesn\u2019t have a handle on where its sensitive data resides. These companies are likely to have a nasty wake-up call in one year\u2019s time. If they don\u2019t have this fundamental insight into where sensitive data sits within their organizations and who can and is accessing it, then their chances of getting to first base with the regulations are miniscule and they are putting themselves firmly at the front of the queue for fines.\u201d (http://www.securityweek.com/survey-shows-disparity-gdpr-preparedness-and-concerns)\n\nAny company found to be in violation of the regulation, faces fines and penalties up to 4% of their global annual revenue. It is this penalty that has companies taking note and working hard to ensure compliance. But not everyone is taking it seriously, or at least not everyone has started.\n\n\n\nA recent survey conducted on behalf of Varonis highlights a disparity between the priorities of company executives and those responsible for ensuring compliance. Among the 500 IT decision makers surveyed, 75% \u201cface serious challenges in being compliant with the EU GDPR\u201d by the deadline. (http://www.securityweek.com/survey-shows-disparity-gdpr-preparedness-and-concerns) Not surprising when you learn 42% of company executives do not view compliance by the deadline as a priority. Where does this disparity come from?\n\nThe survey included companies from the UK, Germany, France and the US. These companies undoubtedly have different experiences with regulators based on their geographic locations and their operating industries. Some regulators tend to be collaborative in finding a resolution while others tend towards punitive actions. We don\u2019t yet know how EU regulators will apply the GDPR penalties. 92% of respondents expect that a specific industry \u201cwill be singled out as an example in the event of a breach\u201d (http://www.securityweek.com/survey-shows-disparity-gdpr-preparedness-and-concerns) with 52% of UK respondents predicting banking, while France and Germany overwhelmingly predict a breach in technology and telecommunications to be the example.\n\nRegardless of who is first, the scale of the first penalty will be the signal to company executives on how much they should devote to compliance. And as with all business decisions, it is one of the minimizing costs to maximize profitability.\n\n56% of UK respondents believe the GDPR will increase complexity for IT teams and result in higher prices for customers with 22% seeing no benefit to their business. (https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/uk-it-leaders-gdpr-will-drive-up/) With these kinds of numbers, it will be difficult to get executive support for compliance efforts. However, 35% of companies surveyed believe GDPR compliance will be beneficial with better protections for personal data being the biggest improvement. While the GDPR only addresses personal information, the exercise will help companies understand the effort required to manage data better and some may see unexpected benefits.\n\nLeading up to January 1, 2000 there were many similar stories about companies taking different approaches to Y2K remediation. Some had enormous, expensive projects running for years, others scrambled at the end of 1999 while a few focused on response planning and hoped for the best. The requirements of the GDPR are well documented, but the likelihood and size of penalties are still unknown. Different companies take different approaches based on industry, geography, and individual risk tolerances. The only certainty is that everyone is watching for the first big consumer data breach in the EU in 2018 and hoping it isn\u2019t theirs.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 GDPR, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gdpr", "topic_name": "GDPR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/regulation", "topic_name": "regulation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ue", "topic_name": "UE"}]}, {"news_name": "Hackers demonstrated that it is too easy to bypass the Samsung S8 iris scanner.", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59381/hacking/samsung-s8-hacking.html", "title": "Hackers demonstrated that it is too easy to bypass the Samsung S8 iris scanner.\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 23, 2017", "body": "Security experts have once against bypassed mobile Biometric system installed on a mobile device, the Samsung S8 model.\n\nHackers used a camera, a printer and a contact lens to bypass the iris scanner installed on the Samsung S8.\n\nSome smartphones use facial recognition technology for user authentication, researchers from the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) demonstrated that is possible to easily bypass the scanner\u2019s protections and unlock the device.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had iris scanners that could be bypassed using a simple print-out,\u201d Linus Neumann, one of the experts who devised the hacking technique, told Motherboard in a Twitter direct message.\n\n\u201cThe Samsung Galaxy S8 is the first flagship smartphone with iris recognition.

Instead, however, the developer has introduced a number of diagnostic and debugging features to ensure that all keystrokes are either broadcasted through a debugging interface or written to a log file in a public directory on the hard-drive. This type of debugging turns the audio driver effectively into a keylogging spyware.

Internet users, in general, are worried about securing their data against the threats posed by hackers and the vulnerabilities in their favorite browsers.\n\nTalking about browsers, Chrome is one of the most used browsers in the world. There are many extensions developed for the Chrome browser that provides an added layer of security and privacy. Following is our review of the essential extensions for Chrome that can protect your online privacy.\n\n\n\nWhat sets PureVPN extension apart from all other privacy extensions is its completeness. While users need a different extension for each category of privacy they may be looking for, PureVPN is an all-in-one package. It blocks ads, provides malware protection, protection against hackers and viruses, and encrypts any data sent over the internet. Of course, it allows users to change their location as well, enabling them to access geo-restricted content too. This easy-to-use Chrome extension contains quick access features that make it one of the most trending extensions currently being used by thousands of users around the world.\n\nWhile this extension only provides partial security, it is a great tool for users who are looking for better and more secure ways of encrypting their communication. HTTPS Everywhere works with many popular websites, communication platforms, as well as social media platforms, making instant communications secure around the world. It has been developed as a joint venture between The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThis free chrome extension has a specialized built-in feature that allows users to make private searches and browse anonymously on Chrome. The developers claim that they do not collect any private information, IP addresses or search logs, which makes it secure. Along with the free Chrome extension, the developers have also created it as a web service, which makes it simpler to use and configure according to users\u2019 desired preferences.\n\nThis extension is known for its mysterious capabilities of revealing the \u201cinvisible\u201d web. It can display a list of all trackers, web bugs, pixels on the page, and beacons. The invisible web is used by hundreds of websites to gather behavioral data of different users and then target them with related ads. Advanced options in the extension also allow users to specifically identify whether someone is tracking their browsing activities. Despite the detailed insight that this extension can provide, it doesn\u2019t feature any tool to address the loopholes that compromise user data.\n\nAbout Author: Anas Baig\n\nAnas Baig is a Cyber Security Expert, a computer science graduate specializing in internet security, science, and technology.

But how does the law actually affect the average Australian internet user? What is metadata anyway? And what can you do to protect your metadata?\n\nRead on to get the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions following Australia\u2019s Data Retention Law.\n\nWhat Metadata Is?\n\nIn layman terms, Metadata is data about data. To put it more eloquently, Metadata describes a set of data, explaining how and when it was collected and by whom. It summarizes basic information about data, making it easier to find and work with particular instances of data.\n\nWhat\u2019s Included In The Metadata?\n\nMetadata isn\u2019t as much related to what you type on a handheld device or utter on the phone. Rather it is the trail of footprints you leave behind when you visit sites, download files, are online. Understandably, it can give ISPs, telecom companies, snoopers and government agencies everything about your internet activity.\n\nWhat People Says About Metadata Retention?\n\nIt is safe to say that when it comes to online privacy, the average internet user in Australian still doesn\u2019t grasp the implications of the new Data Retention law. In an interview with News.com.au, Dr Jake Goldenfein from Swinburne University of Technology explained,\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to your online data and the privacy protections afforded to it, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know. Unfortunately we just don\u2019t really know what ISPs are doing with data really. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being anonymised and sold, or the degree to which the data they collect is being regulated by privacy law because evidently it depends on the structure of the data bases through which it\u2019s retained.\u201d\n\nWhile the average internet user in Australia would identify freedom as a constitutional right, many are unable to relate the concept with online freedom and privacy.\n\nHowever, Digital Rights advocacy groups across Australia have proactively rallied against the law. They recently called for a \u201cNational Get A VPN Day\u201d to emphasize upon internet users the importance of protecting their personal data, and online privacy and freedom.\n\n\n\nHow To Protect Your Data From Metadata Retention Law?\n\nNow that you know the importance of Metadata in tracking your trail digital footprints, you should have also realized how easy it is for your ISP, Telecom Company or the Government to keep a tab on your online activity.\n\nHowever, there are many ways you can actually wipe out this digital trail and avoid any awkward encounters with the authorities. To completely avoid metadata retention, VPN is the most effective and the cheapest way to prevent your data from ISPs, telecom companies and Govt. Agencies. You can protect your data by getting the most secure VPN service such as IVACY VPN, which is considered the best VPN for Australia to stop Metadata Retention.\n\nHow VPN Helps You In Protecting Your Personal Information?\n\nSince all your data is encrypted during the data transfer process, there is no way it can be tracked or cracked by ISPs, telecom companies, government agencies or any other third-party for that matter.\n\nOnce you\u2019re connected to a VPN, the only information about you that your ISP will be able to see is that you\u2019re connected to a VPN server. All other personal information is encrypted with advanced security protocols of the VPN, making it impossible for your ISP to crack it.\n\nIt is understandable, therefore, why digital right groups in Australia promptly called for National Get A VPN Day right after the Data Retention law was passed.\n\nAbout Author: Anas Baig\n\nAnas Baig is a Cyber Security Expert, a computer science graduate specializing in internet security, science and technology.

Our attack is based on two observations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs example, Olejnik reminds us that many sites change the color of links once a user has visited them, then the expert used the ambient light sensors to detect these changes and access users\u2019 browsing history.\n\n\u201cFor privacy reasons, browsers lie to developers about the colors of links displayed on a page; otherwise a malicious developer could apply :visited styles and detect which websites are present in the user\u2019s history.\u201d continues Olejnik.\n\nThe expert highlighted that such kind of attack is very slow, it took 48 seconds to detect a 16-character text string and three minutes and twenty seconds to recognize a QR code.\n\n\u201cIn principle, browser sensors can deliver a 60 Hz readout rate. However, this does not mean that we can actually extract 60 bits per second \u2013 that\u2019s because the ultimate detection limit is tied to the rate at which a change in screen brightness can be detected by the sensor.\u201d explained Olejnik.\n\nIn the test conducted by the expert he and his team measured a screen brightness to readout latency of 200-300ms, and for a fully reliable exploit it\u2019s more realistic to assume one bit per 500ms.\n\nBelow examples of detection times obtainable at the above rate:\n\nThe good news is that the attack in some cases is not feasible because users would not keep a QR code on the screen for so long time.\n\nOlejnik also proposes a countermeasure to mitigate the attack by limiting the frequency of ambient light sensors readings by API and quantized their output. In this way, the countermeasure will not impact the activity of the sensors preventing any abuse.\n\n\u201cThe current proposal argues that the following protections are sufficient:\n\nPierluigi

hackers to gather data about owner\u2019s activities?\n\nA group of researchers from Newcastle University demonstrated that hackers can potentially guess PINs and passwords entered by the owner of the mobile device while authenticating itself on a website or an app. The technique devised by the experts has a surprising degree of accuracy, experts can monitor the angle and motion of the phone while the owner is typing a secret code.\n\nUnfortunately, mobile phones don\u2019t restrict websites and apps from accessing sensors\u2019 data.\n\n\u201cMost smartphones, tablets and other wearables are now equipped with a multitude of sensors, from the well-known GPS, camera, and microphone to instruments such as the gyroscope, proximity, NFC, and rotation sensors and accelerometer,\u201d reads the paper titled \u201cStealing PINs via mobile sensors: actual risk versus user perception\u201d that was published by the experts.\n\n\u201cBut because mobile apps and websites don\u2019t need to ask permission to access most of them, malicious programs can covertly \u2018listen in\u2019 on your sensor data and use it to discover a wide range of sensitive information about you such as phone call timing, physical activities and even your touch actions, PINs and passwords.\u201d\n\nResearchers were able to acquire data from around 25 sensors in a smartphone.\n\nBelow a video PoC of the attack devised by the researchers, the experts developed a malicious script to collect sensor data from an iOS device.\n\n\n\nThe script can be embedded in a mobile app or loaded on a website visited by the victims. This means that attackers just have to trick victims into visiting a malicious website either installing a malicious app.\n\nAt this point, everytime a victim types on the phone while visiting the website or using the malicious app in the background of the device, the malicious script will access data from the sensors and record information that could be used to guess a PIN or a password.\n\n\n\nResearchers were able to guess four-digit PINs on the first try with 74% accuracy and on the fifth try with 100% accuracy. These results were obtained using data logged from 50 devices and by using information collected from just motion and orientation sensors, these specific categories of sensors do not require any special permission to access.\n\nThe researchers reported their findings to leading browser providers such as Google and Apple, Mozilla and Safari have already partially fixed the issue.

In order to increase the awareness of user towards the possibility of data leakage and the importance of protecting personal data stored in smartphones, we developed: \u2018Privacy Guard\u2018.\n\nPrivacy Guard is an Android app that evaluates the risks of data privacy relying on the permissions requested by the apps installed on a device.\n\nPrivacy Guard was developed at Iswatlab (http://www.iswatlab.eu/?page_id=499), the cyber security lab of the Department of Engineering of the University of Sannio (Italy), from an idea of and under the supervision of Corrado Aaron Visaggio, which is the responsible of the lab and: Antonio Altieri, Fabrizio Giorgione, Alfredo Nazzaro, and Assunta Oropallo.\n\nOn the basis of our studies on malicious apps that exfiltrate sensitive data (http://www.iswatlab.eu/?p=461), we found out that both trusted apps and malicious apps take a lot of sensitive data. Such data can be then used for different purposes that produce revenue for the adversary who obtained it: to sell user\u2019s profile to a third party for marketing purposes, to feed OSINT platforms, to realize identity thefts or for accomplishing frauds and scams.\n\nThe point is that the user grants those permissions which allow the data exfiltration when installs the application on the device. The core problem is that the common user ignores completely the kind of permissions that are granted, and, what is more severe, ignores which risk a certain combination of permissions exposes her privacy too.\n\nIf an app requires the permission to send SMS and the permission to read contacts, SMS, and some other personal identifiable information stored in the device, it exposes the user to the possibility that the app sends that sensitive information to a third party by SMS.\n\nRelying on such observations, we created a model that identifies which apps have the most dangerous combination of permssions for data privacy.\n\nIt is important to remark that Privacy Guard does not evaluate if a data exfiltration happens on a device, but it just identifies those apps which require a combination of permissions that can be strong indicators of activities that affect data privacy preservation.\n\nPrivacy Guard is intended to first monitor the potential risks for a user\u2019s data privacy and, as second aim, to stimulate and increase the awareness of user towards the kind of apps she installs on her device, from a security perspective.\n\nLet\u2019s now look at how Privacy Guard works.\n\nPermissions have been grouped into categories and each permission has been assigned a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to describe its dangerousness.\n\nThe permissions have been divided into four categories:\n\nTo compute a value representing applications\u2019 data leakage capabilities the followed formula has been developed:\n\n                                                                (1) (Hn*Wh +Dn * Wd) * MAX(C)\n\nHowever, (1) to represent data leakage capabilities of applications is not enough: some permissions are far more dangerous if used in combination with other permissions. In order to take this into account, the hardware and data access categories have been divided into sub-categories:\n\nNetwork access                                                             Data Acquisition\n\nChange hardware configuration                               Personal data access\n\nNon-combinable\n\nThe communication permissions have been divided considering range and bandwidth. Every combination of this subcategories was considered, assigning a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to each combination. These values act as a penalty to the base score.range and bandwidth. Every combination of this subcategories was considered, assigning a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to each combination. These values act as a penalty to the base score.range and bandwidth. Every combination of .range and bandwidth. Every combination of this subcategories was considered, assigning a score, ranging from 1 to 10, to each combination. These values act as a penalty to the base score.\n\nFirst of all the application shows a message to synthesize the results and the list of all the applications with the related data leakage score, while if there are one or more applications that exceed a certain threshold, at the top of screen will be shown a message that indicates the number of applications that exceed this value.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible to explore the details of each app. Privacy Guard shows the list of all the activated permissions with a brief description. If one application requires a permission particularly suspect, the application shows a warning to explain at the user how that permission can be used for malicious purposes.\n\n\n\n \n\nIt\u2019s possible to explore the details of each app. Privacy Guard shows the list of all the activated permissions with a brief description.

Thankfully, fortifying your online privacy is not rocket science.\n\nWith the array of online encryption tools such as IP Changer software, Virtual Private Networks, and the popular Tor Browser, internet users are not short of options. Herein are some of the best ways to browse the internet securely and anonymously.\n\nThe Onion Router, abbreviated and more commonly known as Tor, is one of the most sought after online anonymity tools. Tor focuses on making your location untraceable by masking your IP address under layers and layers of smokescreen and encryption to cover up the origins of your connection.\n\nAlready, a sizeable percentage of the internet is already using the Tor Browser \u2013 a modified version of the Mozilla Firefox Browser \u2013 to keep their identities hidden while on the internet. Not only does it act as an IP changer, it also keeps trackers at bay. Tor can be described as the most user-friendly option in this list, and also the most all-encompassing encryption tool since it integrates more than one encryption technique in the form of browser extensions to give users comprehensive online security. Being an open-source project, it is also completely free.\n\nHowever, using the Tor browser will still require you to change your online behavior in order to retain maximum anonymity. It comes with a number of warnings, tips, and tricks that every privacy-conscious individual should follow when browsing the internet. Tor is not without its limitations but has so far proved to be the most viable option for people of all calibers.Tor is not without its limitations but has so far proved to be the most viable option for people of all calibers.\n\nVPNs are considered heavy-duty online anonymity tools for a reason. These services focus on helping users to disguise their traffic in addition to keeping their IP addresses hidden whenever they connect to the internet. They are also considered powerful IP changer software. VPNs are only able to encrypt internet traffic, though, meaning that users\u2019 ISPs will still be able to see how much traffic you generate from website to website, but will not be able to see the actual content. The same applies to snooping governments and any malicious parties who may wish to steal your vital information such as login credentials.\n\nThe only catch is that a good VPN service will cost you. However, the expense can often be overlooked because this technique does not have a lot of weaknesses. If you\u2019re living in a country where the government has sanctioned the blocking of all VPN connections, there are stealth VPNs that will allow you to browse the internet undetected. As such, VPNs are the preferred option for people living in countries with extreme internet censorship and heavy government surveillance.\n\n\n\nFor much lighter, but just as effective online privacy, users can always choose to install a privacy-centric browser extension. At the top of the list of extensions users can get is Ghostery, which is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, and EFF\u2019s Privacy Badger. Unlike VPNs and Tor, browser extensions will not function as IP changer software since they do not hide your IP address.\n\nThe only notable difference between the two extensions is that Ghostery is more hands-on than Privacy Badger is. With Ghostery, you are allowed to tweak your privacy settings, such as which trackers to block. It also allows you to see all the trackers that are being used on you for every website that you visit, allowing you to choose which websites to show your information to and which to block out completely. It is quite handy when it comes to keeping advertisers from logging your information.\n\nPrivacy Badger, on the other hand, is a bit more intuitive than the former option. This extension monitors websites that are tracking your browsing habits and either block out the websites in total or keeps their tracking methods from working on you. Despite being based on an ad-blocking codebase, it does a lot more than just keep you safe from annoying ads. Its intuitive design allows it to learn from your browsing habits, meaning that you don\u2019t have to constantly adjust the settings.\n\nIP bans are the primary reason why people change their IP addresses. Whether a certain online service is not yet available in your country or you have been explicitly banned from a specific website, changing your IP address can be a viable way of gaining access to the website.\n\nMethods range from the fairly complicated manual method, which involves resetting your modem or using different devices, to downloading IP changer software.\n\nThe latter option is often preferred over the former. IP changer software can be used to change your IP address multiple times even if you\u2019re using the same device. Unlike other encryption services, however, IP changer software only alters your real IP address. The IP changer software will not mask your traffic or help you block any trackers; it simply displays a different IP address than the one that is actually assigned to you.\n\nYou might opt for IP changer software if your privacy needs are basic. It simply throws off your ISP and government on your real location, sometimes helping you circumvent government-imposed censorship and other bans put in place by your ISP. IP changer software is by no means a comprehensive option like Tor or VPNs, but it does work. You can choose from a wide range of IP changer software on the internet, or alternatively, you can go for a VPN service that provides the IP changer option to keep your real location well under wraps.\n\nEven as the whole internet is in the process of fully adopting SSL, there is still a notable percentage that does not support the security protocol. It is essential in keeping web traffic free from malicious interceptors. Web sites that still display unencrypted connections by default are significantly less safe.\n\nThe HTTPS browser extension allows users to force an HTTPS connection on countless websites. However, since it depends on the website users are connecting to, it is still a viable solution despite not being the best option in this list.\n\nMany of these privacy-centric tools and software rely on IP changing tactics, masking your traffic, or securing your connections via a number of channels. You might not think you\u2019re a target for hackers, but based on the indiscriminate hacking that is going on nowadays, it pays to take precautions.\n\nWritten by Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at Cyberogism.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is a tech and security enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

The rules prohibit ISPs from sharing user data with third parties without the user\u2019s explicit consent. The set of rules also requires ISPs to implement \u201creasonable measures\u201d to protect data from cyber threats.\n\nBack to the present, the FCC announced the suspension of the privacy rules just before they came into effect.\n\n\u201c\u201dUntil that happens, however, we will work together on harmonizing the FCC\u2019s privacy rules for broadband providers with the FTC\u2019s standards for other companies in the digital economy. Accordingly, the FCC today stayed one of its rules before it could take effect on March 2.\u201d reads a joint statement of FCC chairman Ajit Pai And Acting FTC chairman Maureen K. Ohlhausen on protecting Americans\u2019 online privacy.\n\n \u201cThis rule is not consistent with the FTC\u2019s privacy framework. The stay will remain in place only until the FCC is able to rule on a petition for reconsideration of its privacy rules.\u201d\n\nThis means that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can use customers\u2019 data for the commercial purposes.\n\nConsider that ISPs are a sort of sentinel of the Internet, from their point of view it is possible to monitor users\u2019 activities and profile them.\n\nData collected on the users then are shared with advertising firms for commercial purposes.\n\nAjit Pai is the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, he was designated Chairman by President Donald Trump in January 2017.\n\nAjit Pai is known as an opponent of the net neutrality, he publicly defined it \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nPai is arguing that the privacy rules favored IT tech giants like Google and Facebook, which are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), over ISPs like Verizon and Comcast.\n\n\n\nSo, he is asking for the equity in the treatment for IT firms by the FTC and the FCC.\n\n\u201cAll actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, enforced by the same agency.\u201d FCC said in a statement.\n\nThe FCC will block new privacy rules because it will never go in contrast with IT giants like Google and Facebook on the way they commercialize users\u00ec data, it is likely the FCC would never restore those suspended rules on ISPs.\n\nStay Tuned!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 FCC, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fcc", "topic_name": "FCC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isps", "topic_name": "ISPs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "Trolling, Doxing & Cyberstalking: Cybercrime & The Law", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56841/laws-and-regulations/trolling-doxing-cyberstalking-cybercrime-law.html", "title": "Trolling, Doxing & Cyberstalking: Cybercrime & The Law\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 3, 2017", "body": "According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), \u201ccybercrime is one of the greatest threats facing our country and has enormous implications for our national security, economic prosperity, and public safety. The range of threats and the challenges they present for law enforcement expand just as rapidly as technology evolves.\u201d\n\n\n\nCyberstalking\n\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) released a report in 2016 which stated that, \u201cunder the federal cyberstalking statute, \u2018cyberstalking\u2019 includes any course of conduct or series of acts taken by the perpetrator on the Internet that place the victim in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury, or causes, attempts to cause, or would be reasonably expected to cause substantial emotional distress to the victim or the victim\u2019s immediate family. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A (2015). However, there are a number of federal statutes that may apply in cyberstalking situations.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s Office of Victims of Crime cites the following common elements of  cyberstalking:\n\nMichigan was the first state to charge someone with online stalking. There are laws at both the state and federal levels that can be applied to cyberstalking.\n\n\u201cStalking, threats, and harassment offenses used to to be primarily local law enforcement matters. But with the increased use of technology and the multi-jurisdictional nature of many of these offenses, federal law enforcement and prosecutors can offer additional resources to effectively pursue these cases that may exceed the capacity of local law enforcement.\u201d\n\nZane D. Memeger, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania wrote that, \u201ca very important tool in our effort to combat stalking and threats via the Internet is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c), which makes it a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, to transmit any communication in interstate or foreign commerce containing a threat to injure the person of another.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, there were several federal cyberstalking convictions.\n\nA cyberstalking conviction can have a significant impact\u2013on your finances, reputation, ability to get a job and your freedom. Even if you are not incarcerated, a conviction can have negative impact on your parental rights and can disqualify you from employment in certain settings, such as hospitals and schools.\n\nDoxing\n\nDoxing is the process of gathering identifiable information about an individual or group of people, with the objective to shame, scare, blackmail, defame, bully or endanger the target.\n\nWhile some individuals perform doxing out of general curiosity about a person or company, others have less honorable motives. The motives may include revenge, extortion, or embarrassment. But, publicly posting an individual\u2019s personal details is often done with the knowledge that it could potentially put the targeted individual in danger, particularly if the person is a law enforcement officer, an undercover agent or a high profile individual.\n\nFurther, a dox is likely to drag the families and sometimes friends of the target into the fray. Sadly, this sometimes includes children.\n\nOccasionally, doxing sets the target up for further cybercrimes including identity theft, credit card and/or debit card fraud, phishing, hacking or other cyber crimes.\n\nPosting personal information publicly with the intent to shame, defame, harass or endanger is illegal. It places the doxed individual in a potentially dangerous situation. The federal law often utilized to address doxing is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A:\n\n\u201cTitle 18, United States Code, Section 2261A is the federal stalking statute. Section\n\n2261A(1) covers in-person stalking and Section 2261A(2) covers cyberstalking\u2014 stalking that occurs using Internet or telephones\u2014as well as stalking that occurs using the mail. Section 2261(2), originally enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, has two main provisions\u2014Subsections (A) and (B):\n\nAlso, if you dox someone using a service such as Facebook, Twitter or WordPress you may be in violation of the service\u2019s Terms of Service.\n\nIn the case of a group of individuals involved in the gathering of information, publicly posting it, sharing it or using it to harass the victim, under certain circumstances the act of one conspirator may be treated, by law, as an act of all involved. This means that all the conspirators may be held accountable for the acts committed by any one or more of them even though they did not all personally participate in that act themselves.  This is particularly important in cases in which cyberstalking, including doxing, leads to the murder of the targeted individual:\n\n\u201cIn the case of a jointly undertaken activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that was both:\n\nIt has been argued that it is reasonably foreseeable that publicly posting someone\u2019s personal information could endanger that individual and/or members of their family.\n\nCertain individuals have additional protection from doxing, under the law. This would include jurors, witnesses, court officers, informants and some state and local officers:\n\n\u201c(a)In General.\u2014Whoever knowingly makes restricted personal information about a covered person, or a member of the immediate family of that covered person, publicly available\u2014\n\nshall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n\n(b) Definitions.\u2014In this section\u2014\n\n(1) the term \u201crestricted personal information\u201d means, with respect to an individual, the Social Security number, the home address, home phone number, mobile phone number, personal email, or home fax number of, and identifiable to, that individual;\n\n(2) the term \u201ccovered person\u201d means\u2014\n\n(A) an individual designated in section 1114;\n\n(B) a grand or petit juror, witness, or other officer in or of, any court of the United States, or an officer who may be, or was, serving at any examination or other proceeding before any United States magistrate judge or other committing magistrate;\n\n(C) an informant or witness in a Federal criminal investigation or prosecution; or\n\n(D) a State or local officer or employee whose restricted personal information is made publicly available because of the participation in, or assistance provided to, a Federal criminal investigation by that officer or employee\u201d\n\nDisclosing the identity of an individual working undercover is also often against the law. Anyone who doxes someone who is working undercover for the federal government is in violation of federal law. Those who are protected by this law include intelligence officers, agents, informants, and sources.\n\n\u201cWhoever, in the course of a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents and with reason to believe that such activities would impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States, discloses any information that identifies an individual as a covert agent to any individual not authorized to receive classified information, knowing that the information disclosed so identifies such individual and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such individual\u2019s classified intelligence relationship to the United States, shall be fined not more than $15,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u201d\n\nIt is also a bad idea to tip someone off that they are the focus of a federal investigation:\n\n\u201cObstruction of Justice by \u2018Tip-Off\u2019\n\nAlthough an individual who obstructs a federal investigation by tipping off the targets of the investigation is likely to incur liability either as a principal under 18 U.S.C. 2 or as an accessory after the fact under 18 U.S.C. 3, there are several federal anti-tip-off statutes like \u00a71510, which prohibits bank officials from notifying suspects that they are under investigation, and which imposes a similar restriction on insurance company officers and employees.\n\n(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who \u2026 (e) (i) intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, intercepted by means authorized by subsections 2511(2)(a)(ii), 2511(2)(b) to (c), 2511(2)(e), 2516, and 2518 of this chapter, (ii) knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of such a communication in connection with a criminal investigation, (iii) having obtained or received the information in connection with a criminal investigation, and (iv) with intent to improperly obstruct, impede, or interfere with a duly authorized criminal investigation \u2026 (4)(a) \u2026 shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both,\u201d 18 U.S.C.2511(1)(e), (4)(a).\u201d\n\nThis includes social media posts that would provide warning to a suspect or suspects that they are being investigated by the federal government.\n\nCyberstalking & Doxing Cases\n\nThe Psychology of Trolls & Cyberstalkers\n\nResearchers from Winnipeg found clear evidence that trolling is associated specifically with sadism and to a lesser degree with Machiavellianism. The researchers also found that trolls who admit to being sadistic report that they tend to troll because they find it to be pleasurable.\n\nCyberstalkers, however, are often propelled by the presence of personality disorders, poor emotional control, and antisocial tendencies.\n\nWhile trolls take pleasure in their behavior, cyberstalkers are more likely to be \u201chighly distressed and angry with the victim. While they may get secondary pleasure from it, stalkers who intimidate or threaten usually have the very specific purpose of expressing their negative feelings and making the victim feel as bad as they do.\u201d\n\nTrolls are in it for fun but a cyberstalker tends to be more emotionally invested in pursuing the victim. Ignoring a troll will generally make them go away, but ignoring a cyberstalker can produce an escalation in the stalking behavior. If it gets to that point, it\u2019s time to consider involving law enforcement.\n\nHelp for Victims\n\nThe DOJ has issued recommendations for people who believe they are victims of cyberstalking. The first step should be to demand the stalker to cease all contact and stop the harassing actions. Additionally, in order to facilitate prosecution of the perpetrator, the victim should:\n\nAdditionally, the LookingGlass Special Investigations Unit recommends:\n\nPay close attention to messages containing attachments or links to other websites; they may be infected\n\nWritten by: CandiceLanier\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 doxing, law)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberstalking", "topic_name": "Cyberstalking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/doxing", "topic_name": "doxing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trolling", "topic_name": "Trolling"}]}, {"news_name": "ReBreakCaptcha \u2013 How to breaking Google\u2019s ReCaptcha v2 using Google\u2019s APIs", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56816/hacking/rebreakcaptcha-google-recaptcha-hacking.html", "title": "ReBreakCaptcha \u2013 How to breaking Google\u2019s ReCaptcha v2 using Google\u2019s APIs\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 2, 2017", "body": "East-Ee Security proposed a proof of concept bypass of the Google\u2019s reCaptcha V2 verification system dubbed ReBreakCaptcha.

It\u2019s not unusual to find garbage, corrupt data, mislabeled data or just crazy non-conforming data\u2026but the format of the data this time was confusing enough that I spent some time trying to debug what had gone wrong, wondering if it was a bug in my code. In fact, the data was bizarre enough that some colleagues around the Project Zero office even got intrigued.\u201d Ormandy wrote in a security advisory. \u201cWe fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major cloudflare-hosted sites from other users. Once we understood what we were seeing and the implications, we immediately stopped and contacted cloudflare security.\u201d\n\nCloudflare have been leaking customer HTTPS sessions for months. Uber, 1Password, FitBit, OKCupid, etc. https://t.co/wjwE4M3Pbk\n\n\u2014 Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) February 23, 2017\n\n\n\nThe Cloudbleed security issue in Cloudflare servers has a significant impact on numerous major organizations, including Uber, Fitbit, 1Password, and OKCupid. Cloudbleed also affects mobile apps, because, they are developed using the same backends as browsers for content delivery and HTTPS (SSL/TLS) termination.\n\n\u201cLast Friday, Tavis Ormandy from Google\u2019s Project Zero contacted Cloudflare to report a security problem with our edge servers. He was seeing corrupted web pages being returned by some HTTP requests run through Cloudflare.\u201d reads a blog post published by Cloudflare\u2019s CTO, John Graham-Cumming\n\n\u201cIt turned out that in some unusual circumstances, which I\u2019ll detail below, our edge servers were running past the end of a buffer and returning memory that contained private information such as HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data. And some of that data had been cached by search engines.\u201d\n\n\n\nGoogle has started removing cached copies of the leaked data, unfortunately, the same information is still stored in the servers of many other search engines that are accessible to everyone.\n\nCloudflare promptly responded to the incident, the company disabled the following features on its infrastructure because they leverage the broken HTML parser chain that is the root cause of the issue:\n\nThe root cause of Cloudbleed was that \u201creaching the end of a buffer was checked using the equality operator and a pointer was able to step past the end of the buffer.\u201d \u201cHad the check been done using >= instead of == jumping over the buffer end would have been caught,\u201d explained Cumming.\n\nThe Cloudbleed issue dates back September 22, 2016, when the problem begun for the company. The greatest period of impact was between February 13 and February 18 with almost one in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests via Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage, (roughly 0.00003% of requests).\n\n\u201cThe bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines. We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence.\u201d continues the post published by Cloudflare. \u201cThe greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage (that\u2019s about 0.00003% of requests).\u201d\n\nIt is very curious the fact that Cloudflare pointed Ormandy to the company bug bounty programme, offering the expert a reward of a t-shirt instead of financial compensation.\n\nWe cannot exclude that a threat actor discovering the Cloudbleed flaw may have been actively exploiting it, but at the time I was writing there is no evidence of such kind of attacks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cloudbleed , hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloudbleed", "topic_name": "Cloudbleed"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloudflare", "topic_name": "CloudFlare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-leak", "topic_name": "data leak"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "German regulators ban the My Friend Cayla doll fearing it is surveillance device", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56406/digital-id/my-friend-cayla-ban.html", "title": "German regulators ban the My Friend Cayla doll fearing it is surveillance device\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 18, 2017", "body": "German regulators have banned \u2018My Friend Cayla,\u2019 an internet-connected doll that can chat with our children.

When the user deletes a record on one device, it will disappear on all other devices in a few seconds when the devices are connected to the Internet.\n\nUsers can set iCloud to store their browsing history, in this way it will be available from all the user\u2019s connected devices. The researchers discovered that even if the user deletes the history, iCloud doesn\u2019t actually erase it but keeps it in a format invisible to the user.\n\n\u201cHowever, those same records will be kept in Apple iCloud for much longer. In fact, we were able to access records dated more than one year back. The user does not see those records and does not know they still exist on Apple servers.\u201d reads a blog post published by the Elcomsoft\u2019s CEO Vladimir Katalov. \n\n\u201cIn fact, we were able to access records dated more than one year back,\u201d \n\nThe experts used the Elcomsoft Phone Breaker forensic tool to extract files from an iCloud account.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIn order to extract Safari history from iCloud it is necessary to be authenticated into the user\u2019s Apple ID. The operation can be carried on using login credentials or by using an authentication token extracted from the user\u2019s computer. The authentication tokens are automatically created by iCloud Control Panel on Windows and Mac computers that were synced with iCloud.\n\nThe Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can be used by experts to extract iCloud authentication tokens.\n\n\u201cBy using the token to log in, you\u2019ll bypass both the password and the secondary authentication prompt if two-factor authentication is enabled on the user\u2019s account. As a result, iCloud access alert will not be delivered to the user.\u201d states the post.\n\nBelow the procedure to extract Safari browsing history from iCloud with Elcomsoft Phone Breaker:\n\n\n\nThe forensic implication of the discovery is serious because it implies the possibility to conduct surveillance activity as explained in the post.\n\n\u201cForensic use of synced data is hard to underestimate. Unlike cloud backups that are created daily at best, iCloud sync works nearly in real-time. Being able to track suspect\u2019s activities almost no delay can be invaluable for surveillance and investigations.\u201d states Katalov.\n\n\u201cSince deleting browsing history from iCloud is nearly impossible for the user, discovering illicit activities becomes much easier. Experts will be able to recover visits to extremist and other illicit Web sites even if the suspect deletes their browser history or wipes their iPhone.\u201d\n\nKeeping a copy of a user\u2019s browser history can certainly be \u201cinvaluable for surveillance and investigations,\u201d Katalov said. But it\u2019s unclear if Apple knew that its iCloud service was storing the deleted records.\n\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment, but experts from Elcomsoft noticed that after they disclosed the issue, Apple started \u201cpurging\u201d older browser history records from iCloud.\n\n\u201cwe have informed media about this issue in advance, and they reached Apple for comments. As far as we know, Apple has not responded, but started purging older history records. For what we know, they could be just moving them to other servers, making deleted records inaccessible from the outside; but we never know for sure. Either way, as of right now, for most iCloud accounts we can see history records for the last two weeks only (deleted records for those two weeks are still there though).\u201d states the blog post.

As it requires network connectivity it can cause users to make network requests without consent when opening a media file such as a video file or audio file. WMV is using Microsoft Advanced Systems Format (ASF) to store audio and video as objects. This file format consists of objects that are labelled by GUID and packed together to make a media package.\u201d reads the analysis published on myhackerhouse.com.\n\nSimplifying the problem, DRM-protected content has to fetch a license key from a server in order to be displayed. Windows raises a dialogue to the user is the content If isn\u2019t signed properly.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, this warning DOES NOT appear if the DRM license has been signed correctly and the Digital Signature Object, Content Encryption Object and Extended Content Encryption Object contain the appropriate cryptographic signing performed by an authorised Microsoft License Server profile\u201d\n\n\n\nResearchers at Hacker House highlighted that Microsoft requests an expensive fee to users that want to sign media.\n\n\u201cDRM is expensive business and unless you use the SDK to develop your own application you will likely need to make use of a license provider to encrypt your WMV files using these tools and also for signing purposes. If you want to build your own Microsoft DRM signing solution the price-tag is around $10,000.\u201d states Hacker House.\n\nThe experts have discovered online serviced managing to generate signed content avoiding a so expensive payment. These Windows DRM providers that could be used to sign user media can decloak Tor users.\n\n\u201cThere are several free DRM providers who could sign your media for you however as the barrier to entry to the DRM market is the aforementioned price tag, it makes you wonder how these files are being signed in the wild!\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cAs these \u201csigned WMV\u201d files do not present any alert to a user before opening them they can be used quite effectively to decloak users of the popular privacy tool TorBrowser with very little warning\u201d, they write.\n\nExperts at the Tor Project are aware of the possibility that hackers track Windows Tor users leveraging on Windows DRM issue. They invite users to run Tails if they need to run media files.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Windows DRM, Tor)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-rights-management", "topic_name": "Digital Rights Management"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/windows-drm", "topic_name": "Windows DRM"}]}, {"news_name": "How much trust do you put into your Gmail inbox messages?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55931/hacking/gmail-inbox-security.html", "title": "How much trust do you put into your Gmail inbox messages?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 3, 2017", "body": "1.    Introduction\n\nTaking good care of e-mail messages is certainly among the first recommendations of any information security policy and user awareness program. The involved risks range from SPAM to Spear Phishing attacks, generally aimed to steal information or infect the victim\u2019s computer. Most malicious messages are filtered by anti-\u201ceverything\u201d engines before ever being delivered to the user\u2019s mailbox, although some bypass those filters and require the user\u2019s perspicacity to be detected.\n\nGenerally, our trust on the technology security filters is proportional to the reputation of the service provider. The higher our belief on the provider, the lower tends to be our attention to the risks. Given the high trust we have on Gmail we tend to believe that all messages that fall into our inbox are legit and safe.\n\nIt turns out that, based on our findings this week at Morphus Labs, this \u201ctrust\u201d logic should be revisited. We realized that a message that appears in your Gmail inbox folder even with an important sign, coming from one of your Gmail contacts with no spoof or security alert, may have been forged and impersonated by a fraudster or a cybercriminal. As few people may be aware of this possibility, we decided to shed light on this problem with this article.\n\nThis document is divided into four parts. First, it presents a contextualization on e-mail spoofing. Then, it passes through to our e-mail spoofing experiment scenarios involving Gmail and Yahoo. Next, it presents an extra Gmail behavior and finally, it presents advices on how users could identify Gmail spoofed messages and final words.\n\n2.   E-mail Spoofing\n\nIn this section, we will pass through some SMTP concepts and how e-mail sender spoofing occurs. If you are familiar with those concepts, you can skip to the next section.\n\nThe Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the standard protocol used for email transmission over the Internet. Considering the technology evolution rate and today\u2019s security requirements, we may say that this protocol is, at least, anachronistic. Its first version was defined in 1982 by the RFC 821 [1] and has not evolved much since \u2013 mainly in security aspects.\n\nAs stated in the previous paragraph, the SMTP protocol defines the message transport, not the message content. It defines, therefore, the mail envelop and its parameters, such as the message sender and recipient. The message content (body) and headers are defined by the standard STD 11 (RFC 5322) [2].\n\nBasically, a SMTP transaction consists of three commands:\n\nMail From: establish the message return address in case of delivery failure;\n\nRcpt to: establish the message recipient. In case of multiple recipients, this command may be repeated for each one;\n\nData: this command sign the SMTP server to receive the content of the message which consists of the message headers and body.\n\nTo make it clear, let\u2019s look at a very basic sample of a SMTP transaction in the Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Simple SMTP transaction sample\n\nNote that the directive \u201cFrom:\u201d is part of the message content and is normally equivalent to the value used in the SMTP command \u201cmail from:\u201d, but not necessarily. Its value can be freely specified by the system or person issuing commands to the SMTP server. Using the same sample, but now spoofing the message sender, it would be enough to change the \u201cFrom: \u201c to the desired value, as seen in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: A sample SMTP transaction with a spoofed sender\n\nIn this case, the message delivered to recipient@domain.com will look like it has been sent by SpoofedSender@anydomain.com rather than sender@domain.com. This open space for message impersonation or sender spoofing. And this is exactly the way it is done by cybercriminals or fraudsters to trick its victims to click on malicious links, for example.\n\nNote that by using this kind of impersonation, if the recipient replies the message, it will be delivered to the spoofed address. For the example above, it would be delivered to SpoofedSener@anydomain.com.\n\nIt turns out that changing the \u201cFrom:\u201d to the desired value will almost certainly trig the recipient\u2019s mail server anti-spam or anti-phishing to reject or quarantine the sent. If the message bypasses those filters, it will depend on the recipient to detect that the message was forged by analyzing the message headers.\n\nTrying to avoid those filters, some spammers configure ad-hoc mail servers in a way to send spoofed messages on behalf of a certain domain by changing the \u201cMail from:\u201d SMTP command and \u201cFrom:\u201d header to the desired value. This spoof strategy can be combated by the owners of the Internet domain by applying spoofing protection mechanisms, like SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) and DMARC (Domain Message Authentication Reporting & Conformance). By using SPF, for example, you can specify the IP addresses of the mail servers that are allowed to send e-mail messages on behalf of your domain. Once this policy is stablished, it will be up to the recipient\u2019s mail server to check the policy and reject messages coming from non-authorized servers.\n\n3. Experiments\n\nAfter some basic concepts on SMTP protocol and how e-mail spoofing occurs, it\u2019s time to check the resilience of Gmail and Yahoo against mail spoofing. We are going impersonate the \u201cFrom:\u201c message header value. The \u201cMail from:\u201d SMTP command will be issued using an address of a generic domain owned by us.\n\nFor the experiments, we created a very simple scenario:\n\nLet\u2019s get started.\n\n3.1. Trying to spoof without SPF\n\nIn this experiment, we are going to try this scenario:\n\nFigure 3: No SPF policy associated to the experiment domain\n\n3.1.1. Trying to spoof a Gmail to Gmail message\n\nThis experiment itself consisted in sending an e-mail message to temporaryrecipient@gmail.com pretending to be from temporarysender@gmail.com. It is to be observed that email@our-generic-domain.com was set as the \u201cMail from:\u201d SMTP parameter while the \u201cFrom:\u201d header was set to the forged value temporarysender@gmail.com, as seen in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Trying to spoof Gmail to Gmail message with no SPF policy\n\nAs the result of this experiment (Figure 5), the Gmail servers rejected our spoofed message (ID: 7A14D2452C) with the error code 421-4.7.0 followed by the message \u201cTo protect our users from spam, mail sent from your IP address has been temporarily rate limited.\u201d We can also see the error 421-4.7.0 and the message \u201cOur system has detected that this message is suspicious due to the very low reputation of the sending IP address.\u201d.\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Gmail servers rejecting the spoofed message\n\n3.1.2. Trying to spoof a Yahoo to Yahoo message\n\nNow, let\u2019s see what happened in the Yahoo spoofing scenario. Similarly to Gmail scenario, we tried to send a message to temporaryrecipient@yahoo.com pretending it to be from temporarysender@yahoo.com, as seen in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Trying to spoof Gmail to Gmail message with no SPF policy\n\nAs the result for this experiment, we verified that our Postfix mail server couldn\u2019t deliver the message (ID 4259245CE). The error 421-4.7.0 followed by the message \u201csuspicious due to the very low reputation of the sending IP address\u201d was triggered as seen in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7: Mail rejected by Yahoo servers during the spoofed message delivery\n\n3.2. Trying to spoof with SPF\n\nIn this experiment, we are going to try this scenario:\n\nFigure 8: SPF policy allowing our SMTP Server\n\n3.2.1. Trying to spoof a Gmail to Gmail message\n\nAs the previous experiment, we try to send an e-mail message to temporaryrecipient@gmail.com pretending to be from temporarysender@gmail.com. In the Figure 9, you can see the commands issued to our SMTP server in order to send the spoofed message.\n\nFigure 9: Spoofing Gmail to Gmail with SPF policy allowing our SMTP server\n\nIn Figure 10, you can see the logs from our SMTP server while delivering the message (ID EBE852452C) to Gmail servers.\n\nFigure 10 \u2013 SMTP logs\n\nUnlike what happened when the SPF policy wasn\u2019t authorizing our SMTP server, this time Gmail servers accepted our message delivery. Remains to know if the message was tagged as SPAM or something like that. To our surprise, the message was delivered to the recipient\u2019s inbox folder, as seen in Figure 11. We got really surprised about that.\n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Spoofed message in the recipient\u2019s inbox folder\n\nAs you can see in Figure 12, by opening the message, the only detail that may draw the user\u2019s attention to a suspicious \u201cnon-Gmail\u201d message is the \u201cvia our-generic-domain.com\u201d near the sender\u2019s address. As it\u2019s not an alert and it doesn\u2019t have any warn sign, users may not pay enough attention to this detail and believe the message is legit. It\u2019s important to note that if the user receives this message on iOS mobile app, this detail does not even appears as shown in Figure 13. The Gmail app for Android offers user the option to see the security details of the message.\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Spoofed message in the Gmail Web app\n\nFigure 13 \u2013 The spoofed message seen from the Gmail iPhone mobile app\n\nBy observing the message headers, in Figure 14, we can see that the SPF check PASS and besides the unsuccessful DMARC check, the e-mail was properly delivered to the inbox folder of the recipient. Technically speaking, the DMARC test depends on SPF and DKIM tests. If both tests return Ok, DMARC will PASS. [3]\n\nSimilarly to SPF, DMARC is a configuration done at DNS zone level that informs what the recipient\u2019s e-mail server should do with a message that does not comply to its policy. If it should be \u201crejected\u201d to drop the message, \u201cquarantine\u201d to isolate the message or \u201cnone\u201d if you want to inform that the message should be delivered.\n\nFigure 15: Spoofing Yahoo to Yahoo with SPF polity SMTP transaction\n\nUnlike Gmail, Yahoo rejected our spoofed message during the SMTP transaction with the error 554 5.7.9 followed by the message \u201cMessage not accepted for policy reasons.\u201d. It is not clear, but the message was probably blocked because of the @yahoo.com e-mail address in \u201cFrom:\u201d message header sent from a non-Yahoo server.\n\nFigure 16 \u2013 Spoofed message rejected by Yahoo servers\n\n3.3.  Trying to spoof message between corporative domains hosted by Google Apps\n\nGiven we had success spoofing messages between @gmail.com accounts, we became curious if the same strategy would work for corporative domains hosted by Google. For this scenario we had help from two companies that host their e-mails with Google and tried to send a spoofed message between user accounts.\n\nThe same steps from section 3.2.1 (spoofing Gmail to Gmail with SPF) were used. The results in this more sensitive scenario showed us concerning results. Not only the message was delivered without security warnings to the recipient\u2019s inbox folder, but also the spoofed account profile picture.\n\n3.4. Extra findings\n\nDuring our experiments, we\u2019ve found a curious scenario in which Gmail detects the spoofed message. It happened when we tried to spoof an address that apparently does not exists on Gmail user base.\n\nIn this situation, unlike the successful scenarios, Gmail forwarded the message to Spam folder and adds a special security alert informing that they could not verify if the message was really sent by gmail.com, as seen in Figure 17.\n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Behavior when the spoofed sender is a non-existing Gmail account\n\nTake a look at the same message at the Gmail app for iOS on Figure 18. Beyond the alert, it shows a fish hook icon as an allusion to a phishing attack.\n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Spoofed message on Google mobile app for iOS\n\nAnother interesting finding is related the spoofed email avatar. Google loads the real spoofed email associated profile image, which increases the legitimacy perception by the message recipient, as seem in the Figure below.\n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Spoofed sender profile picture\n\n4. How to identify Gmail spoofed messages\n\nGiven the spoofed message is delivered to your inbox, without security warning, may have been flagged as important, shows the picture associated with the spoofed email and may not show that the message was sent through a non-google server, what can an user do to protect itself?\n\nIn this section, we give advices on how users may identify Gmail spoofed messages and avoid risks.\n\n4.1. Examine message details on Gmail\n\nBe aware of messages in your inbox coming from \u201c@gmail.com\u201d via another servers or domains. Normally, @gmail.com messages are delivered directly from the Gmail servers. Unfortunately, the \u201cvia\u201d tag is available only in Gmail Web Application. In the mobile (Android and iOS) apps this information is not present making it harder to identify fake messages.\n\nAdditionally, you may take a look at the message details. This feature is available at Gmail Web application by clicking on the \u201cdown-arrow\u201d near \u201cto me\u201d, as in Figure 20\n\nFigure 20 \u2013 Examining message details\n\n4.2. Examine message source\n\nBy examining the message details, you may notice the first signs of a spoofed message, but, only by examining the full message headers you can make sure about that.\n\nYou can access the message source by clicking on the drop down button near the \u201creply\u201d button on Gmail Web application and choosing the \u201cShow original\u201d option as seen in the Figure 21.\n\nFigure 21 \u2013 Opening message source/original\n\nNote that the value of the field \u201cReturn-Path\u201d in the message headers is an address of a non-Gmail domain. The value in this field is exactly the same used in the \u201cMail from: \u201c SMTP command when we forged this message.\n\nSo, suspect Gmail messages you receive with improper address on this field, as seen in Figure 22.\n\nFigure 22 \u2013 Observing the message source\n\nIt is worth noting that, as Gmail marks messages with the \u201cvia\u201d tag, obviously there are situations in which the message was sent by another mail server and yet is legit. Thus, not all messages marked with the \u201cvia\u201d tag are malicious.\n\n4.3. Report malicious or spam messages to Gmail\n\nFinally, as you identify malicious or spoofed messages, report it to Gmail. By doing this, you will help Gmail improve its message filters.  The report spam/phishing functions are available on the drop down button near the \u201creply\u201d button on the Gmail Web application.\n\n5. Final considerations\n\nAs we can see, if you have a \u201cself-authorized-email-server\u201d by your own domain SPF policy, you can deliver spoofed messages pretending to be any existing @gmail.com address to the inbox folder of any other @gmail.com account with no security warning.\n\nAs per the results of section 3.3, it was also possible to spoof messages between corporative domains hosted by Google Apps. Beyond the malicious actions that may target a regular Gmail account, this possibility may put at risk entire businesses.\n\nWe\u2019ve privately contacted Google Security team informing the possibilities that we have found and the potential impact to users. They gave us a rapid feedback informing that our submission won\u2019t be tracked as a security bug.\n\nAlthough it has not been considered a security bug, in our opinion, it would be better if Gmail could at least adopt the same behavior we saw when trying to spoof a non-existing Gmail account. The alerts used in this case could prevent users from a variety of malicious actions. Additionally, we suggest to add the possibility to view message security details within the Gmail IOS app, as today users have no options to verify if they are being spoofed.\n\nIt\u2019s worth to mention that, as per our experiments, Yahoo rejected spoofed messages in both cases. We didn\u2019t document Outlook.com tests, but the spoofed messages we tried to send were forwarded to recipient\u2019s SPAM folder.\n\nAs it can be used by cybercriminals or fraudsters to make victims among Gmail users, we decided to publish this article to make people aware of this possibility and protect themselves.\n\nArticle also published on LinkedIn\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-much-trust-do-you-put-your-gmail-inbox-messages-renato-marinho?trk=pulse_spock-articles\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nRenato Marinho\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Gmail, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/e-mail-spoofing", "topic_name": "E-mail Spoofing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gmail", "topic_name": "Gmail"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spam", "topic_name": "spam"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spear-phishing", "topic_name": "spear phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "WhatsApp will allow to Revoke Sent Messages and Track Friends Live Location", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55898/digital-id/whatsapp-live-location.html", "title": "WhatsApp will allow to Revoke Sent Messages and Track Friends Live Location\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 2, 2017", "body": "What\u2019s app is working to improve user\u2019s experience introducing new features, in particular, today I\u2019ll speak about two of them about the possibility to track friends location and also to revoke sent messages.\n\nYes, you will be able to recall a sent message you the recipient hasn\u2019t read it, it seems in fact that this is one of the most requested features.

It will be a paid service because a TorWorld team will handle their abuse notifications.\n\nWe all know that darknets represent a facilitator and aggregator for cyber criminal communities and the Tor network is one of the most popular anonymizing netwotk in the criminal underground.\n\nThe TorWorld will not allow criminal uses of its infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, there is no certainty about when and how the TorWorld TaaS service will be ready, anyway I\u2019ll monitor its progress with a great interest and admiration.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 TorWorld, Tor)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/taas", "topic_name": "TaaS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-exit-node", "topic_name": "Tor Exit Node"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-project", "topic_name": "Tor Project"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-relay", "topic_name": "Tor Relay"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/torworld", "topic_name": "TorWorld"}]}, {"news_name": "Mozilla Internet Health Report calls for more security and privacy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55563/reports/1-mozilla-internet-health-report.html", "title": "Mozilla Internet Health Report calls for more security and privacy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 23, 2017", "body": "The Mozilla foundation has published its first Internet Health Report to analyze the dangers of the Internet that we can consider as a global commodity.\n\nThe oligarchy of internet companies. internet monitoring, censorship and new threats posed by Internet of Things devices every day menace our privacy.\n\nMozilla aims to track the health of the Internet focusing on aspects such as the Open Innovation, Digital Inclusion, Decentralization, Privacy and Security and Web literacy.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with people and organizations that care about a healthy internet to engage the general public in caring more deeply about \u2018internet health,\u2019 in the way that the environmental movement was able to grow mainstream using terms like \u2018global warming\u2019 that no one previously had heard of,\u201d explained the editor Solana Larsen.\n\nPositive news from the security and privacy perspective, communications over the Internet is more secure thanks to the efforts of organizations and private companies.\n\nThe Internet Health Report appreciates the adoption of end-to-end encryption by messaging apps and other web services and welcomes the upcoming new version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3) cryptographic protocol that will make the web more secure and fast.\n\n\n\n\u201cMore messaging apps, including WhatsApp, now offer end-to-end encryption, meaning that conversations are protected from eavesdroppers, including the service provider.\u201d states the report.\n\n\u201cWeb traffic encryption is rising too. One factor is the launch of Let\u2019s Encrypt, a new certificate authority that makes it easy and free to add HTTPS to any website. This helps protect the privacy of users, and offers some guarantee they are not looking at spoof pages. Also driving adoption, search engines and browsers are now subtly rewarding HTTPS websites.\n\nUnknown to most, Internet communication will be more private, and possibly also faster, due to an upcoming new version of the cryptographic protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3) that is used to secure all communications between Web browsers and servers.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, snooping powers continues to grow, several states continues to spend a significant effort in surveillance activities threatening users\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cThere is more public scrutiny of surveillance laws than before, but it hasn\u2019t stopped greater snooping powers from being proposed in Britain, Pakistan, France and several other countries,\u201d states the report.\n\nThe report also warns of the risks related to a rapid and uncontrolled diffusion of unsecured IoT device.

The US Government was interested in spying on the Edward Snowden\u2018s emails.\n\nIn March 2016, a redaction error in the court-ordered release of Lavabit case files confirmed that Edward Snowden was the target of the FBI that caused the termination of the secure email service.\n\nSnowden was using the Lavabit encrypted email service and that FBI drove the company into closure because it refused to serve the US Government\u2019s requests.\n\nThe US Government ordered to install a surveillance implant on the Lavabit servers and later to turn over Lavabit\u2019s encryption keys allowing the Feds to access Snowden\u2019s messages. The court order also revealed that the US Government ordered not to disclose the surveillance activity to third-party entities.\n\nAfter a few weeks of legal dispute, Levison shuttered Lavabit refusing to become not become complicit in criminal surveillance operated by the US Government.\n\n\u201cAfter 38 days of legal fighting, a court appearance, subpoena, appeals and being found in contempt of court, Levison abruptly shuttered Lavabit citing government interference and stating that he would not become \u201ccomplicit in crimes against the American people\u201d.\u201d reported the Guardian.\n\nUS authorities revealed the mysterious circumstances behind the Lavabit shut down by publishing a collection of case files that were not correctly redacted allowing to discover the target of the FBI activity, the email address Ed_Snowden@lavabit.com.\n\nThe document was integrally published by Cryptome, it is visible the Snowden\u2019s email address was left unredacted.\n\n\n\nThe documents were publicly disclosed in the result of Levison\u2019s battle against the US Government, he filed a motion in December 2015 that prompted the court to order the release of files related the Lavabit case.\n\nNow, Levison has announced that he is reviving the Lavabit service fixing the SSL issue and implementing new privacy-enhancing features.\n\nThe Lavabit CEO is releasing the source code for an open-source end-to-end encrypted global email standard, dubbed Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME). The code aims to avoid government surveillance and hides the metadata.\n\n\u201cDeveloped by Lavabit, DIME is an open source secure end-to-end communications platform for asynchronous messaging across the Internet. DIME follows in the footsteps of innovative email protocols, but takes advantage of the lessons learned during the 20-year history of PGP based encrypted communication. DIME is the technological evolution over current standards, OpenPGP and S/MIME, which are both difficult to deploy and only narrowly adopted. Recent revelations regarding surveillance have pushed OpenPGP and S/MIME to the forefront, but these standards simply can\u2019t address the current privacy crisis because they don\u2019t provide automatic encryption or protect metadata. By encrypting all facets of an email transmission (body, metadata and transport layer), DIME guarantees the security of users and the least amount of information leakage possible. A security first design, DIME solves problems that plague legacy standards and combines the best of current technologies into a complete system that gives users the greatest protection possible without sacrificing functionality.\u201d states the description of the standard published by Lavabit.\n\n\n\nThe Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME)  the standard will be available on Github along with a mail server application dubbed Magma that was designed to allow users with existing email clients to easily use Lavabit service.\n\n\u201cTo learn more about DIME & Magma we invite you to join the Dark Mail Technical Alliance https://darkmail.info/ where you can find the latest code & specifications, provide feedback, and contribute to the development effort.\u201d\n\nThe DIME standard implements the \u2018Trustful\u2019 encryption mode that requires users to trust the server to manage the encryption and their keys.\n\n\u201cThe server performs the encryption on your behalf, and as such, you must trust that the server will not be rewritten in such a way that it captures your password, or peeks at your messages during processing,\u201d Levison said.\n\nThe DIME standard also implements a more strictly control over their encryption keys, it allows the users to choose the Cautious Mode and Paranoid Mode, for example, Paranoid means Lavabit will never store a user\u2019s private keys on its server.\n\nLavabit service will only be accessible to existing customers in Trustful mode, others can pre-register and wait for it.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lavabit, Edward Snowden)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-internet-mail-environment", "topic_name": "Dark Internet Mail Environment"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dime", "topic_name": "DIME"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/edward-snowden", "topic_name": "Edward Snowden"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encrypted-email-service", "topic_name": "encrypted email service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lavabit", "topic_name": "Lavabit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "ProtonMail announced that its Tor Hidden Service is online", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55471/digital-id/protonmail-tor-hidden-service.html", "title": "ProtonMail announced that its Tor Hidden Service is online\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 20, 2017", "body": "ProtonMail is the world\u2019s largest encrypted email provider with over 2 million users worldwide.

First, routing your traffic to ProtonMail through the Tor network makes it difficult for an adversary wiretapping your internet connection to know that you are using ProtonMail. Tor applies extra encryption layers on top of your connection, making it more difficult for an advanced attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on your connection to us. Tor also makes your connections to ProtonMail anonymous as we will not be able to see the true IP address of your connection to ProtonMail.\u201d  a onion site,\u201d ProtonMail explained in a blog post.\n\n\u201cTor can also help with ProtonMail accessibility. If ProtonMail becomes blocked in your country, it may be possible to reach ProtonMail by going to our onion site. Furthermore, onion sites are \u201chidden\u201d services in the sense that an adversary cannot easily determine their physical location. Thus, while protonmail.com could be attacked by DDoS attacks, protonirockerxow.onion cannot be attacked in the same way because an attacker will not be able to find a public IP address.\u201d\n\nThe onion address for the ProtonMail Tor service:\n\nhttps://protonirockerxow.onion\n\nJust for curiosity, the above address was generated by the company used spare CPU capacity to generate millions of encryption keys and then hashed them aiming to generate a more human readable hash. The address it can be easily remembered as:\n\nproton i rocker xow\n\n\n\nProtonMail published detailed instructions on how to setup Tor and how to access the service over Tor. For example, in order to use the ProtonMail hidden service is it necessary to enable Javascript.Tor Browser disables Javascript by default, but you will need it for our onion site.

Nearly 17 percent of users are safeguarding their accounts with \u201c123456.\u201d What really perplexed us is that so many website operators are not enforcing password security best practices.\u201d states the report published by Keeper Security. \u201cWe scoured 10 million passwords that became public through data breaches that happened in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe bad news is that the list of most popular passwords hasn\u2019t changed over the years.\n\n\u201cThe list of most frequently used passwords has changed little over the past few years. That means that user education has limits.\u201d continues the study.\n\nThis aspect highlights the lack of a security policy that contemplates also the use of strong passwords and enforces it.

According to a blog post published by The Guardian, the application was affected by a vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to intercept and read messages.\n\nThe issue could not be considered as a backdoor either a vulnerability, it is an issue related to the implementation of the cryptography in the app, in the specific case of user\u2019s encryption key changes.\n\nEven when a new key is generated, for example using a new device,  the user will be able to continue an old conversation without informing the sender of the change. Anyway, specific settings in Whatsapp can enable the notification that the sender transmitted message using a new Key.\n\nThe security issue was discovered by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cIf WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys.\u201d Boelter told the Guardian\n\nResuming the issue is a serious threat to the users\u2019 privacy, WhatsApp can read encrypted messages sent through the service.\n\nThe researcher reported the flaw to WhatsApp in April, but the loophole is still present.\n\nBoelter highlights WhatsApp by default trusts the use of new key without any sender\u2019s notification, he also remarked that the application notifies the sender of the change only after the message is sent even when that default is changed.\n\nOn the other end, the application Signal, for example, requires a sender to manually verify keys, WhatsApp doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe notorious Moxie Marlinspike, who is considered the mind behind the encryption protocol behind both Signal and WhatsApp explained that the issue could not be considered as a backdoor.\n\n\u201cThe fact that WhatsApp handles key changes is not a \u2018backdoor,'\u201d reads a blog post published by Moxie. \u201cIt is how cryptography works. Any attempt to intercept messages in transmit by the server is detectable by the sender, just like with Signal, PGP, or any other end-to-end encrypted communication system.\u201d\n\nMoxie highlighted that WhatsApp takes strict precautions to prevent its servers from knowing which users have enabled security notifications. This means that it should be impossible for attackers to gather information about potential victims that turned off the notification.\n\nBoelter highlighted that an attacker can hack WhatApp servers and gain administrative control over them.\n\nThe attacker could force a change of the encryption key for a targeted mobile device allowing the application to use his key to encrypt messages without ever warning the receiver.\n\n\n\nThe attacker then has to take the targeted phone temporarily unavailable (for a period of hours or days). All the messages that were sent during that time will be stored in a queue and once the phone became available again, the messages will be encrypted with the new attacker key.\n\nThe attack anyway is very complex from the attacker perspective because:\n\nWhich is the WhatsApp reply?\n\n\u201cWhatsApp does not give governments a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor. The design decision referenced in the Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks. WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report.\u201d states WhatsApp\n\n\u201cUltimately, there\u2019s little evidence of a vulnerability and certainly none of a backdoor\u2014which is usually defined as secret functionality for defeating security measures.

The problem was spotted by the notorious Google hacker Tavis Ormandy, the vulnerability affects the Kaspersky antivirus software and the way it used certificates to analyze encrypted traffic.\n\nThe security firm is a trusted CA, the Kaspersky Anti-Virus Personal Root, and uses its digital certificate for the traffic inspection, in this way it is able to decrypt it and analyze scanning for malicious patterns.\n\n\u201cIn order to inspect encrypted data streams using SSL/TLS, Kasperky installs a WFP driver to intercept all outgoing HTTPS connections. They effectively proxy SSL connections, inserting their own certificate as a trusted authority in the system store and then replace all leaf certificates on-the-fly. This is why if you examine a certificate when using Kaspersky Antivirus, the issuer appears to be \u201cKaspersky Anti-Virus Personal Root\u201d.\u201d Ormandy wrote in a security advisory.\n\nThe process implemented by Kaspersky for certificate interception has previously resulted in serious vulnerabilities. Now the experts discovered other issues such as the way leaf certificates are cached that leverages on an extremely naive fingerprinting technique.\n\n\u201cKaspersky cache recently generated certificates in memory in case the user agent initiates another connection. In order to do this, Kaspersky fetches the certificate chain and then checks if it\u2019s already generated a matching leaf certificate in the cache. If it has, it just grabs the existing certificate and private key and then reuses it for the new connection.\u201d explained the expert.\n\n\u201cThe cache is a binary tree, and as new leaf certificates and keys are generated, they\u2019re inserted using the first 32 bits of MD5(serialNumber||issuer) as the key. If a match is found for a key, they just pull the previously generated certificate and key out of the binary tree and start using it to relay data to the user-agent.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to understand that a 32bit key open to brute-forcing attacks to generate a collision in a few seconds. An attacker can produce a collision with other certificates.\n\nOrmandy also provided a description of the attack:\n\nOrmandy also provided a proof of the bug forcing a collision between Hacker News and manchesterct.gov website.\n\n\u201cYou can reproduce this bug, by visiting https://autodiscover.manchesterct.gov, then https://news.ycombinator.com and observing that the content is signed by the wrong certificate.\u201d he added. \u201cSo if you use Kaspersky Antivirus in Manchester, Connecticut and were wondering why Hacker News didn\u2019t work sometimes, it\u2019s because of a critical vulnerability that has effectively disabled SSL certificate validation for all 400 million Kaspersky users.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe expert also provided the C source code that it is possible to use to generate a colliding certificate for testing.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 digital certificates, Kaspersky)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/traffic-inspection", "topic_name": "traffic inspection"}]}, {"news_name": "ZeroNet could be a solution against censorship and much more", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55011/digital-id/zeronet-project.html", "title": "ZeroNet could be a solution against censorship and much more\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 4, 2017", "body": "ZeroNet is a decentralized and open source web platform.

It\u2019s impossible to shut down websites in the ZeroNet.\n\n\u201cWhen a site is updated by its owner, all nodes serving that site (previous visitors) will receive only the incremental updates done to the site content.\u201d states the official website of the project.\n\nZeroNet implements a network whereby users can access and surf websites that are hosted on other user\u2019s machines, it doesn\u2019t include centralized servers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nowhere because it\u2019s everywhere!\u201d declares ZeroNet site\n\nYou can create a free website using ZeroNet. There are no costs for hosting because the website is stored automatically your website. This could be a challenge to web hosting companies. It is always online with no downtime and can be accessible if your internet is unavailable if you have visited the website previously.\n\nThe site owner can accept payment directly to the site address.\n\nIf you want to hide your IP address, ZeroNet supports Tor network. The level of anonymity implemented is the same of the one implemented for BitTorrent, but a combined use with the Tor network will allow protecting user\u2019s anonymity.\n\nZeroNet is made to work with anonymity networks: you can easily hide your IP using the Tor network.\n\nFurthermore, you don\u2019t need to remember your password, because your account is protected by same cryptography as a Bitcoin wallet.\n\n\n\nIn order to ensure integrity files, when you visit a site you download a file named \u201ccontent.json\u201d, it contains all other file names with relative hashes and cryptographic signature by the site owner. Then you download other files and verify them using hashes included in the \u201ccontent.json\u201d. This prevents in some way the diffusion of corrupted files or malicious code.\n\n\n\nAnother feature is multi-user site for example if you want to post on forum or blog. Sending your auth address to the site owner, it creates a new file and set your auth address as the valid signer. The site owner publishes a new \u201ccontent.json\u201d declaring that you can be signed a file.\n\nBelow the list of features implemented by ZeroNet:\n\nZeroNet users also have access to\n\nOne of the questions in the FAQ session camptured my attention:\n\nWhat happens when someone hosts malicious content?\n\nThe answer is very clear:\n\nThe ZeroNet sites are sandboxed, they have the same privileges as any other website you visit over the Internet. You are in full control of what you are hosting. If you find suspicious content you can stop hosting the site at any time.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n @GranetMan\n\nGranet is a young and Junior IT Security Researcher, he is passionate in Linux, Arduino, Digital Forensics, Cyber Security, Free software and Malware Analysis\n\n \n\n \n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 ZeroNet , privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zeronet", "topic_name": "ZeroNet"}]}, {"news_name": "Bitcoin passes above $1,000 for first time since 2013", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54978/breaking-news/bitcoin-value-peak.html", "title": "Bitcoin passes above $1,000 for first time since 2013\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 3, 2017", "body": "Did you invest in Bitcoin?

Gox exchange was hacked. After the hack, the value of the digital currency dropped under $400.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency based on the concept of BlockChain, it is very popular in the criminal underground due to the difficulty to de-anonymize users that chose it for their payments.\n\nMore than 5 Million Bitcoins were traded in the last 24 hours of 2016, roughly 38 Billion yen were traded (~$3.2 Billion). The China is the country that most of all have invested in Bitcoin in the last months due to the drop of the national currency, the yuan.\n\n\u201cBitcoin trading volumes by currency points to a significant volume in bitcoins purchased in China.

The new feature will be included in the stable branch of Firefox 52, scheduled for release on March 7, 2017.\n\n\n\nThe user privacy protection mechanism was already implemented by Mozilla in the Tor Browser, it was developed to block websites from identifying visitors based on the fonts installed on their machines.\n\nThe font fingerprinting protection is already available in Firefox 52 Beta.\n\n\u201cDefending against font fingerprinting is complex. We have to worry about distinguishing attacks via differing installed font sets, text rendering engine differences, and font variants. There are a variety of tickets involved.\u201d states the Tor Development Team.\n\n\u201cIn #13313, we introduced a Tor Browser pref, \u201cfont.system.whitelist\u201d, which accepts a list of fonts and excludes all others from the browser.\u201d\n\nHow does the feature work? \n\nThe feature leverages a whitelist of system fonts for each operating system, the browser will not block queries for system fonts but it will provide the same answer for every user making impossible to discriminate them.\n\nThe practice of font fingerprinting relies on website operators deploying Flash or JS scripts that query the user\u2019s browser for a list of locally installed fonts.\n\nThe news confirms the intention of Mozilla to protect users\u2019 privacy, in July the development team launched the Tor Uplift project, a significant effort in improving privacy features implemented in FireFox.\n\n\u201cTo uplift all of the Tor Browser patches to mainline Firefox.

The Government of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates applied measures to block Signal, for this reason, the Open Whisper Systems who develop the app has revised the Android version introducing a technique called domain fronting.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s release, domain fronting is enabled for Signal users who have a phone number with a country code from Egypt or the UAE,\u201d said company founder Moxie Marlinspike in a blog post. \u201cWhen those users send a Signal message, it will look like a normal HTTPS request to www.google.com. To block Signal messages, these countries would also have to block all of google.com.\u201d\n\nThe domain fronting is a technique that relies on the use of different domain names at different application layers to evade censorship.\n\n\n\nThe domain fronting techniques \u201chides the remote endpoint of a communication. Domain fronting works at the application layer, using HTTPS, to communicate with a forbidden host while appearing to communicate with some other host, permitted by the censor,\u201d as described in a paper published by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Psiphon, and Brave New Software.\n\n\u201cThe key idea is the use of different domain names at different layers of communication. One domain appears on the \u201coutside\u201d of an HTTPS request\u2014in the DNS request and TLS Server Name Indication\u2014while another domain appears on the \u201cinside\u201d\u2014in the HTTP Host header, invisible to the censor under HTTPS encryption.\u201d continues the paper.\u201dA censor, unable to distinguish fronted and nonfronted traffic to a domain, must choose between allowing circumvention traffic and blocking the domain entirely, which results in expensive collateral damage\u201d \n\nThe Domain fronting technique is easy to deploy and use and doesn\u2019t require special activities by network intermediaries.\n\nIf the front domain is a popular website like \u2018google.com, if the censor will block it would have a serious impact on the users.\n\nDomain fronting has a cost.\n\nDomain fronting leverages a CDN that have to receive the request and forward it to the domain in the HTTP host header, or a service that provides similar functionality, like Google\u2019s App Engine.\n\nSuch services typically have a cost that according to the paper ranges from $0.10\u20130.25 per GB using a service like Google App Engine, Amazon CloudFront, Microsoft Azure, Fastly, and CloudFlare. This may explain why Signal isn\u2019t making domain fronting a default everywhere.\n\nDue to this cost, Signal isn\u2019t providing domain fronting by default.\n\nWhat about domain fronting for the iOS version of Signal?\n\nMarlinspike confirmed that an iOS version of Signal that supports domain fronting is expected soon, meantime it is available a beta version.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Signal, domain fronting)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/domain-fronting", "topic_name": "domain fronting"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/secure-messaging", "topic_name": "secure messaging"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/signal", "topic_name": "Signal"}]}, {"news_name": "The Turkish Government has blocked the Tor access once again", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54541/breaking-news/turkish-government-tor-ban.html", "title": "The Turkish Government has blocked the Tor access once again\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 19, 2016", "body": "\u201cOur study indicates that service providers have successfully complied with a government order to ban VPN services.\u201d reads a blog post published by the Turkey Blocks.\n\nTor popularity in Turkey is increasing due to the censorship applied by the local authorities.\n\nThe Turkish Government has applied new sophisticated \u201cblocking measures\u201d that will not allow circumventing social media shutdowns in Turkey.

The Sandboxed Tor Browser aims to isolate the Tor Browser from other processes of the operating system in order to limit its ability to interact or query low-level APIs.\n\nIn this way the experts believe it is possible to reduce the surface of attack of the Tor users, making hard for attackers the exploitation of flaws that could lead to the exposure of real IP addresses, MAC addresses, computer name, and other data that can be used to de-anonymize users.\n\nThe Tor Browser is composed of two components, a modified version of the Firefox browser, and the Tor proxy which implements routing functionalities in the Tor network. An attacker can try to hack the browser component forcing it to connect to other than the legitimate Tor proxy part, for example, a server set up by the attacker that gathers user data.\n\n\u201cThat means if an attacker can compromise the Firefox half of Tor Browser, it can de-anonymize the user by connecting to something other than the Tor proxy,\u201d Richard Barnes, Firefox Security Lead, said.\n\nIn October Barnes announced a series of improvements, including the use of Unix domain sockets that are data communications endpoints of exchanging data between processes executing on the same operating system.\n\n\n\nThis allows the Tor Browser to securely communicate with the FireFox component without underlying the network protocol. In this way the experts are able to create a sandbox around the Firefox component, any manipulation or attacks will have no effects on the user\u2019s privacy because the Tor Browser wouldn\u2019t be able to make a network connection to de-anonymize the user.\n\nIn October, Motherboard reported that the Tor developer Yawning Angel just finished an experimental prototype that will likely appear in some versions of the Tor Browser later this year.\n\n\u201cThat means that you could run it in a sandbox with no network access (only a Unix domain socket to the proxy), and it would still work fine. And then, even if the Firefox half of Tor Browser were compromised, it wouldn\u2019t be able to make a network connection to de-anonymize the user,\u201d added Barnes.\n\nAs explained by Barnes such kind of security measures is actually supported only on platforms that have implemented Unix domain sockets, such as Linux and Mac OS.\n\nThe implementation of a Sandboxed Tor Browser will protect users from attacks like the one conducted by law enforcement in 2015 while they were investigating into a child pornography site Playpen hosted on the dark web.\n\nThe law enforcement used a hacking tool known as network investigative technique (NIT) that allowed them to hack into some 8,700 computers across 120 different countries.\n\nUnfortunately, hacking tools like the NIT can also be used by a totalitarian government to unmask political opponents, journalists, dissidents, and others.\n\nNow the Tor development team announced the released the first version of the sandboxed Tor Browser (ver 0.0.2) that implements the following features:\n\nOne of the developers working on the project describes the browser features as:\n\nWatch out, it is still an alpha version that could include some potentially major bugs.\n\nThis version is only available for Linux distro and the binaries should be available sometime next week.

At the time of the article, the cellular surveillance system was costing as much as $400,000 in the basic configuration, and its price varied with add-ons ordered by the agency.\n\nThe IMSI-catcher is a surveillance solution used by military and intelligence agencies for telephone eavesdropping. It allows for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking movements of mobile phone users. Essentially, an IMSI catcher operates as a bogus mobile cell tower that sits between the target mobile phone and the service provider\u2019s real towers. The IMSI catcher runs a Man In the Middle (MITM) attack that could not be detected by the users without using specific products that secure communication on mobile devices.\n\nThe use of the IMSI-catcher is raising a heated debate in the United States because devices like StingRay and other similar cellphone tracking solutions are being widely adopted by law enforcement agencies across the country.\n\nStingRay allows law enforcement to intercept calls and Internet traffic, send fake texts, inject malware on a mobile device, and to locate the targets.\n\nNow Curtis Waltman from Motherboard published an interesting blog post which provided further details on the cost of the StingRay phone surveillance tool.\n\nWaltman published data provided by the Rochester Police Department in New York that responded to the Cell Site Simulator Census, an initiative that census the cellphone surveillance equipment use and policy.\n\n\u201cA mapping of police departments and agencies nationwide that are using IMSI catcher (Stingray) technology. Included in this mapping is a focus on the policies, procedure and contractual agreements that department\u2019s are formulating as they adopt the controversial surveillance device.\u201d states the description for the census.\n\nData shared by Motherboard are very interesting and provides useful insights about their surveillance systems, their components, and prices. It a \u201ccompletely unredacted quote list of Harris Corporation products\u201d.\n\nDocuments shared by the Rochester Police Department show clearly how Harris sells the Stingray equipment to law enforcement.\n\nAccording to the documents, devices are often sold in packages, like the StingRay II Vehicular System that is offered for sale with devices (i.e. Three different kinds of Harris\u2019 Harpoon signal amplifiers) that allow its use for a patrol vehicle.\n\nHow much cost a StingRay II Vehicular System?\n\nThe package includes a laptop, three kinds of software for accessing different types of cellular networks, and an AmberJack cellphone tracker goes for a grand total of $148,000.\n\n\u201cThe Amberjack is an important accessory for the surveillance systems like Stingray, Gossamer, and Kingfish. It is a direction-finding system antenna that is used for cellular device tracking. It costs nearly $35,015\u2033 I wrote in a blog post published early this year.\n\nThe prices for the AmberJack is quite similar I published early this year.\n\n\n\nAccording to documents published by Motherboard, The KingFish package, Harris Corporations smaller, mobile version of the StingRay, is sold for $157,000.\n\nThe single KingFish device is not so expensive as I have reported early this year.\n\n\u201cKingfish is a surveillance transceiver that is used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies to track cellular devices and exfiltrate information from mobile devices over a targeted area. It could be concealed in a briefcase and allows gathering of unique identity codes and shows connections between phones and numbers being dialed. Its cost is slightly higher than $25,000.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe Rochester PD expressed its interest for the entire KingFish, except the laptop.\n\n\n\nThe company is including in the surveillance packages also training activities that go for $12,000.\n\n\u201cThese packages also come with the option of a training package, costing $12,000, and a one year maintenance package that will cost $169,000 if your department decided to splurge for the whole line of Harris\u2019 products (this was 2011 so the 4G network cell site simulator the HailStorm wasn\u2019t released yet.) Training isn\u2019t included interestingly enough, so police departments are more or less forced to pay for training on these complicated and powerful devices.\u201d states the post published by Motherboard.\n\nThe note at the end of the document provides also further details of the surveillance technology, including the specifications required to use the equipment in a real scenario.\n\n\u201cThe StingRay and Kingfish can be run out of a car\u2019s cigarette lighter, while the StingRay II requires a 2000W power inverter. That is hungrier for power than almost any household appliance, save a dryer or oven.\u201d continues the post.\n\nIf you are interested in StingRay surveillance technology, give a look at the article \u201cStingRay Technology: How Government Tracks Cellular Devices\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Surveillance, Law enforcement) \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/imsi-catcher", "topic_name": "IMSI catcher"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-devices", "topic_name": "mobile devices"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stingray", "topic_name": "StingRay"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Uber asks to track your location even when you\u2019re not using the app", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54061/security/user-tracking.html", "title": "Uber asks to track your location even when you\u2019re not using the app\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 5, 2016", "body": "The last update of the Uber App allows it to track the passengers\u2019 locations even when they have been dropped off and the application is running in the background of a customer\u2019s smartphone.

The emphasis has always been on features and capabilities while security is usually relegated to the back burner. And, while no internet-connected device is 100% secure, a few smartphones stand out as the best contenders for mobile security.\n\n\n\nBlackBerry describes the DTEK50 smartphone as the \u201cworld\u2019s most secure Android smartphone.\u201d The DTEK50 includes features such as periodic application tracking, which automatically monitors the OS and apps.

These professional iPhone hackers said that Apple has made cracking the logins for backups stored on a Mac or PC a lot easier.\n\nElcomsoft discovered that Apple was using a weaker password protection mechanism, for manual backups via iTunes, than before:\n\n\u201cThanks to Apple\u2019s mistake, Elcomsoft said it could potentially guess backup passwords 40 times faster using CPU acceleration when compared to the speedier GPU-powered cracking in iOS 9. When using the same Intel i5 CPU for cracking efforts, it was an astonishing 2500 times faster, with 6 million password guesses per second compared to just 2,400. The company thinks it has an 80 to 90 per cent chance of successfully getting the right password with its tools, which can be bought by anyone, not just the cops.\n\n\u2018We discovered an alternative password verification mechanism added to iOS 10 backups. We looked into it and found out that the new mechanism skips certain security checks, allowing us to try passwords approximately 2500 times faster compared to the old mechanism used in iOS 9 and older.\u2019\u201d\n\nApple opted for a weaker hashing algorithm for local backups of iPhone files stored on PCs. \u201cSuch algorithms turn a plaintext password into a \u2018hash\u2019 \u2014 a string of numbers and letters. Password crackers attempt to guess the output, or hash, of the algorithm and match it with plaintext; so, the more complex the algorithm and the more complex the password, the harder it is to find a match.\u201d\n\nWhile there are obstacles to carrying out an attack under these circumstances, it is not outside the realm of possibilities. It simply means a hacker would have to gain access to the computer on which the iPhone files are stored. Additionally, the iPhone user would have also had to have turned on local backups instead of using iCloud. A hacker could access the linked computer either by physically extracting the data or by compromising the machine in some other manner, such as hacking it remotely.\n\nIf, however, a hacker has physical access to both phone and laptop, according to Elcomsoft, it is possible to \u201cforce a phone into creating a backup on the phone and it may be possible \u2018to produce a local backup even if the phone is locked by using a pairing record extracted from a trusted computer.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat being said, Google\u2019s highly anticipated and heavily promoted Pixel has already been hacked\u2013by a team of Chinese hackers at the 2016 PwnFest. It took the hackers less than a minute to hack the phone. Google is working on a patch for the vulnerability.\n\nFrustrated with Google\u2019s seeming resistance to providing ample security measures on Android phones, The Tor Project recently announced the release of its prototype for a Tor-enabled smartphone. Ars Technica describes it as \u201can Android phone beefed up with privacy and security in mind, and intended as equal parts opsec kung fu and a gauntlet to Google.\u201d\n\n\n\nDesigned by Tor developer Mike Perry, it is based on Copperhead OS, a hardened Android distribution.\n\nCopperhead OS was the obvious choice for the prototype\u2019s base system, Perry explained to Ars Technica. \u201cCopperhead is also the only Android ROM that supports verified boot, which prevents exploits from modifying the boot, system, recovery, and vendor device partitions,\u201d he said in a blog post. \u201cCopperhead has also extended this protection by preventing system applications from being overridden by Google Play Store apps, or from writing bytecode to writable partitions (where it could be modified and infected).\u201d\n\nArs Technica reports:\n\n\u201c\u2019The prototype is meant to show a possible direction for Tor on mobile,\u2019 Perry wrote in a blog post. \u2018We are trying to demonstrate that it is possible to build a phone that respects user choice and freedom, vastly reduces vulnerability surface, and sets a direction for the ecosystem with respect to how to meet the needs of high-security users.\u2019\n\nTo protect user privacy, the prototype runs OrWall, the Android firewall that routes traffic over Tor, and blocks all other traffic. Users can punch a hole through the firewall for voice traffic, for instance, to enable Signal.\n\nThe prototype only works on Google Nexus and Pixel hardware, as these are the only Android device lines, Perry wrote, that \u2018support Verified Boot with user-controlled keys.\u2019 While strong Linux geekcraft is required to install and maintain the prototype, Perry stressed that the phone is also aimed at provoking discussion about what he described as \u2018Google\u2019s increasing hostility towards Android as a fully Open Source platform.\u2019\u201d\n\nPerry argues that in trying to resolve security, Google is encroaching on user civil liberties and causing Android to be more susceptible to compelled backdoors. He is also concerned about the lack of transparency in Google\u2019s release and development process.\n\nPerry has vehemently stated the Tor Project has no plans to move into the hardware business. He just wants this prototype to inspire innovation.The prototype, nicknamed \u201cMission Improbable,\u201d can now be downloaded and installed. And, Mission Improbable installation instructions on can be accessed on GitHub.\n\nWritten by: CandiceLanier\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Secure Smartphones, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/secure-smartphone", "topic_name": "Secure Smartphone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}]}, {"news_name": "Are you an iPhone user?

Your contacts and calendars, system backups and photos can be stored in the cloud on Apple servers. This time, we discovered that yet another piece of data is stored in the cloud for no apparent reason. Using an iPhone and have an active iCloud account? Your calls will sync with iCloud whether you want it or not. In fact, most users we\u2019ve heard from don\u2019t want this \u201cfeature\u201d, yet Apple has no official way to turn off this behavior other than telling people \u201cnot using the same Apple ID on different devices\u201d. What\u2019s up with that? Let\u2019s try to find out.\u201d reads the analysis published by Elcomsoft.\n\nElcomsoft tools could allow determining what personal data is synchronized with Apple servers and how to prevent it.\n\nWhen the iCloud feature is enabled, Apple mobile devices automatically collect and send back to the company private information such as call history, phone numbers, phone call metadata (i.e. Length of calls).\n\nThe iPhone also sends information collected from other third-party VoOP applications, including Facebook Messenger, Viber, WhatsApp, and Skype.\n\n\n\nSecurity experts highlighted the low level of protection of users\u2019 data in Apple iCloud, that could be easily accessed by law enforcement.\n\n\u201cSo far, we had no reasons to doubt this policy. However, we\u2019ve seen Apple moving more and more data into the cloud. iCloud data (backups, call logs, contacts and so on) is very loosely protected, allowing Apple itself or any third party with access to proper credentials extracting this information. Information stored in Apple iCloud is of course available to law enforcement.\u201d continues Elcomsoft .\n\nEven logs are sent in real time to Apple when iCloud Drive is enabled. If users want to stop sharing their logs with Apple need to disable iCloud Drive completely, an operation that has an impact on many applications.\n\n\u201cSyncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,\u201d says Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov. \u201cBut all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. In that case, many applications will stop working or lose iCloud-related features completely.\u201d\n\nApple, of course, defends its iCloud Sync feature ensuring that customers\u2019 data is encrypted and protected with a two-factor authentication mechanism.\n\n\u201cWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers\u2019 data. That is why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user\u2019s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user\u2019s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.\u201d is the official statement from the company.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 iPhone, mobile)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "A Facebook glitch declared all its users are dead, including Zuckerberg", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/53345/social-networks/facebook-memorial-glitch.html", "title": "A Facebook glitch declared all its users are dead, including Zuckerberg\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 12, 2016", "body": "Funny as it is disturbing, but the technology can also do this and this time it has happened to Facebook.

AT&T, a telecommunications conglomerate with diversified revenues of more than $146 billion reported in 2015, is branching out by selling its \u201cHemisphere\u201d services to the US Justice Department.  AT&T has been data-mining and willingly sharing user phone data, through its \u201cHemisphere\u201d Project, which is essentially a mass surveillance program.  The Hemisphere program, first whispered about as early as 2013, reportedly utilizes data provided by the cell phone company dating back to the 1980s.\n\nAT&T has not commented publically on the program, but reported documents published highlight the fact that the telephone company is providing the service through its already established infrastructure.  All at the cost of additional fees to the buyer, of course.\n\nAT&T has collected and retained, in the past, phone call logs and other \u201cMetadata\u201d with of extensive 380 million user database.  Research conducted by the NSA revealed that telephone metadata can reveal sensitive personal information of the user.  Collected meta-data consists of non-content phone user information, which can pose a threat to user privacy.\n\n\n\nImage: The logo of the \u201cHemisphere Project\u201d (AT&T)\n\nVerizon Communications has also been the subject of a forced compliance order issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that resulted in handing over electronic data to the NSA.  This data included all calling records maintained on a daily basis- without disclosure to the user.  The order itself covered location, frequency, and duration of the calls, but not the actual content of the communication.  Additionally, the user is not aware of any such privacy invasions nor may be the subject of any criminal investigations.\n\nPreviously, the NSA might have been the only entity that had the resources to support such surveillance with the infrastructure to house such extensive data.  AT&T\u2019s access to its hundreds of millions of customer, however, gave the telecommunications company ample opportunity and infrastructure to collect data on everything that happens within its network.  The communication of two or more users in regards to \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d, and \u201cwhere\u201d are collected and stored.  This data, accessed through AT&T\u2019s vast user network, along with the location data provided by cell phones, leaves a distinct digital trail that law enforcement should be able to follow.  We\u2019re talking about a massive amount of information, especially considering AT&T\u2019s market share and reach.  AT&T\u2019s landline customers alone consist of more than 75% of the entire market share.\n\nDocuments revealed confirm a link between the collections of phone data to the formation of an \u201calliance\u201d with law enforcement agencies, who are eager for such information provided by AT&T\u2019s vast network. The revenue received by AT&T for such a service, although morally or ethically ambiguous in nature, amounts to millions per year.\n\nAT&T\u2019s willingness to data-mine information is one unique characteristic of this alliance.  Usually, a private entity provides such information under the enforcement of a legal warrant.  AT&T itself seeking an alliance (a sort of public-private partnership) with a governmental agency, is a rather different type of partnership.\n\nCell phone providers, in the past, have hardly played such a cooperative role, and certainly not such a prosperous one.  FBI\u2019s battle with Apple regarding the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone indicated that Apple publically opposed such an alliance.  It refused to cooperate with investigators in order to create software that would unlock the shooter\u2019s iPhone.  Apple believed that creating, in essence a backdoor to unlock its software, would set a dangerous precedent.  Apple ultimately propagated against the invasion of cell phone privacy by refusing to cooperate with investigators in a terrorism case.  AT&T has no such reservations.\n\nFormerly, the US-NSA has had legal authority to access phone user information under the USA Patriot Act of 2001.  Some of the same powers granted to the USA Patriot Act are now available under the USA Freedom bill (2016), but with some restrictive guidelines.  The NSA is also facing several lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over its controversial bulk collection of phone data.  Several rulings have vilified the ACLU\u2019s claim on the basis that:\n\nAT&T\u2019s stand on these published documents is in opposition to Snowden\u2019s views on the matter.\n\n\n\n[IMAGE] Edward Snowden\u2019s on the cover of Time in 2013.\n\nEdward Snowden, in an interview with European reporters on Oct. 26th 2016, further fueled the massive public debate on mass surveillance by cell phone service providers.  Snowden claimed that the public is not able to stop targeted surveillance from huge government organizational programs.  According to him, this was the reason behind the massive data breaches and cyber-attacks that have taken place in recent years:\n\nIn the continuing saga of Edward Snowden, his comments on the cooperation of AT&T with governmental agencies suggest that governmental agencies are focusing most of their resources on the offensive-end, leaving them vulnerable to defend against massive data breaches and hacks.  Because of a lacking in defense, vulnerabilities can be exploited, as evidenced by the cyber-attack at the Office of Personnel Management, the recent Democratic National Committee hacks, and other such infrastructural attacks.  These could have been prevented with a focus on bolstering defense:\n\n\u201c[Its] fear of the power grid being attacked\u2014these were preventable problems\u201d- Edward Snowden\n\nIf such cyber-attacks can compromise the security of private and governmental agencies, then what is the defense against such a compromise in critical sectors, such as energy or manufacturing?  Previous Reports, published in 2015, have in fact stated that the energy sector in the U.S. is not prepared to defend itself against cyber threats.\n\nSnowden\u2019s reasoning isn\u2019t incorrect as he makes a justifiable argument.  Moreover, his narrative has consistently warned of mass surveillance activities taking place without the knowledge of the mass public.  He has sacrificed his entire career on reporting breaches of user privacy by intelligence agencies.  The former NSA contractor is a whistle-blower, he exposed the questionable practices of his employer, a governmental agency, but he is also an advocate of safeguarding user privacy at the hands of surveillance agencies.\n\nYou may ask, \u201cIf AT&T volunteers user phone information- is it still illegal?\u201d  The answer lies somewhere in the middle.  In essence, this is capitalism at its finest, an exchange between buyer and seller that constitutes a business transaction.  The information at the heart of this debate is legitimized at the source and wrapped around an added financial incentive.  However, the threat of user privacy against mass surveillance is a very real one, and not just in the U.S.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAllena Dominus is an easily excitable tech user who loves to review and write about her experiences in the tech world.

An attacker can try to hack the browser component forcing it to connect to other than the legitimate Tor proxy part, for example, a server set up by the attacker that gathers user data.\n\n\u201cThat means if an attacker can compromise the Firefox half of Tor Browser, it can de-anonymize the user by connecting to something other than the Tor proxy,\u201d Barnes said.\n\nBarnes a series of improvements, including the use of Unix domain sockets that are data communications endpoints for exchanging data between processes executing on the same operating system.\n\nThis will allow the Tor Browser to securely communicate with the FireFox component without underlying the network protocol. In this was the experts will sandbox the Firefox component, any manipulation or attacks will have no effects on the user\u2019s privacy because the Tor Browser wouldn\u2019t be able to make a network connection to de-anonymize the user.\n\nBasically the intent of the experts at the Tor Project is to sandbox the Tor browser to insulate our users from attacks such as the NIT and similar ones. According to Motherboard, the Tor developer Yawning Angel just finished an experimental prototype that will likely appear in some versions of the Tor Browser later this year.\n\n\u201cThat means that you could run it in a sandbox with no network access (only a Unix domain socket to the proxy), and it would still work fine. And then, even if the Firefox half of Tor Browser were compromised, it wouldn\u2019t be able to make a network connection to de-anonymize the user,\u201d added Barnes.\n\nAs explained by Barnes such kind of security measures is actually supported only on platforms that have implement Unix domain sockets, such as Linux and Mac OS.\n\nThe experts are now working to extend it to Windows platforms.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Tor Project, Tor Browser)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mozilla", "topic_name": "Mozilla"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-browser", "topic_name": "Tor Browser"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-project", "topic_name": "Tor Project"}]}, {"news_name": "No doubt, events demonstrate that Signal is the most secure messaging app", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/51915/digital-id/signal-metadata.html", "title": "No doubt, events demonstrate that Signal is the most secure messaging app\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 5, 2016", "body": "\u201cUse anything by Open Whisper Systems\u201d Snowden says.\n\nThe Cryptographer and Professor at Johns Hopkins University Matt Green and the popular security expert Bruce Schneier are other two admirers of the Signal app.\n\nWhy is it considered so secure compared to other messaging apps?\n\nSecurity experts and privacy defenders are aware that almost any messaging app store a huge quantity of metadata on users\u2019 activity, including data related to calls and messages.

a number of violations, including backdating SHA -1 certificates in order to subvert deprecating certs from being trusted.\n\nAccording to a report published by Mozilla on Monday, WoSign failed to report its acquisition of SmartCom and has also been accused of mis-issuing digital certificates for GitHub, allowing arbitrary domain names to be securely signed without ever performing any type of validation.\n\n \u201cMozilla\u2019s CA team has lost confidence in the ability of WoSign/StartCom to faithfully and competently discharge the functions of a CA,\u201d they went on to add \u201cTherefore we propose that, starting on a date to be determined in the near future, Mozilla products will no longer trust newly-issued certificates issued by either of these two CA brands.\u201d Reads the report published by Mozilla.\nIn order to avoid impacting existing users, Mozilla has said that they will only distrust newly issued certificates as both CAs have to date issued a large number of certificates.\n\n\u201cMozilla believes that continued public trust in the correct working of the CA certificate system is vital to the health of the Internet, and we will not hesitate to take steps such as those outlined above to maintain that public trust,\u201d Mozilla said. \u201cWe believe that the behavior documented here would be unacceptable in any CA, whatever their nationality, business model or position in the market.\u201d\n\n\n\nSHA-1 has been long considered a weak algorithm and most of the major players in the browser market are taking steps to phase out its integration.\n\nMicrosoft looks poised to phase out the outdated algorithm on their Edge and Internet Explorer products in February of next year, with Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and Google\u2019s Chrome browsers not trusting any SHA-1 certificates with a notBefore date of January 1st 2016.\n\nMozilla commented that unscrupulous Certificate Authorities could backdate their certificates in order to bypass this restriction, something that WoSign have been found culpable of on 62 certificates that were issued in 2016.\n\nTheir investigation reported that a number of certificates were found containing as issue date of December 20th 2015 which contradicts their typical patterns of assignment during working days.\n\n\u201cWe think it is highly unlikely that WoSign employees decided to go to work on that particular Sunday for a marathon 24-hour period and approve an unprecedented number of Type Y certificate requests,\u201d Mozilla said. \u201cWe think it is more plausible that for those certificates, the notBefore date does not reflect the actual date of certificate creation, and that these certificates were created in 2016 (or the last day of 2015) and back-dated.\u201d\n\nWritten by: Steven Boyd\n\nSteven is a security consultant, researcher, ethical hacker and freelance writer with over 16 years of experience in the industry.

The professor \u201ccoated the 3D printed fingers in a thin layer of metallic particles\u201d in order to overwhelm the limitation related to the electric conduction of that most 3D-printed objects.\n\n\u201cThe police already have a scan of the victim\u2019s fingerprints taken while he was alive (apparently he had been arrested previously). They gave those scans to the lab, and using them Arora has created 3D printed replicas of all ten digits.\u201d stated the report published by Eveleth. \u201cA 3D printed finger alone often can\u2019t unlock a phone these days. Most fingerprint readers used on phones are capacitive, which means they rely on the closing of tiny electrical circuits to work. The ridges of your fingers cause some of these circuits to come in contact with each other, generating an image of the fingerprint. Skin is conductive enough to close these circuits, but the normal 3D printing plastic isn\u2019t, so Arora coated the 3D printed fingers in a thin layer of metallic particles so that the fingerprint scanner can read them.\u201d\n\nArora and his team haven\u2019t yet tested the fingers on the mobile device of the dead man, but the professor is confident that in a few weeks he will be able to unlock the device .\n\nOn the other hand, this technique potentially represents a threat to the users\u2019 privacy, there is the concrete risk that someone could abuse it, for example by stealing a fingerprint using a high-resolution photo and recreating it with a 3D-printing process.\n\nAt the time I was writing the investigation is still ongoing and there are no details on the research.\n\nIf the experiment will be successful, the unique defense for the users will be to disable the biometric sensor on the mobile smartphone.

The list of baby monitor analyzed includes the Philips In.Sight B120/37, the iBaby M3S and M6 models, the Summer Infant Baby Zoom,TrendNet Wi-Fi Baby Cam, the Lens Peek-a-View and a Gynoii device.\n\nFlaws affecting baby monitors represent a serious threat to the privacy of the families. Baby monitors are smart devices always online equipped with a camera and a microphone, all the necessary to spy on the surrounding environment.\n\nA couple of years another case was in the headlines, a Russian website was allowing users to spy from more than 73,000 live streams from unprotected baby monitors.\n\nWhat is changed during the last couple of years on the privacy perspective? Nothing, online it is quite easy to find vulnerable baby monitors. The UK\u2019s data watchdog has warned that baby monitors are still open to cyber attacks and it is inviting manufacturers to improve cyber security of their products.\n\nHackers still violate users\u2019 privacy by spying on their kids through hacker baby monitors and unfortunately these images are publicly available online.\n\nThe Information Commissioner\u2019s Office took action to avoid this kind of incidents, so it issued a guidance to help users to secure their devices.\n\n\u201cInternet of Things products such as baby monitors, music systems, and photo or document storage, which can be accessed online, are at risk of revealing your personal details to other people,\u201d said the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office technology manager Simon Rice.\n\n\u201cA lack of security when it comes to IoT devices could mean that a search engine is used by criminals to locate vulnerable devices and then gain access to them or others on your home network.

Each server permutes the order in which it receives messages before passing them on to the next. If,for instance, messages from senders Alice, Bob, and Carol reach the first server in the order A, B, C, that server would send them to the second server in a different order \u2014 say, C, B, A. The second server would permute them before sending them to the third, and so on.\u201d states the blog post on the MIT.\n\n\u201cAn adversary that had tracked the messages\u2019 points of origin would have no idea which was which by the time they exited the last server. It\u2019s this reshuffling of the messages that gives the new system its name: Riffle.\u201d\n\nAn attacker is not able to track messages because the paths of each message are random, the Riffle anonymizing scheme also protect traffic by using an Onion protocol leveraging on multi-layered encryption mechanism. Messages are encrypted hop by hop while travelling from source to the final recipient.\n\n\n\nIn order to make Riffle resilient to hacking attacks relying on compromised servers the new architecture implements a technique known as \u2018Verifiable Shuffle.\u2019\n\nA Verifiable Shuffle is a method that is used to mathematically verify the integrity of messages.\n\n\u201cTo thwart message tampering, Riffle uses a technique called a verifiable shuffle.\u201d continues the post published by the MIT.\n\n\u201cAuthentication encryption is much more efficient to execute than the verifiable shuffle, but it requires the sender and the receiver to share a private cryptographic key. So Riffle uses the verifiable shuffle only to establish secure connections that let each user and each mixnet server agree upon a key. Then it uses authentication encryption for the remainder of the communication session.\n\nIn order to verify the authenticity of an encrypted message, the Riffle method uses the \u201cAuthentication encryption.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuthentication encryption is much more efficient to execute than the verifiable shuffle, but it requires the sender and the receiver to share a private cryptographic key. So Riffle uses the verifiable shuffle only to establish secure connections that let each user and each mixnet server agree upon a key. Then it uses authentication encryption for the remainder of the communication session.\u201d\n\nResearchers claim that the Riffle has better performance than the Tor network, to transfer a large file between anonymous users it required one-tenth of the time as compared to TOR and other anonymity networks during experimental tests.\n\nMore details on the Riffle system will be presented at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium in July, in Germany, waiting for the event give a look to the paper [PDF] published by the researchers.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Riffle, online anonymity)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/online-anonymity", "topic_name": "online anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/riffle", "topic_name": "Riffle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-network", "topic_name": "Tor network"}]}, {"news_name": "Shard discovers shared passwords between most popular web services", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49353/hacking/shard-tool.html", "title": "Shard discovers shared passwords between most popular web services\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 14, 2016", "body": "In the past months, we have read about numerous data breaches, LinkedIn, MySpace, VerticalScope are just a few examples of illustrious victims.\n\nHundreds of thousands of millions of credentials have flooded the criminal underground, a precious commodity for hackers that could try to exploit them to hack into users\u2019 account when the owner share the same username and password.\n\nOf course, the activity is time-consuming, hackers need to test login credentials included in a data dump against various services available online.\n\nNow this activity can be sped up by using Shard, a command-line tool that was developed to allow users to test if a password they use for one site is also used on other popular services, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, or Instagram.\n\nBelow the list of available modules:\n\nThe Shard receives a username and password as input then it will attempt to authenticate with multiple sites.\n\n\u201cI used that password as a general password for many services,\u201d he wrote in an e-mail. \u201cIt was a pain to remember which sites it was shared and to change them all.

Unfortunately, many users of social media are learning this lesson the hard way.\n\nCifas, a leading group in fraud protection, recently released its report on the fraud landscape for 2016 and the numbers are staggering.  According to Cifas, its members alone prevent \u00a31.1 billion in fraud losses in 2015!   And that\u2019s just the tip of the digital iceberg.  According to the report, 62 percent of all fraud and 86 percent of all identity theft is made possible through the internet.\n\nThe Cifas report cover a number of fraud types and it is worth reading the full report if you\u2019re an asset manager.  For cyber security professionals, there are two numbers that should be glaringly disconcerting.  Between 2014 and 2015, identify fraud rose 49 percent while bank account fraud rose 59 percent over the same period.  It should come as no surprise.\n\n\n\nIdentity theft is a known enabler of bank account fraud and as social media continues to grow, it is becoming easier and easier for criminals to piece together the personal information of its users.   In 2011, 10.6 percent of identity fraud involved the use of fictitious identities as compared to only 3.6 percent in 2015, indicating criminals are getting better at reconnaissance of their intended targets.\n\nPunctuating the problem with identity theft, a short film on the ease at which hackers can steal your personal information was released on the same day as the Cifas report.  The short clip on YouTube, a little over a minute and half, takes place a local coffee shop.  As customers buy their double lattes, a nondescript van sits outside the shop collecting the personal data coffee shop patrons as they surfed their phones while waiting for their cup Joe.  It\u2019s a compelling video and hits its target audience, twenty-somethings, square on their social media feeds and iPhones.\n\nAccording to Cifa\u2019s research some 24,000 identity fraud victims were under the age of thirty, a 52 percent increase over 2014 and more than doubling since 2014.  At the same time, 49 percent of first party fraud was committed by people under the age of thirty. It\u2019s this last statistic that shows how pervasive the problem is.  Being creatures of opportunity, fraudsters are likely to take advantage of the easiest targets that they are most familiar with, reducing the risk of being caught targeting unknown territory.  This number suggests that there needs to be more education focused on our youth as to what fraud is and how to prevent it.  Let\u2019s face it, the internet generation is also the most likely group to publish more details about their personal lives making reconnaissance all but a breeze rather than a chore for criminals.\n\nBeing creatures of opportunity, fraudsters are likely to take advantage of the easiest targets that they are most familiar with, reducing the risk of being caught targeting unknown territory.  This number suggests that there needs to be more education focused on our youth as to what fraud is and how to prevent it.  Let\u2019s face it, the internet generation is also the most likely group to publish more details about their personal lives making reconnaissance all but a breeze rather than a chore for criminals.\n\nFraudsters are also adapting to the changing economic conditions.  The Cifas report shows that the gender gap between males and females is closing with a 4 percent shift between the sexes.  However, forty-year old men, 60.5 percent, remain the most likely targets of fraud.  According to Cifas, this is likely due to the perception that men in that age bracket are more likely to have access to lines of credit making it lucrative for criminals to target.  This shift in behavior may indicate a change in the perception as men being the breadwinners as governments continue tackle problems of the pay gaps associated with gender inequality in business.\n\nFraud isn\u2019t just increasing among individuals.  The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been warning businesses about so-called Business E-Mail Compromise (BEC) campaigns for well over a year.  The attack is simple, criminals target C-level executives with well-crafted emails, enticing wire transfers of funds. The emails are real enough, including actual signatures over company seals in some cases, to trick unsuspecting victims to transfer large sums of money.  On average BEC victims lose $130,000 according to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).\n\nBoth the Cifas report and the FBI\u2019s warnings are just pieces of a much more global phenomenon. Fraud and attempted fraud is finding its way into some of the very underpinnings of the global finance infrastructure.  Once believed to be stalwart of fraud, SWIFT, the global financial network use by banks to transfer billions of dollars, has recently come under attack resulting in an attempt of stealing over a billion dollars from the Central Bank of Bangladesh.  Fortunately, the attack only resulted in losing US$81 million but has placed increased scrutiny on the SWIFT network, the integrity of its software, and protection of its infrastructure.\n\nThough fraud is likely to remain a concern for the developed world, emerging markets are also becoming a favorite for criminals. Perhaps, there is no greater example of this than Brazil. The up-and-coming country now ranks second worldwide in online banking fraud and financial malware, according to cyber security firm Kaspersky.  According to CERT.br, security notifications ballooned to 197 percent in 2014 over 2013!  Moreover, there was a whopping 80 percent increase in fake online banking and e-commerce pages and 40 percent increase in fraud attempts.  With the Olympics just around the corner, these numbers are likely to increase significantly.\n\nSadly, fraud is likely the new normal as we Facebook, Instagram, and Tweet our lives out for the world to see.  As the old saying goes, \u201csecurity is not convenient.\u201d  That said, buy a cup of coffee shouldn\u2019t mean we sell out our bank accounts to criminals either.  It\u2019s all about balance, and if we as a community can\u2019t figure it out, getting a cup of coffee is likely going to cost us more than what\u2019s listed on the menu.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

In fact, according to the report, not a single wiretap application was denied in 2015 for a total of 4,148 wiretaps in all.  Of those wiretaps, only seven taps encountered encryption, down from twenty-two in 2014.\n\nThough the report suggests that encryption is waning among Americans, it is more likely that costs are driving law enforcement to be very selective in its wiretapping efforts.  The report Court\u2019s report details the average cost of wiretaps increased an average 7 percent over 2014 pushing the cost to US$42,216 per tap and this doesn\u2019t even account for the costs associated with breaking encryption.\n\nJust this year, the FBI paid an unknown person or group at least US$1.3 million to break into the 5C iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who murdered 14 people and wounded 22 others in a terrorist attack in 2015 in San Bernardino, California.\n\nAccording to FBI Director, James Comey, the method purchased by the FBI can be used in future investigations where encryption is involved but it is unknown if the FBI is willing to share its methodology with state and local governments facing the same problems.  Without an easy button, state and local agencies have to weigh the costs of breaking encryption and the likelihood of a conviction if a wiretap unsuccessfully produces incriminating evidence.\n\nThe Court\u2019s report also runs counter to warnings by John Brennan, director the US\u2019s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nWhen asked why recent terrorist attacks in Pairs went undetected by the intelligence community he warned there were, \u201ca lot of technological capabilities that are available right now that make it exceptionally difficult, both technically as well as legally, for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need.\u201d\n\nMaking it even more difficult on the intelligence community, the Obama administration in November of last year suggested that \u201cthe time was not right\u201d for legislation forcing technology companies to provide the government with methods of breaking encryption.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the CIA raising concerns. National Security Agency (NSA) director James Clapper testified to Congress that the Islamic State is \u201cvery security conscious\u201d and a \u201cprolific user of strong encryption technology, posing a major challenge\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to clapper ISIL commonly makes use of end-to-end encryption creating a major obstacle for the intelligence community discerning the various plots by the terrorist groups.  Clapper supports strong encryption for businesses such as Apple and Google, but called that support into question by stating U.S. officials are trying to \u201cthreat the needle so that we ensure privacy and security.\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s report also reveals that 94 percent of wiretaps in 2015 involved intercepts of voice communications being made through the use of cellular phones. It is widely known that US intelligence snoops have access to those calls and is likely pushing many criminals to use other methods of communication outside of the telephone networks.\n\n\n\nRevelations made public by Edward Snowden about the NSA is likely a key factor in the tech-savvy nature of criminals using modern technologies. According to Clapper, Snowden pushed encryption usage seven years forward as many searched for ways to circumvent the NSA\u2019s wide-reaching espionage program.\n\nAs government\u2019s around the world continue to struggle with the privacy versus security equation, it is likely those adoption encryption are only going to increase and this could be even more problematic for law enforcement that the intelligence agencies.  According to the Court\u2019s report, a majority of wiretaps have been used in thwarting the illegal narcotics trade.\n\nIn 2015, wiretaps were responsible for about a 19 percent conviction rate of those arrested as the result of a wiretap.  The Eastern District of Virginia reported a somewhat better result of about 25 percent.  With results this low and costs being so high, the thought of encryption getting in the way all but indicates a need for selectivity in choosing who to wiretap.\n\nIt is clear that the debate between privacy and security will continue well into the future.  Like the old saying, security does not exist in nature and we can\u2019t avoid danger if we don\u2019t see it coming.  It\u2019s a tough choice with no clear answer.  Civil liberties groups and the federal government are likely to spar endlessly on the debate that will likely not be settled until public sentiment settles and politicians are forced to take a final stand on the matter.  Perhaps, the biggest driver in swaying the debate one way or another is public safety and the threat of terrorism as James Clapper has warned.\n\nThe past few weeks the world has been rocked by a series of deadly terrorist attacks in Orlando, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iraq.

WhatsApp has gone over one billion users and Telegram claims to have over 350,000 people a day signing up for its services. So, it seems that there is a great need to cover communication freely and with some sort of encryption. Added security is always a wonderful asset for every app and especially when it comes to communication. But which is the best option of the two? Should you choose WhatsApp or Telegram for your chatting? Let\u2019s have a look.\n\n\n\nTelegram is the work of two Russian brothers and billionaires, Nikolai and Pavel Durov. They had previously created Vkontakte \u2013 an alternative to Facebook. However, they got in trouble over some Ukrainian personal data issue and fled to Berlin from Russia in 2014. WhatsApp is the work of Brian Acton and Jan Koum. With awesome messaging features, the app captured the attention of Facebook and Zuckerberg bought it in 2014. Now, which one offers the best option for you to consider?\n\nFirst of all, you need to keep in mind that WhatsApp offers encryption to all the messages. On the other hand, Telegram allows you to choose whether you want a secret chat or not. Even though the encryption used by Telegram is pretty solid, it is not present to all chats and this makes it a bit controversial. There is an extra step that many people do not take. They either do not realize that this is important or they do not want to spend time in an extra thing. With WhatsApp, there is no such problem. Even with a unique key for each message, Telegram has to take this into account.\n\nSignup process on both apps is really easy, but they both require your phone number for authentication. Although this is standard procedure, one cannot help but wonder how this complies with encryption and online privacy. With Telegram, you can also use two-factor authentication. The apps of Telegram are all open source and this means that you can modify them, according to your needs. The main focus of WhatsApp is the mobile phones and therefore its apps are primarily moving in that direction. Telegram has a wide variety of apps.\n\nOne important thing to consider is the fact that WhatsApp demands access to your address book. On Telegram, there is no similar demand for such access. Now, as far as special features are concerned, WhatsApp is definitely the winner. You can use group chats for up to 256 users and of course, this communication is always encrypted. Group chats of Telegram do not have encryption. On WhatsApp, you can also encrypt your Android and other phone calls.\n\nIn a nutshell, both these messaging apps are popular and offer quality services to their users. In terms of encryption, WhatsApp is the big winner. In terms of features and flexibility, though, Telegram is the number one option.\nAuthor bio: Ali Qamar is an Internet security research and tech enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the tech and security industry.

Modern Terrorism is technological, it makes a large use of the Internet and cyber terrorists represent a concrete threat for every country.\n\nMany governments are discussing \u201canti-terrorism\u201d legislations to contrast the threat, of course, privacy advocates are worried about the evolution of such kind of legal framework that could open the door to a massive surveillance and censorship. bill is now on its way to becoming law in Russia.\n\nIn these days a new anti-terrorism bill is becoming law in Russia, it includes a large number of issues related to internet monitoring that will have a severe impact also on IT companies and ISPs that operate in the country. Telecom and internet companies have to record and store all customer communications for six months, potentially at a multitrillion-dollar cost.\n\nThe internet firms will have to store all communications metadata for a year while telecom companies will have to store them for three years.\n\nThe bill that is sustained by the United Russia party passed last Friday in the Duma, a landslide victory if we consider that it obtained 277 votes for, 148 against, and only one abstaining. It now moves to Russia\u2019s Federal Council and the Kremlin, where it\u2019s expected to pass into law.\n\nThe next step is the final approval of the anti-terrorism bill by the Russia\u2019s Federal Council and the Kremlin, but we have no doubts that it will be soon a Russian law..\n\nTelecom operators and internet companies, for example, will have to record and store all customer communications for six months. This means that the companies will have to face multitrillion-dollar additional costs to be compliant with the new anti-terrorism law.\n\nThe new law is being called an anti-terrorism bill, but it could be considered as the formal legalization of already ongoing surveillance activities.\n\nYes, in Russia, like elsewhere, the Government already has the technology to conduct a massive network surveillance. In August 2014, the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has signed a decree that will extend the use of SORM-2 to social network surveillance.\n\nIt\u2019s known that the Russian Government is applying a strict surveillance on the Internet within the country, the Kremlin has developed a system code-named \u201cSORM-2\u201d to monitor Russian citizens.\n\nThe Russian Government has obliged national ISPs to purchase and install the probes used by SORM-2 system that allows the Federal Security Service (FSB) to monitor Internet traffic including online communications.\n\nSORM-2 is a mass surveillance system that allows the Government of Moscow to track online activities of single individuals thanks to the support of Russian ISP.\n\n\n\nThe new anti-terrorism bill obliges all internet firms into providing mandatory backdoor access into encrypted communications for the Russian intelligence Agency (FSB).\n\nAccording to the news shared with the media, the law will have no impact on instant messaging services implementing end-to-end encryption, this means that popular applications like Telegram, WhatsApp, Viber, and Signal will be out of the scope of the law. The bad news is that the law will extend to all the ISP operating in the country that will have to provide the Russian Intelligence the access to the entire traffic.\n\nThe companies that will not be compliant with the anti-terrorism bill will face fines that can reach 1 million rubles ($15,000), but I think that financial sanctions are the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe government stiffens penalties for those who make online propaganda or who encourage discussion concerning terrorism. They risk imprisonment up to seven years.\n\nThe anti-terrorism law also cover the omission of informing authorities about activities related to terrorism, it will be considered a crime too and authorities will punish the culprits with up to one year in prison.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Anti-terrorism bill, Russia)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "FTC\u2019s chief technologist was victim of Id theft, someone hijacked her phone number", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48147/cyber-crime/id-theft.html", "title": "FTC\u2019s chief technologist was victim of Id theft, someone hijacked her phone number\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 8, 2016", "body": "The incident that I\u2019m going to tell you is worrisome, the US Federal Trade Commission\u2019s chief technologist Lorrie Cranor gets her phone number hijacked. The FTC\u2019s chief technologist was hacked by someone posing as her went into a mobile phone store and hijacked her number.\n\nLorrie Cranor described the what happened in a blog post, a few weeks ago an unknown person walked into a mobile phone store, claimed to be the FTC\u2019s chief technologist and requested an update for Cranor\u2019s mobile phones. The criminal obtained in this way two brand new iPhone devices assigned to her telephone numbers.\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago an unknown person walked into a mobile phone store, claimed to be me, asked to upgrade my mobile phones, and walked out with two brand new iPhones assigned to my telephone numbers. My phones immediately stopped receiving calls, and I was left with a large bill and the anxiety and fear of financial injury that spring from identity theft.\u201d said Lorrie Cranor.\n\n\n\nThe Cranor\u2019s mobile devices immediately stopped working, the FTC\u2019s chief technologist was clearly a victim of ID theft.\n\n\u201cOne evening my mobile phone stopped working mid call. After discovering that another phone on my account also had no signal, I called my mobile carrier on a landline phone. The customer service representative explained that my account had been updated to include new iPhones, and in the process the SIM cards in my Android phones had been deactivated. She assumed it was a mistake, and told me to take my phones to one of my mobile carrier\u2019s retail stores.\u201d continues the FTC\u2019s chief technologist.\n\n\u201cThe store replaced my SIM cards and got my phones working again. A store employee explained that a thief claiming to be me had gone into a phone store and \u201cupgraded\u201d my two phones to the most expensive iPhone models available and transferred my phone numbers to the new iPhones.\u201d\n\nThe most disconcerting part of the story is the response of the mobile carrier, below the description provided by the victim.\n\n\u201cI called my mobile carrier\u2019s fraud department and reported what happened. The representative agreed to remove the charges, but blamed the theft on me. When I asked how the store authenticated the thief, he told me that employees of stores owned by the mobile carrier would have asked for the account holder\u2019s photo ID and the last four digits of their social security number, but if the theft occurred at another retailer, that might not have happened.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this kind of crimes is increasing, for this reason, it is desirable that the unnamed carrier involved in the incident will provide the paperwork filed by the criminal to hijack the Cranor\u2019s mobile number.\n\nClearly the thief used Cranor\u2019s counterfeit documents, the iPhones were acquired at a retail store in Ohio, which is far from the Cranor\u2019s residency.\n\nIn January 2013, the FTC received 1,038 claims for mobile hijacking, this kind of practice accounts for about 3.2 percent of all the identity thefts reported that month to the FTC. By January 2016, the FTC received reports of 2,658 hijacks, representing 6.3 percent of identity thefts that month.\n\nThe situation is getting worse because the number of claims reported to the FTC reached 2,658 hijacks in the same period of 2016.\n\n\u201cRecords of identity thefts reported to the FTC provide some insight into how often thieves hijack a mobile phone account or open a new mobile phone account in a victim\u2019s name. In January 2013, there were 1,038 incidents of these types of identity theft reported, representing 3.2% of all identity theft incidents reported to the FTC that month. By January 2016, that number had increased to 2,658 such incidents, representing 6.3% of all identity thefts reported to the FTC that month.  Such thefts involved all four of the major mobile carriers.\u201d states the Cranor\u2019s post.\n\nSuch kind of crimes could have different motivations, attackers could operate for profits reselling the victims\u2019 mobile devices or could spy on their victims.\n\nCranor explained that ID theft victims can access the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s identitytheft.gov website to report the crime and receive detailed instructions to regain possession of their identity.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 ID theft, phone number hijacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/id-theft", "topic_name": "ID theft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/identity-theft", "topic_name": "Identity Theft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phone-number-hijacking", "topic_name": "phone number hijacking"}]}, {"news_name": "Unlimited surveillance capabilities, but it\u2019s going to cost you", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/47974/mobile-2/surveillance-unlimited-spying.html", "title": "Unlimited surveillance capabilities, but it\u2019s going to cost you\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 3, 2016", "body": "Israeli-based company Ability is planning a big marketing push aimed at law enforcement in the United States.  Ability Unlimited Interception System (ULIN) promises unlimited surveillance capabilities of revealing the location, calls, and texts of any cell phone on the planet.  The price tag, US$20 million, but with the necessity of responding to the more and more criminal activity being facilitated over mobile networks, the price could be well worth it to keep citizens safe.\n\n\u201cLaunched in November last year, it can cost as much as $20 million, depending on how many targets the customer wants to surveil.\u201d reported Forbes. \u201cAll a ULIN customer requires is the target\u2019s phone number or the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity), the unique identifier for an individual mobile device. Got those? Then boom \u2013 you can spy on a target\u2019s location, calls and texts.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbility was founded in 1993 by experts with military intelligence and communications backgrounds.  Specializing in off-air interception of cellular and even satellite communications, Ability\u2019s ULIN technology is a leap forward in espionage capabilities. ULIN\u2019s strength is its ability to capture GSM, MTS, and LTE phone traffic without the need of having to be within close proximity of the device, or with the consent of the mobile carrier, which the phone may belong too.\n\nAt the core of ULIN, is its ability to exploit a vulnerability in Signaling System No. 7 (SS7), an international telecommunications standard that defines how public switched telephone networks (PSTN) exchange information over digital networks for mobile phones.  The SS7 nodes are called \u201csignaling points\u201d that use out-of-band signaling providing network efficiency and other services such as call forwarding.\n\nAbility licenses this vulnerability from an unknown third party and claims to solely granted access to, or knowledge of, the SS7 vulnerability. All that is required by law enforcement to tap into a phone is the mobile phone number of the target.\n\nHacking of SS7 is nothing new.  In 2015, the FCC launched a probe into the problem after \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired a report showing German computer scientist Karsten Nohl tapping into U.S. Representative Ted Lieu\u2019s mobile phone.  In a counter argument, John Marinho, vice president of the mobile industry group CTIA, claimed Nohl was giving \u201cextraordinary access\u201d for his demonstration for 60 minutes.  Ability\u2019s UNIL system appears to overcome that challenge, exploiting the bridge between end-of-life technology SS7, and fully digital networks.\n\nIt is likely that civil liberties groups will take exception to Ability\u2019s push into\n\n\u201cThis system means that law enforcement will have the ability to conduct wiretaps and location tracking without anybody scrutinizing what they\u2019re doing, and nobody may have the opportunity to push back and demand appropriate legal process.\u201d \n\nAdditionally, it has yet to be determined how ULIN runs afoul of U.S. laws on wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping \u2013 a federal crime that carries stiff penalties in fines and even imprisonment.\n\nIn the end, the opportunities for U.S. law enforcement may be too great an offer to refuse.  Even at a $20 million price tag, the capability of conducting criminal investigations bypassing the need of the consent of mobile carriers may reduce time and cost significantly enough to justify the expenditure.  The reality is, domestic surveillance is likely here to stay. The efficiency at which information flows between the federal government down to the hands of municipal law enforcement has been questionable in recent years, including the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, which the real-time sharing of information prior to the bombing was called into question.\n\nThe argument will ultimately boil down to safety versus privacy.  Which side Ability and its ULIN technology lands is yet to be seen.\n\n\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

Although Holder believes that Snowden \u201charmed American interests,\u201d the argument of how far government can, or should, peek into the very personal details of its citizens continues to agitate civil rights advocates around the globe.\n\nThe New York Times recently highlighted the story of Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights advocate living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who claims that country\u2019s domestic espionage program led to his imprisonment and beating as well as a great financial loss. According to Bill Marczak,\n\nAccording to Bill Marczak, senior fellow at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, Mr. Mansoor had been targeted by spyware provided by Germany\u2019s Finfisher and Italy\u2019s Hacking Team.

Though no specific proof has been offered by Mr. Mansoor as to whether the government of the UAE is behind the attacks against him, his personal research into spyware found on his personal computer led him to the Royal Group, a company run by one of six ruling families of the UAE.  Analysis of data leaked in 2015 as a result of hackers penetrating Hacking Team\u2019s databases revealed the UAE was that company\u2019s second largest customer spending some US$635,500 on spyware.\n\nTargeting of dissidents and journalists by what is believed to be state-sponsored cyber-espionage has been steadily increasing.  In 2015, it was reported by Citizen Lab opposition leaders in Ecuador and Venezuela was targeted by Packrat malware.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing target of Packrat was Argentina\u2019s Alberto Nisman, that country\u2019s special prosecutor who \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 attempted to press criminal charges against Christina Kirchner, Argentina\u2019s president.  Mr. Nisman was later found dead of a gunshot wound to the head. His death remains a mystery and no arrests have been made.\n\nEric Holder and Edward Snowden may seem to be strange bedfellows in the debate over domestic espionage but Snowden\u2019s whistleblowing has brought about an awareness and a global debate about the ease at which governments are able to spy.\n\n\n\nThe tools provided by Hacking Team are relatively inexpensive and yet very effective.  The availability of these tools is becoming increasingly widespread. Recent analysis of underground hacking sites reveals that a zero-day malware package able to compromise Microsoft\u2019s most current operating system can be had for around US$100K \u2013 not out of reach for a well-funded government or clandestine espionage group.\n\nThere is very little doubt in the mind of many that Snowden has caused irreparable damage to the U.S. espionage program; a program that the U.S., and other nations, greatly rely upon to protect its citizens.  Unfortunately, those same tools that protect its citizens have been and most likely often used against them.  So was Snowden right in his actions?  Maybe, maybe not; however, to Snowden\u2019s credit, we can now openly debate the use of these tools and how best to use them for good, or at least warn those who want to bring meaningful change to their country\u2019s that what they say can and sometimes used against them \u2013 even by their own government.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

Some websites are able to monitor and track users through fingerprinting techniques based on the HTML Canvass API and WebRTC local IP discovery.\n\nToday we will discuss a new web-tracking technique called Audio Fingerprinting.\n\nThe Audio Fingerprinting tracking technique represents a valid solution for the advertising industry and for law enforcement agencies. It could be used to de-anonymized users surfing through a VPN network without decrypting the traffic.\n\nA group of researchers from the Princeton University have conducted a study on multiple Google domains and discovered the company is tracking users on nearly 80 percent of all Top 1 Million Domains by leveraging on a variety of tracking and identification techniques.\n\n\u201cWe make 15 types of measurements on each site, including stateful (cookie-based) and stateless (fingerprinting-based) tracking, the effect of browser privacy tools, and the exchange of tracking data between different sites (\u201ccookie syncing\u201d). Our findings include multiple sophisticated fingerprinting techniques never before measured in the wild\u201d states the paper published by the researchers.\n\nOne of these tracking methods is the Audio Fingerprinting technique that relies on the audio stack of the machine through the use of the AudioContext API.The researchers discovered that it is possible to harvest the audio signals of the each machine that is using the AudioContext API to reveal unique browser and device combinations.\n\nThe technique is devious as efficient, a third-party tracker could use the AudioContext API to send low-frequency sounds to a user\u2019s machine and then measures the way it processes the data in order to create a unique fingerprint.\n\n\u201cA script from the company Liverail checks for the existence of an AudioContext and OscillatorNode to add a single bit of information to a broader fingerprint. More sophisticated scripts process an audio signal generated with an OscillatorNode to fingerprint the device.\u201d wrote the researchers.\u201dThis technique appears conceptually similar to that of canvas fingerprinting. Audio signals processed on different machines or browsers may have slight differences due to hardware or software differences between the machines while the same combination of machine and browser will produce the same output.\u201d\n\nThe team of researchers has published a live demo page of the technique to show to fingerprint users exploiting the AudioContext API.\n\nFortunately, the Audio fingerprinting technique is not widespread.\n\nThe researchers used the open-source tool OpenWPM to perform their tests, is implements numerous advanced features, including the ability to automatically log into websites using specified credentials. It loads sites in common browsers (i.e. Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer) collecting data on the tracking loaded on each page.\n\nThe work of the researchers is precious, such kind of analysis will help privacy defenders against the proliferation of tracking techniques.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

Facebook is accused to have violated federal privacy laws by scanning the private messages. The situation is even more serious if we consider that the company uses the information to make profits and share it with commercial partners, including advertising firms.\n\nThe accusers, Matthew Campbell, and Michael Hurley claim the company is collecting data related the URLs included in the messages and it is organizing it in a searchable form, both actions in contrast with the rules included in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California Invasion of Privacy Act.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs allege that Facebook routinely scans those URLs for advertising and other user-targeting data \u2014 and claim that by maintaining those records in a searchable form, Facebook is violating both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California Invasion of Privacy Act. Facebook disputes that private messages are scanned in bulk, and maintains the URL data is anonymized and only used in aggregate form.\u201d reports a blog post published by the Verge.\n\n\n\nWhy does Facebook scan private messages?\n\nThe answer is very simple, the company routinely scans private messages in order to prevent abuse, its engine search for malicious URLs or any link to child pornography and violent content. Anyway, Facebook is accused of using the data resulting from the scan for advertising and to target its offer.\n\nThe company defends itself against accusations, claiming that its systems scan users\u2019 private messages in bulk, and keeps any extracted data in an anonymized way.\n\nThe plaintiffs sustain that Facebook is currently maintaining a database, dubbed Titan, it includes all the URL-related message alongside with metadata that could be used to track a specific user. Each record includes, for example, the date and time the message was sent, and the user IDs of both the sender and the recipient.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Facebook is accused of threatening users\u2019 privacy with its practices.\n\nThe CNET news portal reached the company for a comment on the case and below is reported the reply of a company spokesperson who confirmed they stopped any practice that exposes user\u2019s privacy to serious risk.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the court\u2019s finding that the alleged conduct did not result in any actual harm and that it would be inappropriate to allow plaintiffs to seek damages on a class-wide basis,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told CNET. \u201cThe remaining claims relate to historical practices that are entirely lawful, and we look forward to resolving those claims on the merits.\u201d\n\nThe position of the company is in contrast with the claims of the plaintiffs that sustain Facebook is still scanning private messages for commercial purposes violating users\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s source code not only reveals that Facebook continues to acquire URL content from private messages, but that it also continues to make use of the content it acquires.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2012 and still have to be proceeded, the plaintiffs have until June 8 to file any amended complaints.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

Now, however, a new study confirms what privacy advocates have been arguing for years. This is according to US researchers who used basic phone logs and were able to identify individuals and access their confidential information.\n\nAll of these personal details were derived from anonymous \u201cmetadata\u201d found on individuals\u2019 calls and texts. The two scientists at Stanford University who conducted the research were able to figure out individuals\u2019 names, where they lived and association information.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all they found.\n\nThey also uncovered details such as gun ownership, medical and disability information and activities involving recreational drugs.When the results were paired with public information already available on services such as Yelp, Google and Facebook, a much bigger, more detailed picture of a given individual\u2019s life can be seen.\n\nFormer general counsel at the US National Security Agency (NSA), Stewart Baker has said that, \u201cmetadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an Android app. The app also received information from their Facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. In all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.\u201d read an article published by the The Guardian.\n\n\u201cAnalysts who logged into the NSA\u2019s metadata gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. A call from the target individual\u2019s phone to another number was one hop. From that phone to another was two hops. And so on. The records available to analysts stretched back for five years. The collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.\u201d\n\nAlarmingly, the Stanford study revealed that given just one phone number to start with, the NSA program would have access to telephone metadata for tens of millions of people. With restrictions in place, however, the number plummets\u2013but still indicates that armed with just one phone number, it is possible to retrieve metadata on 25,000 people.\n\n\n\nPatrick Mutchler, a computer security researcher at Stanford, writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, goes over some key points:\n\nThe scientists were eventually able to determine relationships based on analyzing individuals\u2019 call patterns. Following that, they \u201cgathered details on calls made to and from a list of organisations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms, marijuana dispensaries, and sex establishments. From these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nMutchler hopes these findings will give legislators pause in regard to to authorizing mass surveillance programs: \u201cLarge-scale metadata surveillance programs, like the NSA\u2019s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,\u201d he wrote. Mutchler went on to write: \u201cTo strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University argues that the study presents data that discussions can now be based on, saying: \u201cWith the right analytics running over nation-scale comms data you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. We always suspected that of course, but here\u2019s the data.\u201d\n\nWritten by: Sneacker \n\nAuthor Bio: Sneacker is a writer who works in the information technology field.

The diffusion of the technology and the increasing threats of espionage and terrorism is approached by the intelligence with a significant intensification of monitoring activities.\n\nAccording to 2015 transparency report regarding the use of National Security Authorities, the US intelligence has ramped up searches of US citizens\u2019 data.\n\nThe US intelligence agencies access information stored in a database that is fed with the data gathered by the surveillance machine managed by the NSA. Edward Snowden has leaked online documents related to powerful surveillance platforms like the XKeyScore that is considered the \u201cwidest-reaching\u201d architecture for developing intelligence from the internet.\n\nGoing deep in the report is it possible to discover that the number of surveillance queries concerning known US citizens is 4,672, almost double respect the same number declare in the 2013 transparent report.\n\nThe above number related to the surveillance queries include the requests made by Intelligence Agencies, like the NSA and CIA, but doesn\u2019t include the FBI that has no access to the database.\n\n\n\nThe intelligence transparency report also refers more than 48,000 targets of National Security Letters, a National Security Letters (NSL) is defined as \u201ca request for information that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can make when they or other agencies in the Executive Branch of the U.S. government are conducting national security investigations. An NSL can\u2019t be used in ordinary criminal, civil or administrative matters.\u201d\n\nThe agencies query the database without a warrant as specified in section 702 of FISA ( \u201cProcedures for Targeting Certain Persons Outside the United States Other Than United States Persons\u201d).\n\nThe section highlights that \u201cThe government may not target any U.S. person anywhere in the world under this authority, nor may it target a person outside of the U.S. if the purpose is to acquire information from a particular, known person inside the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 702 only permits the targeting of non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information. Such targets, however, may on occasion communicate information of or about U.S. persons.  Where appropriate, NSA may disseminate such information concerning U.S. persons. \u201d clarifies the report.\n\nThe 4,672 cases cited in the transparency report demonstrate that the US intelligence has gathered and accessed data of US citizens without any warrant. You have also to consider that the NSA and the CIA theoretically don\u2019t cover internal surveillance activities.\n\nThe report also identifies more than 48,000 targets of National Security Letters, a common business request that has also been criticized as unconstitutional.\n\nAdditionally, according to the report, the FBI sent out 48,642 national security letters (NSL) in 2015.

All of the 1,457 requests made last year by the NSA and FBI were approved. This was the case in 2014, as well. All 1,379 requests submitted were approved by the court. There was, however, a significant increase in requests that were modified by the court before they were approved: 80 applications were revised in 2015, as opposed to 19 in 2014.\n\nAdditionally, according to the report, the FBI sent out 48,642 national security letters (NSL) in 2015. NSLs are demands for information which include gag orders forbidding the recipient from disclosing the request.\n\nThe FISA Court is responsible for approving or denying electronic spying requests for use in foreign intelligence activities. It should be noted that the role of the court is to provide oversight\u2013not to working in concert with the government.\n\nSimilarly, during the second half of 2015, government requests for Facebook to spy on its users increased 13% to 46,763. This is according to Facebook\u2019s bi-annual transparency report. Included in the requests were personal data and messaging content from Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\n\n\n\nSixty percent of those requests for access to the data of Facebook users in the U.S. came with a non-disclosure order preventing Facebook from alerting the user to the fact that their personal data had been accessed and their communications were being monitored.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is one step closer to being authorized to remotely access computers anywhere in the world.  According to TechDirt:\n\n\u201cThe proposed amendments to Rule 41 remove jurisdiction limitations, which would allow the FBI to obtain a search warrant in, say, Virginia, and use it to \u2018search\u2019 computers across the nation using Network Investigative Techniques (NITs).\n\nThe DOJ claims the updates are needed because suspects routinely anonymize their connections, making it difficult to determine where they\u2019re actually located. Opponents of the changes point out that this significantly broadens the power of magistrate judges, who would now be able to approve search warrants targeting any computer anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nThere has been no congressional opposition to the proposed amendments, with the exception of Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR).\n\nMeanwhile, National Intelligence chief James Clapper has been attempting to reverse all the progress made over the past couple years with encrypted communications. Clapper recently referred to encryption as \u201cnot a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe encrypted communications market emerged in reaction to the government\u2019s overzealous efforts to sidestep the 4th Amendment. The government inadvertently created what it is now trying to destroy.\n\nWritten by: Sneacker \n\nAuthor Bio: Sneacker is a writer who works in the information technology field.

We have since blocked this unauthorized access and made additional changes to our technical infrastructure to prevent future incidents.\u201d\n\nThe incident prompted two new features to enhance security measures for Slack users/teams.  This included two-factor authentication (2FA) and \u201cPassword Kill Switch\u201d for team owners.\n\nFast forward approx. a year, and Slack\u2019s commitment to \u201ctake security seriously\u201d had reassured its users that \u201cevery person and team using our service expects their data to be secure and confidential\u201d (more here) has put Slack on the spotlight several times including this one.\n\n\n\nThe team at Detectify, the creators of a SaaS (security/software-as-a-service) based website security service that audit your company\u2019s website security, have discovered an interesting \u201cfeature\u201d.  This feature, called Slack bot, is Slack\u2019s way of marinating authenticity and integrity of the developer and their code/script/program when other Slack users (dev-peers/team) use their code through a process of tokenization\u2014the process of creating a unique ID with privileges such as digital signaling your work.\n\nThink of tokenization as a handshake of a static key. To execute the code in an environment, the right parameters must be met. If the parameters aren\u2019t met, then the security prevention measures will not allow the execution to take place and report an error.  Since, naturally, developers first thing on their mind is to code, they are often unaware of the security ramification when sharing their work to the world.  Github is one of those portals that these developers use to share their work and get ideas and even code contribution. But, what if someone else is able to obtain this token? And use this token to access more than just your code, your workspace or even be able to impersonate you?   Thanks to Detecity, they were able to produce this proof-of-concept and expose these Slack bot tokens that the developers use for their code in clear text through Github\u2019s search engine.   More from Detectify post here.\n\nIt is important to note that tokenization is a safe and secure measure to adopt in developing software\u2014in this case; however, not assigning the appropriate privileges on the token can and will put your data/code/work at risk leading to potential security incidents.  Since Slack bot takes care of that for the developer, its lack of setting the right privileges is placing Slack on the hot seat\u2026again.\n\nStill, I give credit where its due. Slack\u2019s ongoing bug bounty on HackerOne  is thriving and active.  In fact, they are looking for security engineers.\n\nTake away from all this:\n\n\u201cNEVER COMMIT CREDENTIALS INSIDE CODE.

It is often viewed as an invasion of privacy and employer overstepping their authority.\n\nFrom an employer perspective, employee monitoring is a very useful tool, allowing them to solve a number of issues and challenges, and raise the general health and effectiveness of an organization. It is something that employers used for a very long time. A couple of decades ago they tapped corporate phones, checked mail and conducted video surveillance. Nowadays they monitor employee PCs, social networks, and e-mails. Most of the time such monitoring is not conducted out of maliciousness toward employees, but rather to serve a specific business-related purpose.\n\nThe question then is \u2013 can the compromise on employee monitoring be found? How to monitor employee internet usage while getting him or her on your side and ensuring cooperation? Practice shows that it is possible, and in this article we will try to give you some tips on how to monitor employee PC use ethically and without overstepping your boundaries.\n\n\n\nFirst, it is important to understand the reason why it can be very useful and often even necessary to monitor what employees are doing. Such reasons often differs from one organization to the other. However, they all can be generalized into three main categories:\n\nEmployee monitoring can solve these crucial issues to the benefit of an organization. However, your employees most likely will not be happy with your decision to monitor their PCs.\n\nMost employees viewing monitoring negatively and usually meet it with hostility. It is rarely considered to be a useful business or security tool, but rather an oppressive practice by the overly zealous boss.\n\nThis negative opinion is usually based on a number of legitimate concerns that can be summarized as follows:\n\nInvasive monitoring often leads to lower general work satisfaction. As a result, such monitoring will produce an opposite effect to the one intended: instead of improving employee productivity, it will reduce it. However, there are certain ways and best practices to change the situation and conduct employee monitoring that satisfies all involved parties.\n\nOne of the best tips to employee computer monitoring, is to approach the issue ethically and fairly, with respect for the privacy of your employees in mind. First, you need to make sure that employee monitoring is prompted by a very serious business need that can be clearly formulated and easily communicated to your employees. You should not monitor your employees beyond your direct business needs, and should not collect data, that is not necessary for business purposes.\n\nIt is important to create a clear formal monitoring policy based on your needs and stick to it. Make sure that your employees are familiar with it and understand it. You need to clearly communicate what employee actions are being monitored and in what way, and how this information will be used to help your organization.\n\nOne of the best practices on how to monitor employees computer usage is to notify them when they are being monitored. While it is not required by federal law, it will show your concern for the privacy of your employees and will help to facilitate the relationship of trust between you.\n\nAnother important point that can help you make employee monitoring more effective is the right software selection. It is very important to use the right tools for the right job. You need to clearly define what type of information you want to collect and why, and choose the tool that will allow you to do just that.\n\nThere are a lot of different simple solutions for recording certain types of user activity, such as keystrokes recording, network monitoring, and employee tracking software, etc. These solutions are easily available and not expensive, often even free. They can be used to control employee productivity, monitor their internet and social network usage, and as a basic security precautions.\n\nHowever, if your goal is to organize centralized monitoring at a number of endpoints, monitor compliance, or you want a way to actually reliably detect and prevent insider threats, then you need to employ a more sophisticated professional software. Such solution needs to be heavily protected, configurable, and capable of collecting a large amount of important data regarding network and application usage.\n\nAgent-based user monitoring software, are able to create video recording of everything employee sees on their screen coupled with large amounts of relevant metadata. Such solutions allow you to comply with regulations, thoroughly protect your organization from insider threats and provide you with all the necessary data for employee performance evaluation. They can be configured to record either the whole user session, or only specific data, allowing you to collect only information that is needed.\n\nThe downside is that most of these business solutions are very expensive and can be cost-prohibitive for small companies, although there are some offers with flexible licensing. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate your needs and consider all available options when deciding what employee monitoring software to use.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDennis Turpitka is the CEO of  Ekransystem, an expert within Digital Security solution business design and development, Virtualization and Cloud Computing R&D projects, establishment and management of Software Research direction.

It operates touchless, highly reliable, hygienic, and super-fast. The biometric authentication based on Palm vein recognition takes less than one second and can definitely enter the next level of payments soon.\n\n\n\nCash could well be a thing of the past in the not-so-distant future and it is becoming clearly obvious that the time, where Credit cards and pin codes have been used for payments has come to an that means more innovative and highly secure solutions are entering the banking technology. In the UK, 59% of consumers have made a purchase through a smart device, and 12% are more likely to make a purchase using their smartphone than they were 12 months ago. And with more and more people interested in mobile and digital payments, brands are racing to create ever-more secure ways to pay. As a case in point, MasterCard has created a secure way to pay that allows users to identify themselves using a selfie taken on their smartphone.\n\nFujitsu has announced plans to roll out its digital payment system PalmSecure in Europe that is a security solution for biometric identification, which is offering the perfect user authentication for payment scenarios. It operates touchless, hygienic, highly reliable and super-fast. The biometric authentication based on Palm vein recognition takes less than 1 second and can definitely enter the next level of payments soon.\n\n\n\nThe PalmSecure sensor captures more than five million reference points from someone\u2019s palm-vein pattern to confirm their identity and allows them to pay for goods by just touching one of its sensors \u2013 no cash or credit cards needed here. The image capture and matching processes work without the need to touch the sensor\u2019s surface, making it very hygienic. A person\u2019s palm vein pattern remains the same throughout their life. Every palm-vein pattern is also unique. Individuals have different patterns in their left and their right hands, and even twins have different patterns. The palm vein device works by capturing a person\u2019s vein pattern image while radiating it with near-infrared rays. The deoxidized haemoglobin in the palm vein absorbs these rays, thereby reducing the reflection rate and causing the veins to appear as a black pattern. This vein pattern is then verified against a pre-registered pattern to authenticate the individual.\n\nIn the graph below, Fujitsu compares some of the most common technologies by the criteria \u201caccuracy\u201d and \u201cpracticality\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe following table ranks biometric methods on their False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). These indicators define the security level of a biometric system (FAR) and the usability of a biometric system (FRR).\n\n\n\nThe way that people pay is changing; technology is advancing to a level that people might not have to carry credit cards ever again, let alone cash. Brands should be keeping abreast of these technological changes and consumers\u2019 increasing interest in the quickest and easiest way for them to pay; after all the easier it is for people to buy, the more they will.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAli Taherian (@ali_taherian) is an enthusiastic information security Officer.

Tor browser is preconfigured to prevent a lot of possible attacks on user privacy, not only the communications layer provided by tor itself.\u201d wrote Jose Carlos Norte.\n\n\u201cOne common problem that tor browser tries to address is user fingerprinting. If a website is able to generate a unique fingerprint that identifies each user that enters the page, then it is possible to track the activity of this user in time, for example, correlate visits of the user during an entire year, knowing that its the same user. Or even worse, it could be possible to identify the user if the fingerprint is the same in tor browser and in the normal browser used to browse internet. It is very important for the tor browser to prevent any attempt on fingerprinting the user.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe researcher explained that his Javascript code, once deployed on a website, could fingerprint a user based on how he moves the mouse. The researcher explained that observing user\u2019s movements in a \u2018significant\u2019 number of pages the user visits on the clear web it is possible to create a unique fingerprint that can allow his identification even when he is in the Tor network.\n\nThe expert created a quick and dirty PoC called UberCookie to demonstrate that is possible to fingerprint a user in a controlled environment.\n\nNorte explained that the most interesting fingerprinting vector he discovered on Tor Browser is getClientRects that allows to get the exact pixel position and size of the box of a given DOM element.\n\nThe results of the getClientRects call depend on multiple factors, including the resolution and the font configuration that can compose the fingerprinting vector.\n\nLorenzo Bicchierai from MotherBoard tried to contact members of the Tor Project and is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\u201cThe Tor Project did not respond to a request for comment, but it seems that its developers are looking into this issue, according to two official bug reports. \u201d wrote Bicchierai.\n\nThe popular cyber security expert Mikko Hypponen published a Tweet that define \u201cclever\u201d the technique.\n\nClever! Fingerprinting a website user based on his mouse wheel moves, as reported by your browser. Has a demo, too. https://t.co/0MDkmpfxc5\n\n\u2014 Mikko Hypponen (@mikko) 8 Marzo 2016\n\n\n\nTo avoid beign tracked with this fingerprint technique users can deactivate Javascript completely.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Tor network, fingerprint)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Let\u2019s Encrypt has already issued one Million certificates", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45152/breaking-news/lets-encrypt-one-million-certificates.html", "title": "Let\u2019s Encrypt has already issued one Million certificates\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 9, 2016", "body": "The open Certificate Authority (CA) Let\u2019s Encrypt seems to be a success, the EFF is reaching its goals with the creation of this new certificate authority run by Internet Security Research Group (ISRG).\n\nIT giants like Mozilla, Cisco, Akamai, Automattic and IdenTrust joined the initiative with the support of the Linux Foundation. The principal goal is to create a more secure web by encrypting website traffic using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and improve users\u2019 privacy online.\n\nThe Let\u2019s Encrypt CA issued its first certificate in September 2015, and today the EFF is proud to announce that Let\u2019s Encrypt has issued its first million certificates.\n\n\u201cAt 9:04am GMT today, the Let\u2019s Encrypt Certificate Authority issued its millionth certificate.

The Let\u2019s Encrypt initiative aims to overwhelm these issues by issuing free digital certificates and by automating each phase of the lifecycle of a digital certificate.\n\nThe Let\u2019s Encrypt has been a driving force for other similar initiatives, Amazon also started offering free certificates too.\n\nThere are other aspects to consider when dealing with Let\u2019s Encrypt certificates, certificates are valid for only 90 days, this means that some website operators might forget to renew their certificates in due time.\n\n\u201cUnlike other CAs that issue certificates that don\u2019t expire for years, LE is issuing short-lived certificates (90 days).

We hope that with more publicity about how risky it is to use weak passwords, more people will take steps to strengthen their passwords and, most importantly, use different passwords for different websites.\u201d\n\nLet me show you how users\u2019 worst passwords have evolved in the last three years:\n\n\n\nBelow the situation in 2014\n\n\n\nAnd in 2015, the list included the following strings:\n\n\n\n \n\nSports remain a popular password theme, but this year \u201cfootball\u201d has overtaken baseball, clear change of the Americans\u2019 passions.\n\nVery common are also terms used in the Star Wars saga, for the fist time in the list of worst passwords list we see terms like \u201cstarwars,\u201d \u201csolo,\u201d and \u201cprincess.\u201d Other novelties respect the 2014 list are \u201cwelcome\u201d, \u201clogin\u201d and \u201cpassw0rd.\u201d\n\nBelow the complete list of the worst passwords of 2015, is you are using one of them is time to change it!\n\nIf you want to have more information on the topic give a look to the \u201cWorst passwords ebook\u201d published by the company\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Worst passwords, Spash data)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/passwords", "topic_name": "passwords"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spash-data", "topic_name": "Spash data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/worst-passwords", "topic_name": "Worst passwords"}]}, {"news_name": "A new archive of US voting records appeared on the Dark Web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43751/cyber-crime/voting-records-dark-web.html", "title": "A new archive of US voting records appeared on the Dark Web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 19, 2016", "body": "Joseph Fox from Motherboard discovered alleged voting records of millions of American citizens on a website in the dark web.

Cassidy called LostPass his LastPass phishing attack.\n\n\u201cLostPass works because LastPass displays messages in the browser that attackers can fake. Users can\u2019t tell the difference between a fake LostPass message and the real thing because there is no difference. It\u2019s pixel-for-pixel the same notification and login screen\u201d wrote Cassidy in a blog post.\n\nThe LastPass phishing technique could allow an attacker to take over user accounts even if protected by the two-factor authentication.\n\nCassidy explained that this particular attack is feasible because LastPass is vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery that allows any site to send the application a logout notification.\n\nCassidy demonstrated how users can be tricked into submitting both their LastPass master password and their 2nd-factor authentication code, the attack method relies on a malicious server and exploits bogus pop-up notifications to fool the victims.\n\nThe LastPass phishing attack starts when the user visits a bogus website running javascript code that generates in the victim\u2019s browser a notification informing him he has been logged out of LastPass application. The message appears as legitimate and redirects victims to a fake LastPass login screen.\n\nThe fake login page requests the user entering his master password and the 2-factor authentication code, if the victim has enabled it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the victim submits the information requested they are sent to a web server controlled by the attacker.\n\nThe attacker can use the information to access LastPass\u2019 API and use the credentials to download and decrypt the victim\u2019s password.\n\nCassidy explained that LastPass, differently from other password managers like KeePass, encourages users to keep an encrypted backup of their password vault on its servers, this choice allows users to sync with multiple devices, but also enlarge their surface of attack. An attacker that is able to access the user\u2019s LastPass login credentials can get a copy of the password file.\n\nSimilar attacks against LastPass users are not a novelty, in 2015 the experts Garcia and Vigo developed a technique called \u201cEven the LastPass Will be Stolen, Deal with It!.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy work comes at LastPass from a different angle: you don\u2019t have access to a LastPass user\u2019s machine. Instead, you trick the user into giving you their credentials.\u201d Cassidy explained.\n\nThe researcher reported the issue to LastPass in November, and its experts acknowledged the flaw in December.\n\nLastPass has already released an update that mitigates this kind of phishing scheme avoiding users from being logged out and implemented a security alert to warn users when they\u2019ve entered their master password into a fake LastPass form.\n\nCassidy released LostPass tool on Github.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 LastPass Phishing attack, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cross-site-request-forgery", "topic_name": "Cross-site Request Forgery"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lastpass-phishing", "topic_name": "LastPass phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shmoon", "topic_name": "Shmoon"}]}, {"news_name": "Senior Bitcoin developer expects a failure of the currency", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43649/digital-id/bitcoin-failure.html", "title": "Senior Bitcoin developer expects a failure of the currency\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 16, 2016", "body": "Mike Hearn, a senior Bitcoin developer explained the failure of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency as experiment and announced he has stopped working on it and sold his coins.\n\nHearn blamed the community for the failure, according to the expert, it refused to adopt new standards for its grow.\n\nMike Hearn is the former chair of the bitcoin foundation\u2019s law and policy committee, he wrote a blog post titled \u201cThe resolution of the Bitcoin experiment\u201d to explain his point of view on the status of the popular virtual currency.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, I\u2019ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. \u201d he wrote. \u201cBut despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.\u201d \n\nHearn explained that the decentralised currency lacked \u201csystemically important institutions,\u201d the component of the community with power over the future of the currency is top resistant to change.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is open source software, although anyone can propose changes to its release, but only the core development team composed of 5 people has the authority to implement the changes.\n\nThose five have been split for the last six months about how to deal with bitcoin evolution.\n\n\u201cJeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen, the two of five Bitcoin Core committers who support a block size increase (and the two who have been around the longest), both have a stellar reputation within the community. They recently wrote a joint article titled \u201cBitcoin is Being Hot-Wired for Settlement\u201d.\n\nJeff and Gavin are generally softer in their approach than I am. I\u2019m more of a tell-it-like-I-see-it kinda guy, or as Gavin has delicately put it, \u201chonest to a fault\u201d. So the strong language in their joint letter is unusual. They don\u2019t pull any punches:\u201d wrote Hearn.\n\nGavin Andresen paired with Hearn in August to attempt to launch a fork of bitcoin currency, which would use the same basic code but overwhelm capacity constraints.\n\nWe are seeing a schism, some are pushing for the new version, called Bitcoin XT, others oppose it and want the old version. Unfortunately, technical reason linked to the miners blocked the launch of the Bitcoin XT.\n\nTo apply the changes requested in the Bitcoin XT, more than half of the computing power on the bitcoin network has to update their own software. The problem is that only a small portion of Bitcoin users mines the currency because it\u2019s expensive in terms of computer hardware, time and electricity. Consider that two individuals control more than 50% of the entire power of the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cWhy has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.\u201d wrote Hearn.\n\n\u201cWhy are they not allowing it to grow? Several reasons. One is that the developers of the \u201cBitcoin Core\u201d software that they run have refused to implement the necessary changes. Another is that the miners refuse to switch to any competing product, as they perceive doing so as \u201cdisloyalty\u201d \u2014and they\u2019re terrified of doing anything that might make the news as a \u201csplit\u201d and cause investor panic. They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away.\u201d\n\nConcluding, Hearn is betting on a congestion of the Bitcoin currency scheme, the impossibility to apply the changes will cause the decline of the project.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long-term trend should probably be downwards\u201d, Hearn concludes.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Bitcoin, Mike Hearn)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bitcoin", "topic_name": "Bitcoin"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mike-hearn", "topic_name": "Mike Hearn"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mining", "topic_name": "mining"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/virtual-currency", "topic_name": "virtual currency"}]}, {"news_name": "How to convert 30$ D-Link DCS web cameras into a backdoor", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43558/digital-id/d-link-web-cameras-backdoor.html", "title": "How to convert 30$ D-Link DCS web cameras into a backdoor\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 13, 2016", "body": "Vectra Threat Labs, part of Vectra Networks has invested time testing some IoT solutions available in the market, and one of the most interesting products its always the Wi-Fi security web cameras. According to experts from Vectra Threat Labs, web cameras, designed to improve the physical security, can be hacked and reprogrammed to be used as a backdoor.\n\n\u201cConsumer-grade IoT products can be easily manipulated by an attacker, used to steal an organization\u2019s private information, and go undetected by traditional security solutions,\u201d\u2026 \u201cWhile many of these devices are low-value in terms of hard costs, they can affect the security and integrity of the network, and teams need to keep an eye on them to reveal any signs of malicious behavior.\u201d Said the CSO of Vectra Networks, Gunter Ollmann.\n\nIt is technically possible to exploit an IoT device, including web cameras, as a backdoor, that means that the attackers can have access to an organization / home network 24x7without infect any internal workstation or server, bypassing firewalls and other intrusion prevention systems.\n\n\u201cMost organizations don\u2019t necessarily think of these devices as miniature computers, but essentially they are in that they can still give attackers access to sensitive company information, particularly because they are connected to the corporate network,\u201d\u2026 \u201cUnlike the computers people regularly interact with, these devices do not have the processing power or memory to run antivirus or other security software. Since they don\u2019t have usable persistent storage, attackers use NVRAM to store the configuration and flash ROM to store the malicious code.\u201d Added Gunter Ollmann.\n\nResearchers at Vectra Threat Labs tested a popular Wi-Fi camera in the market, the D-Link DCS 930L, that costs roughly $30, and was able to reprogram the device as a network backdoor, without disrupting its operation as a camera.\n\n\u201cConsumer-grade internet-of-things products can be easily manipulated by an attacker, used to steal an organisation\u2019s private information, and go undetected by traditional security solutions.\u201d\n\nThe researchers were able to access the memory chip of the web camera and dump its content to analyze it.\n\nThey discovered that the format of the firmware on this model of web cameras consists of a u-boot and a Linux kernel and image.\n\n\u201cWe could have used dd, lzma or cpio to extract the content of the firmware or we can let binwalk do this work. We still need to extract the last step of the cpio image to see the content of the image.\u201d States the post published by the experts.\n\n\n\nThe researchers were so able to access the Linux image filesystem and add a service to make the \u201cdirty job\u201d and remove the capacity to reflash the device in the future to avoid update.\n\n\u201cAt this point, adding a backdoor roughly devolves to adding a service inside a Linux system \u2013 in our case, all we want is a simple connect-back Socks proxy. This can either be accomplished with a srelay and netcat in the startup script or more optimized C code, or one could go with a simple callback backdoor with a shell using netcat and busybox which are already present on the system. \u201c\n\nAs a last note, D-Link has not fixed the vulnerability exploited by Vectra Threat Labs, and researchers are not expecting for a fix to come up soon, because a fix would need a Trusted Platform Module or a specialized chip to verify software updates.\n\nIf you want to know more about the all process used by Vectra, please check out their blog here.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  D-Link DCS web cameras, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/d-link-dcs", "topic_name": "D-Link DCS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/web-cameras", "topic_name": "web cameras"}]}, {"news_name": "A research team has found two flaws in the OAuth 2.0 protocol", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43518/digital-id/oauth-2-vulnerability.html", "title": "A research team has found two flaws in the OAuth 2.0 protocol\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 12, 2016", "body": "The OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol is widely used on social networking sites, every day billion of users access their profiles on Facebook and Google+ using it.\n\nAccording to researchers Daniel Fett, Ralf K\u00fcsters and Guido Schmitz  from the University of Trier, the protocol is affected by a couple of vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to subvert single sign-on authentication capturing login credentials to impersonate a user.\n\nThe researchers described a couple of attack scenarios, in the first one known as \u201cthe HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect\u201d the identity providers (IdP) inadvertently forward user credentials (ie, username and password) to the relying party (RP) or the attacker, in the second scenario the attacker can impersonate the victim.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to prove these properties, we discovered two previously unknown attacks on OAuth, which both break authorization as well as authentication. In the first attack, IdPs inadvertently forward user credentials (i.e., username and password) to the RP or the attacker. In the second attack, a network attacker can impersonate any victim. This severe attack is caused by a logical flaw in the OAuth 2.0 protocol and depends on the presence of malicious IdP. In practice, OAuth setups often allow for selected (and thus hopefully trustworthy) IdPs only. In these setups the attack would not apply. The attack, however, can be exploited in OpenID Connect, which, as mentioned, builds directly on OAuth\u201d reads the paper published by the researchers.\n\n\n\nWhen dealing with the \u201cthe HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect\u201d attack scenario the researchers explained that an attacker can exploit the flaws to capture the user\u2019s credentials when access an identity provider.\n\n\u201cIn this attack, the attacker (running a malicious RP) learns the user\u2019s credentials when the user logs in at an IdP that uses the wrong HTTP redirection status code.\u201d\n\nThe experts suggest to permit only HTTP 303 codes in OAuth to solve the issue, since \u201cthe 303 redirect is defined unambiguously to drop the body of an HTTP POST request\u201d.\n\nIn a second attack scenario, dubbed : IdP Mix-Up, the attacker confuses an RP about which IdP the user chose at the beginning of the authorisation process, in this way he can steal an authentication code or access token and impersonate the victim. The attacker run a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on the IdP to obtain the authorisation code or the access token.\n\n\u201cIn this attack, the attacker confuses an RP about which IdP the user chose at the beginning of the login/authorization process in order to acquire an authentication code or access token which can be used to impersonate the user or access user data.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, the RP sends the authorisation code or the access token (depending on the OAuth mode) issued by the honest IdP to the attacker, who then can use these values to login at the RP under the user\u2019s identity (managed by the honest IdP) or access the user\u2019s protected resources at the honest IdP.\u201d\n\nAlso in this case the researchers provided a suggestion to fix the issue, OAuth has to include the identity of the IdP in the redirect.\n\n \u201cMore specifically, we propose that RPs provide a unique redirection endpoint for each IdP. Hence, the information which IdP redirected the browser to the RP is encoded in the request and the RP can detect a mismatch.\u201d\n\nAs for future work, the researchers will conduct a formal analysis of OpenID Connect.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 oAuth 2.0, digital identity)\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-identity", "topic_name": "Digital Identity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/oauth-2-0", "topic_name": "OAuth 2.0"}]}, {"news_name": "Experts revealed that security camera vendors lack of security by design", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43405/digital-id/security-camera-vendors-insecurity.html", "title": "Experts revealed that security camera vendors lack of security by design\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 8, 2016", "body": "A new study made by researchers from NowSecure shows that IoT vendors have yet a lot to learn in terms of security, often doing many mistakes in that area.\n\nIn the new research NowSecure explains that Security Cameras accessible through mobile apps are becoming a must for homeowners. Unfortunately, these mobile apps are lacking security, leaving in the open dangerous possibilities.\n\n\u201cEvery camera-and-app combination I tested included at least one security flaw that concerned me. Camera vendors sell numerous models, and it wasn\u2019t feasible for me to test them all. \u201d wrote the researcher Jake Van Dyke.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes made by these apps is the fact that sending/storing sensitive data like credentials is done is plaintext.\n\n\n\n \u201cI was shocked and disappointed at the same time to see how easy some of the systems made it for somebody else to access the account,\u201d he continues.\n\nIn their tests, experts from NowSecure have chosen four different vendors, but all four of them highly popular choices. The price range for a security camera ranges from $100 to thousands, below the products evaluated by the experts:\n\nWhich of these products it\u2019s the worst?\n\nVan Dyke thinks it\u2019s a dispute between the Zmodo and Vimtag systems.\n\nReferring to the ZSight app used by ZModo Van Dyke said:\n\n\u201cthe app will send your username in plaintext and MD5-hashed password to http://openapi.meshare.com. The Zsight app for iOS sent the username and password as GET parameters meaning the credentials are recoverable from server access logs. Upon successful log in, MeShare\u2019s back-end server returns a token for app authentication on subsequent requests. As far as an attacker is concerned, the password, it\u2019s MD5 hash, or the token all grant access to the victim\u2019s account (i.e., any of these items are equal to a valid login).\u201d Wrote Van Dyke.\n\nNot only the username, also unencrypted passwords, email addresses and valid tokens have been left in XML files. For the Vimtag app the main problem was that it communicates with the back-end server mostly through unencrypted channels, exposing users to man-in-the middle attacks.\n\nAn attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities to execute a number of activities on the camera, such as recording of audio/video, adjusting settings, accessing stored audio or video, registering a camera to an account and also formatting an SD card,\n\nBut there is much more, when checking the app network setting Van Dyke noticed that the Vimtag back end server was sending over the WPA2 key to all wireless networks to which it was connected exposing them to the attackers.\n\nThis means that not only is the key visible to any attacker, but it is archived on the server and easily recoverable.\n\n\u201cThis means an attacker could use SSID to locate a house using the security camera, sit on the curb in front, and connect to the network.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cA team of researchers found that using only SSID, they could locate a device within 13-to-40 meters. The server also sent the WPA2 key for the network to which it was connected meaning that not only is the key visible to any attacker, it\u2019s stored on the server and easily recoverable.

It\u2019s claimed to be more secure and efficient on contrary to other online anonymity systems like Tor or I2P and will be fast enough to work as a smartphone app. It has not been approved that the project is fully coded and tested but the alpha version of the project is in a development phase on android platform to serve as an instant messaging app and more features such as larger file sharing for photos and video will be added in the future.\n\nThe controversial feature of PrivaTegrity is a controlled backdoor that prevent abuse of encryption by anyone doing something \u201cgenerally recognized as evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnyone using PrivaTegrity for something \u201cgenerally recognized as evil\u201d can have their anonymity and privacy stripped altogether.\u201d reported Wired who published a detailed post on the topic.\n\nEvil is defined by who controls that backdoor and this task is given to a sort of council system. It means nine server administrators located in 9 different countries need to work all together in order to trace criminals and their communications within the network.\n\n\n\nWhile privacy advocates are against mass spying, law enforcement agencies argue that encryption has provided a heaven for criminals to hide their devilish activities. This suggested approach by Chaum satisfy the need of both sides of the crypto wars. Dr. Chaum says if we want to solve this apparent logjam:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to give up on privacy. We don\u2019t have to allow terrorists and drug dealers to use it. We can have a civil society electronically without the possibility of covert mass surveillance.\u201d\n\nMix network is an influential privacy idea that was coined by Chaum in 1979.  It anonymizes messages by encrypting them in layers and routing them through a series of computers that serve as intermediaries. cMix is a new kind of mix network introduced by Chaum also to be used within PrivaTegrity. cMix designed to be far more efficient than the layered encryption scheme he created decades ago.\n\nAccording to Wire.com, in Chaum\u2019s cMix setup, a smartphone communicates with PrivaTegrity\u2019s nine servers when the app is installed to establish a series of keys that it shares with each server. When the phone sends a message, it encrypts the message\u2019s data by multiplying it by that series of unique keys. Then the message is passed around all nine servers, with each one dividing out its secret key and multiplying the data with a random number. On a second pass through the nine servers, the message is put into a batch with other messages, and each server shuffles the batch\u2019s order using a randomized pattern only that server knows, then multiplies the messages with another random number. Finally, the process is reversed, and as the message passes through the servers one last time, all of those random numbers are divided out and replaced with keys unique to the message\u2019s intended recipient, who can then decrypt and read it.\n\nPrivaTegrity has nine-server architecture that makes possible its unique backdoor decryption feature. Only when all nine servers cooperate, they can combine their data to reconstruct a message\u2019s entire path and divide out the random numbers they used to encrypt it, therefore, decryption cannot be done by one single server or even eight of the nine servers.  \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s like a backdoor with nine different padlocks on it,\u201d Chaum says.\n\nAccording to Chaum, Amazon\u2019s cloud will be used for the prototype of PrivaTegrity but in final version of the app, he plans to spread out to nine different countries and require each server to publish its law enforcement cooperation policy. List of these countries has not been published, but Chaum suggests they will be in jurisdiction of democratic governments such as Switzerland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the UN,\u201d says Chaum. \u201cI don\u2019t think a single jurisdiction should be able to covertly surveil the planet\u2026In this system, there\u2019s an agreement on the rules, and then we can enforce them.\u201d\n\nSpreading the keys to decrypt communications among nine servers would prevent abusive government surveillance and make his backdoor far harder to hack. In addition, Chaum suggests developing unique security protections by servers\u2019 administrator and even implementing distinctive code to PrivaTegrity\u2019s protocol, avoid any single bug that could be common to all nine nodes.\n\n\u201cThese systems would be far more hardened than even corporate systems, and to abuse the backdoor you\u2019d have to break all of them,\u201d he says.\n\nIf reality of PrivaTegrity meets descriptions of its potential, it could be a revolutionary encryption systems that can protect innocent people from spying without offering immunity to criminals.\n\n\u201cYou have to perfect the traceability of the evil people and the untraceability of the honest people,\u201d says Chaum\n\nAbout the Author Ali Taherian \n\nAli Taherian (@ali_taherian) is an enthusiastic information security Officer.

This means that an attacker could perform any operation on the device, including sending text messages, visit specific websites or make phone calls. An attacker could also exploit the flaw to install a spyware on the device.\n\nSilent Circle promptly fixed the security issue, experts at SentinelOne were impressed by the speed in solving the problems they reported. The researchers reported the vulnerability to Silent Circle in late August, then submitted the issue, as requested, via BugCrowd in September. Silent Circle acknowledged the submission immediately fixed the problem in four weeks. The patch was issued by SilentCircle in early December.\n\n\u201cWhen I reached out to them, they responded immediately,\u201d Tim Strazzere, director of mobile research at SentinelOne, told SecurityWeek . \u201cThey were very interested in what I found, and asked for my suggestions, fixed the problem, asked me to check it, and then pushed the update as fast as possible,\u201d\n\nThe flawed Icera modem used by the BlackPhone is no longer on the market.\n\nLet me remark that the flaw affects Blackphone 1 running versions 1.1.13 RC2 and prior of PrivatOS, the Blackphone 2 is not affected by the vulnerability as confirmed by Silent Circle in a blog post.

My goal was to present the appearance of these cameras as aesthetic, rather than intrusive; beautiful instead of filthy.\u201d Derek Arnold wrote in a blog post.\n\nArnold manually selects the webcams to use for his experiment to avoid tweeting images that expose unaware people and their homes.

Whenever he comes across cameras broadcasting from people\u2019s homes, he immediately blocks them from the bot\u2019s list of source cameras.\n\n\u201cI tended to lean on cameras that are in outdoors, public or business settings rather than in people\u2019s homes, which was fairly easy since I chose not to scan residential ISP blocks,\u201d\n\nMost of the pictures show empty offices and office building interiors, in a limited number of cases, unaware people is captured while working.\n\nThere are a number of tools available online to search for connected devices like webcams, Shodan and Censys are the most popular project that scan for this category of systems allowing an easy search.\n\nMost IoT devices lack security by design or are not properly configured, opening users to cyber attacks. Smart TVs, smart meters and Refrigerator are potentially exploitable to target users everywhere. In October 2015, experts from Imperva have discovered that attackers hijack CCTV cameras to launch powerful DDoS attacks exploiting weak credentials and poor configurations of IoT devices\n\nIn the blog post, Arnold explained that the @FFD8FFDB project is just one of a couple of project he is carrying on,  the second camera bot he used is a YouTube bot that is stealing video from a list of cameras, mixing the colors down into grayscale.\n\n\u201cMy second camera bot is a YouTube bot, stealing video from a smaller list of cameras, mixing the colors down into grayscale. The frame rates of these cameras are variable, as fast as the network can deliver them, with some jitter. The end result is a rough time-lapse, and though each video is roughly a minute, the actual time elapsed varies.\u201d Arnold wrote.\n\nThe project conducted by Arnold demonstrates the importance to carefully configure connected devices to protect our privacy.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 @FFD8FFDB, IoT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ffd8ffdb", "topic_name": "@FFD8FFDB"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censys", "topic_name": "Censys"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shodan", "topic_name": "shodan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/twitter", "topic_name": "Twitter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/webcam", "topic_name": "webcam"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft maintains the recovery key of your new PC", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43134/digital-id/microsoft-maintains-recovery-key.html", "title": "Microsoft maintains the recovery key of your new PC\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 29, 2015", "body": "New Windows computers implement a built-in disk encryption feature that is turned on by default to protect user data in case the device is lost or stolen.\n\nBe aware, this device encryption feature is different from the BitLocker which allows users to choose whether or not to backup their Recovery keys on Windows server.\n\nThe security feature is enabled by default in Microsoft systems since Windows 8.1, but what happen in case the user lost the encryption keys?\n\nMicrosoft maintains a copy of the Recovery Key, a circumstance that is raising a heated debate on the web because it represents a privacy violation according to many experts.\n\nThe Intercept revealed that when a user is logged into Windows 10 using his Microsoft account, the OS automatically uploads a copy of the recovery key to the Microsoft\u2019s servers, and the bad news is that it is impossible to prevent it.\n\n\u201cBut what is less well-known is that, if you are like most users and login to Windows 10 using your Microsoft account, your computer automatically uploaded a copy of your recovery key \u2013 which can be used to unlock your encrypted disk \u2013 to Microsoft\u2019s servers, probably without your knowledge and without an option to opt-out.\u201d states The Intercept.\n\nClearly this setting open users to a number of cyber attack, let\u2019s think the case an attacker violates their Microsoft account, he would be able to access/copy the recovery key and delete it.

Wright was trying to persuade the Australian Taxation Office to tax his Bitcoin holdings as a currency and not as an asset.\n\nAnother thing that suspicious experts is that Nakamoto reportedly has some 1.1 Million Bitcoins to his name in a trust fund that amounts to roughly 455 Million in US Dollars, it is exactly the same amount that Wright is believed to own.\n\n\u201cAn email to a Clayton Utz lawyer identified as Wright\u2019s lawyer in the ATO transcripts was sent from an address linked to Nakamoto and is signed \u201cCraig (possibly).\u201d \u201cThe email discussed whether contact should be made with Australia\u2019s then assistant treasurer Arthur Sinodinos in January 2014 over the regulatory issues in Australia surrounding bitcoin.\u201d continues the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThe treatment of bitcoin for tax purposes in Australia has been the subject of considerable debate.

However, there are many incidents revealing Internet surveillance. If you think of Edward Snowden and the revelations that he had brought to the public about NSA and mass surveillance acts, you will see why we need a way of securely communicating with each other online.\n\nEven though there are a plethora of options out there, not many can take pride in being reliable and safe to use. If you are in search of the best alternatives available to this date, have a look at the EFF scoreboard.\n\nIn the EFF scoreboard, all the options that we get today in communication are analyzed as per their features and level of encryption. The criteria used by the experts include the ability of encryption in transit, encryption that does not allow the provider to read what you are communicating, verification of the sender\u2019s and recipient\u2019s identities, security of past communications and open code, proper documentation and code audit.\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, this is only the beginning and EFF is planning to move forward with a more detailed scoreboard in the near future.\n\nFrom the EFF scoreboard, we can get quite a few enlightening pieces of information.\n\nFor example, BlackBerry Messenger does not score well \u2013 on the contrary, BlackBerry Protected is much more reliable as an option of communication. ChatSecure + Orbot, CryptoCat and Off the Record Messaging for Windows (Pidgin), Signal/RedPhone, Silent Phone and Silent Text, TextSecure and Telegram have passed the test with flying colors. On the other hand, Yahoo!Messenger and WhatsApp, Viber and Skype are not that secure. They do not offer adequate encryption and thus they are not to be trusted.\n\nCryptography is the number one criterion when we seek safe and secure communication. Nevertheless, we see that more and more people nowadays continue on using unsafe methods of communication.\n\nAlthough they have been warned about potential risks, they go ahead with their habits and do not change them for something else. This happens due to the fact that the broadly used programs are easier to use.\n\nIf something of quality and ease of use was to be released, people would look it up and try it out. This is what EFF, Julia Angwin at ProPublica and Joseph Bonneau at the Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy all have been trying to accomplish.\n\nSafe, secure and usable cryptography can save the day and offer people of all backgrounds (tech savvies and not) the chance to remain protected while communicating with others.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

The Hello Barbie doll is developed by the startup ToyTalk.\n\nIn February, The Register was one of the fist news agency reporting security and privacy implications of the Mattel\u2019s Hello Barbie, and now that the popular doll is available for sale a security researcher has discovered security issues with the toy.\n\n\u201cIts Wi-Fi-connected Barbie toy has a microphone, a speaker, a small embedded computer with a battery that lasts about an hour, and Wi-Fi hardware. When you press a button on her belt buckle, Barbie wakes up, asks a question, and turns on its microphone while the switch is held down.\u201d wrote the register.\n\nLast week, the security expert Matt Jakubowski explained that the new Wi-Fi-Enabled Hello Barbie can be hacked, in the specific case to extract Wi-Fi network names, account IDs, and MP3 files from the toy.\n\n\u201cYou can take that information and find out a person\u2019s house or business. It\u2019s just a matter of time until we are able to replace their servers with ours and have her say anything we want,\u201d Jakubowski warned.\n\n\n\n\n\nOren Jacob, the ToyTalk CEO provided the following statement in response to the Jakubowski affirmation trying to rebuke the alarm.\n\n\u201cAn enthusiastic researcher has reported finding some device data and called that a hack.\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWhile the path that the researcher used to find that data is not obvious and not user-friendly, it is important to note that all that information was already directly available to Hello Barbie customers through the Hello Barbie Companion App. No user data, no Barbie content, and no major security or privacy protections have been compromised to our knowledge.\u201d\n\nJakubowski explained that it is quite easy to steal the account ID, this means that the attackers need get the password to gain access to the Hello Barbie account. Steal a password could be very simple for example with a spear phishing attack or by using other social engineering techniques.\n\nUnfortunately, the experts at ToyTalk have a different opinion and consider the scenario improbable.\n\nThe Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood already asked Mattel to drop the Hello Barbie doll, a petition has already been signed by over 6,000 worried people.\n\nWe are approaching the holiday season, and recent data breach suffered by the giant VTech raised the question of children\u2019s privacy.\n\nEven if the Hello Barbie doll is secure today, this doesn\u2019t mean that it will be the same tomorrow. Security experts could make a reverse engineering of its software components in order to discover security flaws.\n\nSomerset Recon already reported the news that researchers have dumped the 16 megabits of firmware that runs the doll to analyze it.\n\n\u201cWe began dumping the contents of the 16Mbit flash chip, and some pretty neat stuff popped up.

The mechanism is similar to the one adopted to protect user Internet activities, the traffic is routed through the TorNetwork making impossible to intercept it.\n\nThe experts at Tor Project explained that that have considered a number of messaging clients for inspiration during the design phase, including Pidgin, Adam Langley\u2019s xmpp-client, and Instantbird.\n\n\u201cInstantbird was the pragmatic choice \u2014 its transport protocols are written in a memory-safe language (JavaScript); it has a graphical user interface and already supports many natural languages; and it\u2019s a XUL application, which means we can leverage both the code (Tor Launcher) and in-house expertise that the Tor Project has developed working on Tor Browser with Firefox. It also has an active and vibrant software developer community that has been very responsive and understanding of our needs.

The idea is to incentive  the ethical disclosure of vulnerabilities in military systems.\n\nSuch kind of initiatives is very important, every system, every software could be compromised, even in the military industry, for this reason, bug bounty programs are very important.\n\nNews of the day is that the US military websites are protected using SHA-1 cipher, the researcher at Netcraft security Paul Mutton discovered that a number of US Department of Defence (DoD) agencies are issuing SHA-1 certificates.\n\nSecurity experts are warning the IT industry on the risks related the use of the vulnerable SHA-1 hashing algorithm, a couple of weeks ago a group of researchers has demonstrated that the cost of breaking the SHA-1 hash algorithm is lower than previously estimated.\n\nAccording to experts at Netcraft,  the number of SHA-1 certificates issued this year is 120,000, but most worrying is that nearly a million of surveyed SSL certificates October SSL were signed with a process relying on the SHA-1.\n\nUS military websites are among the website that use the vulnerable SHA-1 digital certificates despite US organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are long requesting the US government agencies to adopt more secure hashing algorithm.\n\nThe experts at Netcraft published another interesting post reporting the United States Department of Defense is still issuing SHA-1 signed certificates for use by military agencies.\n\n\u201cThe Missile Defense Agency, the eventual successor to the \u201cStar Wars\u201d programme, uses one of these SHA-1 certificates on a Juniper Networks remote access device. The SHA-1 certificate was issued by the Department of Defense in February 2015, long after NIST declared this practice to be unacceptable.\u201d states the post. \n\nSome US military  web services still support the outdated TLS 1.0 connections, even the Defense Logistics Agency only supports the TLS 1.0 protocol.\n\n\u201cSeveral other U.S. military remote access services only support the obsolete TLS 1.0 protocol, including two used by the Defense Logistics Agency. Some other military sites, including one of the Navy\u2019s VPN services do support TLS 1.2, but with obsolete cipher suites. These particular sites all use SHA-1 signed certificates that do not expire until 2017, and so are regarded as \u201caffirmatively insecure\u201d by Chrome.\u201d continues the post. \n\n\n \n\n\u201cAs an example, the subscriber certificate issued to cec.navfac.navy.mil was signed on 19 March 2015 by the DoD CA-27 intermediate, which is signed by the DoD Root CA 2 trusted root,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201cIf any of these intermediate certificates were to be targeted to find a collision, it would be possible for an attacker to generate valid subscriber certificates for any domain. This would allow the attacker to convincingly impersonate US military sites and carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against browsers that trust the DoD root certificates.\u201d\n\nIt is curious to note that the PKI infrastructure of The Department of Defence relies on two root certificate authorities (DoD Root CA 2 and DoD Root CA 3) that are not included in all browsers by default.\n\nThe use of SHA-1 based certificates exposes government websites to state-sponsored attacks, in the specific case the cost of a migration to other hashing algorithms is negligible when compared to the benefits in terms of security.\n\n\u201cThe risk to the Department of Defense is further heightened by enemy governments being the most likely sources of attack. The projected cost of attacking SHA-1 is unlikely to be prohibitive, and some governments may already be in a position to find a hash collision faster than the most organised criminals.\u201d states Netcraft.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 US DoD , SHA-1)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dod", "topic_name": "DoD"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hash", "topic_name": "hash"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sha-1", "topic_name": "SHA-1"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "WhatsApp collects phone numbers, call duration, and a lot of metadata", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41483/digital-id/whatsapp-collects-call-metadata.html", "title": "WhatsApp collects phone numbers, call duration, and a lot of metadata\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 27, 2015", "body": "A new research conducted by forensic researchers at the University of New Haven (F.

The SMS Stealing Library is a component of Taomike\u2019s in-app purchases (IAPs) system that has been designed to capture incoming messages from the mobile device.\n\n\u201c,we recently identified that the Chinese Taomike SDK has begun capturing copies of all messages received by the phone and sending them to a Taomike controlled server.

Google Chrome already regards these certificates as insecure, resulting in more warning signals than if the sites had been served over a completely unencrypted HTTP connection.\u201d states Netcraft.\n\n\n\nA recent research dubbed SHAppening aimed to demonstrate how to cause a full SHA-1 collision within 49-78 days by using a 512-GPU cluster.\n\nDo you think that is not easy to have this computational capability?\n\nWrong, an attacker can rent the equivalent processing capability on Amazon\u2019s EC2 cloud computing service, an operation that would cost only $75,000 to $120,000. The demonstration provided by Netcraft is alarming and it reinforces to accelerate the migration that is estimated to be completed by 2017.\n\n\u201cRenting the equivalent processing time on Amazon\u2019s EC2 cloud computing service would cost only $75k-$120k, which is an order of magnitude less than earlier estimates. The researchers point out that this represents an important alarm signal, and that the industry\u2019s plans to move away from SHA-1 by 2017 might not be fast enough.\u201d states  Netcraft.\n\nWhat does it mean for end-users?\n\nA group of well-funded attackers, let\u2019s think about state-sponsored hackers or an international cyber crime ring, could impersonate an SSL site that uses a trusted SHA-1 certificate.\n\nAnother dangerous scenario could be observed when browsers still accepting SHA-1 signatures, in this case even after the adoption of SHA-2 certificates the SSL sites remain at risk. If the attackers are able to compromise an intermediate CA certificate signed with SHA-1, they could generate valid certificates for any domains.\n\n\u201cSome certificate authorities were hit by an unexpected pitfall after migrating to SHA-2, after failing to use new names for their SHA-2 signed intermediate certificates. SSLMate, an SSL certificate vendor, published two examples of how Google Chrome could erroneously suggest that a site was affirmatively insecure for serving a SHA-1 certificate, even when the full certificate chain actually used the SHA-2 hashing algorithm. This undesirable behaviour was caused by caching in the cryptographic libraries used by Chrome (CryptoAPI on Windows, and NSS on Linux).\u201d\n\nIt is time to migrate to SHA-2 and SHA-3, the unique hash algorithms approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the generation of digital signatures, but beware because only SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 algorithms are allowed by the CA/Browser Forum\u2019s Baseline Requirements of publicly-trusted certificates.\n\nAs I have already written, Microsoft announced in 2013, its intention to force the use of the SHA2 algorithm in code signing and SSL certificates from 2014.

According to Snowden, the intelligence Agency was able to decrypt and intercept nearly Trillions of Internet connections. The US cyber spies were able to spy on every connection, including VPN ones, SSH and HTTPs were not able to protect netizens from prying eyes.\n\nHow was it possible?\n\nNow the mystery has a solution, the computer scientists Alex Halderman and Nadia Heninger have presented a paper at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security that explained how the NSA has intercepted encrypted connections breaking the Internet encryption.\n\n\n\nThe NSA hasn\u2019t broken the Diffie-Hellman, instead, they target the start of the process. For each actor involved in the communication is generated a couple of keys, the public key is shared with the interlocutor, meanwhile, the private key is kept secret. The algorithm generates a common public key, a large prime number which is agreed upon at the start of the process.\n\nWhy?\n\nPrime numbers are public and it is computationally expensive to generate new ones, for this reason, many encryption systems reuse them to improve performance.\n\nThe experts noticed that one single prime is used to encrypt two-thirds of all VPNs and a quarter of all the SSH servers. A second prime is used to encrypt \u201cnearly 20% of the top million HTTPS websites\u201d.\n\nDo you want an idea of how law diffused it the problem? \n\nAround 92% of the top 1 Million Alexa HTTPS domains use of the same two primes for Diffie-Hellman, the NSA may have exploited this issue to intercept the traffic.\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence we have, we can\u2019t prove for certain that NSA is doing this. However, our proposed Diffie-Hellman break fits the known technical details about their large-scale decryption capabilities better than any competing explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince a handful of primes are so widely reused, the payoff, in terms of connections they could decrypt, would be enormous,\u201d wrote the researchers in a blog post.\n\n\u201cBreaking a single, 1024-bit prime would allow the NSA to passively decrypt connections to two-thirds of VPNs and a quarter of all SSH servers globally. Breaking a second 1024-bit prime would allow passive eavesdropping on connections to nearly 20% of the top million HTTPS websites. In other words, a one-time investment in massive computation would make it possible to eavesdrop on trillions of encrypted connections.\u201d\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NSA, Diffie-Hellman)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/diffie-hellman", "topic_name": "Diffie-Hellman"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/edward-snowden", "topic_name": "Edward Snowden"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "McAfee study on the prices of stolen data on the Dark Web", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41092/cyber-crime/stolen-data-dark-web.html", "title": "McAfee study on the prices of stolen data on the Dark Web\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 16, 2015", "body": "You know my passion for the Dark Web, I spend a lot of time monitoring activities in the hidden part of the web with a particular interest in illegal activities that exploit anonymity of such environment.\n\nToday I have found the announcement of a new report, titled \u201cThe Hidden Data Economy,\u201d published by the experts at McAfee Labs that have identified a number of websites and services in the Dark Web used by the criminal communities for the commercialization of stolen data.\n\nFirst of all, we have to understand which kind of commodities offered in the criminal underground were monitored by the team of experts.\n\nThe researchers from McAfee Labs monitored pricing for stolen payment card data, bank account and online payment service login credentials, premium content service login credentials, enterprise network login credentials, hospitality loyalty account login credentials, and online auction account login credentials.\n\nA dangerous trend that is confirmed is the propensity to the model of sale known as cybercrime-as-a-service. The term Cybercrime-as-a-Service refers the practice in the cyber criminal ecosystem to provide product and services for use by other criminals. In September 2014, a report from Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the 2014 Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (iOCTA) report, revealed the diffusion of the business model in the underground communities and highlighted that barriers to entry in cybercrime ring are being lowered even if criminal gangs have no specific technical skills.\n\nFor example, criminals can rent a botnet of machines for their illegal activities, instead to infect thousands of machines worldwide. These malicious infrastructures are built with a few requirements that make them suitable for the criminals, including User-friendly Command and Control infrastructure and sophisticated evasion techniques.\n\n\u201cLike any unregulated, efficient economy, the cybercrime ecosystem has quickly evolved to deliver many tools and services to anyone aspiring to criminal behavior,\u201d said Raj Samani, CTO for Intel Security EMEA. \u201cThis \u2018cybercrime-as-a-service\u2019 marketplace has been a primary driver for the explosion in the size, frequency and severity of cyber attacks. The same can be said for the proliferation of business models established to sell stolen data and make cybercrime pay.\u201d\n\nStolen Payment card data is one of the most traded commodities in the underground. According experts at McAfee, a basic offering includes a software-generated, valid number that combines a primary account number (PAN), an expiration date and a CVV2 number.\n\nIn line with the information provided by other reports, prices rise when sellers include also additional information with the stolen card data. \u201cFullzinfo\u201d includes bank account ID number, date of birth, victim\u2019s billing address, PIN number, social security number, and other information like parent\u2019s maiden name.\n\n\u201cA criminal in possession of the digital equivalent of the physical card can make purchases or withdrawals until the victim contacts the card issuer and challenge the charges,\u201d continued Samani. \u201cProvide that criminal with extensive personal information which can be used to \u2018verify\u2019 the identity of a card holder, or worse yet allow the thief to access the account and change the information, and the potential for extensive financial harm goes up dramatically for the individual.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe prices of  compromised online payment service accounts mainly depend by the account balance as reported in the following table.\n\n\n\nVery interesting also the offer for Bank login credentials on the Dark Web, the experts discovered that banking login credentials and services related to accounts with a $2,200 balance are selling for $190. Bank login credentials are very precious because are normally used to stealthily transferring funds to U.S. banks, their value ranged from $500 for a $6,000 account balance, to $1,200 for a $20,000 account balance.\n\nQuite in line the offer for the United Kingdom transfers ranged from $700 for a $10,000 account balance, to $900 for a $16,000 account balance.\n\nIn the dark web, it is possible to acquire online premium content services, including online video streaming and premium comic book services. Same price samples are\n\nLess traded goods include some specific categories of online services, such as login credentials to hotel loyalty programs and online auction accounts, a major hotel brand loyalty account with 100,000 points for sale for $20, and an online auction community account with high reputation marks priced at $1,400.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Dark Web, stolen data)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/banking-account", "topic_name": "banking account"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/credit-card", "topic_name": "credit card"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime-as-a-service", "topic_name": "Cybercrime-as-a-Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-market", "topic_name": "Dark market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stolen-data", "topic_name": "stolen data"}]}, {"news_name": "Google records and maintains all our voice searches", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41050/digital-id/google-records-voice-searches.html", "title": "Google records and maintains all our voice searches\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 14, 2015", "body": "Google knows everything of our digital existence and the story that I\u2019m going to tell you confirm it.\n\nThe fact that Google keeps track of our researchers is not a mystery, but probably the majority of its users still ignores that Google also record and store every single voice search.\n\nThe IT giant stores every users\u2019 searches from its voice-activated assistant Google\u2019s Voice Search and search feature Google Now, why?\n\nOf course Google keeps track of the voice searchers improve the feature and serve to the user-targeted advertising.\n\nThe disconcerting aspect of the story is that Google makes a recording of the voice search and stores it.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s voice and audio activity page isn\u2019t promoted heavily by the company, and visiting it gives a hint as to why.

The disclosure of the Microsoft CID makes each request visible to anyone that could monitor the DNS traffic. This means that an attacker that share the target\u2019s segment of the network or the ISP can access your requests, the issue is present even if the Microsoft users is browsing through the Tor network, in this case, the CID results visible at the exit node.\n\n\u201cAs we said in the beginning, when you use one of the free web apps from Microsoft and the host name containing your CID is resolved, the request is visible to anyone who can monitor your DNS traffic.  This includes everyone from your local coffee shop packet sniffers, to your ISP, and eventually to the men and women defending national security at the Internet backbones.  If you use Tor, your CID is visible to the exit node.\u201d continues ramen-hero.\n\nThe Microsoft CID is visible to attackers even if no DNS lookup is made because it is part of the host name and is sent in clear text during TLS handshake (Server Name Indication (SNI)).\nAccess your CID could very easily, for example, it is enough to share the URL related to a file on OneDrive. This URL generated to share the content contains your CID.\n\nBad news for Microsoft users who linked their accounts with their Skype accounts, threat actors knowing the main alias of a Microsoft account can also obtain the CID using the People app.\n\nThe CID can be used to retrieve the user\u2019s profile image, and it can also be used via the OneDrive site to retrieve a user\u2019s account display name. The Microsoft CID could be used to access metadata from Microsoft\u2019s Live service, it is possible to access also information about when the account was created or last accessed time. An attacker can also use metadata to retrieve information associated with the Live Calendar application.\n\nMicrosoft has already started the migration of Outlook.com mailboxes to Exchange Online, which uses a different protocol.\n\n\u201cThe original web protocols were designed to allow applications to programmatically access public profile items. Non-public items are protected by user controlled authorization. Our recent protocols are more restrictive and over time we will phase out the older versions,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson said SecurityWeek.com.\n\n\u201cFor most users, the simplest workaround is to modify the hosts file to avoid DNS lookups to cid-___.users.storage.live.com (where the blank stands for your CID (in 16-character 0-padded hexadecimal form)).

No ?\n\nThe popular investigator Brian Krebs has published an interesting post on the topic explaining that a Boarding Pass Barcode contains a lot of data.\n\nAirlines use the boarding pass barcode for every single boarding pass, but what happen if someone tries to read the information it contains?\n\nKrebs reported the attempt made by one of its readers, named Cory, who saw a friend posting his boarding pass on Facebook so decided to analyze it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI found a website that could decode the data and instantly had lots of info about his trip,\u201d said Cory,  \u201cBesides his name, frequent flyer number and other [personally identifiable information], I was able to get his record locator (a.k.a. \u201crecord key\u201d for the Lufthansa flight he was taking that day,\u201d \u201cI then proceeded to Lufthansa\u2019s website and using his last name (which was encoded in the barcode) and the record locator was able to get access to his entire account. Not only could I see this one flight, but I could see ANY future flights that were booked to his frequent flyer number from the Star Alliance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s frightening what someone could do with this information, I used the barcode reader website myself to read an old boarding pass barcode, and the information I could get.\n\nThe boarding pass barcodes are widely available for years, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) published a details document  on how the barcode standards have been implemented by the organizations on the industry.\n\nComing back to Cory\u2019s story, he was able to use the info available in the barcode to enter in Lufthansa website site and access his friend\u2019s phone number, the name of the person who did the booking, and see future flights connected to the frequent flyer account.\n\nWhat do you think about the possibility to conduct a targeted attack with this data? For example an attacker can send a spear phishing email to the victim reporting information on his flights.\n\nThe situation goes worse if we consider that accessing the list of future flights he is able to cancel them or change seats.\n\nAn attacker could also reset the PIN number associated with Star Alliance frequent flyer account, in the case of Cory, he tried to use the \u201cForgot Pin\u201d reset and his friend question was, \u201cWhat is your Mother\u2019s maiden name?\u201d An information like this, it\u2019s not that difficult to extract and probably can be found in social media.\n\nThis is just an example of what can be done with a barcode, and the amount of information it can be extracted.

Sanmay Ved was searching for available .com domains when he made a shocking discovery, the Google.com was \u201cavailable\u201d for purchase.\n\n\u201cA strange thing happened at 1:20 AM Eastern Time on Tuesday, September 29. I was learning more about the Google Domains interface, and typed google.com and clicked search domains. To my surprise, Google.com was showing as available!\u201d explained Ved.\n\nSanmay Ved, an ex-Google employee and current-Amazon employee, experienced something of a shock when he found that the world\u2019s largest search engine website, Google.com, was \u201cavailable\u201d for purchase.\n\nHow much is it? Just $12 to buy the domain of the search engine giant.\n\n\n\nHe wary went ahead trying to complete the purchase, certain that it was a mistake. He added the Google.com domain to the shopping cart and completed the payment. The purchase was successfully completed and he and he became the new owner of the domain.\n\nIn a few seconds his inbox and Google Webmaster Tools were flooded with webmaster related messages that were confirming the ownership for the Google.com domains, a scary circumstance if we consider that Ved had access to webmaster controls for a minute.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I completed purchase, I received two emails, one from sc-noreply@google.com, and one from wmt-noreply@google.com, which is not the norm when you book domains via Google Domains as I have booked new, previously un-registered domains before, and I have never received emails from the above aliases on booking the domains.  I will not share the contents of the emails here given they relate to the Google.com domain. The domain also successfully appeared in my Google Domains order history.\n\nAdditionally, my Google Search Console (aka Google Webmaster Tools) was auto-updated with webmaster related messages for the Google.com domain which actually means ownership was transferred to me! One gets the below messages in Search Console only for those domains for which one is the verified admin/verified owner (of course access was removed when domain was taken back by Google).\u201d Ved said. \u201cThe scary part was I had access to the webmaster controls for a minute,\u201d\n\nJust a few minutes and the dream vanished, Ved received an order cancellation email and was refunded by Google Domains.\n\nHow is it possible? Google owns Google Domains and this means that the company manage all purchases of domains and it could revoke them if needed.\n\nAt the time I was writing there are no news regarding the \u201cincident,\u201d someone speculates that Google simply has forgotten to renew the Google.com domain, other believe that there is a bug in Google Domains.\n\nVed has published a blog post describing the entire story and publishing the screenshots of the process.\n\nVed reported the incident to Google Security and the company has acknowledged it.\n\nThat\u2019s incredible!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Google.com domain, ownership)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google-domains", "topic_name": "Google domains"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google-com-domain", "topic_name": "Google.com domain"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ownership", "topic_name": "ownership"}]}, {"news_name": "The US military is still sending un-encrypted emails", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40446/digital-id/us-military-encrypted-emails.html", "title": "The US military is still sending un-encrypted emails\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 25, 2015", "body": "After the Edward Snowden case blown up in the US Government face, the US decided to create a task force to encrypt all that can, urging the adoption of HTTPS for all the government websites. Good idea, but there is still something missing in all this process, the email encryption.\n\nIn this specific case, the US military leaves their soldiers emails unencrypted, exposing them to possible interception by threat actors.\n\nThe principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Chris Soghoian has been trying for years to push the adoption of encryption said something curious, \u201cThis is a pervasive problem in the government,\u201d And in many ways it affects the parts on the government that should be more focused on security\u2014they\u2019re doing it worse.\u201d\n\nFor obvious reasons the Military should be the ones given the example in terms of security, but surprisingly they aren\u2019t alone in this, because neither Pentagon, including the Army, the Navy, the Defense Security Service, and DARPA, are using email encryption.\n\nInside the military only Air Force is using encryption in their emails, using STARTTLS to encrypt their e-mails.\n\nSTARTTLS is mainly a protocol that encrypts emails traveling from server mail to server mail, big companies (example Google) are using it to help in the standardization of encryption.\n\nEven if you are encrypting your emails that doesn\u2019t mean you are safe, because if your email provider doesn\u2019t use STARTTLS, you are only encrypting your email from your computer to your provider, meaning that after travels across the internet in clear text (after getting out from the server of your email provider). By the way, this can be avoided with end-to-end encryption.\n\nLet\u2019s get some practical example to visualize what happens when your email provider doesn\u2019t support STARTTLS:\n\n\n\nThe red line means that after getting out from your email provider server, the email is open to be read until it enter in the recipient\u2019s email provider.\n\nWhen emails provider support STARTTLS every single part of the email\u2019s path will ensure encryption as can be seen:\n\n\n\nI already reported that Google is using STARTTLS, what I haven\u2019t told is that they are using it since the launch of Gmail in 2004, other companies like Microsoft Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, only did their STARTTLS Implementation in 2014.\n\nAll this to get the key point of the article, private companies are going in the right direction, but how about the US Government? There the story is a bit different.\n\nA spokesperson for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the Pentagon\u2019s branch that oversees email and other technologies said their Enterprise emails doesn\u2019t support STARTTLS.\n\n\u201cSTARTTLS is an extension for the Post Office Protocol 3 and Internet Message Access protocols, which rely on username and password for system access,\u201d \u201cTo remain compliant with DOD PKI policy, DEE does not support the use of username and password to grant access, and does not leverage either protocol.\u201d\n\nOpinions, commenting the words of the spokesperson said things like:\n\n\u201can unacceptable and technically inept answer,\u201d,\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a single technical reason why they wouldn\u2019t use it,\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s again think about the US military, and for that I will be given a case scenario, a US military unit goes to Afghanistan and soldiers are sending emails, this means that the soldiers e-mail could be intercepted by a foreigner government, that is controlling the internet infrastructure in that country.\n\nThere are more agencies not using this layer of security, like the FBI, he Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI), CIA, but it\u2019s unclear why they don\u2019t, NSA for example, is using STARTTLS.\n\nThe thing is, implementing STARTTLS its very cheap, and so , leaves me to believe that the reason why they aren\u2019t using it may be related to other reasons that we can\u2019t still comprehend, but one things is sure, STARTTLS should became a standard not only in the private domain, but also in the public (governments related) domain.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 US military, email encryption)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/email", "topic_name": "email"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/starttls", "topic_name": "STARTTLS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-military", "topic_name": "US Military"}]}, {"news_name": "Lenovo caught with pre-installed tracking application for the third time", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40440/digital-id/lenovo-tracking-application-3.html", "title": "Lenovo caught with pre-installed tracking application for the third time\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 25, 2015", "body": "Once, two, three \u2026 this is the third time that security experts discover a spyware pre-installed on Lenovo laptops and workstations, and also in this case without the knowledge of its millions of users.\n\nThe IT giant was already accused in the past for selling some refurbished laptop models with pre-installed application that were collecting users\u2019 data for commercial purposes. Earlier this year, security experts reported Lenovo was selling laptops pre-installed with Superfish spyware that anyway could be exploited by attackers to spy on the end-users.\n\nSuperFish is considered by many antivirus companies as a potentially unwanted program, adware, or a trojan. The \u201cSuperfish\u201d malware was installed on laptops sold by Lenovo until January 2015, it was able to steal web traffic using fake, self-signed, root certificates to inject advertisements into sessions.  Lenovo removed Superfish after numerous users reported the embarrassing discovery on its forums by claiming to be victims of attacks.\n\n\u201cA blatant man-in-the-middle attack malware breaking privacy laws. I have requested return of the laptop and refund as I find it unbelievable that \u2026 Lenovo would facilitate such applications pre bundled with new laptops,\u201d the user wrote on the Lenovo forums.\n\n\u201cI just bought a Lenovo G50 Notebook. And as you might guess it\u2019s also \u201cinfected\u201d with PUP (a SuperFish Software (that\u2019s the one which displays ads on webpages)). So, now i try to clean up a brand new device. Sounds a bit absurd. What do you think?\u201d said another user.\n\nIn the following image posted by one of the Lenovo users is visible a certificate masquerading as being issued by Bank of America.\n\n\n\nA similar circumstance is happened again this summer, in August security experts discovered that the company was installing unwanted and unremovable rootkit software on certain Lenovo laptop model and desktop PCs.\n\nThe controversial feature is called \u201cLenovo Service Engine\u201d (LSE), it is a function implemented in the firmware of computers sold by Lenovo.\n\nAccording to the security experts, if Windows is installed on the computer, the LSE automatically downloads and installs Lenovo software. The operations start during bootstrap before the Microsoft operating system is launched, overwriting some of the Windows operating system files.\n\nThe Lenovo Service Engine injects software that updates, drivers, and firmware onto a Windows machine even if users completely reinstall the OS and remove pre-installed software.\n\nOn various forums, users speculated the existence of a Lenovo \u201cbootkit\u201d impossible to remove.\n\nAccording to the company, its service doesn\u2019t collect user data neither personally identifying information, but sends back some basic information, including the system model, date, region, and system ID.\n\nNews of the day is that Lenovo is embedding tracking software into its laptops and workstations, models affected are Lenovo ThinkPad, ThinkCentre, and ThinkStation series.\n\nMichael Horowitz from Computerworld has discovered a disputable software, called \u201cLenovo Customer Feedback Program 64,\u201d which is used by Lenovo to gather customers\u2019 feedback data.\n\n\u201cThe task that gave me pause is called \u201cLenovo Customer Feedback Program 64\u201d. It was running daily. According to the description in the task scheduler: \u201cThis task uploads Customer Feedback Program data to Lenovo.\u201d wrote Horowitz.\n\nHorowitz clarified that Lenovo has explicitly referred the software in its EULA.\n\n\u201cThe [EULA] document says that it can be found in theC:\\windows\\system32\\oobe\\info folder. The folder contains 39 files. Which is the EULA? It doesn\u2019t say. \n\nApparently, the reason I only ran across one of the two phone-home EXEs is that the Lenovo Experience Improvement system un-installs itself after 90 days. The document mentions that it can also be manually un-installed from the Control Panel \u201cPrograms and Features\u201d where it is listed as \u201cLenovo Experience Improvement\u201d.\n\nLenovo repeatedly mentions, in document HT102023, that the data they collect is not \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d. They also state that the only apps for which they collect data are their own. And, Lenovo.TVT.CustomerFeedback.Agent.exe gets a clean bill of health at Virus Total where it was first seen in May of 2014.\u201d continues Horowitz.\n\nAccording to Horowitz the application includes also these other files:\n\nOmniture is an online marketing and Web analytics company, Horowitz speculate that it is included to monitor users\u2019 online activities.\n\n\u201cSo, while there may not be extra ads on ThinkPads, there is some monitoring and tracking. On the one hand this is surprising because the machines were refurbished and sold by IBM. On the other hand, considering Lenovo\u2019s recent history, it\u2019s not surprising at all.\u201d\n\nUsers that want to remove the Lenovo Customer Feedback Program 64 application need to follow this procedure:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Lenovo, malicious application)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lenovo", "topic_name": "Lenovo"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/marketing", "topic_name": "marketing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pre-installed-malware", "topic_name": "pre-installed malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spyware", "topic_name": "spyware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/superfish", "topic_name": "Superfish"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/unwanted-program", "topic_name": "unwanted program"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/web-monitoring", "topic_name": "web monitoring"}]}, {"news_name": "OPM stolen data includes 5.6 Million Fingerprints", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40396/cyber-crime/opm-5-6-million-fingerprints.html", "title": "OPM stolen data includes 5.6 Million Fingerprints\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 24, 2015", "body": "The press secretary of the Office of Personnel Management, Sam Schumach, announced that the data breach suffered by the OPM exposed approximately 5.6 million sets of fingerprints belonging to federal employees, contractors, and other members of the staff.\n\nIn a first time, the number of sets of fingerprints that was stolen has been estimated at 1.1 million, but a new investigation presented a worst scenario. Be aware, the discovery of the overall amount of stolen data doesn\u2019t not increase the number of people affected by the OPM data breach that is 21.5 million.\n\n\u201cDuring that process, OPM and DoD identified archived records containing additional fingerprint data not previously analyzed.

Some send a child\u2019s location data to parents and issue an alert when a child searches keywords such as \u2018suicide\u2019, \u2018pregnancy\u2019 and \u2018bully\u2019 or receives messages with those words\u201d, reports AP\n\nThe researchers discovered that attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to take over the users\u2019 accounts and access other sensitive information.\n\n\n\nMore than half a million South Koreans use the Smart Sheriff child monitoring app to monitor their children.\n\nCitizen Lab reported the security issued to the company that develops the child monitoring app,  the Korean Mobile Internet Business Association (MOIBA), in early August. The company fixed some of the problems reported, but it is not clear which ones have been fixed to date.\n\nThe Citizen Lab agreed a timeline with the MOIBA, but it isn\u2019t providing any update on its bug fixing activity.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Smart Sheriff app was written without any security in mind. The connected API services are architectured and implemented in similarly horrendous ways, allowing trivial exposure of passwords and other highly sensitive user data,\u201d reads the report issued by the German pen testing service Cure53.\n\n\u201cGiven the level of vulnerability this app exposes, combined with the extremely high numbers of its users, it needs to be considered that at least some of the issues published in this report must have started to be actively exploited by now.\u201d\n\nThe Smart Sheriff app fails to encrypt any parents and child\u2019s data, dates of birth, gender, and telephone numbers along mobile device information could be easily  intercepted by an attacker sharing the same network. Smart Sheriff sends information to its own servers in plain text, violating also the Korean law.\n\nThe app doesn\u2019t authenticate requests it receives, an attacker could impersonate the Safe Sheriff servers, and inject malicious code into smartphone using the child monitoring app.\n\n\u201cTheir servers fail to meet common security standards,\u201d Citizen Lab writes, \u201cThe deployment is based on obsolete and insecure protocols that are vulnerable to attacks that could lead to the interception and impersonation of MOIBA\u2019s servers.\u201d\n\n\u201cCombinations of the identified vulnerabilities could lead to mass compromise of accounts or service disruption. An attacker with the resources to run a high volume of queries against Smart Sheriff could potentially identify all of Smart Sheriff\u2019s users, and then use the vulnerabilities we identified to systematically disrupt all subscribers\u2019 devices or the service itself,\u201d the researchers write.\n\nIt is absurd that a country technological advanced like the South Korea has promoted an app that totally lack of security by design, especially when dealing with online child protection.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 child monitoring app, Smart Sheriff)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/child-abuses", "topic_name": "child abuses"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/child-monitoring-app", "topic_name": "child monitoring app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/citizen-lab", "topic_name": "Citizen Lab"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/moiba", "topic_name": "MOIBA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pornography", "topic_name": "pornography"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smart-sheriff", "topic_name": "Smart Sheriff"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/south-korea", "topic_name": "South Korea"}]}, {"news_name": "AVG will sell user\u2019s personal data to third-parties", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40281/digital-id/avg-sells-personal-data.html", "title": "AVG will sell user\u2019s personal data to third-parties\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 20, 2015", "body": "Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 AVG, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/avg", "topic_name": "AVG"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/meta-data", "topic_name": "meta data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/personal-data", "topic_name": "personal data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Vodafone Australia has hacked a Fairfax journalist\u2019s phone", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40094/digital-id/vodafone-australia-hacked-journalist.html", "title": "Vodafone Australia has hacked a Fairfax journalist\u2019s phone\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 13, 2015", "body": "Vodafone Australia has admitted it hacked a journalist\u2019s phone records for espionage purpose.

Since when did telling the truth become the wrong thing to do?\u201d\n\nAccording to internal Vodafone email, reported by the Australian, the Giant was aware of the serious security breaches and of consequences for hacking the journalist\u2019s communications and data.\n\n\u201cThe head of fraud management and investigations for Vodafone Group, Colin Yates, wrote to then global corporate security director Richard Knowlton that there was a \u201chuge risk\u201d to the company if the hacking of O\u2019Brien\u2019s phone \u201cgets into the public domain\u201d.\u201d reported the Guardian. \n\n\u201cIf the issue relating to breaching the reporter\u2019s privacy by searching her private call records and text messages gets into the public domain, this could have \u00adserious consequences given it is a breach of the Australian Telecommunications Act,\u201d Yates wrote.\n\n\u201cAnd would certainly des\u00adtroy all of the work done by VHA [Vodafone Hutchison Australia] over the past months to try and restore their reputation.\u201d\n\nVodafone denies any allegations of improper behaviour and confirms it provided all the necessary support to the Privacy Commissioner\u2019s investigation.\n\n[Vodafone] \u201cstrongly denies any allegations of improper behaviour. VHA takes its legal and corporate responsibilities very seriously\u201d. states the company in an official statement.\n\n\u201cOver the past four years, VHA has invested heavily in the security of its IT systems. The company has very strict controls and processes around the privacy of customer information, and has appointed a dedicated privacy officer. The privacy of our customers and protection of their information is our highest priority and we take this responsibility very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe deny that Vodafone Hutchison Australia made any incorrect statements to the Privacy Commissioner or any other authorities.\u201d\n\nVodafone confirmed it became aware of the hacking of O\u2019Brien\u2019s phone in June 2012.\n\n\u201cVodafone Hutchison Australia immediately commissioned an investigation by one of Australia\u2019s top accounting firms. The investigation found there was no evidence VHA management had instructed the employee to access the messages and that VHA staff were fully aware of their legal obligations in relation to customer information.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Vodafone was cited by privacy advocates.\n\nIn June 2014, Vodafone issued the \u201cLaw Enforcement Disclosure Report\u201c that revealed the existence of secret wires that allow state surveillance. The document  describes the support provided by the company to many governments for lawful interception for some of its 400 million customers.\n\nIn November 2013, Vodafone Iceland suffered a major data breach that exposed 70000 user personal information. A a group of hackers disclosed a compressed 61.7MB rar file that contained a collection of files including one titled users.sql that appears to contain the 77,000 Vodafone user accounts. The file includes usernames, social security numbers, encrypted passwords as many other encrypted information.\n\nAnother file, MySQL file greind.sql appears to contain a small log of sms history that is dated 2011 as well as a sms logger.\n\n\n\nThe hack of the Fairfax journalist\u2019s phone represents a serious threat for the user privacy, let\u2019s wait for further information of the investigation of Australian authorities.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Vodafone, hacking)\n\n// <![CDATA[\n(function(){var h=this,aa=function(a){var b=typeof

"Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 24, 2015", "body": "Thousands of Britons are exposed to cyber crime after the content of their PC was exposed on the Internet by Shodan, a website dubbed the \u201cGoogle for hackers.\u201d\n\nThe leaked data includes medical records, photographs, medical records and other sensitive documents that can be easily downloaded from the site. According to a Mail on Sunday investigation, the data was raked because of security holes in hard drives used by victims to archive the information or back up them.\n\nSecurity experts speculate that millions of Britons and UK firms are at risk of being hacked because the populer Shodan website provides information about their web-connected storage devices.\n\nBy using the powerful Shodan search engine, hackers can easily locate the flawed devices and download sensitive information.\n\n\u201cHighly confidential files belonging to a High Street law firm were also freely available on the website, called Shodan, including full details of their clients\u2019 financial affairs, passports and driving licences.\u201d states the Mail on Sunday.\n\nThe experts highlight the importance to keep every electronic device connected to the internet up to dated and properly configured to avoid that hackers can find easy-to-guess passwords or use default credentials to access their systems.\n\n\u201cWhat Shodan does is shine a light on some of the more insecure aspects of this new interconnected world.\u201d explained the Professor Tim Watson, director of the Cyber Security Centre at the University of Warwick\n\n\u201cWe are buying kit connected by default to the internet, because we love the fact we can use it anywhere. But this comes at a price \u2013 we\u2019re buying these features but we\u2019re not buying security.\u201d\n\nIn many cased the devices are open on the Interned left without password protection and presents default settings easily to guess once identified the component.\n\nIn the specific case, hackers can identify the flawed hard drives made by the company Iomega by using Shodan, such storage devices are used by thousands of individuals to back-up documents.\n\n \n\nSearching for this hard drives using the query \u201cIomega\u201d in Shodan it is possible to discover nearly 20,000 devices worldwide, 1,600 of them in the UK. The majority of this hard drives is not protected by password so its content is easy to access.\n\n\u201cIn two cases, the Mail on Sunday spoke to victims whose hard drives were hacked despite setting up unique passwords. Within minutes of the Mail on Sunday signing up to the site \u2013 which is free to join for a limited number of searches but costs $49 (\u00a331) for full membership \u2013 we were able to look at the folders stored on these machines.\u201d states the Mail on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe discovery is not surprising for the security experts, but anyway disconcerting if we think to the possible consequence of the exposure of a huge quantity of sensitive data. Most files contained the names and addresses of their owners, as well as personal and sensitive data such as medical and financial information.\n\nThe experts at the Mail on Sunday tracked the owners of the devices warning them of the risks.\n\n\u201cBy searching Shodan for unprotected devices in Glasgow, we discovered a hard drive containing the business files of a solicitors\u2019 firm.Folder titles included \u2018cash\u2019, \u2018clients\u2019, \u2018powers of attorney\u2019 and \u2018money laundering\u2019, with the individual files giving full details on everything from house purchases to visa letters and even customers\u2019 passports. One of the main folders was titled \u2018MacKaur documents\u2019 while others gave the names of the two partners and a secretary working for a Scottish law firm called MacRae & Kaur. But it denied its data had been leaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose I represent have clarified with their IT support organisation that the computer system they employ, in particular that which deals with the storing of data securely is lawful and in accordance with legal requirements as a law firm practising in Scotland.\u201d said the law firm.\n\nLenovo admitted the problem for its Iomega hard drives, confirmed that it has already fixed the issue since last year.\n\nA spokesman said: \u2018Lenovo addressed these concerns in 2014 whereby new devices did not have this problem and a fix was made available to existing customers.\u2019 \n\nThe problem is that the majority of hard drive owners is not aware of the security issues and in many cases are not able to install the updates.\n\nAnother suggestion provided by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, Britain\u2019s data watchdog, is to check the device password once installed the update.\n\n\u201cThe first security step anyone should take when getting any new device, is to set a strong password.\u201d said a spokesman.\n\n\u201cThe default passwords many manufacturers use are freely available online so it\u2019s important to get these simple passwords changed.\u201d \u201cIf the device doesn\u2019t have a password, then as a bare minimum, you should set one up, making sure it\u2019s not one that can be easily guessed.\u201d\n\nShodan\u2019s founder John Matherly, explained that its company have already banned in the past individuals for abusing its service.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in shooting the messenger. Shodan is the right answer to the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should be upset that the product they purchased didn\u2019t provide better safeguards to protect their data and prevent it from being leaked on the internet.\u201d \u201cThe way we fix these insecure-by-default devices is by raising awareness so consumers demand change from companies.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Shodan, hard drives)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hard-drives", "topic_name": "hard drives"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/identity-theft", "topic_name": "Identity Theft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iomega", "topic_name": "iomega"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shodan", "topic_name": "shodan"}]}, {"news_name": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 23 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39528/cyber-crime/security-affairs-newsletter-23.html", "title": "Security Affairs newsletter Round 23 \u2013 Best of the week from best sources\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 23, 2015", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again thank you!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Newsletter, SecurityAffairs)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/newsletter", "topic_name": "Newsletter"}]}, {"news_name": "AT&T secretly helped Spy agency, suggests new NSA leaked documents", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39439/digital-id/att-helped-nsa.html", "title": "AT&T secretly helped Spy agency, suggests new NSA leaked documents\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 19, 2015", "body": "The archives gave by the previous NSA foreman and checked on by The New York Times and ProPublica portrayed a \u201cprofoundly synergistic\u201d telecom titan that showed a \u201cgreat ability to offer assistance.\u201d\n\nThe Times said it was misty whether the projects are still operational in the same way today.

The SS7 protocol allows cell phone carriers to collect location data related to the user\u2019s device from cell phone towers and share it with other carriers, this means that exploiting the SS7 a carrier is able to discover the position of its customer everywhere he is.\n\n\u201cThe flaws, to be reported at a hacker conference in Hamburg this month, are the latest evidence of widespread insecurity on SS7, the global network that allows the world\u2019s cellular carriers to route calls, texts and other services to each other. Experts say it\u2019s increasingly clear that SS7, first designed in the 1980s, is riddled with serious vulnerabilities that undermine the privacy of the world\u2019s billions of cellular customers.\n\nThe flaws discovered by the German researchers are actually functions built into SS7 for other purposes \u2013 such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways, switching from cell tower to cell tower \u2013 that hackers can repurpose for surveillance because of the lax security on the network.\u201d reports The Washington Post.\n\nIn the hacking community is known the existence of several techniques that hackers and snoopers can make use of, in order to eavesdrop and intercept phone calls or written text messages. In December 2014, German researchers have placed the matter to the public for consideration at the Chaos Communication Hacker Congress, since there can be a great many problems emerging.\n\nCarriers of mobile telephony spend large amounts of money towards expanding their network and securing the conditions of communication with 3G and high-end encryption. To quote Tobias Engel, one of the German researchers mentioned above,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you secure the front door of the house, but the back door is wide open\u201d.\n\nOne of the major incidents registered by NKRZI (which is the National Commission for the State Regulation of Communications and Informatization in Ukraine) involved Russian addresses back in April 2014.\n\nThe expert noticed that many Ukrainian holders of mobile phones have been affected by notorious SS7 packets that possibly derived from Russia. As a result, the mobile phone holders were intercepted of their address details and everything that was stored inside each phone. MTS Ukraine obviously participated in the interception, in relation to MTS Russia.\n\nAs a direct consequence of security breaches related to SS7 protocols of telecommunication, the eminent threat is none other than the surveillance taking place between different countries.\n\nThe system is being used by major Australian providers, this means that Aussies data could be exposed to hackers. Names, addresses, bank account details and medical data stolen due to a security vulnerability that could give hackers the access to their mobile devices.\n\n\u201cEverything about our lives is contained in the palm of our hand,'\u201d reporter Ross Coulthart said. \u2018Your sensitive, private data is opened for anyone to see. You could be bugged, tracked and hacked from anywhere in the world. It\u2019s long been the dirty little secret of international espionage. What it means is that your smartphone is an open book.\u201d\n\nIn the TV show, Mr Coulthart was speaking from Germany with the Independent senator Nick Xenophon who was located at the Parliament House in Canberra at the time of phone call.\n\nWith the support of the German hacker Luca Melette, Mr Coulthart demonstrated how to track its interlocutor by exploiting the security issue into the SS7.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat if I could tell you senator, that it\u2019s possible to listen in to any mobile phone from anywhere in the world \u2013 would you believe me?'\u201d Mr Coulthart asked to Mr Xenophon while Melette was listening the conversation.\n\n\u201cI find it very hard to believe.\u201d replied the incredulous Mr Xenophon.\n\n\n\nMr Coulhart then asked the senator for consent to record the phone call.\n\n\u201cBut if you reckon they can pull it off, I give my consent but I find this incredibly hard to believe.\u201d responded Mr Xenophon.\n\nThe reporter also anticipated to Mr Xenophon hat the hackers could intercept his text messages, but once again he skeptical immediately sent the following text message:\n\n\u201cHi Ross, I don\u2019t believe you!! Nick.\u201d\n\nThe senator was shocked by the live demo provided by the reporter and the hacker.\n\n\u201cThis is actually quite shocking because this affects every Australia,\u201d Mr Xenophon said. \u201cIt means anyone with a mobile phone can be hacked, can be bugged \u2013 it\u2019s just chilling. This is the end of anyone\u2019s privacy as we know it.\u201d \u2018This is not about spies or terrorists and pollies \u2013 this is about every Australian that is vulnerable because their phones can be hacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t use the telephone service provided by the phone company for voice.

Hackers have demonstrated that it is not difficult to trigger vulnerabilities inside systems that manage fingerprints in order to bypass authentication mechanisms, in April 2015 a group of security researchers at FireEye have discovered a vulnerability in the Samsung Galaxy S5 that allows hackers to clone fingerprints.\n\nNow security experts from FireEye have discovered four new methods to hack Android devices and extract user fingerprints remotely.\n\nThe researchers Tao Wei and Yulong Zhang presented the findings of their hack in a talk titled, Fingerprints on Mobile Devices: Abusing and Leaking, at the Black Hat conference last week.\n\nThe techniques are very insidious because the victim will never notice the disconcerting theft of its fingerprints.\n\n\n\nThe researchers dubbed the attack \u201cFingerprint Sensor Spying attack\u201d and it could allow attackers to \u201cremotely harvest fingerprints in a large scale from the handset of the major manufacturers including HTC, Samsung and Huawei.\n\nThe experts avoided to release  any \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d for obvious reason.\nThe targets of the attack are Android devices equipped with Fingerprint Sensors that allow users to authenticate themselves by simply touching the display of their smartphone.\n\nLet\u2019s note that Google doesn\u2019t yet officially support the authentication mechanism based on fingerprints based on its mobile operating system, but the company will soon implement the support in the next release Android M.\n\nThe researchers tested their attack on the HTC One Max and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S5, the succeeded to steal a fingerprint image from the device due to the lack of a proper implementation of a locking mechanism for the fingerprint sensor.\n\nI have explained several times the risks related to a wrong implementation of biometric authentication, the theft of a biometric data like fingerprints would be more dangerous compared the theft of a stolen password.\n\nUsers can reset their compromised password, but cannot change fingerprints neither the iris in the case of data breach.\n\n\u201cIn this attack, victims\u2019 fingerprint data directly fall into attacker\u2019s hand. For the rest of the victim\u2019s life, the attacker can keep using the fingerprint data to do other malicious things,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nFortunately, the security issue is quite easy to fix, for example by encrypting fingerprint data on Android devices, and a number of vendors are already working to a security update.\n\nThe measure is already adopted by Apple iOS that encrypts data acquired by the Touch ID sensor. The experts explained that Apple iOS is \u201cquite secure\u201d because it encrypts fingerprint data from the scanner with a crypto key, making it unreadable even if hackers gain access.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Android, fingerprints)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/black-hat-2015", "topic_name": "Black Hat 2015"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fingerprints", "topic_name": "fingerprints"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fireeye", "topic_name": "FireEye"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}]}, {"news_name": "Hijacking Satellite Communications with a $1,000 Device", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39051/digital-id/hijacking-satellite-communications.html", "title": "Hijacking Satellite Communications with a $1,000 Device\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 3, 2015", "body": "Colby Moore, a security expert from security firm Synack, will present in a talk at the next Black Hat Conference how to hack satellite tracking technology by using a $1,000 device made of off the shelf components.\n\nThe possible consequences are serious if we consider that satellite tracking technology is practically used in every industry, including cargo shipment and military.\n\nMoore focused its analysis on GlobalStar systems, the vendor provides satellite tracking devices to its customers that want to track their assets. The GlobalStar satellite tracking devices can also be used to monitor industrial critical infrastructure such as pipelines, or to track hikers and other adventurers who use GlobalStar\u2019s consumer tracker called \u201cSpot.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoore will demonstrate that communications between GlobalStar tracker devices and its constellation of satellites is not secure and open to cyber attacks, hackers, in fact, can intercept data transferred and spoof the signal sent to the satellites.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only at the tip of the iceberg for the implications around this,\u201d Moore told Motherboard. \u201cIt\u2019s really critical that these companies start taking security seriously.\u201d\n\nMoore sustain that the company GlobalStar isn\u2019t taking security seriously and it isn\u2019t protecting its customers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical that these companies start taking security seriously.\u201d\n\nGlobalStar satellite tracking devices are used for various purposes, they can be used to monitor industrial critical infrastructure such as pipelines, or to track adventurers.\n\nMoore pointed out that the entire family of devices provided by GlobalStart relies on the flawed technology, known as the Simplex data network, which is used to transmit data between the tracking devices and the satellites.\n\nThe researcher made a reverse engineering of the protocol discovering that it is easy to intercept communication data in transit. Moore has built device composed of a satellite antenna, a software defined radio transceiver, and an amplifier, that allows him to capture data sent by GlobalStar transmitters to the satellites.\n\n\n\nThe device allows attackers to see the position of every satellite tracker, and can even hijack and spoof the data, tricking the trackers and making them believe to be in a different location.\n\nThe device cost only around $1,000, Moore plans to release the hardware specifications as well as the code he developed at the Black Hat.\n\nThe repercussions on security could be serious, as explained by the MotherBoard.\n\n\u201cFor example, a criminal could track a vehicle, say an armored car, for days to learn its regular path. The intercepted data doesn\u2019t reveal what kind of vehicle a tracker is installed on, but regular patterns might give that away\u2014think of a vehicle that constantly goes between banks or diamond shops.\u201d wrote Lorenzo Bicchierai from MotherBoard.\n\nAt that point, the criminal could hijack it, disable the satellite transmitter, and use another transmitter to show to the company that the armored car is on its regular track \u201cbut in reality you\u2019re hijacking it and taking it somewhere else,\u201d Moore said.\n\nCurrently the device is able to track devices in a range of \u201cseveral miles\u201d, future improvements will allow Moore to extend the range up to 2,000 miles.\n\n\u201cIn the future I\u2019ll be able to see 2,000 miles around me for every base station I set up,\u201d explained Moore.\n\nMoore reported the flaws to GlobalStar more than six months ago without receiving any reply.\n\nThe bad news for GlobalStar\u2019s customers is that it is likely the firmware on the device could not be updated so the company would have to recall them.\n\nThe GlobalStar immediately replied to the claims, a spokesperson for GlobalStar released the following statement via email:\n\n\u201cengineers would know quickly if any person or entity was hacking our system in a material way, and this type of situation has never been an issue to date.\u201d\n\nMoore doesn\u2019t believe the explanation provided by the company\u2019s spokesman.\n\n\u201cIts very possible that GlobalStar does have internal monitoring mechanisms,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBut due to the nature of the flaws I have discovered, I believe it would be impossible to monitor if someone is intercepting data and using it for malicious purposes.\u201c\n\nLet\u2019s wait for the talk \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 GlobalStar,  satellite tracking device)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/globalstar", "topic_name": "GlobalStar"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/highjacking", "topic_name": "highjacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satellite-tracking-device", "topic_name": "satellite tracking device"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satellites", "topic_name": "satellites"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft Windows 10 spies on you by default", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39042/digital-id/windows-10-privacy.html", "title": "Microsoft Windows 10 spies on you by default\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 2, 2015", "body": "Microsoft Windows 10 is the new operating system of the IT giant, the newborn already reached more than 14 million downloads in just two days.

The Hornet is able to manage anonymous traffic at speeds of more than 93 Gbps.\n\nThe HORNET anonymous network was designed by researcher Chen Chen of Carnegie Mellon University, with the colleagues Daniele Enrico Asoni, Adrian Perrig and David Barrera of the Zurich\u2019s Federal Institute of Technology, and George Danezis of University College London.\n\n\u201cOur system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on intermediate nodes. This design enables HORNET nodes to process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET can also scale as required, adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel. We discuss design and implementation details, as well as a performance and security evaluation.\u201d is the description provided by the experts in the paper titled HORNET: High-speed Onion Routing at the Network Layer.\n\nIn order to speed up data transfer, HORNET doesn\u2019t keep the state at each relay, connection state is carried within packet headers, this means that intermediate nodes can quickly forward traffic for large numbers of nodes.\n\nHORNET does not \u201cperform computationally expensive operations for data forwarding,\u201d allowing it to scale as required without any limitations.\n\nHORNET encrypts encapsulated network requests in \u201conions,\u201d like Tor each layer being decrypted by each node passing the traffic along to retrieve information on next hop where to forward data. HORNET uses two onion protocols for protecting the anonymity of requests to online resources and a modified version of Tor\u2019s \u201crendezvous point\u201d negotiation to connect with a site in the HORNET network.\n\nWhen a user wants to access a website on the Internet a Tor-like \u201cSphinx\u201d onion protocol is first used to set up the channel.\n\n\u201cEach Sphinx packet allows a source node to establish a set of symmetric keys, one for each node on the path through which packets are routed,\u201d states the paper. A chain of keys is created via a Diffie-Helman exchange and each key is used to encrypt a \u201cForwarding Segment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe [Forwarding Segment] allows its creating node to dynamically retrieve the embedded information (i.e., next hop, shared key, session expiration time), while hiding this information from unauthorized third parties,\u201d reports the paper.\n\nThe sender inserts the forwarding segments related to each node on the channel to the destination in the anonymous header (AHDR).\n\n\n\n\u201cAn AHDR grants each node on the path access to the [forwarding segment] it created, without divulging any information about the path except for a node\u2019s previous and next nodes,\u201d states the paper. \n\nThe data traffic is encrypted with the keys for each of the nodes in the channel.

Facebook has created an AI research laboratory and hired NYU professor \u201cYann LeCun\u201d as the head of artificial intelligence since 2013. This investment led to a successful experimental algorithm that uses other identifying clues such as hair style, clothing, and body shape in order to recognize people even if their faces are not clear.\n\nThis Facebook algorithm is considered as the latest AI step in facial recognition called PIPER. The technology is able to identify people even when faces are obscured. PIPER has been examined by use of a dataset, consisting of over 60,000 instances of 2000 individuals collected from public Flickr photo albums with only about half of the person images containing a frontal face. The final result is quite astonishing and as Facebook said:\n\n\u201cit has the ability to identify individuals with 83% accuracy\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Pose Invariant Person Recognition (PIPER) method, accumulates the cues of poselet-level person recognizers trained by deep convolutional networks to discount for the pose variations, combined with a face recognizer and a global recognizer.\n\nFacial recognition use has been rapidly increasing both in commercial products, as well as by law enforcement lately. Facebook has used facial recognition technology to enable tag suggestion and for its new photo sharing application named Moments that was introduced on June 15, 2015.Facebook facial recognition software helps users tag photos by suggesting tags of their friends. This software uses an algorithm to calculate a unique number (\u201ctemplate\u201d) based on someone\u2019s facial features, like the distance between the eyes, nose and ears. This template is based on profile pictures and photos users have been tagged in on Facebook. Algorithms like this could help application such as Moments to provide better accuracy and higher user satisfaction.\n\n\u201cIf, even when you hide your face, you can be successfully linked to your identiy, that will certainly concern people,\u201d said Ralph Gross at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It goes without say that, the algorithm and its ability to identify someone even when they are not looking at the camera is very impressive, but it might bring some serious privacy issues to the fore.\n\nAlso, these advanced facial recognition algorithms like PIPER bring limitless possibilities for solving crimes and putting an end to drawbacks of the traditional algorithms which relied on \u2018face alignment\u2019 based on locations of the two eyes and have difficulty to function correctly in situation person wearing sunglasses or face is occluded.

It seems that the listening component was involuntarily activated within Chromium and represent a serious threat for the users privacy.\n\nChromium is the open-source web browser project from which Google Chrome draws its source code, an open source developer discovered that it began remotely installing the dreaded audio-snooping code.\n\n\n\nOfficially the code discovered in Chromium was designed to support the new \u201cOK, Google\u201d feature implemented in Chrome, the feature allows the system users to respond when they talk to it. Now the problem is that this code is installed and activated without the user\u2019s permission.\n\n\u201cIt looked like just another bug report. \u201cWhen I start Chromium, it downloads something.\u201d Followed by strange status information that notably included the lines \u201cMicrophone: Yes\u201d and \u201cAudio Capture Allowed: Yes\u201d.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cWithout consent, Google\u2019s code had downloaded a black box of code that \u2013 according to itself \u2013 had turned on the microphone and was actively listening to your room,\u201d explained Rick Falkvinge, the Pirate party founder, in a blog post. \u201cWhich means that your computer had been stealth configured to send what was being said in your room to somebody else, to a private company in another country, without your consent or knowledge, an audio transmission triggered by \u2026 an unknown and unverifiable set of conditions.\u201d\n\nThe snooping feature is installed by default as part of Google\u2019s Chrome browser, but privacy advocates are up in arms because the listening code is considered to be a \u201cblack box\u201d code that is excluded from an open source audit process on the Chromium project.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know and can\u2019t know what this black box does,\u201d remarked Falkvinge.\n\nOn his hand, Google has provided the following responses to complaints via its developer boards, I decided to propose them integrally in order of avoid misunderstanding, but the content is eloquent:\n\n1) Yes, we\u2019re downloading and installing a wiretapping black-box to your computer. But we\u2019re not actually activating it. We did take advantage of our position as trusted upstream to stealth-insert code into open-source software that installed this black box onto millions of computers, but we would never abuse the same trust in the same way to insert code that activates the eavesdropping-blackbox we already downloaded and installed onto your computer without your consent or knowledge. You can look at the code as it looks right now to see that the code doesn\u2019t do this right now.\n\n2) Yes, Chromium is bypassing the entire source code auditing process by downloading a pre-built black box onto people\u2019s computers. But that\u2019s not something we care about, really. We\u2019re concerned with building Google Chrome, the product from Google. As part of that, we provide the source code for others to package if they like. Anybody who uses our code for their own purpose takes responsibility for it. When this happens in a Debian installation, it is not Google Chrome\u2019s behavior, this is Debian Chromium\u2019s behavior. It\u2019s Debian\u2019s responsibility entirely.\n\n3) Yes, we deliberately hid this listening module from the users, but that\u2019s because we consider this behavior to be part of the basic Google Chrome experience. We don\u2019t want to show all modules that we install ourselves.\n\nResuming, Chromium as the culprit and Google also blamed the Linux distribution Debian for downloading the non-open source component with Chromium automatically, rather than Google Chrome.\n\nGoogle remarked that Chromium is not a Google product and also blamed the Linux distribution Debian for downloading the non-open source component with Chromium automatically.\n\n\u201cThe key here is that Chromium is not a Google product. We do not directly distribute it, or make any guarantees with respect to compliance with various open source policies,\u201d Google developer mgiuca said.\n\nThe developer Ofer Zelig provided an interesting testimony regarding the issue.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, while I was working on my PC at home, I noticed something strange. My PC has a web camera (combined with a microphone) that sits on top of my monitor, and the camera has a small blue LED that lights when the camera and/or microphone are operating.\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI opened Task Manager (I\u2019m working on Windows. Apologies.) and looked for a process to blame on that dodgy activity. Who is listening to me? I didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d \u201cAnd then I\u2019ve come across this bug report \u2013 it\u2019s Google! And according to them it\u2019s not a bug! They silently put this new module in Chrome (or Chromium to be precise, doesn\u2019t matter much from an end-user perspective). \u201c\n\nThe principal problem is that a growing number of similar functions will be included in modern devices to improve the user\u2019s experience, SmartTV and our cars are already watching us and listening to our conversation, that\u2019s the way privacy issues must be carefully approached.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Chromium, snooping features)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2013 WhatsApp ranked as the worst at protecting users\u2019 privacy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/37969/digital-id/electronic-frontier-foundation-report.html", "title": "Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2013 WhatsApp ranked as the worst at protecting users\u2019 privacy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 21, 2015", "body": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation has published its annual report \u201cWho Has Your Back? 2015: Protecting Your Data From Government Requests\u201d that analyzes how private companies handlesusers data with specific focus on Government surveillance.\n\n\u201cWhich companies will stand by users, insisting on transparency and strong legal standards around government access to user data?

Following the section 215 of the Patriot Act, the process to collect data on Americans from security and intelligence agencies had been a data \u201ccrown jewels\u201d to detect and prevent any risk of a security breach. Nonetheless, there is an alarming debate from a privacy perspective considering big differences between legal perform of Section 215 upon a pernicious application of Executive Order 12333 and 2008.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, there is an alarming debate from a privacy perspective considering big differences between legal perform of Section 215 upon a pernicious application of Executive Order 12333 and the 2008 FISA Amendments Act. In fact, those legal instruments have a different orientation from privacy perspective.\n\nCyber Risk is persisting with the materialization of terror attacks. Therefore, the importance to provide the best legal conditions to the NSA and security offices means a compromise to transform surveillance practices into a good example of accountability and transparency of government surveillance activities. Legal aspects of three parts of the Patriot Act expired, including Section 215.\n\nNow, there is an example of controversy and conflict between political parties, private sector and civil society to find out a solution, considering critical factors to guarantee individual privacy rights upon government\u2019s surveillance activities.\n\nCurrently, privacy is extremely important for governments in terms of geopolitics and cyber-politics. There are several examples where governments are taking \u201cprivacy extremely seriously\u201d.\n\nThe Germans within their Federal Intelligence Service the BND has started several investigations to detect cyber-espionage activities. Brazil and its new internet freedom law is impelling best conditions to guarantee security and liberty in cyberspace.\n\nFrance approved a bill for intrusive surveillance after January\u2019s Charlie Hebdo attacks. In Canada, the government has tried to insert back doors into encryption. Last year, Australian legislation gave sweeping powers to monitor any device \u201cconnected\u201d to a particular device with just a single warrant.\n\nHowever, government surveillance powers require a prompt consensus to place substantive limits on legal aspects of Executive Order 12333 and the 2008 FISA Amendments Act.

Once the e-mail address was confirmed as legitimate, the IRS procedure requests a number of questions about personal, financial, and tax information of the users before making the transcript available for the download.\n\nThe hackers bypassed the security screen requiring user information such as SSN, date of birth, and street address in order to access taxpayers\u2019 data.\n\nThe IRS counted more than 200,000 attempts, about half of them were successful. The IRS has temporarily interrupted the service, explained that the service was targeted by the hackers in a two-month period between February and mid-May.\n\n\u201cThe online Get Transcript service is currently unavailable. Transcripts may still be ordered using the Get Transcript by Mail service.

The hackers had used the personal information of the taxpayers to get a refund direct deposit.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an American and haven\u2019t yet created an account at irs.gov, you may want to take care of that before tax fraudsters create an account in your name and steal your personal and tax data in the process.\u201d worte Krebs on this blog.\n\n \n\nThe process of authentication implemented by the IRS service is based on the knowledge of user personal information (knowledge-based authentication) that never changes making possible for an attacker to gain them in various ways.\n\nSSN numbers, for example, along with other PII are easy to acquire in the various black markets, recent data breaches of Anthem and CareFirst have made available on the market data related to million customers.\n\n\u201cThe IRS is continuing to conduct further reviews on those instances where the transcript application was accessed, including how many of these households filed taxes in 2015.

Tails includes a set of tools to protect the user anonymity, such as the Tor Browser and the I2P anonymizing software. The Tails live OS is designed to route all the user traffic over the Tor network to prevent applications from leaking it.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Tails ability to boot and run from a disc, USB drive, or SD card ensures no traces of a user\u2019s activity remain on the local host hard drive and registry, this means that it could also run on an untrusted computer. Another point of strength for the Tails live distribution is the impossibility for spyware to run infect the Tails OS.\n\nTheoretically the unique possibility for an attacker to spy on a Tails session is to use a malicious implant at firmware level on the targeted host.\n\nTails use other privacy software like KeePassX password manager, Electrum BitCoin wallet, Pidgin, and disk-wiping and encryption tools.\n\nPidgin for example, is a free chat client used by to connect to AIM, MSN, Yahoo, and more chat networks all at once. The version installed in the Tails 1.4 version comes with the Off-the-Record plug-in for encrypted chatting.

The situation is particularly serious in the energy sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe attacker was able to navigate from the third-party-managed environment into the USIS network in late [redacted] by successfully brute-forcing a password on an application server,\u201d Stroz Friedberg Managing Director Bret Padres wrote in the letter, obtained by Nextgov.\n\n\u201cOnce the attacker was able to log in to that server, the attacker installed a malicious backdoor\u201d to provide easy access, Padres wrote.\n\nThe attacks against companies like the USIS are not a surprise, these companies create detailed dossiers on government officials that could be used by the threat actors to conduct further attacks against the targeted organization.\n\nLet me add that China isn\u2019t the unique country that target US organization searching for background investigation databases, Russian hackers also represent a serious threat to the US.\n\nTo better understand why attackers target background investigation databases, let\u2019s think to the information that a state-sponsored hacker can gather linking data from a government personnel databases and health care databases like the one compromised in the Anthem hack.  Intruders can easily obtain precious data related to the family lives of federal employees who might be susceptible to bribery or blackmail.

It seems that there is a general need for the US Government to have access to encrypted content and the advanced security and encryption protocols used do not make this happen. As you may recall, Apple has already announced that they will no longer unlock their various products for the police, even when asked to do that via a warrant.\n\nThis comes as quite a shock, especially when combined with the recent revelations of Rogers from the NSA regarding his point on the matter of encryption. To be more specific, Roger has asked for the proper legislation that would cover his need to monitor encrypted content. What he needs is not a back door, rather than a front door with multiple locks. In other words this means that a possible solution to the problem of encryption lies beneath the combination of persons or agencies towards gaining the access required to encrypted content.\n\nThe White House and Barack Obama himself are not willing to decide on the spot, since this is a hot potato that has raised concerns and complaints all over the web. With the exponential increase of mobile devices (smartphones, iPhones and iPads, tablets etc.) and with the huge plethora of apps available to the public, encryption has become easier than ever to accomplish. What is more, with the use of VPN you can get advanced encryption that allows you to encode all of your data and leave nothing to chance in your effort to safeguard your privacy and anonymity.\n\n\n\nOf course, what the NSA and the Government seem to be worried about regarding encryption is the fact that such a tactic allows criminals to act under cover and get their way, without anyone noticing. However, in the name of such a potential harm being done, it is not sure that the freedom to use encryption should be put at risk.\n\nThe Constitution does not jeopardize the human rights of a person, simply because there may be some other rights at stake. One good does not compensate for a bad that is being committed and this is some very thin ice that the US Government and officials are walking on. Fifth Amendment can be used in favour of the people who are actually to blame and doing something that might backfire does not seem like the perfect way to go in the United States.\nThe people have become more aware of the benefits that encryption offers, including the enhancement of their anonymity online that in turn leads to the lack of problems related to hacking or identity theft incidents. Having that in mind, the importance of allowing encryption to go on benefiting people is indisputable. What remains is for us to see how the NSA and the US Government are going to balance between their need to penetrate the privacy of the citizens and the rights of the citizens to continue encrypting their communication and personal files.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

The investigation revealed that a Chinese certificate authority was using an intermediate CA, MCS Holdings, that issued the bogus Google digital certificates. The circumstance is worrying because the MCS Holdings could have issued digital certificates for virtually any domain of the company.\n\nGoogle issued an update for the revocation list included in the Chrome browser in order to revoke the fraudulent certificate, meantime it has also alerted other browser vendors to the security issue. Google contacted officials at CNNIC, the Chinese registrar who authorized the intermediate CA, and the officials said that they were working with MCS to issue certificates for domains that it registered.\n\nGoogle promptly reported the issued to the CNNIC,  the Chinese registrar that authorized the intermediate CA, that confirmed MCS issues certificates for domains that it registered. It seems that the private key was installed on man-in-the-middle proxy, a network equipment used to eavesdrop secure connections by impersonating the intended destination for surveillance purpose.\n\n\u201cCNNIC responded on the 22nd to explain that they had contracted with MCS Holdings on the basis that MCS would only issue certificates for domains that they had registered. However, rather than keep the private key in a suitable HSM, MCS installed it in a man-in-the-middle proxy. These devices intercept secure connections by masquerading as the intended destination and are sometimes used by companies to intercept their employees\u2019 secure traffic for monitoring or legal reasons,\u201d wrote Adam Langley from Google in a blog post.\n\nLangley highlighted the risks related to such kind of operation, the problem is that the CNNIC authority is trusted by all of the major browsers exposing users to serious risks.\n\n\u201cThe employees\u2019 computers normally have to be configured to trust a proxy for it to be able to do this. However, in this case, the presumed proxy was given the full authority of a public CA, which is a serious breach of the CA system.\u201d wrote Langley \u201cCNNIC is included in all major root stores and so the misissued certificates would be trusted by almost all browsers and operating systems. Chrome on Windows, OS X, and Linux, ChromeOS, and Firefox 33 and greater would have rejected these certificates because of public-key pinning, although misissued certificates for other sites likely exist,\u201d \n\nIn December 2013 a similar incident occurred, security experts at Google discovered the unauthorized use of digital certificates issued by an intermediate certificate authority linked to ANSSI for several Google domains.\n\nANSSI is the French CyberSecurity agency that operates with French intelligence agencies, the organization declared that an intermediate CA was generating fake-certificate to conduct MITM attack and inspect SSL traffic. Be aware that an intermediate CA certificate carries the full authority of the CA, attackers can use it to create a certificate for any website they wish to hack.\n\n\u201cANSSI has found that the intermediate CA certificate was used in a commercial device, on a private network, to inspect encrypted traffic with the knowledge of the users on that network. This was a violation of their procedures and they have asked for the certificate in question to be revoked by browsers. We updated Chrome\u2019s revocation metadata again to implement this,\u201d reported Google. \n\nGoogle discovered the ongoing MITM attack and blocked it, Google has declared that ANSSI has requested to block an intermediate CA certificate.\n\n\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  MITM,  digital certificate)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cnnic", "topic_name": "CNNIC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificate", "topic_name": "Digital Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mitm", "topic_name": "MITM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/public-key-pinning", "topic_name": "public-key pinning"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft discovered a bogus SSL digital certificate for Live that could be exploited for MITM attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/35002/digital-id/microsoft-bogus-digital-certificate.html", "title": "Microsoft discovered a bogus SSL digital certificate for Live that could be exploited for MITM attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 17, 2015", "body": "In January, an unnamed man came into possession of the live.fi certificate after noticing that he was able to use hostmaster@live.fi as an alias for his normal e-mail address.\n\nThe news was spread by Tivi.fi, the man discovered in this way that it was a highly privileged address that allowed him to automatically receive sensitive certificates from browser-trusted certificate authority Comodo.\n\nDespite the man made the worrying discovery in January, only now it seems that Microsoft has discovered and blacklisted the bogus SSL digital certificate that could be exploited to run man-in-the-middle attacks, the fraudulent certificate was issued for one of the company\u2019s Windows Live Web addresses.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is aware of an improperly issued SSL certificate for the domain \u201clive.fi\u201d that could be used in attempts to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. It cannot be used to issue other certificates, impersonate other domains, or sign code. This issue affects all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. Microsoft is not currently aware of attacks related to this issue.\u201d states the security advisory published by Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft confirmed that the bogus certificate for the domain \u201clive.fi\u201d could also by threat actors to spoof content or carry out phishing attacks, so the certificate authority Comodo that issued the digital certificate has revoked it promptly. In response, Microsoft is updating its Certificate Trust List (CTL) for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows to avoid the exploitation of the digital certificate.\n\n\n\nIn the next days, also Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox will block the bogus digital certificate to protect their users.\n\nAn unauthorized entity was able to register an email account on the domain with a \u201cprivileged username,\u201d and use it to request a bogus certificate for live.fi. For the majority of Windows systems that are using the automatic updater of revoked certificates, customers do not need to take any action.\n\nMicrosoft warns that users who don\u2019t run an automatic updater have to run the manual update KB2917500 to blacklist the certificate.\n\nComodo assured its customers by claiming that all of its certificates must pass through Domain Control Validation (DCV) before they\u2019re issued, but it seems that third party used an email (i.e. administrator@, admin@, etc.) to prove ownership of the domain and subsequently the certificate.\n\nMicrosoft reported that the bogus SSL certificate was issued due to a misconfigured privileged email account on the live.fi domain.\n\nA disconcerting fact of this history is that the Finnish man who obtained the digital certificate said he warned both Microsoft and Finland authorities, but he hasn\u2019t received any response.\n\nUnfortunately, this incident confirms concerns of security experts about a proper management of digital certificate life-cycle.\n\nThe security researcher Moxie Marlinspike demonstrated in 2009 how to easily defeat the revocation lists used by common browsers to check the validity of TLS certificates.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because the \u201conline certificate status protocol\u201d and an earlier database known as certificate revocation lists trigger what\u2019s known as a \u201csoft fail\u201d rather than a more secure but also harder-to-tolerate \u201chard fail.\u201d As a result, when an Internet outage makes a revocation list unavailable, most browsers will treat an unvalidated certificate as trusted. Attackers using a CA-issued counterfeit certificate to mount a man-in-the-middle attack can capitalize on this flaw by suppressing revocation response before it reaches a targeted end user. That means the only sure way to block an improperly issued certificate is for each browser maker to hard-code the revocation into an update. Windows 8 and 8.1 come with an automatic updater of revoked certificates.\u201d reported a post published by  ArsTechnica on the issue.\n\nIf you are interested to know more about possible abuses of digital certificates read the post \u201cHow Cybercrime Exploits Digital Certificates.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  digital certificate, SSL)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Yahoo launches its on-demand password feature", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/34985/digital-id/yahoo-on-demand-password.html", "title": "Yahoo launches its on-demand password feature\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 17, 2015", "body": "Yahoo has announced a new Password-Free login feature to let users access their account without the need for a password.

Based on these thoughts, MPs are trying to ban anonymity on the web and so they are trying to sabotage programs and services such as the Tor network.\n\nPrime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, suggests and promotes the idea of the ban of encryption of any kind regarding communication through the web and through users who prefer to communicate using anonymizing services like the Tor network. When an expert heard about his proposal, he immediately thought about the public outcry. The same thing happened when the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which cooperates with the MPs, found out about such an act. In fact, they said that there has been: \u201cwidespread agreement that banning online anonymity systems altogether is not seen as an acceptable policy option in the UK\u201d.\n\n\u201cwidespread agreement that banning online anonymity systems altogether is not seen as an acceptable policy option in the UK\u201d.\n\n\n\nWe cannot ignore that anonymizing services, in particular the Tor network, are precious instruments to circumvent censorship, aiding activism and journalism.\n\nThe Technical Challenges if anonymizing networks Like Tor network Were Banned\n\nIt is sure that if something like that happened, thus if services like Tor network were banned, some really technical issues would definitely appear. A report like that was published on Monday, 9 March. This report cited the example of the Chinese government and for those of you who do not know what happened there, you need to know the Chinese government tried to block and forbid the access to the Tor network and in this way they achieved to stop the visits on specific sites that were not approved by them. David Cameron insists on saying that there should be no \u201cmeans of communication\u201d that cannot be read from security services.\n\n\u201cIn extremis, it has been possible to read someone\u2019s letter, to listen to someone\u2019s call to mobile communications.\u201d sais C\n\u201cThe question remains, \u2018Are we going to allow a means of communications where it simply is not possible to do that?\u2019 My answer to that question is, \u2018No, we must not.'\u201d \n\nIn this effort of his, he had listed the name of the greatest search engines such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo that they will help him find and withdraw images of child abuse.\n\nOther Opinions about the Specific Matter\n\nA book called The Dark Net, which has been written by Jamie Bartlett, was referred in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (Post) report and states that this kind of Internet as it is called the Dark Internet is not indexed by the great search engines that were mentioned above. The author of the specific book actually agrees with the opinion of Cameron, thus that this kind of Internet should not be a place which criminals could hide but apart from the theory, it would be really difficult to become a reality.\n\nThe Services That No One Knows\n\nIt is known that the Post offers to the MPs office reports that have to do with science and technology in order to make them feel and be familiar with these subjects and make them fully understand them. In this report Post makes the difference of the dark Internet and the use of the web that acts in the public interest really clear.\n\nSo, based on this they have made it clear to the Parliament that some people have argued for an anonymous network but without any kind of hidden services, such as the Silk Road. This hidden service is mainly used for criminal purposes. In the report many other things were mentioned such as:\n\n\u201cHowever, THS also benefit non-criminal Tor users because they may add a further layer of user security,\u201d \u201cSites requiring strong security, like whistle-blowing platforms are offered as THS.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, computer experts argue that any legislative attempt to preclude THS from being available in the UK over Tor would be technologically infeasible.\u201d After all the above statements, no one from the Prime Minister\u2019s office not even the Prime Minister responded to any of these comments. \n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

It is known that people that acquires a domain could request to keep their information private by paying an extra fee.\n\nThe incident was discovered by Craig Williams, senior technical leader for Cisco\u2019s Talos research group, which reported the issue to Google that in about six days fixed the issue.\n\nThe leaked data could be used by criminal crews to run targeted phishing attack. According data provided by Cisco in a blog post,  282,867 domains were affected by the privacy breach.\n\n[cybercriminals are] \u201cgoing to have the right website name, the right name, the right address, the right phone number, the right email,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe expert noticed that privacy settings for domain names registered through the Google partner eNom were being turned in the renewal phase, starting around mid-2013.\n\n\u201cIn mid-2013, a problem occurred that slowly began unmasking the hidden registration information for owners\u2019 domains that had opted into WHOIS privacy protection.

Whois information is considered useless since it\u2019s either set to private or is simply fake. Criminal organizations use to buy domains by using stolen personal information or by entering bogus data.\n\nSecurity firms constantly monitor this data because they can help track malware campaigns, as explained by Williams, in many cases cyber criminals reuse the bogus information.\n\n\u201cThere are legitimate reasons to track whois information,\u201d he said.\n\nThanks to the monitoring activity, experts at Cisco Talos have already identified many affected domains that they have linked to malicious activity.\n\n\u201cCisco Talos has already identified many affected domains that we have linked to malicious activity. For example, looking at some of the unmasked domains possessing very poor web reputation scores, we can see several potential threat actors who might have some \u2018splaining to do. \u201c\n\nA privacy breach is probably one of the most serious incident that can occur today.

The dangers are not negligible for children that could have easy access to inappropriate content.  The experts at Kaspersky have conducted an interesting investigation of potential online threats to children by analyzing data from more than a million Kaspersky Lab customers.\n\nThe first disconcerting data is that each customer had encountered dangerous content at least once in the last year, adult content accounted for 59.5% of customers followed by gambling and weapons websites respectively at 26.66% and 20,29%.\n\n\u201cAmong the changes that took place in 2014, it is worth noting an increase in the percentage of users who visited various chat sites \u2013 up 18.16 percentage points. At the same time, the proportions of users encountering other types of dangerous sites declined.\u201d states the report published by Kaspersky.\n\nAnother interesting discovery made by the researchers is that the threats for children changes significantly from country to country.\n\nPrincipal exposure to the threats for children is caused by frequenting Chat services (67,29%), this data is alarming if we consider the diffusion of such services for different platforms used by Children, including mobile and social networks.\n\n\u201cHowever, the data does confirm the popularity of chat; and the greater the popularity of chat services in any given country, the greater the probability that children might occasionally or even intentionally enter into an unsafe chat environment. So, if nothing else, evidence of frequent encounters with chat services could be a sign for parents to pay more attention to the nature of these services and the likelihood of their child being drawn in.\u201d states the report from Kaspersky.\n\nThe list of inappropriate content also includes websites proposing an obscene Language, violence scenes and images and Alcohol and Drugs.\n\nThe experts analyzed data provided by the Kaspersky Lab protection solutions, the frequency of detections of inappropriate content online was higher for users from China, USA, Germany, the UK and Russia.\n\n\u201cChina, the USA, Germany, the UK and Russia lead the list of countries with the greatest frequency of Parental Control detections in 2014. In the previous year the situation was more or less the same, with the exception of China, which jumped from fourth place in 2013 to first place in 2014.\u201d continues the report.\n\nAs anticipated threats for children appear very differed from country to country, for instance, adult content was the biggest threat to users in Germany (with 172 detections per user), followed by China (144.18 detections per user), and the US (126.16 detections). The situation is different for Russian users that were threatened by a content about alcohol, tobacco and drugs\n\n\n\nParents need to pay special attention to protecting their children online threats, to this it is crucial to understand the menace, for this reason I consider this research exceptional and I recommend it to adults. Choose protection solutions with Parental Control technologies and make full use of safe \u201cchildren\u201d modes in search engines and applications that allow access to multimedia content and which are used by children.\n\nBe sure to use Parental Control technologies to mitigate threat for children and \u2018make full use of safe \u201cchildren\u201d modes in search engines and applications that allow access to multimedia content and which are used by children.\u2019\n\nThe limit of Parental Control technologies resides in the fact that they fail to protect our son from cyber threats for children when they access web services like chats and social networks. Predators or cyber bullies represent serious threats for children online.\n\nWe must consider seriously the possible consequences of the exposure to cyber threats for children, parents must be a point of reference in real life and in the digital one, we cannot leave them alone.\n\nThe \u201cChildren online\u201d study is a report that you must read!\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Children online, threats for children )\n\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/childre", "topic_name": "childre"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kaspersky", "topic_name": "Kaspersky"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/parental-control", "topic_name": "Parental control"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/threat-for-children", "topic_name": "threat for children"}]}, {"news_name": "Drones spying on cell phones for Advertizing campaigns", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/34476/digital-id/drones-advertizing-spying.html", "title": "Drones spying on cell phones for Advertizing campaigns\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 5, 2015", "body": "Drones that spy on unaware people, a nightmare come true, apparently nothing new considering that it is a common practice of law enforcement and Intelligence agency.

Whether it is a multi-billion organization or a single person with a computer, security is important for all. One of the pillars for cyber security is the Authentication. People want an easy way to deal with authentication, but currently the only available technique is to remember and manage long cumbersome passwords.\n\nEven this form of authentication is compromised now and then, because of the growing threat to the security domain as well as humans being the weakest link.\n\nDARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has come up with an innovative approach to solve the difficulties faced during authentication with the help of a concept termed as Cognitive Fingerprints also called \u201cActive Authentication.\u201d This is a multi-million dollar contract to produce a new identity verification system based on users\u2019 behavior.\n\n\u201cThis program focuses on the behavioral traits that can be observed through how we interact with the world.  Just as when you touch something your finger you leave behind a fingerprint, when you interact with technology you do so in a pattern based on how your mind processes information, leaving behind a \u201ccognitive fingerprint.\u201c reads a blog post on the \u201cACTIVE AUTHENTICATION\u201d published by the DARPA. \n\nThe logic behind this concept is to uniquely identify human patterns and use these parameters as the base for authentication. Fingerprints and retina scans are being used to authenticate the user but this technology demands setting up physical hardware which incurs huge costs.\n\n\n\n \n\nDARPA\u2019s vision is to eliminate these costs and, develop more robust and stable way of authentication. In our personal views this may completely replace the password-based authentication in near future. The project of \u201cCognitive Fingerprints\u201d is divided into multiple phases, in a first phase the expert will focus their efforts into searching for biometrics that do not require the installation of additional hardware sensors, these could include how the user interacts with the machine or the way user uses the mouse or other system components. It may also include how user searches for some information, how user opens and reads documents or emails, and many more parameters.\n\n\u201cThe first phase of the program will focus on researching biometrics that do not require the installation of additional hardware sensors, rather the program will look for research on biometrics that can be captured through the technology we already use looking for aspects of this \u201ccognitive fingerprint\u201d.\n\nSubsequently, the experts from DARPA working on Cognitive Fingerprints will develop a solution to implement an authentication platform that implements the results of their research.\n\n \u201cThe later phases of the program will focus on developing a solution that integrates any available biometrics using a new authentication platform suitable for deployment on a standard Department of Defense desktop or laptop.\u201d wrote the DARPA .\n\nCognitive Fingerprints have huge advantages as it will eliminate two crucial hurdles, the need of biometric based hardware and the need to remember complex long passwords.\nIn our personal view, this concept may face some hurdles as mentioned below. Though these are hypothetical issues but its worth to mention.\n\nThe Cognitive Fingerprints seems promising and will solve many problems of authentication to a much greater extent.\n\nAll are waiting to get a glance of this technology soon.\n\nAbout the Author Shivang Desai\n\nShivang Desai is a security researcher and certified security professional from India.

Due to its enormous popularity even apart from the fact that it\u2019s blocked in some countries and being accessed by some tools (it shows everyone out there wants to get it, no matter how much effort it requires), Facebook has drawn attention universally and with the ongoing problems emerging thanks to vague statements in previous versions of the terms of use and policies the phenomenon has not calmed down. In order to be kept up to date with the latest version of Facebook\u2019s policies, the report was issued raising awareness to everyone, even in a provisional manner.\n\n\n\nIn response to the revisions announced last December and performed a month later, the report is in accordance to what seems to be the case legally with Facebook to this date. According to the professionals, what has led them to proceed with the report was the following: \u201cIn December 2014, Facebook announced that it would revise\n\n\u201cIn December 2014, Facebook announced that it would revise its Data Use Policy and Terms of Service. At the request of the Belgian Privacy Commission, ICRI/CIR (KU Leuven), in cooperation with iMinds-SMIT (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) conducted an extensive analysis of Facebook\u2019s revised policies and terms.\u201d So, you can see that there is great concern on behalf of some European governments and their commissions , the Belgian Privacy Commission) to shed light to the privacy and freedom concerns of Facebook.\n\nWhat seems to raise suspicions and a great deal of concern about the rights of Facebook and its extensive data process is the fact that there are some policies that are of questionable legality within the European Union (EU) and the respective legislation. To be more specific:\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s data processing capabilities have increased both horizontally and vertically. By horizontal we refer to the increase of data gathered from different sources. Vertical refers to the deeper and more detailed view Facebook has on its users.\u201d\n\nThis has been a result of the cooperation of Facebook with some other companies and services, such as Instagram or Whatsapp. Due to the purchase of these services by Facebook and due to the acknowledgement that a lot of plugins are used by them, it makes total sense why Facebook feels that it is high time it backed its legal rights up properly.\n\nAccording to the report, there are problems and potential red flags with the Unfair Contract Terms Directive. This Directive \u201cintroduces a notion of \u201cgood faith\u201d in order to prevent significant imbalances in the rights and obligations of consumers on the one hand and sellers and suppliers on the other hand.\u201d\n\nSo, you can see that there are several points that need to be discussed further towards outlining the vulnerabilities of the privacy policy of Facebook. It is crucial that all the users are thoroughly informed on what they agree to upon subscribing to Facebook.\n\nThis can result in a much better handling of their privacy as a whole. So, reports like the one that we have referred to here are certainly moving towards the desired direction.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some voice commands may be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to a third-party service that converts speech to text or to the extent necessary to provide the Voice Recognition features to you.

We have discussed several times about the difficulty to preserve or anonymity online, even a new study explains that three small credit card transactions could reveal our identity.\n\nThe study published in the journal Science confirms that by analyzing just three pieces of information per person, that could be three minor transactions for a pizza, a coff\u00e8 and a bottle of water, it possible de-anonymize cardholders.\n\n\u201cJust knowing an individual\u2019s location on four occasions was enough to fingerprint 90% of the spenders. And knowing the amount spent on those occasions\u2014the equivalent of a few receipts from someone\u2019s trash\u2014made it possible to de-anonymize nearly everyone and trace their entire transaction history with just three pieces of information per person.\u201d reads the study.\n\nThe findings confirm that a small set of credit card metadata could allow an attacker to uniquely identify an individual.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a few data points are enough to uniquely identify an individual was true in credit card metadata,\u201d explained Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye,  which is a co-author of the study\u2019.\n\nMontjoye was known to the scientific community for a study conducted in 2013 that analyzed fifteen months of human mobility data for 1.5 million individuals to demonstrate that human mobility traces are highly unique.\n\nThe research on mobility showed that four data points, for example geographic location and time, were enough to identify a person from lard data set of mobile phone records in 95 percent of the time.\n\nThis time, the team of researchers has analyzed credit card transactions provided by an unnamed major bank, the data are related to transactions of 1.1 million people in some 10,000 stores over a three-month period.\n\nThe researchers were evaluating how much data they needed to identify a person\u2019s transactions from a larger data set of transaction metadata that of course not include personal information (i.e. names, addresses, email addresses and other info). They didn\u2019t try to actually identify a specific individual, but instead to quantify the mount of data necessary to link transactions to a person.\n\n\u201cWe did not try to find a specific person on purpose,\u201d Montjoye said.\n\nThe experts verified that by knowing an individual\u2019s location and four transactions was enough to fingerprint 90% of the spenders, and just adding price information (i.e. purchase receipts) allowed them to identify a specific individual with just three transactions.\n\nResearchers could also identify individuals from \u201cone receipt, one Instagram photo of you having coffee with friends, and one tweet about the phone you just bought,\u201d they explained. \u201cThe fundamental scientific question is one of our human behavior,\u201d de Montjoye said. \u201cIt\u2019s really how our behavior compares with that of others and eventually makes us unique and identifiable.\u201d\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t try to actually identify particular individuals, but instead to figure out on average how much data would be needed to narrow transactions down to a person.\n\n\n\nIn the last years, we are a long debated on the right to anonymity and about mass surveillance operated by governments that in some cases defended their operations sustaining that they were collecting only metadata.\n\nThis research demonstrates that removing names and email addresses from the records is not enough to protect how anonymity, and Intelligence Agencies know this!\n\n\u201cWhat our study shows is that this is not enough to prevent identification,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only way to protect user\u2019s identity from prying eyes is to adopt data that must be \u201cprovably\u201d anonymous, and make it impossible to de-anonymize individuals.\n\nVerifying which conditions could ensure that data could not be linked to a user\u2019s identity is very difficult as explained by de Montjoye, people should be aware of the potential risks of identification.\n\n\u201cOne way to protect against correlation attacks is to blur the data by binning certain variables. For example, rather than revealing the exact day or price of a transaction, the public version of the data set might reveal only the week in which it occurred or a price range within which it fell. Binning did not thwart de Montjoye\u2018s correlation attack; instead, it only increased the amount of information needed to de-anonymize each person to the equivalent of a dozen receipts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to be 100 percent safe, but there are steps that can be taken,\u201d Montjoye said.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  anonymity, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/card-transactions", "topic_name": "card transactions"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-identy", "topic_name": "digital identy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/identity", "topic_name": "identity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/metadata", "topic_name": "metadata"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Mozilla continues the phasing out of 1024-bit SSL CA certificates", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/32902/digital-id/mozilla-phasing-out-1024ca-certificates.html", "title": "Mozilla continues the phasing out of 1024-bit SSL CA certificates\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 30, 2015", "body": "Mozilla products including the popular Firefox browser will stop trusting SSL certificates that were issued using old root CA certificates with 1024-bit RSA keys.\n\nWhen a user access to a website it presents its SSL certificate that is verified on the client side by browser by using the above CA digital certificates.\n\nFollowing the exclusion of the CA certificates starting from Firefox 36, the company and its products will no longer trust SSL certificates that chain back to the roots and users will present a message that inform them of an \u201cuntrusted connection error\u201d.\n\n\n\nMozilla has started the Phasing out Certificates with 1024-bit RSA Keys in September 2014, when the company excluded from the Firefox 32 CA certificates issued by EMC/RSA, Entrust, GoDaddy, NetLock, SECOM and Symantec / VeriSign.\n\n\u201cFor many years, Mozilla, NIST, the CA/Browser Forum, and others have been encouraging Certification Authorities (CAs) to upgrade their 1024-bit RSA keys to a stronger cryptographic algorithm (either longer RSA keys or ECDSA)\u201d states Mozilla in a previous post.  \u201cWe are actively working with CAs to retire SSL and Code Signing certificates that have 1024-bit RSA keys in an effort to make the upgrade as orderly as possible, and to avoid having system administrators find themselves in emergency mode because their SSL keys were compromised.\u201d\n\nMozilla plan to conclude the phasing out of CA certificates in the first half of 2015, it has announced the removal of two more Equifax root certificates owned by Symantec, one of which is still \u201cvery widely used.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Mozilla, CA certificates)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca-certificates", "topic_name": "CA certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/firefox", "topic_name": "Firefox"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mozilla", "topic_name": "Mozilla"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl", "topic_name": "SSL"}]}, {"news_name": "Insider Theft affects a tenth of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Clients", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/31915/digital-id/morgan-stanley-insider-theft.html", "title": "Insider Theft affects a tenth of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Clients\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 7, 2015", "body": "The financial services company Morgan Stanley has confirmed a partial client data leak, the incident was confirmed by the firm in a statement published on its website.

Since March 2013 Apple has progressively extended the two-step verification system to other countries and has introduced the feature to protect other services offered by the company, including the Apple iCloud for which the feature was added in September after the Fappening case. In September, the CEO Tim Cook announced the imminent implementation of a two-factor authentication mechanism to protect the access to the iCloud service from a mobile device that was effective with the iOS 8.0.\n\nThe login to iCloud service from iPhones and iPads will be allowed to users is possession of the couple Apple ID and password, plus the an authentication code sent to the device through SMS or generated at the time of sign-up. Tim Cook highlighted the great importance reserved by Apple to the user\u2019s privacy, confirming that the company will do even more to protect user\u2019s data.\n\nThe two-step verification system requires a user to provide the number of a second \u201ctrusted\u201d device that is used to verify the user\u2019s identity in addition to an extra security code called the \u201cRecovery Key\u201d. The reporter at The Next Web\u2019s Owen Williams explained that the Recovery Key mechanism could cause completely lock a person out of their Apple account if they\u2019re being hacked.\n\nWilliams discovered that someone had tried to hack his Apple iCloud account despite the Apple\u2019s two-step verification system. The mechanism correctly avoided the unauthorized access to the system and blocked the account, unfortunately, denying both the would-be hacker and Williams access it.\n\n\u201cEarlier this week, a strange message popped up on my Mac that I thought nothing of. \u201cYou can\u2019t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.\u201d I dismissed it in my tired haze, thinking it would solve itself and went to sleep.\u201d states the post on TheNextWeb.\n\n\n\nThe reporter then tried to recover the password with the Apple iForgot procedure. To unlock the account, it is requested to provide Recovery Key or the number of a trusted device as he was led to believe by an Apple Support document, but he was wrong.\n\n\u201cThe Apple support page relating to lockouts assured me it would be easy to recover my account with a combination of any two of either my password, a trusted device or the two-factor recovery key. When I headed to the account recovery service, dubbed iForgot, I discovered that there was no way back in without my recovery key. That\u2019s when it hit me; I had no idea where my recovery key was or if I\u2019d ever even put the piece of paper in a safe place. I\u2019ve moved since I set up two-factor on iCloud.\u201d states the post.\n\n\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, Williams was not able to retrieve a screenshot or a print copy of the Recovery Key he had taken for extra safekeeping, then he contacted the Apple customer support and was told  that there was no way Apple could help him despite he offered a scan of his government ID, his trusted devices and other proof that it was him.\n\nIn a second call, he made to the support he received the following reply:\n\n \u201cWe take your security very seriously at Apple\u201d she told me \u201cbut at this time we cannot grant you access back into your Apple account. We recommend you create a new Apple ID.\u201d\n\nAfter a couple more days of talking to Apple customer support, the reporter discovered that it was impossible to unlock the account without a Recovery Key even though Apple\u2019s support document explains that it is possible with a trusted device.\n\nWilliams shared with the web his experience, warning the reader on possible consequences in managing Apple Recovery Key for the two-step verification system. Williams explained that losing the recovery key could permanently lock a user out of their Apple ID with Apple unable to do anything to help.\n\n\u201cI know it was stupid that I\u2019d lost the recovery key but I\u2019d set it up so long ago I couldn\u2019t remember where it would conceivably be. There\u2019s only so many things I can keep track of.

The CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether or not the entity that is requesting the access to a resource is human. CAPTCHA systems are used to protect websites from spam bots and web crawlers.  Google, rather than have users authenticating to an online service try to decipher blurred text, has simplified the process by simply asking its users whether they are a bot agent. Just one click allows users to be authenticated the requested service.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn websites using this new API, a significant number of users will be able to securely and easily verify they\u2019re human without actually having to solve a CAPTCHA,\u201dproduct manager Vinay Shet said. \u201cInstead, with just a single click, they\u2019ll confirm they are not a robot.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the improvement of the reCAPTCHA authentication system was driven by the need to improve the efficiency of the process, according Google in fact, bots have a success rate close to 100 percent in solving traditional CAPTCHA challenges.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Google improved it reCAPTCHA process introducing an approach based on a risk analysis of the user as explained by the company:\n\n\u201cA few months ago, we announced an improved version of reCAPTCHA that uses advanced risk analysis techniques to distinguish humans from machines. This enabled us to relax the text distortions and show our users CAPTCHAs that adapt to their risk profiles. In other words, with a high likelihood, our valid human users would see CAPTCHAs that they would find easy to solve. Abusive traffic, on the other hand, would get CAPTCHAs designed to stop them in their tracks.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the complexity of the challenge proposed to the user linked to the likelihood that a human is trying to be authenticated to a service. Google applied a similar algorithm to audio CAPTCHAs based on the risk reputation of the user. When the new reCAPTCHA process will not be able to evaluate the risk associated with the user, Google will continue to display a classic CAPTCHA image to solve. To improve the authentication experience of the mobile users, Google may present with a challenge image, and a grid of nine images and asks to select all those that match.\n\n\u201cThe new API is the next step in this steady evolution,\u201d Shet added. \u201cNow, humans can just check the box and in most cases, they\u2019re through the challenge.\u201d\n\nShet also commented the adoption of the new CAPTCHA made by some users in the last week revealing that it was a very positive experience in term of performance.\n\n\u201cFor example, in the last week, more than 60% of WordPress\u2019 traffic and more than 80% of Humble Bundle\u2019s traffic on reCAPTCHA encountered the No CAPTCHA experience\u2014users got to these sites faster,\u201d Shet said. \u201cHumans, we\u2019ll continue our work to keep the Internet safe and easy to use. Abusive bots and scripts, it\u2019ll only get worse\u2014sorry we\u2019re (still) not sorry.\u201d\n\nGoogle confirmed that Snapchat, WordPress and Humble Bundle have already adopters the noCAPTCHA API.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Google, reCAPTCHA)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/recaptcha", "topic_name": "reCAPTCHA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/web-crawler", "topic_name": "web crawler"}]}, {"news_name": "The Twitter App Graph feature will track users mobile apps for commercial purposes", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30585/digital-id/twitter-app-graph.html", "title": "The Twitter App Graph feature will track users mobile apps for commercial purposes\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 28, 2014", "body": "Twitter has recently updated the mobile app for  iOS platform, adding the \u201capp graph\u201d feature, meanwhile the Android version will be issued the next week.\n\nUsing Twitter for iOS:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Twitter App graph, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-apps", "topic_name": "mobile apps"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/twitter", "topic_name": "Twitter"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/twitter-app-graph", "topic_name": "Twitter App graph"}]}, {"news_name": "Detekt is the free tool to detect state spyware on phones and PCs", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30363/digital-id/detekt-detect-state-spyware.html", "title": "Detekt is the free tool to detect state spyware on phones and PCs\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 20, 2014", "body": "A group of security and technology experts that fight for the respect of human rights experts have launched a new tool dubbed Detekt that allow the detection of the government surveillance malware on mobile devices and PCs.

The Spyfiles that WikiLeaks released in 2012 showed the extent of the surveillance market, its worth (more than 5 billion dollars) and the sophistication of its products.\u201d report states.\n\nWe must distinguish surveillance technology widely available on the internet from advanced technologies developed by private firms for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, both cases poses a serious menace to individuals living  in countries that persistently commit human rights violations. The sale of these solutions must be regulated, the alliance invites an international call for action from national governments and regional institutions to avoid the abuse of the technologies.\n\n\u201cGovernments need to begin regulating this trade by updating export laws, to encourage moral responsibility amongst private companies and to prevent their technologies from empowering dictatorships and oppressive regimes with powerful surveillance systems.\u201d is reported in the website of the Coalition Against Unlawful Surveillance Exports.\n\nAmnesty will promote Detekt among their activists around the world, let me remind you that the software is free and open-source.\n\n\u201cDetekt is a great tool which can help activists stay safe but ultimately the only way to prevent these technologies from being used to violate or abuse human rights is to establish and enforce strict controls on their use and trade.\u201d said Marczynski.  \u201cIt represents a strike back against governments who are using information obtained through surveillance to arbitrarily detain, illegally arrest and even torture human rights defenders and journalists.\u201d\n\nAmnesty will promote the new software, which is free and open-source, among their activists around the world.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Detekt , government surveillance)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "NHS Trusts fail to Extend Outdated Windows XP Security Support with Microsoft", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30106/digital-id/nhs-fail-extend-windows-xp-support.html", "title": "NHS Trusts fail to Extend Outdated Windows XP Security Support with Microsoft\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 12, 2014", "body": "Hundreds of Thousands of Patient records lay vulnerable to cyberattacks after Trusts under the National Hospital Service failed to extend security support for outdated Windows XP. Trusts that are yet to upgrade to windows 7 or 8, risk attacks from hackers who reverse engineer security updates for the new OS to exploit vulnerability in unsupported Windows XP.\n\nCurrently, over 85% of NHS trusts run on outdated Windows XP with a majority of the trusts depending on a Microsoft patches and security updates for the outdated OS. Trusts were required to sign a Premier Services Agreement (PSA) with Microsoft in order to access periodic patches and security updates, but apparently 18 trusts failed to sign the pact.\n\nMicrosoft first signaled the end of commercial support for windows XP in 2007, with mainstream support ending in 2009 and extended security ending in April 2014. Governments and organization who were yet to upgrade to newer OS version were required to sign the PSA  agreement by 31st May 2014 for another extension period of one year.\n\n\u201cIf you have not migrated away from Windows XP, Security Patch downloads will only become available to organizations once you have put a Premier Services Agreement (PSA),\u201d read a warning letter sent NHS trust by the cabinet office earlier this year. \u201cIt is imperative that your organization clearly understands the risk that is placed on it should the decision be not to take out a PSA.\u201d\n\nTechnically, the end of commercial support for Windows XP means that Microsoft would stop releasing security patches and security updates for the operating system, meaning that security holes discovered past the support period go unattended.\n\nMicrosoft warned customers still on outdated XP that hackers would come gun blazing with all types of exploits after the end of commercial support. \u201cSince a security update will never become available for Windows XP to address these vulnerabilities, Windows XP will essentially have zero-day vulnerability forever,\u201d said Tim Rains, the director of Microsoft\u2019s Trustworthy Computing group.\n\n\n\nThe risks of running a non-supported operating system vary depending on the sensitivity of information on the network and more importantly on the quality of Technical expertise available to different organizations.\n\nThe \u201crisk may depend on how many non-upgraded machines are on the network, the effectiveness of perimeter defenses, the availability of suitable exploits to a potential attacker, and so on,\u201d said David Harley, a former NHS IT manager, currently working as a researcher at ESET security firm. \u201cAn internet connection on a machine that carries sensitive data itself, or allows access to it, is probably most at risk.\u201d\n\nEarlier this the year, the government signed a \u00a35.5 million deal with Microsoft to extend support for windows XP for organizations still running on the outdated OS. Apparently, public service organizations are yet to upgrade to newer Operating systems 8 months past the 12 month grace period extended by Microsoft.  Asked as to why the upgrade is yet to take off, the cabinet office said the process is \u201ccomplex and Costly\u201d adding that all public sector organizations will have upgraded by the April 2015 deadline.\n\nWritten by: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

The decision has raised several doubts for security and privacy issues, the policy chosen by Yahoo could expose users to the risk of for identity theft, let\u2019s imagine for example that a user share the same Yahoo email with other web services, the new owner of the account could impersonate the old one and request a password reset to gain access to all the services linked to that email (i.e. Facebook).\n\nFacebook confirmed that its concern about the security of its account linked to a recycled Yahoo account that could be taken over by a recycled Yahoo email address.\n\n\n\nYahoo and Facebook have worked together to overwhelm the problem, their engineers have developed an SMTP extension dubbed Require-Recipient-Valid-Since (RRVS) which inserts a timestamp in the header of an email message. The timestamp is used to indicate when Facebook last confirmed ownership of the Yahoo account.\n\n\u201cIf the account changed hands since our last confirmation, Yahoo can just drop the message, preventing delivery of sensitive messages to the wrong hands,\u201d explained Murray Kucherawy, a software engineer at Facebook.\n\nFacebook on Thursday announced the RRVS Request for Comments draft RFC7293 was approved as a Proposed Standard by the IETF.\n\n\u201cThe intended use of these facilities is on automatically generated messages, such as account statements or password-change instructions, that might contain sensitive information, though it may also be useful in other applications,\u201d states the draft.\n\nUsing the RRVS extension, the sender is able to discriminate the recipient at a certain point-in-time.\n\n\u201cA receiving system can compare this information against the point in time at which the address was assigned to its current user,\u201d the draft says. \u201cIf the assignment was made later than the point in time indicated in the message, there is a good chance the current user of the address is not the correct recipient.

Additionally, due to the POODLE attack, we have also disabled SSLv3 in this release.\u201d\n\nThe measure is necessary for an anonymizing tool like Tor to avoid that an attacker can spy on user\u2019s internet activity, even if carried out over SSL which is still supported by the majority of Internet users.\n\n\u201cThis vulnerability allows the plaintext of secure connections to be calculated by a network attacker,\u201d said the researcher Bodo M\u00f6ller at Google. \u201cIf a client and server both support a version of TLS, the security level offered by SSL 3.0 is still relevant since many clients implement a protocol downgrade dance to work around serve \u00adside interoperability bugs.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother important update is related to the mechanisms implemented to circumvent censorship, as explained in the release not the new version features the addition of three versions of the meek pluggable transport. A meek is a pluggable transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for obfuscation, technically the traffic is routed through a third-party server to circumvent censorship.\n\n\u201cMore importantly for censored users who were using 3.6, the 4.0 series also features the addition of three versions of the meek pluggable transport. In fact, we believe that both meek-amazon and meek-azure will work in China today, without the need to obtain bridge addresses. Note though that we still need to improve meek\u2019s performance to match other transports, though. so adjust your expectations accordingly.\u201d states the release note.\n\nThe new Tor Browser 4.0 also includes an in-browser updater and as announced by the developers of the project very soon the bundle will support both strong HTTPS site-specific certificate pinning (ticket #11955) and update package signatures (ticket #13379).\n\n\u201cThis release also features an in-browser updater, and a completely reorganized bundle directory structure to make this updater possible. This means that simply extracting a 4.0 Tor Browser over a 3.6.6 Tor Browser will not work,\u201d reads the blog post. \u201cPlease also be aware that the security of the updater depends on the specific CA that issued the www.torproject.org HTTPS certificate (Digicert), and so it still must be activated manually through the Help (\u201c?\u201d) \u201cabout browser\u201d menu option.\u201d\n\ndon\u2019t wast time Download Tor Browser 4.0.\n\nTor Browser 4.0 isn\u2019t the unique privacy tool updated during this period, a new version of live anonymizing distribution TAILS (VERSION 1.2) has been released.

Hashing algorithms are used to ensure the integrity of the certificate in the signing processes, a flawed algorithm could allow an attacker to forge fraudulent certificates.\n\nIn the past collision attacks against the MD5 hash algorithm allowed threat actors to obtain fraudulent certificates, security experts want to avoid similar problems for SHA-1.\n\nPrincipal vendors are working to phase out support for the SHA-1 hash algorithm which is vulnerable to collision attacks that will be soon possible, in 2012 experts demonstrated how breaking SHA1 is becoming feasible, in November 2013, Microsoft announced that they will phase out SHA1 certificates after 2016.\n\n\u201c. Collision attacks against SHA-1 are too affordable for us to consider it safe for the public web PKI. We can only expect that attacks will get cheaper.\u201d states Google in an official statement on the topic. SHA-1\u2019s use on the Internet has been deprecated since 2011, when the CA/Browser Forum, an industry group of leading web browsers and certificate authorities (CAs) working together to establish basic security requirements for SSL certificates, published their Baseline Requirements for SSL. These Requirements recommended that all CAs transition away from SHA-1 as soon as possible, and followed similar events in other industries and sectors, such as NIST deprecating SHA-1 for government use in 2010.\n\nTo have an idea of the impact for the deprecation of SHA-1 let\u2019s analyze the data provided by the SSL Pulse which confirms that only 14,8 % sites use SHA256 certificates in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\u201cA collision attack is therefore well within the range of what an organized crime syndicate can practically budget by 2018, and a university research project by 2021.\u201d said the expert Bruce Schneier.\n\nThe decision of Microsoft is shared among other IT giants, like Mozilla and Google, the popular search engine, for example, will penalize websites that use SHA1 certificates that expire during 2016 and after.\n\nCertification Authorities (CAs) and Web site administrators have to upgrade their digital certificates to use signature algorithms different from SHA-1, valid alternatives could be SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.\n\n\u201cSites with end-entity certificates that expire between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 (inclusive), and which include a SHA-1-based signature as part of the certificate chain, will be treated as \u201csecure, but with minor errors\u201d.  Sites with end-entity certificates that expire on or after 1 January 2017, and which include a SHA-1-based signature as part of the certificate chain, will be treated as \u201caffirmatively insecure\u201d. Sub resources from such domain will be treated as \u201cactive mixed content\u201d. The current visual display for \u201caffirmatively insecure\u201d is a lock with a red X, and a red strike-through text treatment in the URL scheme.\u201d states the blog post published by Google titled \u201cGradually sunsetting SHA-1\u201c.\n\nMozilla has aligned its position on the acceptance for SHA-1 based certificates,  the company should not be issued after January 1, 2016, or trusted after January 1, 2017. The section 8 of the Mozilla\u2019s CA Certificate Maintenance Policy states:\n\n\u201cWe consider the following algorithms and key sizes to be acceptable and supported in Mozilla products: SHA-1 (until a practical collision attack against SHA-1 certificates is imminent) \u2026\u201d NIST Guidance recommended that SHA-1 certificates should not be trusted beyond 2014. However, there are still many Web sites that are using SSL certificates with SHA-1 based signatures, so we agree with the positions of Microsoft and Google that SHA-1 certificates should not be issued after January 1, 2016, or trusted after January 1, 2017. In particular, CAs should not be issuing new SHA-1 certificates for SSL and Code Signing, and should be migrating their customers off of SHA-1 intermediate and end-entity certificates. If a CA still needs to issue SHA-1 certificates for compatibility reasons, then those SHA-1 certificates should expire before January 2017.

As explained in a blog post published by Wired, through the forum are offered many applications for iCloud \u201cripping,\u201d or downloading the entire contents of an account.\n\n\u201cRipping right now! Send email with Apple ID and Password and I will have it ripping ASAP. Will keep everything private!\u201d report one posting on Anon-IB.\n\nOne of the software most debated is Elcomsoft Phone Password Breaker (EPPB ) which allows an attacker to download data from iCloud backups. As explained by the Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov, the software is a forensic tool sold to government agencies for legitimate uses, but the company doesn\u2019t exclude that copies has been offered for sale in the underground.\n\nA few hours after the data leakage, on the GitHub online repository was published a Python script that could be used to \u201cbrute force\u201d an Apple iCloud account\u2019s password, exploiting the vulnerability in the Find My iPhone service. An attacker could use the script to repeatedly guess passwords in an attempt to discover the right one. Combining the use of the tool with the EPPB application anyone can impersonate an iCloud user and download its full backup, and this is probably what has happened in the case of the celebrities naked pictures.\n\n\n\nEPPB doesn\u2019t exploit flaws in Apple services, the use of such tools once the account Apple ID and password have been compromised allows attacker to access data stored in the backup.

An SSL Certificate issued by trusted Certificate authorities is normally used to authenticate among users and visitors with its effective encrypted connections. The India CCA certificates are included in the Microsoft Root Store and thus are trusted by the vast majority of programs running on Windows OS. The worrying aspect of the alert launched by the Google is that the majority of western companies ordinarily uses intermediate Certificates issued by India CCA.\n\nGiving a look to the most popular web browsers it is possible to verify that Google Chrome and IE Explorer use the Microsoft Root Store while Firefox uses its own root store and for this reason in not affected in the specific case.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of any other root stores that include the India CCA certificates, thus Chrome on other operating systems, Chrome OS, Android, iOS and OS X are not affected. Additionally, Chrome on Windows would not have accepted the certificates for Google sites because of public-key pinning, although misissued certificates for other sites may exist. We promptly alerted NIC, India CCA and Microsoft about the incident, and we blocked the misissued certificates in Chrome with a CRLSet push.\u201d reported Adam Langley, Security Engineer at Google\n\nGoogle immediately informed the CCA, Microsoft and NIC on the use of unauthorized digital certificates while the India CCA is still investigating this incident.\n\n\u201cDue to security reasons NICCA is not issuing certificates as of now.

The Facebook experiment was carried out in 2012 and was related to the manipulation of content on users\u2019 newsfeeds to analyze the effect on the user\u2019s sentiment.\n\nThe Facebook experiment ran from January 11 to 18, 2012 during which the hundreds of thousands of Facebook users unknowingly participating may have felt either happier or more depressed than usual because they visualized the post of their friend.\n\nThe study was conducted in conjunction with researchers from the Cornell and the University of California, Facebook filtered users\u2019 news feeds composed by comments, videos, pictures and web links posted by other people in their social network in order to provide evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks.\n\n\u201cEmotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others.\u201d \u201cThree studies have laid the groundwork for testing these processes via Facebook, the largest online social network. This research demonstrated that (i) emotional contagion occurs via text-based computer-mediated communication; (ii) contagion of psychological and physiological qualities has been suggested based on correlational data for social networks generally; and (iii) people\u2019s emotional expressions on Facebook predict friends\u2019 emotional expressions, even days later (although some shared experiences may in fact last several days). To date, however, there is no experimental evidence that emotions or moods are contagious in the absence of direct interaction between experiencer and target.\u201d states the abstract of the project.\n\nThe Facebook experiment shows that emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, with this approach it is possible to induce same emotions without individual\u2019s awareness.\n\nOne of the tests conducted reduced users\u2019 exposure to their friends\u2019 \u201cpositive emotional content\u201d, resulting in fewer positive posts from the observed users. Another test reduced users\u2019 exposure to \u201cnegative emotional content\u201d and fewer negative posts was the result.\n\n\u201c\u201cWhen positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,\u201d \u201c\u201cThe fact that people were more emotionally positive in response to positive emotion updates from their friends stands in contrast to theories that suggest viewing positive posts by friends on Facebook may somehow affect us negatively,\u201d according to the paper\u201d states the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the Facebook experiment ethically correct?\n\nGiving a look to the Facebook\u2019s data use policy it is possible to note that the company informs its users that their \u2019 information will be used \u201cfor internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement,\u201d, in other words every user could be involved in a study like this one. \n\n\u201cThis research was conducted for a single week in 2012 and none of the data used was associated with a specific person\u2019s Facebook account,\u201d \u201cWe do research to improve our services and to make the content people see on Facebook as relevant and engaging as possible. A big part of this is understanding how people respond to different types of content, whether it\u2019s positive or negative in tone, news from friends, or information from pages they follow.

The unique protection mechanism implemented for the Outlook app is a PIN feature, but it is limited to the protection of the user interface and not the data stored on the file.\n\nThe Outlook.com mobile client app was developed by third-party app firm Seven Networks, researchers at Include Security discovered that it leaves email messages in the clear on the removable SD cards with obvious consequences for users\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cAnyone can grab that and walk away,\u201d said Erik Cabetas, managing director of Include Security.\n\nAndroid users in order to protect their data have to set up their mobile devices to encrypt the file system, unfortunately the number of users that enable encryption by default is limited. The Outlook.com app doesn\u2019t implement by default the data encryption.\n\n\n\n\u201cUsers need to be aware so they can encrypt the file system of the SC card. Android has native tools to do that\u2026 but it\u2019s a [multi-click] setting and most don\u2019t know how to do that.\u201d Cabetas added.\n\nThe PIN  feature is not enough to protect Outlook.com user data, an attacker could steal the SD card and access to files stored on the SD as explained by Cabetas:\n\n\u201cI could lock my phone with the PIN, but if someone gets the SD card, they still have all the data.\u201d\n\nThe risks for user privacy is high, any other application installed on the mobile device could have free access to the plain text data stored on the SD card by the Outlook application.\n\n\u201cAny app on the phone can read that\u201d information on the SD card. They don\u2019t need special permission. Phones nowadays come with preinstalled apps on them that could grab those emails.\u201d\n\nExperts at Include Security reported the flaw to Microsoft\u2019s Security Response Center, but the reply was not positive, Microsoft\u2019s response was that this is an issue related to the device itself and outside of their responsibility, let me add that this is absurd.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For people using the Outlook.com app for Android, applications run in sandboxes where the operating system protects customers\u2019 data. Additionally, customers who wish to encrypt their email can go through their phone settings and encrypt the SD card data. Please see Microsoft\u2019s online privacy policy for more information.\u201d said a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised by the discovery made by the Cabetas\u2019s team, unfortunately similar situations are very common for mobile apps like evidenced by a recent study conducted by experts at the HP Fortify, following the results of the analysis that confirm my declaration:\n\nCabetas suggested to Microsoft to at least advice users of the lack of encryption for data stored by the app on the device file system.\n\n\u201cAs part of the app installation, it should alert the user that \u2018We store emails to your local file system. Would you like to encrypt it? Yes or no.\u2019 Even if a software vendor doesn\u2019t feel directly responsible for worrying about the local file system encryption, at least it should inform the user.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, Outlook.com for Android could use third-party addons (such as SQLcipher) to encrypt the SQLite database in tandem with transmitting the attachments as opaque binary blobs to ensure that the attachments can only be read by the Outlook.com app (perhaps using the JOBB tool). These methods would be useful for older devices (such as devices that run Android 4.0 and earlier) that do not support full disk encryption. he added.\n\nLet me suggest you to use full disk encryption for Android and SD card file systems, and disable the feature  USB debugging that could be abused by attackers and malware to gain the control of the device.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Mobile, Outlook)  \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/app", "topic_name": "app"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/include-security", "topic_name": "Include Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/microsoft", "topic_name": "Microsoft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/outlook", "topic_name": "Outlook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Federal Trade Commission \u2013 Watch out to Health and Fitness Apps", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/24800/digital-id/federal-trade-commission-mobile-apps.html", "title": "Federal Trade Commission \u2013 Watch out to Health and Fitness Apps\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 10, 2014", "body": "The Federal Trade Commission has recently released the disconcerting results of a study conducted on 12 mobile health and fitness apps, focusing the analysis on the way they manage users\u2019 personal information.\n\nLet me anticipate that he mobile apps use to share users\u2019 personal data with 76 different third parties, if we consider that these applications are widely diffused we can imagine the effect on privacy and security.\n\nJah-Juin Ho, an attorney in the Federal Trade Commission \u2019s Mobile Technology Unit presented the results of the research on the privacy of consumer-generated health data  this week during a presentation at the  Federal Trade Commission led panel in Washington, D.C., he avoided naming any of the apps the FTC looked at.\n\n\n\nHo explained that third parties receive from the application several phone information screen size, device model, language setting) and a series of metrics and characteristics about their bodies.\n\n\u201cWho are these third parties and what kind of information are they receiving about our bodies?\u201d this is the question made by the attorney.\n\nPractically all the audited apps share the handset information with third parties, 18 of 76 entities collect information as Unique Device Identifier (UDID) for Apple devices, the device MAC address and International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI).\n\nBut private entities are mainly interested in users\u2019 habits, third party companies collect consumer information (e.g Sleeping patterns, cadence of how they walk or run, users\u2019 running routes, eating habits).

Once stolen the key a bad actor could easily impersonate the compromised site.\n\nAfter the disclosure of OpenSSL flaw, administrators of vulnerable servers have updated the OpenSSL library and generated a new certificate for their infrastructure (so a new public key), but as noted by the security researcher Adam Langley of Google, the old certificates still work allowing an attacker with the old private key to still impersonate the website.\n\n\n\nThe online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is the Internet protocol used for managing the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate, it is an alternative to certificate revocation lists (CRL). The messages communicated via OCSP are usually communicated over HTTP,  OCSP manages less information respect a typical CRL and this allow an optimized use of networks and client resources. Practically the OCSP protocol requires the client to contact a third party to confirm certificate validity.\n\nCommon browsers submit a request to the OCSP server to check the certificate status, they receive a signed assertion that tells them whether the certificate is still valid. In the case the browser for some reason doesn\u2019t get a response from the OCSP server, it has to decide whether to accept the certificate.\n\nLangley has written a specific post titled \u201cNo, don\u2019t enable revocation checking\u201d to analyze the large number of revocations resulting from precautionary rotations for servers affected by the heartbeat flaw.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about an attacker using a revoked certificate then the attacker first must be able to intercept your traffic to the site in question. (If they can\u2019t even intercept the traffic then you didn\u2019t need any authentication to protect it from them in the first place.) Most of the time, such an attacker is near you. For example, they might be running a fake WiFi access point, or maybe they\u2019re at an ISP. In these cases the important fact is that the attacker can intercept all your traffic, including OCSP traffic. Thus they can block OCSP lookups and soft-fail behaviour means that a revoked certificate will be accepted,\u201d Langley wrote.\n\nIn the post Langley proposed different scenarios in which revocations are useless and cannot prevent attacks, for example for offensives related to a nation-state attacker who is able to intercept the entire victim\u2019s traffic.\n\n\u201cFirstly, the attacker can use OCSP stapling to include the OCSP response with the revoked certificate. Because OCSP responses are generally valid for some number of days, they can store one from before the certificate was revoked and use it for as long as it\u2019s valid for. DNS hijackings are generally noticed and corrected faster than the OCSP response will expire.\u201d\n\nLangley explained the checking method implemented by Google Chrome that daily monitors the status of certificates for high-value sites and pushes the information to Chrome users, in this way a revocation is propagated within a day or so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the CRLSet and it\u2019s not complete, nor big enough to cope with large numbers of revocations, but it allows us to react quickly to situations like Diginotar and ANSSI. It\u2019s certainly not perfect, but it\u2019s more than many other browsers do,\u201d Langley wrote.\n\n\u201cA powerful attacker may be able to block a user from receiving CRLSet updates if they can intercept all of that user\u2019s traffic for long periods of time. But that\u2019s a pretty fundamental limit; we can only respond to any Chrome issue, including security bugs, by pushing updates.\u201d\n\nLangley is suggesting a scalable solution to the revocation problem in the form of short-lived certificates or something like OCSP Must Staple, limiting the validity of OCSP response in a few days.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Certificate revocation, HeartBleed)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2014-0160", "topic_name": "CVE-2014-0160"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificate", "topic_name": "Digital Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/heartbleed", "topic_name": "Heartbleed"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mandiant", "topic_name": "Mandiant"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ocsp", "topic_name": "OCSP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/side-channel-attack", "topic_name": "side-channel attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tls", "topic_name": "TLS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vpn", "topic_name": "VPN"}]}, {"news_name": "Google Chrome bug allows sites to listen users private conversations", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/21556/digital-id/google-chrome-bug-spy.html", "title": "Google Chrome bug allows sites to listen users private conversations\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 24, 2014", "body": "Google Chrome is one of the most diffused browsers, it has an excellent reputation in terms of security, usability and performance but it is wrong to consider it as perfect.\n\nAs any other software, also Google Chrome is affected by numerous flaws, more or less serious and in this post I will present a scary vulnerability that raises serious concerns regarding the user\u2019s privacy.\n\nGoogle Chrome implements a \u201cVoice Recognition\u201d feature that allows users to dictate text instead typing it, a user-friendly functionality that allow to perform web searches, to set reminders and quick conversions. The embarrassing problem is that the feature could be abused to spy on individuals.\n\n\n\nWeb developers Tal Ater discovered that the vulnerability in Google Chrome while he was working on Annyang, a tiny javascript library that lets website\u2019s visitors control a site with voice commands. The vulnerability that can be exploited and lets malicious websites use Google Chrome as a bug to spy on the surrounding environment, even after victims has left those sites.\n\nEvery time a user visits a website that allows speech recognition feature, Google Chrome asks permission to enable microphone. Once accepted the browsers displays an icon in the notification area to notify users of microphone status (turned-on/turned-off).\n\nThis feature could be easily abused to deceive users, it is enough that the malicious web site lets visitor to enable voice control for any legitimate purpose, while silently  open a pop-under window disguised as an ordinary ad, to keep the microphone turned on.\n\nThe web developer published also a video Proof of Concept on how to exploit the Google Chrome vulnerability.\n\nAs long as it remains open, the attacker is able to capture through the microphone every noise in the surrounding environment and update the recorded audio to a remote server in a stealthy way.\n\n\u201cMost sites using Speech Recognition, choose to use secure HTTPS connections. This doesn\u2019t mean the site is safe, just that the owner bought a $5 security certificate. When you grant an HTTPS site permission to use your mic, Chrome will remember your choice, and allow the site to start listening in the future, without asking for permission again.\u201d The behavior is quite similar also for HTTPS website as explained by Tal Atar in the blog post.\n\nTal Atar  reported the flaw to the Google security team in late September, 2013, they recognized the flaw, but Google never released a fix for its product, leaving users vulnerable and this is very worrying in my opinion.\n\nSeveral weeks passed after the notification of the bug to Google, a month and a half later the developer asked Google why the fix wasn\u2019t released. Their answer was that there was an ongoing discussion within the Standards group, to agree on the correct behavior.\n\n\u201cNothing is decided yet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredible that today the flaw is still in the popular browser, Google is still waiting for the Standards group to agree on the best course of action, but the web\u2019s standards organization, the W3C, has already defined the correct behavior which would\u2019ve prevented this (refer specification for the Web Speech API, released in October 2012).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve re-investigated and still believe there is no immediate threat, since a user must first enable speech recognition for each site that requests it. The feature is in compliance with the current W3C standard, and we continue to work on improvements.\u201d said a Google spokesperson after the public release of POC.\n\nIf you are interested in the exploit, its full code is available on GitHub.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Google Chrome, hacking)\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-theft", "topic_name": "Data theft"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google-chrome", "topic_name": "Google Chrome"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/voice-recognition", "topic_name": "Voice Recognition"}]}, {"news_name": "Weak passwords, in 2013 it is still a frequent error", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/21472/digital-id/weak-passwords-2013.html", "title": "Weak passwords, in 2013 it is still a frequent error\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 21, 2014", "body": "It was October 2012 when for the first time I\u2019ve seen a report from SpashData on most common passwords chosen by users to protect their account on various services.\n\nSplashData, which develops password management applications, has issued its Annual \u201c25 Worst Passwords of the Year\u201d enumerating the list of the most common password chosen by users.\n\n\n\nIf you are a hacker and need to brute force a login form, probably you can benefit from this reading, hack a password sometime could be very easy because the human factor.

Apple has no reason to do so. But what of intelligence agencies?\u201d they said.\n\nIt is clear the reference to the case PRISM and the revelation made by Snowden on the collaboration offered by Apple to NSA for surveillance activities. When the user sends a iMessage to someone, he takes the receiver\u2019s public key from Apple, and encrypts the message. Once the message is received by  recipient he is able to decrypt the message with his private key according classic asymmetric encryption scheme. Apple acts as a Certification Authority of any PKI architecture, public keys were managed on a server called ESS that could be not publicly inspected. The researchers created its own bogus Certification Authority and inserted its reference into the iPhone Keychain to be able to access to SSL encrypted traffic acting as a proxy. Cattiaux noted that Apple ID and password was being transmitted in clear text during iMessage transmission. Apple actually controls public key repository this means that it could perform a MITM to intercept users\u2019 messages.\n\n\n\nThey exploited the lack of mechanisms to tell devices to trust a given certificate,  for PUSH and iMessage servers, allowing a fake certificate authority to be added to the user Keychain.   \n\n\u201cFirstly, it means that Apple [and intelligence agencies] can replay our password using for instance our email on many websites. Secondly, it also means that anyone capable of adding a certificate and able to [proxy] the communications can get user\u2019s Apple ID and password, thus get access to include accounts, backups\u201d and app purchasing.\n\nThere is the concrete risks that enterprise IT managers when assigning Apple devices with mobile device management platforms could intercept sensitive Apple user account details including iCloud usernames and passwords.\n\n\u201cIf the device is connected to iPhone Configuration Utility, Apple\u2019s enterprise solution for management of iPhones, a trusted CA (Certificate Authority) is added. The consequence is that all subsequent certificates signed by that CA will be trusted to create the SSL communication. It means all companies using that are able to retrieve their employee\u2019s AppleID and password by simply [proxying] the SSL communication.\u201d\n\nI suggest to read the interesting analysis published in the blog post of the researchers.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Apple, Privacy, iMessage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/eavesdropping", "topic_name": "eavesdropping"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/imessage", "topic_name": "iMessage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ios-7", "topic_name": "iOS 7"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mitm", "topic_name": "MITM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/snowden", "topic_name": "Snowden"}]}, {"news_name": "Proxy.sh \u2013 Can you trust your VPN provider?

Attackers gained access to the networks of LexisNexis, that provides personal data of more than 500 million unique consumer identities.\n\nAnalyzing the networks, related activity and credentials used by SSNDOB administrators the security expert discovered that hackers manage a small but very potent botnet that\u2019s controlled at least five infected systems at different US-based consumer and business data aggregators, including  LexisNexis Inc.\n\n\u201cThe botnet\u2019s online dashboard for the LexisNexis systems shows that a tiny unauthorized program called \u201cnbc.exe\u201d was placed on the servers as far back as April 10, 2013, suggesting the intruders have had access to the company\u2019s internal networks for at least the past five months,\u201d \u201cThe program was designed to open an encrypted channel of communications from within LexisNexis\u2019s internal systems to the botnet controller on the public Internet.\u201d Krebs\u2019 report.\n\nA first analysis of bot agent detected on compromised servers reveals that attackers dedicated great effort to develop a code able to avoid detection by antivirus tools.

The Chaos Computer Club in Germany announced late Saturday to have successfully bypassed the biometric security on the Apple\u2019s Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using materials that can be found in almost every household, it seems that they made it by photographing an iPhone user\u2019s fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to verify the user\u2019s login credentials.\n\nThe hack is embarrassing, in recent days a series of bugs and security issues were found on the last version of the popular Apple OS, iOS 7, in particular the lockscreen features is affected by serious flaws.\n\nThe Apple TouchID it the technology developed by Apple to replace passcode on its mobile and help protect users\u2019 devices, it is based on a sensor placed under the home button and it is designed to substitute the four-digit passcode to unlock the handset and authorize iTunes Store purchases.\n\n\u201cYour fingerprint is one of the best passcodes in the world. It\u2019s always with you, and no two are exactly alike. Touch ID is a seamless way to use your fingerprint as a passcode. With just a touch of the Home button of your iPhone 5s, the Touch ID sensor quickly reads your fingerprint and automatically unlocks your phone. You can even use it to authorize purchases from the iTunes Store, App Store, and iBooks Store.\u201d advertise Apple.\n\nBut is it really so? Apple TouchID technology had caused a lot of controversy in recent days, according to some experts it is a threat to privacy being used to manage fingerprint users. The Snowden case and the revelations about the PRISM surveillance program brought down the confidence of users in companies that have been overwhelmed by the scandal, Apple included.\n\nNow the hackers at popular Chaos Computer Club have demonstrated the inadequacy of the proposed solution even in technical, the Apple TouchID could be avoided as they have written in a blog post:\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates \u2014 again \u2014 that fingerprint biometrics is unsuitable as access control method and should be avoided,\u201d the group wrote in a blog post detailing its bypass:\n\nFirst, the fingerprint of the enrolled user is photographed with 2400 dpi resolution. The resulting image is then cleaned up, inverted and laser printed with 1200 dpi onto transparent sheet with a thick toner setting. Finally, pink latex milk or white woodglue is smeared into the pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet. After it cures, the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet, breathed on to make it a tiny bit moist and then placed onto the sensor to unlock the phone. This process has been used with minor refinements and variations against the vast majority of fingerprint sensors on the market.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics,\u201d  \u201cIt is plain stupid to use something that you can\u00b4t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token.\u201d added CCC spokesperson Frank Rieger.\n\nAccording the hackers at the Chaos Computer Club the new Apple Touched sensor has just a higher resolution compared to the previous version, the hacker with nickname Starbug remarked that fingerprints should not be used to secure anything.\n\nFollowing a video posted on the hack:\n\n\n\n \n\nAt this point the only question to be clarified is if the hackers will claim to the bounty of more than $16,000 in cash offered to the first person to hack the Apple TouchID fingerprint sensor.\n\nIsTouchIDhackedyet.com is the brainchild of Nick DePetrillo, an independent security researcher whose last major public research was 2010\u2019s Carmen San Diego Project, it announced on its Web site that it was waiting for the group to upload video of the hack as proof of the hack.\n\nRewards include also a patent application from CipherLaw for the hack process, some Scotch, and a book of erotica.\n\nLesson learned \u2026 nothing is secure!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Apple TouchID, privacy, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple-touchid", "topic_name": "Apple TouchId"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/authentication", "topic_name": "authentication"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chaos-computer-club", "topic_name": "Chaos Computer Club"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Android wallet apps vulnerability could allow currency theft", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/17055/cyber-crime/android-wallet-apps-vulnerability-could-allow-currency-theft.html", "title": "Android wallet apps vulnerability could allow currency theft\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 13, 2013", "body": "Yesterday I\u2019ve written on RAT for Android today we will speak of a weakness in some Android wallet apps for the popular mobile operating system that exposes Bitcoin users to risk of theft.

Because the problem lies with Android itself, this problem will affect you if you have a wallet generated by any Android app. An incomplete list would be Bitcoin Wallet, blockchain.info wallet, BitcoinSpinner and Mycelium Wallet. Apps where you don\u2019t control the private keys at all are not affected. For example, exchange frontends like the Coinbase or Mt Gox apps are not impacted by this issue because the private keys are not generated on your Android phone.\u201d\n\nThe Android \u201cwallet\u201d apps vulnerability is related to OS\u2019s ability to generate sequences of secure random numbers to secure the wallet, practically Android\u2019s SecureRandom Java program sometimes repeats the number sequences instead to make unique.\n\nThe security issues is specific for Android OS and affect all Android wallet apps that devolve the generation of private keys to the user\u2019s mobile device, Coinbase or Mt Gox apps are not impacted because the keys are not generated on Android phone\n\n\n\nAll Android wallet apps vulnerable need to change keys, it is possible \u201cgenerating a new address with a repaired random number generator and then sending all the money in your wallet back to yourself\u201d.\n\nPrincipal Android wallet apps are in the process of updating to fix the bug:\n\nSecurity experts seem to be not surprised by the discovery, it is expected that similar flaws will be found in the next months in principal virtual currency scheme.\n\nSimilar flaws are intrinsic on the ability of computers to generate a real sequence of random numbers to protect data, if the mechanism fail someone could be able to predict them by dropping the entire security infrastructure based on the randomness of the keys.\n\nBut problem for virtual currency schema are not only of a technical nature, The New York Department of Financial Services has requested to about two dozen firms operating with Bitcoin to provide all necessary information on transactions to prevent money laundering  activities.\n\nDespite Bitcoin is the most popular virtual currencies the cybercrime underground has definitely nominated Perfect Money as its currency after the law enforcement shut down Liberty Reserve during the investigation on 6 billion digital money laundering operations.

The report estimates that many people today are arrested and tortured for providing news and information online, the countries considered \u201cEnemies of the Internet\u201d are  Syria, China, Iran, Bahrain, and Vietnam.\n\n\u201cOnline surveillance is a growing danger for journalists, bloggers, citizen-journalists and human rights defenders. The Spyfiles that WikiLeaks released in 2012 showed the extent of the surveillance market, its worth (more than 5 billion dollars) and the sophistication of its products.\u201d report states.\n\nChina has the most advanced censorship system, known as Great Firewall or Great Wall, but also Iran and Syria have acquired/implemented monitoring systems. Both nations addition to the availability of surveillance architecture, in many cases they have also used malware to track hacktivists and dissidents.\n\nIn this states the governments systematic apply online surveillance that results in serious human rights violations, the actions of authorities is invasive due to the frequent use of malicious code and cyber attacks against a restricted circle of individuals opposed to the regimes.\n\nWho armed the hand of the executioner?\n\nReporters at Without Borders hasn\u2019t compiled only a list of states considered likely to censorship but also public denounced five \u201cCorporate Enemies of the Internet,\u201d. The list include five private businesses that sell products used by authoritarian governments to commit violations of human rights and freedom of information.\n\nThe companies are Gamma, Trovicor, Hacking Team, Amesys and Blue Coat, the report uses words of condemnation for these businesses that it defines as \u201cdigital era mercenaries\u201d.\n\nThe companies are accused to essentially provide two types of corporate products for monitoring and espionage, architectures for large-scale monitoring of Internet and spyware and other kinds of tools for targeted and invasive surveillance.\n\nSophisticated malware designed and commercialized by Hacking Team and Gamma have been used by governments to spy on journalists and netizens, the malicious code is able to infect multi-platforms (e.g. desktop, mobile) and OSs, gathering remote control of victims machine and stealing documents and user\u2019s credentials.\n\nProducts such as FinSpy(Gamma) and DaVinci Code (Hacking Team) are infamous in the worldwide security community, Mikko Hypponen Chief Research Officer of F-Secure is one of the most popular voice that denounced the abused use of these applications.\n\nAgain, Trovicor\u2019s surveillance products have been deployed by Bahrain\u2019s royal family to spy on bloggers and journalists and arrest them, a quite similar situation is in Syria, Government of Damascus deployed a DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) produced by Blue Coat.\n\nAmesys company provided Eagle products that were found in the offices of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s secret police.\n\nThe report commented the event with following statemens:\n\n\u201cTheir products have been or are being used to commit violations of human rights and freedom of information. If these companies decided to sell to authoritarian regimes, they must have known that their products could be used to spy on journalists, dissidents and netizens. If their digital surveillance products were sold to an authoritarian regime by an intermediary without their knowledge, their failure to keep track of the exports of their own software means they did not care if their technology was misused and did not care about the vulnerability of those who defend human rights.\u201d\n\nReporters Without Borders calls for the introduction of controls on the commercialization of surveillance software and architectures to governments that persecute dissidents violating fundamental rights, it\u2019s necessary a  prompt action of Legislators.\n\n\u201cThe European Union and the United States have already banned the export of surveillance technology to Iran and Syria. This praiseworthy initiative should not be an isolated one.

He documented the discovery in a first blog post and finally published the result of his research in another post having an eloquent title \u201cNokia\u2019s MITM on HTTPS traffic from their phone\u201d\n\n\n\nObviously Nokia has immediately tried to reassure its clients, Nokia says that there is nothing to worry about.\n\n\u201cWe take the privacy and security of our consumers and their data very seriously. The proxy servers do not store the content of web pages visited by our users or any information they enter into them. Nokia has implemented appropriate organizational and technical measures to prevent access to private information. Claims that we would access complete unencrypted information are inaccurate.\u201d\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the researcher:\n\n\u201cFrom the tests that were preformed, it is evident that Nokia is performing Man In The Middle Attack for sensitive HTTPS traffic originated from their phone and hence they do have access to clear text information which could include user credentials to various sites such as social networking, banking, credit card information or anything that is sensitive in nature. In short, be it HTTP or HTTPS site when browsed through the phone in subject, Nokia has complete information unencrypted (in clear text format) available to them for them to use or abuse. Up on checking privacy statement in Nokia\u2019s website following can be found.\u201d\n\nThe research on  January 11th,2013 provided a further update that showed a meaningful change in the behavior of his device after an update:\n\nUpdate of 11th January,2013\n\nJust upgraded my Nokia browser, the version now is 2.3.0.0.48, and as expected there is a change in HTTPS behaviour. There is a good news and a bad news. The good news is with this browser,they are no more doing Man-In-The-Middle attack on HTTPS traffic, which was originally the issue, and the bad news is the traffic is still flowing through their servers. This time they are tunneling HTTPS traffic over HTTP connection to their server. Details are given below.\n\nThis time again we had browsed https://www.google.com, and found that again DNS requests are sent for Nokia/Ovi servers and this time it was \u201ccloud13.xpress.nokia.com\u201d. Up on receiving DNS reply, a HTTP tunnel is eshtablished between Mobile device and their cloud server and HTTPS traffic is tunneled over that HTTP tunnel.\n\nHe also thanks Nokia officials for quickly responding to the issue and \u201cgetting it fixed on priority\u201d showing company commitment towards privacy of their mobile customers.\n\nThe case fell silent and the approach of the researcher has changed, but what happened is very serious and  raise some questions\n\nExactly one year ago Nokia was cited,  with RIM and Apple, to have provided to the Indian government, particularly its militia, a backdoor that provides the ability to control each mobile device.\n\nThere were found some Indian Military internal documents that refer to a project called RINOA SUR, where the world RINOA stay for RIM, Nokia and Apple. The project is related to a platform used to spy on the USCC\u2014the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nThe documents contain portions of emails sent by members of the USCC regarding the successfully usage of the RINOA SUR, and the Indian Navy has shown interest in the same. The documents suggest that RIM, NOKIA and Apple were required to providing backdoor access.\n\nAt this point I think they are justifiable concerns of users, Governments are increasing the level of monitoring and more transparence on their operate is desirable. Whatever the reasons behind the choice of solution implemented by Nokia it is essential that users of its mobile devices are made aware of potential effects and consequences in terms of security.\n\nWhat would happen if a group of state-sponsored hackers or hacktivists compromise Nokia servers? Do you think it is so absurd?\n\nI leave you with an extract of the privacy policy for browser published by Nokia:\n\n\u201cThe URLs of such sites which you access with the Nokia Browser are stored by Nokia.\u201d However, it does point out that: \u201cYour browsing is not associated to any personally identifiable information and we do not collect any usernames or passwords or any related information on your purchase transactions, such as your credit card number during your browsing sessions.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-middle", "topic_name": "man-in-the-middle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-device", "topic_name": "mobile device"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nokia", "topic_name": "Nokia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Turkey \u2013 Another story on use of fraudulent digital certificates", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11512/cyber-crime/turkey-another-story-on-use-of-fraudulent-digital-certificates.html", "title": "Turkey \u2013 Another story on use of fraudulent digital certificates\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 4, 2013", "body": "It\u2019s the news of the day, a fraudulent digital certificate that could be used for active phishing attacks against Google\u2019s web properties. Using the certificate it is possible to spoof content in a classic phishing schema or perform a man-in-the-middle attack according Google Chrome Security Team and Microsoft experts.\n\nMicrosoft has been immediately started the procedure to update its Certificate Trust list (CTL) and all versions of its OSs to revoke the certificate. Microsoft has also decided to revoke other two certificates for the same reason, it seems that some attacks using the first certificate have been already detected, fraudulent digital certificate that was mistakenly issued by a domain registrar run by a Turkish domain registrar.\n\nMicrosoft has issued a security advisory \u201cMicrosoft Security Advisory (2798897) \u2013 Fraudulent Digital Certificates Could Allow Spoofing\u201d that states:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is aware of active attacks using one fraudulent digital certificate issued by TURKTRUST Inc., which is a CA present in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities Store. This fraudulent certificate could be used to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. This issue affects all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.\n\nTURKTRUST Inc. incorrectly created two subsidiary CAs (*.EGO.GOV.TR and e-islem.kktcmerkezbankasi.org). The *.EGO.GOV.TR subsidiary CA was then used to issue a fraudulent digital certificate to *.google.com. This fraudulent certificate could be used to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks against several Google web properties.\n\nTo help protect customers from the fraudulent use of this digital certificate, Microsoft is updating the Certificate Trust list (CTL) and is providing an update for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows that removes the trust of certificates that are causing this issue.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still unknown which is the real target of attack neither their geographic distribution, Microsoft advisory refers the domain kktcmerkezbankasi.org a web site that presents itself as the Central Bank of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).\n\n\n\n \n\nGoogle On-Line Security Blog published a blog post that reported that on Dec. 24, 2012, its Chrome Web browser detected and blocked an unauthorized digital certificate for the \u201c*.google.com\u201d domain.

Intermediate CA certificates carry the full authority of the CA, so anyone who has one can use it to create a certificate for any website they wish to impersonate.\nIn response, we updated Chrome\u2019s certificate revocation metadata on December 25 to block that intermediate CA, and then alerted TURKTRUST and other browser vendors. TURKTRUST told us that based on our information, they discovered that in August 2011 they had mistakenly issued two intermediate CA certificates to organizations that should have instead received regular SSL certificates.\u201d\n\nAlso the authors of Mozilla browser have published a blog post informing on revoking of fraudulent certificates, interesting the description of the possible impact provided:\n\n\u201cAn intermediate certificate that is used for MITM allows the holder of the certificate to decrypt and monitor communication within their network between the user and any website. Additionally, If the private key to one of the mis-issued intermediate certificates was compromised, then an attacker could use it to create SSL certificates containing domain names or IP addresses that the certificate holder does not legitimately own or control. An attacker armed with a fraudulent SSL certificate and an ability to control their victim\u2019s network could impersonate websites in a way that would be undetectable to most users. Such certificates could deceive users into trusting websites appearing to originate from the domain owners, but actually containing malicious content or software.\u201d\n\nIn a blog post published a In 2011 I explained which is the usefulness to steal a CA certificate:\n\nThe security repercussions are very critical, any attacker with the possibility to sign using a certificate of a CA can sign certificates for any domain. In the past we have already observed similar incidents, such as the case of Diginotar CA, learning how much dangerous is the impairment of a CA.\n\nWho will be next?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n2013/04/01 UPDATE\n\nPUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT  \u2013 Turktrust\n\n11:40 GMT+2, January 04, 2012\n\n TURKTRUST has been delivering SSL certificate services since 2005 and is the first and soul local establishment that has certified its SSL certificate services in compliance with the \u201cETSI TS 102 042 CA Management System Standard\u201d on December 20, 2011.\n\nTURKTRUST is also the only Turkish establishment that has entered the trusted root certificate list of many internet browsers and mobile device manufacturers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Apple Safari, and RIM.\n\nBefore \u201cETSI TS 102 042 CA Management System Standard\u201d certification took place, our systems were subject to upgrades and improvements between May-November 2011. In the course of this process, two faulty SSL certificates in the same production package were issued due to a defective data migration and software upgrade process. Upon the notification of the Internet browsers on December 26, 2012, one of the faulty certificates, that had been valid by then, was immediately revoked. All our systems were explored in depth and the root cause of the problem was identified. The data revealed that the instance was unique, and restricted only to this case. There is also no evidence of any attack or hacking attempt on our systems, as well as no implication of any malicious usage.\n\nSince December 2011, the strong and trustworthy infrastructure of TURKTRUST, which has been certified in compliance with the international standards, certainly ensures preventing any kind of similar events. TURKTRUST sustains with absolute determination to serve as a prominent worldwide CA.\n\nHere and thereafter, invaluable support and kindness of our customers shall remain to be our most valuable asset.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nTURKTRUST Inc.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-middle", "topic_name": "man-in-the-middle"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}]}, {"news_name": "Adobe Code Signing Certificate used to sign malware, who to blame?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/9020/digital-id/adobe-code-signing-certificate-used-to-sign-malware-who-to-blame.html", "title": "Adobe Code Signing Certificate used to sign malware, who to blame?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 30, 2012", "body": "It\u2019s happened again, cyber criminals have stolen digital certificates related to companies recognized reliable to sign malicious code.\n\nThis time the victim is Adobe and according its security chief, Brad Arkin, a group of hackers have signed malware using Adobe digital certificate obtained compromising a vulnerable build server that was used to get code validation from the company\u2019s code-signing system.\n\nThe company advisory wrote by Arkin states:\n\n\u201cWe have identified a compromised build server with access to the Adobe code signing infrastructure. We are proceeding with plans to revoke the certificate and publish updates for existing Adobe software signed using the impacted certificate,\u201d This only affects the Adobe software signed with the impacted certificate that runs on the Windows platform and three Adobe AIR applications* that run on both Windows and Macintosh. The revocation does not impact any other Adobe software for Macintosh or other platforms.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cOur forensic investigation is ongoing. To date we have identified malware on the build server and the likely mechanism used to first gain access to the build server. We also have forensic evidence linking the build server to the signing of the malicious utilities. We can confirm that the private key required for generating valid digital signatures was not extracted from the HSM.\u201d\n\nThe hackers have signed with a valid and legitimate Adobe certificate at least a couple of malicious utilities, a password dumper and a malicious ISAPI filter, the two malicious programs were signed on July 26 of this year.\n\nThe three affected applications are Adobe Muse, Adobe Story AIR applications, and Acrobat.com desktop services.\n\nThe Adobe firm has decided to revoke the certificate to issue new ones for legitimate Adobe products also signed with the stolen certificate after July 10, 2012. We must consider that despite an illegitimate use of the certificate, any code and document signed before the revocation date is considerable as valid.\n\nAn Adobe spokeswoman on the incident stated that the certificate was not actually stolen:\n\n\u201cAdobe has stringent security measures in place to protect its code signing infrastructure. The private keys associated with the Adobe code signing certificates were stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) kept in physically secure facilities. We confirmed that the private key associated with the Adobe code signing certificate was not extracted from the HSM.\u201d\n\nActually it\u2019s not clear when the breach occurred, the company has discovered that it was re-issuing certificates for code that was signed with the compromised signing key after July 10, 2012, that means that the hackers  have been using these files for about three months.\n\nIt is believed the attackers were planning to use them in a large scale attack due the nature of the signed applications.\n\nEvents like this raise concerns on the security level of producer source code and on the chain of trust managed to guarantee on code authenticity. The main problem is how many Adobe\u2019s software were signed by the build server?\n\nAdobe did not identify the product exactly but declared that it isn\u2019t one of the most popular Adobe Reader, Flash Player, Shockwave Player or Adobe AIR.\n\nSome of the principal security firms have already released detection tools to detect the malware signed with Adobe certificate, Sophos for example has released a tool that identify them as Troj/HkCert-A.\n\nLast year was a terrible year for the certification authorities, the number of successful attacks against some major companies reported was really high and totally out of any prediction. Many attacks have had disturbing consequences and it all began, or so we were led to believe, with the case Comodo.\n\nThen came other illustrious victims, like DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority owned by VASCO Data Security International. On September 3, 2011, after it had become clear that a security breach had resulted in the fraudulent issuing of certificates, the Dutch government took over operational management of DigiNotar\u2019s systems.Few weeks later the company was declared bankrupt.\n\nThe list is very long \u2026\n\nWhy steal a CA certificate? \n\nMalware production \u2013 Installation for certain types of software could needs that its code is digitally signed with a trusted certificate. By stealing the certificate of a trusted vendor reduces the possibility that the malicious software being detected as quickly. That is exactly what happened for Stuxnet virus.\n\nEconomic Frauds \u2013 digital signature give a warranty on who signed a document and user can decide if trust the person or company who signed the file and if trust the organization who issued the certificate. If a digital certificate is stolen we will suffer of an identity theft with serious consequences.\n\nSome bot, like happened in the case of Zeus banking malware, could be deployed to steal site certificates so that they can fool web browsers into thinking that a phishing site is a legitimate bank web site.\n\nCyber warfare operations\u2013 Criminals or governments could use the stolen certificates to conduct \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attacks, tricking users into thinking they were at a legitimate site when in fact their communications were being secretly tampered and intercepted. That is for example what occurred in the DigiNota case \u2026 companies like Facebook, Google and also agencies like CIA, MI6 were targeted in Dutch government certificate hack.\n\nPersonally I believe that the attack has with primary purpose the cyber espionage and it is high probably that we are facing with state-sponsored hackers that since now have had the opportunity to spread malicious code recognized as legitimate.\n\nFor information the certificate revocation will affect the following certificate:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe", "topic_name": "Adobe"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificates", "topic_name": "digital certificates"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-signature", "topic_name": "Digital signature"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyberoam DPI vulnerability scares Tor", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7160/digital-id/cyberoam-dpi-vulnerability-scares-tor.html", "title": "Cyberoam DPI vulnerability scares Tor\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 9, 2012", "body": "Last week, on blog.torproject.org was published the news relative to a security vulnerability found in Cyberoam DPI devices (CVE-2012-3372). All is started when a user in Jordan reported seeing a fake certificate to torproject.org.\n\nThe certificate was issued by Cyberoam companies and the researchers of the Tor project believed that the CA has been tricked  such as famous predecessors Comodo, Diginotar. The user not reported problems during its ordinary navigation, he was able to browse web site such as Twitter, Facebook and Gmail, this scenario suggests we are facing with a targeted attack to trick Cyberoam to issue fake certificate for torproject.org website.\n\n\n\nWho is Cyberoam and  which are its products?\n\nCyberoam UTM is a network security solution appliance vendor. But the company also provides a range of devices used for Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), probably the user\u2019s connection was intercepted by one of their devices.\n\nDuring the investigation the experts of torproject.org found a vulnerability in Cyberoam DPI devices, they discovered that all Cyberoam DPI devices share the same digital certificate.\n\nThis means that the private key is the same for every device, the implications, if confirmed, are serious, in fact it could be possible to intercept traffic from any victim of a Cyberoam device extracting the key from the device and import it into other DPI devices to use for the interception or simply using another Cyberoam DPI.\n\nThe torproject.org researchers have immediately tried to contact the Cyberoam firm and they have also notified the vulnerability to browser vendors asking them to blacklist the Cyberoam CA certificate in their browsers.\n\nWaiting for the reply of the security firm the experts of torproject.org have published in their blog the following info.\n\n\u201cThe Cyberoam CA certificate is not trusted, and so browsers will show users a warning (unless someone has already installed the certificate). Users with the Tor Browser Bundle are not affected.\u201d\n\nCyberoam has responded that its security devices open up traffic to inspection by third-parties, it also added in an official communicate that the devices implements tamper-protection measures meant it was not possible to export cryptographic keys from them.\n\n\u201cCyberoam\u2019s private keys cannot be extracted even upon dissecting the box or cloning its hardware and software. This annuls any possibility of tampering with the existing certificates on appliance,\u201d the firm explained.\n\nObviously Cyberoam reiterated the purpose of the https deep scan inspection technology, it has been developed to network protection from malware detection and not to attack tool such as Tor.\n\nAlthough devices are bundled with technology designed to perform deep HTTPS scanning usable to peer into the contents of encrypted communications.\n\nThey completely excluded to have been involved in any king of attacks against Tor project.\n\nAgain the company clarified:\n\n\u201cCyberoam UTM [Unified Threat Management] either accepts or rejects, but does not store HTTPS Deep Scan Inspection data, as processing is done in real-time. The possibility of data interception between any two Cyberoam appliances is hence nullified,\u201d\n\nUTM security appliances perform SSL inspection by generating their own certificates in this way network administrators would install them from Cyberoam on every devices of their network, allowing the traffic inspection technology to work without generating a warning.\n\nThe company remarked that HTTPS Deep Scan Inspection is driven by SSL Bridging Technology, so Cyberoam appliance provides self-signed certificate to the client whilst establishing a secure connection with the client and server. A default certificate is shipped which remains the same across all the appliances.\n\n\n\nIt could simply possible uninstall the Cyberoam CA certificate from the browser and decline to complete any connection which gives a certificate warning.\n\nCriminals or governments could use the stolen certificates to conduct \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attacks, tricking users into thinking they were at a legitimate site when in fact their communications were being secretly tampered and intercepted. That is for example what occurred in the DigiNotar case \u2026 companies like Facebook, Google and also agencies like CIA, MI6 were targeted in Dutch government certificate hack.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certificate", "topic_name": "Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberoam", "topic_name": "Cyberoam"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deep-scan-inspection", "topic_name": "deep scan inspection"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/diginotar", "topic_name": "Diginotar"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dpi", "topic_name": "DPI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/unified-threat-management", "topic_name": "Unified Threat Management"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vulnerability", "topic_name": "vulnerability"}]}, {"news_name": "What is a digital signature?

Essentially The digital signature of an electronic document aims to fulfill the following requirements:\n\nA typical digital signature scheme consists of three algorithms:\n\nTo generate a digital signature is necessary to use the digital asymmetric key pair, attributed unequivocally to a person, called holder of the key pair:\n\nOnce the document is signed with the private key, the signature can be verified successfully only with the corresponding public key. Security is guaranteed by the impossibility to reconstruct the private key (secret) from the public, even if the two keys are uniquely connected.\n\nA Digital signature is a one-way hash, of the original data, that has been encrypted with the signer\u2019s private key. A digital signature process is composed by the following steps:\n\nFor the verification, The receiving software first uses the signer\u2019s public key to decrypt the hash, then it uses the same hashing algorithm that generated the original hash to generate a  new one-way hash of the same data. The receiving software compares the new hash against the original hash. If the two hashes match, the data has not changed since it was signed.\n\n\n\nFigura 2 \u2013 Digital Signature Process\n\nThe authenticity of a document can be verified by anyone decrypting the signature of the document with the sender\u2019s public key, obtaining the fingerprint of the document, then comparing it with that obtained by applying the hash function (which is known) to the document received which was attached the signature. If the two fingerprints are equal, the authenticity and integrity of the document are demonstrated.\nThe signing and verification operations may be delegated to a schedule issued by the certification.\nThanks to the mechanism shown, the digital signature ensures non-repudiation: the signer of a document transmitted cannot deny having sent it and the receiver can deny to have received it. In other words means that the information cannot be ignored, as in the case of a conventional signature on a paper document in the presence of witnesses.\n\nThe advantages of digital signatures\nThe activation of a fully automated workflow, digital signatures, reduce time and costs associated with the signatures on paper, the latter in fact have an economic cost and create delays and inefficiencies.\nAn estimate provided by ARX on the basis of current data sets that each of their clients handwritten signature on a paper document to determine the company at a cost of $ 30 U.S including costs associated with paper, printing costs, of signing, scanning, forwarding, storage and regeneration of lost or missing documents. According to the study of ARX, a person authorized to sign documents marking more than 500 documents a year.\n\nThe digital signatures process is essential for the formal approval processes of every companies, a typical scenario require multiple authorization of multiple offices for each document.\n\nThus digital signatures allow alternate approval processes, collaboration and delivery of paper (expensive and slow), with a digital system (faster, cheaper and more efficient).This results in a number of advantages:\n\nResuming, digital signatures can reliably automate the signatures of authorization allowing the elimination of paper, reducing costs and improving the speed of production processes.\nBy virtue of all these advantages, the digital signature can be particularly useful for:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-identity", "topic_name": "Digital Identity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-signature", "topic_name": "Digital signature"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/identity", "topic_name": "identity"}]}, {"news_name": "Botnets and cyber warfare, a dangerous combination", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4241/cyber-crime/botnets-and-cyber-warfare-a-dangerous-combination.html", "title": "Botnets and cyber warfare, a dangerous combination\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 13, 2012", "body": "The US Government is very close to the theme of warfare being among the countries that invest more in the field. In a cyber security context we can enumerate a huge quantity of cyber threats that daily are designed and enhanced, a heterogeneous world and that includes many different options that could harm military and private sector causing serious damages.\n\nIn recent months is the increased concern on the development of botnets that are afflicting the areas critical for a country such as financial and military. White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Howard Schmidt has deep knowledge of the problem for this reason he\u2019s convening federal agencies, law enforcers and private companies to define a common strategy to deal with the threat.\n\nBehind the botnet we can find several type of actors such as cyber criminals, foreign governments and also hacktivist with different purposes like cyber espionage, financial frauds realizations arranging of operation of protest. The components of the botnets could be located everywhere in the world involving several countries, different social contexts and different laws and regulations, for this reason is quite difficult to arrange a unique front to face with the threat.\n\nDuring the McAfee Public Sector summit in Arlington, Va,  on April 11th, Schmidt declared:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion about botnets\u2026trying to identify how many are out there, what they\u2019re doing, what they could do and what the impact could be. I\u2019ve asked my office to engage in a private-public partnership to enhance the nation\u2019s cybersecurity by fighting against bot networks,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re teaming U.S. internet service providers, search engines, internet vendors, privacy rights advocates and groups and trade associations to tackle this on all fronts. We\u2019re working on developing best practices and an industry code of conduct within the next 90 days.\u201d\n\nThe group of work led by Schmidt is spending a sensible effort in the battle, working to reach the following four main goals:\n\nI agree with the approach of the U.S. government, I believe that the strategy defined and targets are consistent with an approach to the problem that has become indispensable. Essential is to get a snapshot of the current situation and to define method to measure of extent of spread of the threat.  The definition of a process of measuring and the defining of a set of indicators that can provide a status on the evolution of the threat are essential steps, however it is necessary that these parameters must be universally recognized. Another key to fighting the proliferation of botnets is able to increase the level of awareness of the threat in each sector while also providing the tools necessary to tackle the problem.\n\n\n\n\nAs repeatedly stressed there is no clear line between cybercrime and warfare, botnets are a serious threat from the deadly offensive potential. Through the establishment of a botnet is possible to attack the nerve centers of a country, isolate attacks can target its critical infrastructures, create serious problems in areas like finance, communications and transport. That is cyber warfare, no matter if behind the attack there is a foreign government or ruthless criminals, the risk is high and face the threat has high priority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at what [botnets] might do to a business\u2019s infrastructure, to personally identifiable information \u2013 identity theft, credit card fraud, et cetera \u2013 but it goes beyond that. What we\u2019re beginning to see is about 4 million new botnet infections every month\u2026it\u2019s a moving target,\u201d\n\nSchmidt said.\n\nWhat most worries the U.S. government is the high rate of spread of malware in the private sector, not easy to contrast the phenomenon. That it has-been estimated one in ten Americans has some kind of malicious software on Their devices.  To aggravate the scenario is the rapid spread of mobile industry in my opinion one of the most vulnerable in security. To an impressive growth in the demand is not corresponded the awareness of the threat, the user ignores most of the time the potential of its smartphone and threats which it is exposed.\n\nTo remain in topic a mobile botnet is a botnet that targets mobile devices such as smartphones, attempting to gain complete control of the mobile. Mobile botnets take advantage of unpatched exploits to provide hackers with root permissions over the compromised mobile device, enabling hackers to send e-mail or text messages, make phone calls, spy on users, access contacts and photos, and more.\nThe main problem is that botnets go undetected and this make really difficult to tackle.  The malware spread them self sending the agents to other devices via e-mail messages or text messages.\n\nExamples of mobile botnets are DreamDroid and TigerBot (SMS Controlled Android Malware) malware that compromised Google Android devices, Zitmo (zeus varian) that targeted Blackberry platform and CommWarrior which affected Symbian devices. The last in order of time is TigerBot, a new form of Android malware controlled via SMS messages that can record phone calls, upload the device\u2019s GPS location, and reboot the phone, among other operations executable in the command preventing the message from being seen by the user. TigerBot tries to hide itself from the user by not showing any icon on the home screen and by using legitimate sounding app names (like System) or by copying names from trusted vendors like Google or Adobe. \u201cTigerBot\u201d, differs from \u201ctraditional\u201d malware in that it is controlled via SMS rather than from a command & control (C&C) server on the Internet. The polymorphism of the threats and the genesis of new variants are the issues that most concern, these hacks and malware would essentially turn the phones into \u201czombies\u201d in order to respond to external orders.\n\nAccording to Schmidt it is necessary to act immediately, let me conclude with a meaningful affirmation the he said:\n\n\u201cOne of the clear issues we won\u2019t be doing anymore is to just sit back and admire the problem. We\u2019ve done that for too long. We\u2019ve written strategy after strategy\u2026it\u2019s time to move beyond the strategies and actually move into an environment where we\u2019re executing on these strategies,\u201d\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivist", "topic_name": "hacktivist"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/warfare", "topic_name": "warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "Mud against Anonymous using Zeus malware", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3095/cyber-crime/mud-against-anonymous-using-zeus-malware.html", "title": "Mud against Anonymous using Zeus malware\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 6, 2012", "body": "Symantec company recently has disclosed the news that the collective Anonymous has deceived his supporters favoring the spread and installing of Zeus malware on their machines. The charge is heavy and would undermine the trust that underpins the recruitment methods of the collective, it seems that all supporters who have participated to various Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks may have installed unknowingly a variant of Zeus malware used to gather information like e-mail and banking information.\n\nHow can this happened? In a very simple, some hackers have exploited the notoriety of the collective disseminating an infected version of the tools used in the attacks, in this case the tool Slowloris, using standard channels as Pastbin. The hackers have copied and pasted an original Anonymous Pastebin entry replacing the download link with an infected version. In this way the agent diffusion was extremely rapid.\n\n\n\nEvents dating on January 19, 2012, when authorities stopped Megaupload services, and Anonymous hackers have conducted several DDoS attacks retaliated by taking down DOJ, RIAA, MPAA, Universal Music websites, among others.  During the attacks Anonymous released a list of several different DDoS attack tools that supporters have downloaded.\n\nRemember that in the past weeks I had anticipated the possibility that someone could use the name Anonymous in other operations, from cybercrime to intelligence operations made by hostile governments, that is why I defined Anonymous a cyber weapon.\nThe reputation of the group may paradoxically create many problems to the group itself, the audience to which the collective targets is not in fact capable of distinguishing false messages, and infiltration attempts that are occurring and will occur with increasing frequency.\nMy opinion is that Anonymous is completely outside to the events, I still unclear the direction of these attacks to the group. It could be a mud machine set up to discredit the group, or the operation made by unscrupulous criminals who try to benefit from favorable situation to spread of malware useful for realization of fraud. Third hypothesis is anything but fiction that one foreign government is exploiting the emotional involvement in the collective to collect an impressive amount of information on participants in operations.\n\nThe choice of the Zeus malware is in my opinion another indication of the possibility that someone is trying to hide its tracks by attacking the group of hacktivist. Zeus is in fact a trojan which first appeared in 2007 and several different instances have been observed during this years. A real parallel market has in fact set up a criminal industry that can customize the agent on demand with components developed and commissioned for any specific purpose.  Zeus is used to steal banking information via two methods, man-in-the-browser and keystroke logging form grabbing.\n\nOnce installed and executed, the infected version of Slowloris uses the Zeus botnet client to send stolen information to the C&C server. During the transfer the boot master order to the infected machine to continue to perform the attacks against Anonymous\u2019s target ensuring that the victim will not notice the fraud.\n\nSecurity firm Symantec has the details:\n\nAn attacker took a popular PasteBin guide, used by Anonymous members for downloading and using the DoS tool Slowloris, and modified it. In this modified version, the attacker changed the download link to a Trojanized version of the Slowloris tool with matching text. Later that same day, a separate Anonymous DoS guide was posted on PasteBin which included links to various DoS tools. Slowloris was included in this list of tools\u2014the Trojanized version copied from the modified guide.\n\nThe anonymous group immediately dismissed all charges through the major social networks like Twitter, following a collection of the principal messages.\n\nYourAnonNews, which has 547,000 followers, had a very negative reaction:\n\nThis post from @Symantec about @YourAnonNews\u2019s spreading the DDOS hijacking trojan is wrong & libelous to say the least\nDear @Symantec \u2013 @YourAnonNews NEVER posted the DDOS hijacker nor did we attempt to trick people; instead we WARNED of it.\nAlso, @Symantec \u2013 maybe if you paid attention to more details and did proper due diligence, your source code wouldn\u2019t have been stolen. SMH\n\nAnonymousIRC, which has 277,000 followers simply warned its followers:\n\nhttp://is.gd/vF8RUU | #Anonymous supporters tricked into installing Zeus trojan | This MUSTN\u2019T happen. Be careful what you post & click on!\n\nAnonOps, which has 297,000 followers, did not tweet anything about the report. It did, however, retweet this message from our sister site CNET:\n\nDid Anonymous itself get \u201chacked\u201d? Symantec says yes. But Anonymous begs to differ. http://cnet.co/xE7A2s\n\nGroupAnon, which has 72,000 followers, did not react to the news at all.\n\nIt seems to me that someone is pursuing a different strategy to counter the Anonymous group questioning his actions before the masses. You are trying to portray the group as ruthless criminals ready to sacrifice the masses from which she draws strength regardless of the consequences. As repeatedly stressed the group can not be countered with arrests and other operations of oppression, but must be fought with intelligence and infiltration operations that lead to mutual distrust affiliates and supporters. Undermine the nucleus, to induce suspicion in the policies pursued and the methods used.\nDivide and conquer.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nhttp://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/3095/cyber-crime/mud-against-anonymous-using-zeus-malware.html\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacker", "topic_name": "hacker"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/man-in-the-browser", "topic_name": "man-in-the-browser"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zeus-malware", "topic_name": "Zeus malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Trustwave vs Mozilla community for MITM Digital Certificate", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/2562/digital-id/trustwave-vs-mozilla-community-for-mitm-digital-certificate.html", "title": "Trustwave vs Mozilla community for MITM Digital Certificate\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 14, 2012", "body": "After the attacks against certification authorities such as VeriSign, Comodo and DigiNotar the level of confidence in the model based on certificates is in sharp decline. There is widespread accusations addressed to the PKI paradigm (public key infrastructure ) which is based on the concept to request to trusted and credited third parties to guarantee on the identity of an entity in the digital world.\nOn more than one occasion have been identified vulnerabilities to the model and were shown the dangers arising from impairment of such architectures, the risks that pose a serious threat from private sector to the government one. Unfortunately, the criticism of the model are not moved for technical reasons, we are faced with an impressive business, the monetization of our digital identity.\n\nThe news that we are going to discuss is undoubtedly disconcerting and raises serious doubts about the trustworthiness of the trusted \u201cthird party\u201d, main components of the PKI model. Digital Certificate Authority (CA) Trustwave revealed that it has issued a digital certificate that enabled an unnamed private company to spy on SSL protected connections within its corporate network. The news has literally shocked the Mozilla community that has immediately requested to remove the CA\u2019s root certificate from Firefox.\n\n\n\nThe certificate issued by Trustwave is recognized as a subordinate root and enabled to sign digital certificates for virtually any domain on the Internet. Trustwave has decided to make a public declaration on the event to reassure their customers. According the declaration of the company it has been updated their legal repository (https://ssl.trustwave.com/CA). It has been  revoked subordinate root.\n\nThis single certificate was issued for an internal corporate network customer and not to a \u2018government\u2019, \u2018ISP\u2019 or to \u2018law enforcement\u2019. It was to be used within a private network within a data loss prevention (DLP) system. The subordinate certificate was subject to a Certification Practice Statement (CPS), Subscriber Agreement and Relying Party Agreement crafted by Trustwave after an audit of the customer physical security, network security, and security policies. \nThe system was created using dedicated hardware device designed for SSL proxy and acceleration, with a FIPS-140-2 Level 3 compliant Hardware Security Module (HSM) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module) for subordinate root storage and for the purpose of private key generation of the re-signed SSL certificates. This means that once the trusted subordinate root was placed into the device it could not be extracted.\n\nThe statement remarks two main aspects:\n\nHSMs provide both logical and physical protection of these materials from non-authorized use and potential adversaries.  Trustwave declared that the issuing of subordinate roots to private companies has been done with the purpose to allow inspection of the SSL-encrypted traffic that passes through their networks. Anyway the CA decided to stop issuing this type of certificates in the future, revoking the existent ones.\n\nThe unsubstantiated allegations are charges from many quarters, the presence of the certificate could be used to generate ad hoc SSL certificates that would allow to extract the keys to use them elsewhere . These allegations were promptly rejected by the company, Brian Trzupek, Trustwave\u2019s vice president for managed identity and authentication said:\n\u201cNor Could the subordinate root keys ever get exported from the device.\u201d\n\nMozilla\u2019s community seems not accept this motivations and it is currently debating whether the issuing of such certificates represents a serious breach of the policy implemented by the CA. To preserve users\u2019 security the community is oriented to exclude the certificate from its software.\n\nSeveral users are asking Mozilla to remove Trustwave\u2019s root certificate from Firefox and Thunderbird because domain name owners were not aware that Trustwave was re-signing certificates in their name through a subordinate root.\n\nIn my opinion Trustwave has managed the situation in a reasonable way and even correct the observations of the Mozilla community has produced excessive worry. The company has operated in absolute transparency when applying the corrections required, proceding with the certificate revocation.\n\nWhat I do not agree is the different approach followed by the company in the public an governmental and private sectors. Cyber \u200b\u200bthreats are transverse to the areas which are inextricably linked and the exploit of a vulnerability in the private sector could have serious repercussions in other fields.\n\nAnother aspect on which I have strong doubts is that a certification authority can distribute to everyone, although in a safe manner, \u2018weak CA\u2019 certificates.\nA similar procedure is in my opinion contrary to any reasonable security policy and may expose organizations to significant risks.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certification-authority", "topic_name": "Certification Authority"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-certificate", "topic_name": "Digital Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-id-2", "topic_name": "digital ID"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mitm", "topic_name": "MITM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}]}, {"news_name": "Sykipot attacks U.S PKI infrastructures based on smart cards", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1656/cyber-crime/sykipot-attacks-u-s-pki-infrastructures-based-on-smart-cards.html", "title": "Sykipot attacks U.S PKI infrastructures based on smart cards\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 14, 2012", "body": "In these hours on the web is turning the news of a cyber attack performed by a group of Chinese hackers against some U.S. Government Agencies. Once again, the weapon used against the strategic objectives is a cyber weapon, in particular it has been used a new version of the trojan Sykipot.\n\n\n\nChinese hackers have deployed trojan that is aiming the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and potentially a other United States government agencies and businesses. The trojan is targeting smart card readers produced by the company ActivIdentity that provides authentication software.\n\nThe attacks originate have been originated by Chinese servers and for sure they have targeted the defense sector to steal sensible information. The attack has been conceived to exploit the identity management processes used in governative environments for the physical and logical access management.\n\nWhat is really interesting is the process followed by the creator of the original trojan detected in December, the original versions of the Sykipot malware was a Trojan that opened a backdoor into the infected PCs to grab documents from high level offcials within target organizations and businesses.  This time the malware has been packaged to compromise smart card readers running ActivClient, the client application of ActivIdentity. ActivIdentity ActivClient is the market-leading security application that allows customers to use smart cards and USB tokens as identity management devices inside a smart card-based PKI authentication for Windows login, VPN, Web Login, Remote Sessions, as well as data security, digital signature and secure email. This solution is largely used at the DoD and in number of other US government agencies.\n\nWe are dealing with a cyber weapon specifically packaged for a specific target and that makes use of modules available in instances of malware known to researchers. A trend, that does not differ in philosophy, observed in the case of Duqu and Stuxnet. This is the first report of Sykipot being used to compromise smart cards, the authentication devices privileged for identy management systems of the American militia. Hacker have used a version of Sykipot that dates back to March of last year already used for several attacks executed in the past year.The spreading vector is an email campaign addressed to specific targets. Let consider that the malware has appeared several times in combination with zero-day exploits and has been used to launch targeted attacks since 2007.\n\nThe attacks compromise smart card readers running in Windows O.s, in partiulary the native x509 modules according what has been reported by US government.\n\nHow does the trojan work? It uses a keylogger to steal PINs for the smartcards during their usage. When a card is inserted into the reader, the trojan acts, as authenticated user, is free to access sensitive and protected information. The stoled data are send back to the attacker that is able to drive remotely the operations.\n\nThe event is undoubtedly of the utmost gravity and the attack with this method could compromise the whole PKI architecture on which are based the logical and physical access management.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-defence", "topic_name": "cyber defence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defence", "topic_name": "defence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dod", "topic_name": "DoD"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/military", "topic_name": "military"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pki", "topic_name": "PKI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sykipot", "topic_name": "sykipot"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/u-s", "topic_name": "U.S."}]}, {"news_name": "The year of the networked protest, from SOPA act to Anonymous", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/675/cyber-crime/675.html", "title": "The year of the networked protest, from SOPA act to Anonymous\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 15, 2011", "body": "It\u2019s end of the year and time for reflections. Yesterday we have discussed on incident occurred to CAs, but what else will we remember of this 2011? No doubts, we will remember the new way to use Internet, an irreplaceable vector for social protests, expression of social malaise and of too much stolen liberty.\n\nWe have often heard the word Hacktivism intending to use the usage of computers and computer networks as a Means of Protest to Promote political ends. The term is not new because it was first coined in 1998 by a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow hacker group. Hacking to fight censorship, to promote political ideology, sustain free speech and human rights.\n\n\n\nThe year of the networked revolution, from Wikileaks case to the Occupy movement to the Middle East, calls for political and personal freedom. The winds of protest are really strong, they are an hurricane, none is able to silet them. It is really difficult, the network is reacheable in just one click \u2026 a tweet, a post, a message could be spread to million on persons who share the same thought. This is the year of the social media, preciuos instruments to express the dissent against a power that is silently working to control every one repressing awkward voices.\n\nBut the danger is just around the corner, while we are stroking this breath of freedom, we realize that we are pawns in a much more complex boards. The main countries of the world join forces with large multinational companies to install complex monitor systems for communications, they deploy Internet kill switch to suppress protests in the bud. They spy on our phones and control our communications. Do you think the problem is only in China or India?\n\nDuring the last year we have observed political insurrection events in Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, Tunisia, let consider also mass protests against economic breakdown in Greece, Italy and Spain. Than there were the Occupy Wall Street moviments from New York to London. Events united by the same intent, express a dissent, and by the same vector used to inform public opinion and the problems, Internet.\n\nThis time is really hard, we are facing with the worst economic crisis, with social dissatisfaction and an overwhelming sense of profound vulnerability that the 11/9 has left. The mixture is explosive. On one hand, Governments that have to be able to control, hopefully for noble purposes, to ensure the safety of the people, on the other hand  movements of thought that can not tolerate the interference of these preventive measures.\n\nWe witnessed the consecration of groups of \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d as Anonymous who expressed opposition to a rotten system in every way and with success. In terms of security it has been a Waterloo. Underestimated, mocked by arrogant experts in the pay of the multinationals, have stepped up attacks of all kinds.\nAnd then here who have ventured into the operations of web site defacements of institutional portal, denial of service attacks against financial institutions, information theft, and virtual sit-ins. A protest with digital real effect and an important economical impact. They are a powerful political force genetically supported by the people.\n\nRemaining on subject of protests, objections and regulations let me invite you to read the act \u201cStop Online Piracy Act\u201d (SOPA), also known as H.R.3261, is a bill that was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on October 26. It expands the ability of U.S. law enforcement and copyright holders to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods.The bill would allow the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against websites accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement.\nThe interpretation of this Act could be really the event of 2011, indroducing \u201cde facto\u201d an Internet censorship, a digital dictatorship.\n\nWe meditate, this could represent a real step backwards for mankind, the death of the dream of freedom.  The act gives me a great contrast, I personally have always supported the freedom of expression, to be able to exercise free will and  I find it difficult to accept this legislation imposed on us in the name of global security. I am deeply convinced that this will not fight our real enemies, they just stir up fears and nourished the seeds of discord. Control and repression stifling the dialogue that is the only weapon that man has for a civil coexistence.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nhttp://owni.eu/2011/12/15/an-open-letter-from-internet-engineers-to-the-us-congress/#SOPA\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/act", "topic_name": "act"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/freedom", "topic_name": "freedom"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sopa", "topic_name": "SOPA"}]}, {"news_name": "2011, CAs are under attack.

Many attacks have had disturbing consequences.It all began, or so we were led to believe, with the case Comodo. Comodo officials revealed that the registration authority had been compromised in a March 15 attack and that the username and password of a Comodo Trusted Partner in Southern Europe were stolen. A Registration Autorithy suffered an attack that resulted in a breach of one user account of that specific RA. Its account was then used fraudulently to issue 9 certificates (across 7 different domains including: login.yahoo(NSDQ:YHOO).com, mail.google (NSDQ:GOOG).com, login.skype.com and addons.mozilla.org). All of these certificates were revoked immediately on discovery.\n\n\n\nThen came other illustrious victims, like DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority owned by VASCO Data Security International.On September 3, 2011, after it had become clear that a security breach had resulted in the fraudulent issuing of certificates, the Dutch government took over operational management of DigiNotar\u2019s systems. A few weeks later the company was declared bankrupt.\n\nRecently KPN, has stopped issuing digital certificates after finding attack tools on its server. They said that there weren\u2019t evidence that it\u2019s CA infrastructure was compromised, all actions have been taken as a precaution.\nKPN has the tool during a security audit that found a server with a DDoS tool on it, and that that the tool may have been there for as long as four years. That is really worrying from my point of view, but I\u2019m a stupid \u2026 they are smart!\nDo you think that is ended? That is wrong, because during the last month also GemNET\nGemnet, a subsidiary of KPN (leading telecommunication and ICT service provider in The Netherlands), has been compromised and according to Webwereld the hack is related to CA certificates.\nToday I have read the news regarding the hack also of the Certification Authority GlobalSign happened in September.\nDo you think it is enough?\n\nWhy attack a steal or rob a CA certificate? Let\u2019s try to answer:\n\nMalware production \u2013 Installation for certain types of software could needs that its code is digitally signed with a trusted certificate. By stealing the certificate of a trusted vendor reduces the possibility that the malicious software being detected as quickly. That is exactly what happened to Stuxnet virus.\n\nEconomic Frauds \u2013 digital signature give a warranty on who signed a document and you can decide if you trust the person or company who signed the file and if you trust the organization who issued the certificate. If a digital certificate is stolen we will suffer from an identity theft, let\u2019s imagine which could be the implication.\n\nSome bot, like happened to the banking with Zeus malware, could be deployed to steal site certificates so that they can fool web browsers into thinking that a phishing site is a legitimate bank website.\n\nCyber warfare \u2013 Criminals or governments could use the stolen certificates to conduct \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attacks, tricking users into thinking they were at a legitimate site when in fact their communications were being secretly tampered and intercepted. That is for example what occurred in the DigiNotar case \u2026 companies like Facebook, Google and also agencies like CIA, MI6 were targeted in Dutch government certificate hack.\n\nIt is not my intention to discuss here the topicality of a protocol such as TLS / SSL or alternative possibles and valid approaches. I would like to approach the problem from another point of view \u2026 considering the objective responsibility of the CA management, too light that has undermined the confidence in the model. Poor controls and most often carried out in a pedestrian, absent of policies or their wrong implementations, mismanaged infrastructure vulnerable to low complexity attacks are the real cause of what I consider a disaster. How is it conceivable place blind faith in authority compromised for years that decided to make outing as a result of an accident from the possible political implications?\nIf the same CA are part of the main national Telco Operator, we can imagine what might have really happened and which risks the user has been exposed. Before judging the old model we also evaluate the work of those who would adopt it.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 CA, PKI)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cas", "topic_name": "CAs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certificate", "topic_name": "Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certification-authorities", "topic_name": "Certification Authorities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certification-authority", "topic_name": "Certification Authority"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/convergence", "topic_name": "Convergence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Top Nine cyber security trends for 2012?

It is possible that during the next year we will see a rise in attacks which target the worldwide infrastructures that supports SSL. Impervia expects that these attacks will reach a tipping point in 2012. According their forecast it will be the year of the \u201cbreak point\u201d inducing serious discussion about real alternatives for secure web communications. My point of you is quite different. From my prospective SSL is a fine session encryption protocol that is being inappropriate to protect security for Internet based transaction systems because it was not designed for this purpose and it is dated. Several critics can be addressed to the model, for example the incredible number of Certification Authority and their way to protect their \u201ctrust chain\u201d. Comodo case is the worst case we have observed during last year. Which could be valid alternatives \u2026 well, the \u201cConvergence\u201d model launched by Marlinspike is a good one , a secure replacement for the certificate authority system with excellent performances.\n\nTrend #8: HTML 5 goes live \u2013\n\nThe main problem is that HTML5 is not scheduled for official approval by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) until 2014. Developers, meanwhile, want to run the latest technology now. So they will either use proprietary plug-ins such as Flash or protocols considering them a standard.\n\nDuring last few years, vulnerabilities in browsers\u2019 add-ons (third party components such as adobe\u2019s Flash Player or Oracle\u2019s Java) were the significant cause of \u201czero-day\u201d exploits.  Consider that the HTML 5 standard was created to enable browsers to support a richer end user experience in a standardized way. While the new features are attractive to web developers, they are also very beneficial for hackers. I totally agree on this point the events occurred during the last couple of months of 2011 are demonstrating it.\n\nTrend #7: DDoS moves up the stack \u2013 For many reasons this will be one of the main threats of the new year. The year 2011 was a terrible year regarding the number of attacks perpetrated suing this technique. Attacks of this type are widely used for expression of dissent and hacktivism \u2026 and dissent is unfortunately destined to grow. I\u2019m concerned about the conjunction DDOS with other dangerous attacks like spear phishing , because similar techniques used in the same time could create very powerful offensive action.\n\nTrend #6: Internal collaboration meets its evil twin I disagree and do not perceive the criticality as proposed.\n\nTrend #5: NoSQL = No Security? \u2013 I share the concern. I believe that inadequate security mechanisms of distributed  data sources will create several problems like it is happened during the current year.\n\nTrend #4: The kimono comes off of consumerized IT \u2013\n\nFrankly I have not understood the magnitude of the threat and materialize in the coming year. What would make this threat so terrifying the next year? Frankly I did not understand \u2026and you?\n\nTrend #3:  Anti-social media \u2013 As many more organizations are making their way into the social media space, we expect to see a growing impact to the integrity and confidentiality of the enterprise\u2019s information. Moreover, we expect hackers will continue to automate social media attacks, exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe openness to new forms of communication brings undoubted benefits but surely increases the attack surface of each company. The exhibition is expected to increase considerably in 2012 \u2026 it is hoped that together increase the security mechanisms needed to countless threats related to such exposure.\n\nTrend #2: The Rise of the middle man \u2013 I share the prediction on the rise of the cyber broker. This individual matches the buyers of stolen data or compromised machines (aka \u201cbots\u201d) with the sellers of the data (or bot renters).  In the same way stocks and investors gave rise to stock markets, hackers need a middleman. That is an interesting scenario!\n\nTrend #1: Security trumps compliance \u2013 In the past, security decisions were usually driven by compliance.  However, in 2012 we expect to see security decisions driven by security. Considering that the cost of a breach rising, industrialized hacking impacting many organizations and the need to protect of intellectual property, this means that we will probably see more companies making cyber security decisions based on security.\n\nDespite I consider really interesting the Imperva experts\u2019 analysis I believe it is an incomplete list of some of the threats which I consider among the most worrisome.\nWhich one? Following my supplementary list:\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #1 \u2013 The spread of the cloud paradigm will bring with it a series of problems far from negligible.The cloud platforms today are daughters of an aggressive marketing and immature security models. What if cloud platforms were used as a strike force against a predetermined target. It would be a catastrophe, an offensive before which any system would be helpless.\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #2 \u2013 Socialmedia diffusion will be really high. It was becoming a weapon and a battlefield. Governments and private companies have understood the critical of new media platform like social network. Through social network you can collect information, you can perform complex data mining researches, but you can also spread malware and influence common sentiment and event perception \u2026 that is a really a big threat.\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #3 \u2013 Improved Social Engineering Attacks. Attackers will increasingly make use of social-engineering tactics to bypass technological security controls, fine-tuning their techniques to exploit natural human predispositions. We\u2019ve already seen such approaches succeed at influencing victims into clicking on questionable links, opening exploit-laden attachments, and installing malicious software. \n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #4 \u2013  Large diffusion of  Custom Malware developed to attack specific target, Stuxnet Virus and Duqu malware are a good examples. Which will be their evolutions?\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #5 \u2013  2012 will be the year of the IPv6 consolidation? Well consider that its implementation has today to much obscure issues.\n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #6 \u2013  Sensible grow for firmware and hardware hack. \n\nMy Supplementary Trend: #7 \u2013  Mobile Security Issue. Increasingly sophisticated mobile devices and for which there is  low perception of threats that can compromise the integrity and security.\n\nSome examples are Ransomware \u201d (an infection that holds a device \u201chostage\u201d until a \u201cransom\u201d payment is delivered) to Take Mobile Devices Hostage and worming into Android platform that are able to quickly propagate from one device to another.\n\nAs you can see the threats listed by me and not on the initial list Imperva is far from negligible, in fact likely to become soon the nightmares of those responsible for security in the coming months.\nAre you agree?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.imperva.com/docs/HI_Security_Trends_2012.pdf\n\nhttp://www.sans.edu/research/security-laboratory/article/security-predict2011\n\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/06/idUS96123+06-Dec-2011+HUG20111206\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/07/28/html5-poses-threat-to-flash-and-the-app-store/\n\nhttp://www.gartner.com/technology/research/predicts/\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certification-authority", "topic_name": "Certification Authority"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/convergence", "topic_name": "Convergence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl", "topic_name": "SSL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Banking \u2013 new threats grow", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/479/cyber-crime/banking-new-threats-grow.html", "title": "Banking \u2013 new threats grow\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 8, 2011", "body": "Have you ever wondered what are the main threats have concerns the banks and financial institutions? Several survey have been conducted and apart small differenced of on numbers they all have evidenced that Top fraud threats are\n\nWhen these frauds are detected?  The major part of the incidents are evidenced by the customers, the final victims. We are speaking of a percentage that is around the 80%,numbers that are worrying and highlight the difficulty of approaching a problem. Institutions feel prepared to prevent classic card fraud like check fraud and money laundering but it is not a new that these institutions are not so skilled to fight the new threat represented by cybercrime. We have observed an exponential escalation of malware attacks which target transactions, this kind of fraud is increasing respect the others.\n\nCyber \u200b\u200bthreats are among those that are of particular concern and the reason is understandable analyzing the number of transitions that are made every second all over the word. A boundless ocean from which to \u201cfish\u201d and within each control and prevention is very difficult. Compounding the scenario is the same technological evolution, increasingly complex and sophisticated malware able to attack advanced platforms to provide miscellaneous services to customers and internal staff. Easy for those malware typically found before then next-generation agents that take advantage of 0 day vulnerability and from them is really hard to implement prevention policies.\n\nBut what are the main threats that the world of finance is concerned?\n\nAttacck DDOS, spearphishing, malware as Zeus and SpyEye \u2026 but what would happen if all these components come together in one combined action? The threat could cause much damages, and if you think that is the result of my paranoia then read what I have to tell you:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently warned consumers about a scam multiprong That Involves the use of spearphishing, the Zeus Trojan horses, DDoS attacks, and a jewelry heist.The spam campaign pretends to be Legitimate e-mails from the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA), advising the user there is a problem with the ACH transaction at Their bank. They click on the link Once They Are infected with a variant of the Zeus Trojan known as GameOver, Which Is Able to keylog and steal information Their Their online banking credentials, the Denver FBI Cyber \u200b\u200bSquad explained. \u201cAfter the accounts are compromised, the perpetrators conduct a DDoS attack on the financial institution. The belief is the DDoS is used to deflect attention from the wire transfers as well to make them unable to reverse the transactions (if found). A portion of the wire transfers (not all) are being transmitted directly to high-end jewelry stores, wherein the money mule comes to the actual store to pick up his $100K in jewels (or whatever dollar amount was wired)\u201d, the FBI explained.\n\nI could finally give some additional information on the potential related to a malware that is designed to attack the banking sector.Let\u2019s introduce for example Zeus, a Trojan developed to steal banking information by keystroke logging and form grabbing. Zeus is spread mainly through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. In June 2009 the company Prevx has discovered that Zeus had compromised over 75,000 FTP accounts on websites of such companies as the Bank of America, NASA, Monster, ABC, Oracle, Play.com, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek. To give a dimension of the phenomenon the various Zeus\u2019 botnets has been calculated to include to include aroind 4 millions of compromised computers only in USA.  As of October 28, 2009 over 1.5 million phishing messages were sent on Facebook with the purpose of spreading the Zeus\u2019 trojan.\n\nIt was still active in 2010.On July 14, 2010, security firm Trusteer filed a report, which says that the credit cards of more than 15 unnamed US banks have been compromised. The number of computers infected with the ZeuS banking trojan is four times higher than that of systems infected with SpyEye, according to statistics compiled by Trusteer.\n\nConsider that the economic impact on the institutions is really high due direct fraud and other indirect voices like loss of productivity and loss of customer confidence. Of course, managing customer trust is  tricky in consideration of the increase of cyber attacks like the phishing threat, where customers may think their institution has been breached even though that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\n\nBanks and similar institutions are responding to the threat in different way:\n\nThe awareness of the threat and the attention that the economic/financial  world  are paying for these new forms of fraud, a hopeful sign that the fight will be tough but that we are ready to deal with the right energy.\nThe world is changing and with it the way we do and offer banking services.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/22418/zeus-gets-a-little-help-from-ddos-to-defraud-consumers-banks/\n\nhttp://bankinganalyticsblog.fico.com/2011/01/new-survey-reveals-top-fraud-threats-and-vulnerabilities-.html\n\nhttp://www.fico.com/en/FIResourcesLibrary/Fraud-Survey-ExecSummary.pdf\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_(trojan_horse)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bank", "topic_name": "bank"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fraud", "topic_name": "fraud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "The utopian privacy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/469/digital-id/the-utopian-privacy.html", "title": "The utopian privacy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 7, 2011", "body": "Are you able to imagine a world in which everybody is free to communicate without being intercepted, spied on, tracked? Have you ever dreamt, reading sad and bad news pages on the censure of many governments, a world where the concept of freedom of thought has been materialized?\n\nIn recent decades we have witnessed radical change communication and the emergence of powerful new channels for sharing information. We think of social networks, the various Facebook, Twitter or Google + \u2026 millions, billions of people eager to communicate, share without fear, away from prying eyes.\n\nWhat to say about the explosion of mobile and the impact on daily life. We are in constant contact with our friends, with colleagues, sharing photographs, documents, and geographic location.Too bad too many people ignore that these tablet that we carry with us, like the smartphone, are equivalent to our computers and as such should be protected.\n\nAnd which are the main mode to communicate on working places. Simple to reply! We prefer even emails to invite our fellow desk to go get some coffee. Then came Skype with video with this powerful tool we can communicate, share files, chat in the absolute belief of many that it can not be intercepted.\n\nWake up. \u201cThey\u201d control us, \u201cThey\u201d control our children, \u201cThey\u201d listen to our communications and read our mail, \u201cThey\u201d know our movements.The statements may appear strong, paranoid, but \u201cTheir\u201d interference goes beyond the imagination. But who do I mean by \u201cthey\u201d? \u201cThey\u201d are our own Governments that drive the adoption of technological means of which require control. Check the network, censor content, intercept the threats.They continuous try to impose any kind of control using laws and formal Act, inviting ISP to trace our data and Telecom Operator to register our communications.\n\nBut what are the real causes of such interference?\n\nThere are two main reasons,\n\nThis second intent is the most dangerous, and even those two reasons are overlapped. Too often in the name of national security is abused to exercise control, unfortunately for private purposes. It \u2018happened to us in Italy, it is common practice in many industrialized countries.\n\n\n\nCarrierIQ scandal, a company that would have deployed on an unspecified number of mobile phones of different brands and models, a silent app able to spy on customers. After reporting of the researcher Trevor Eckhart we have observer tepid denials from CarrierIQ, and the emergence of an uncomfortable truth. The citizens are being spied on. I would like to believe that the producers were unaware of what the device does, but I am skeptical. Who is behind this, and in situations like these how they mediate the exposure? Government simply denied any reference, any involvement of the majors firms, to impute guilt to a small company to be dismantled and provide a remedy to eliminate the spy agent. But what actually install on the devices when they initiate the removal of the app? who knows. The same app works at a very low level, a sort of backdoor and it is developed to be multi-platform. But how much will cost? It has been argued that the costs are certainly not insignificant, and above the primary business of the same company, so why spy the citiziens?\n\nQuestions to which no response can be provides.\n\nAnother case was related to Skype flaws that can be used to track the final user, localizing its position in a simple way.

Its Global Economic Crime Survey has demonstrated that Cybercrime has double digit growth being today third biggest crime threat in UK businesses behind asset theft crimes, frauds and corruption\n\nNorton Cybercrime Report: The Human Impact, an groundbreaking study that exposes the alarming extent of cybercrime and the feelings of powerlessness and lack of justice felt by its victims worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe trend is the same all over the word, cyber crime industry has collected a lot of successes during the last five years.\n\nAnother important factor is that cybercrime\u2019s financial and geographic growth shows no slowdown during the global economic crisis indeed, it probably took advantage of the crisis factor, to undermine the business much more profitable. Lack of awareness of the threat, and contraction of investment in prevention and awareness have played in favor of cyber crime. No company or organization is immune.\n\nCybercrime Growth has been fueled by an evident lack of adequate protection.\n\nAccording a recent Norton cybercrime report costing fraud victims more than $388 billion worldwide over the past year, consider that up 35% of the global cybercrime bill were U.S. fraud victims, who spent $139 billion on cybercrime last year. An amounts of 141 victims per minute, an alarming statistic even for Norton\u2019s consumer cybercrime expert, Helen Malani.\n\n\n\nReading the PWC survey document It is to understand that there are several significant problems in assessing cybercrime risks, mainly the difficult to address to right definition for the crime. Same event are classified under different categories that require different approach but in effect they are referring the same problem like industrial espionage  or asset theft.\n\nDuring the assessment of the cost usually managers and corporates limit to proven losses through fraud, or include remedial costs or extend that to reputational damage, but has not defined a standardized metrics to evaluate them.\n\nIt is now essential for senior management to truly understand the risks and opportunities of the cyber world giving a strong commitment to fight the battle against an enemy that is increasing its energy.\n\nMust be analyzed also the indirect cost like image dameges related to an incident that seriously damage brands or tarnish a reputation, leading organizations to lose market share. \u201cTrust Level\u201d and the company reputation must be considered like strategic asset and their damage can be critical like is happened for the Diginotar case.\n\nLet me highlight main data published in the final report of the PWC survey:\n\nand also:\n\nWhich is the more worrying threat related cyber crime?\n\nNo doubt, one of the biggest threats is related  crimes against mobile devices, natural consequence of large diffusion of smartphones and tablets to Internet connections. Official sources 80% of people accessing their mobile devices improperly protected, this provides fertile ground for cybercrime activity.\n\nBusinesses on line based for example allow users to access their services via mobile devices, this is especially disconcerting. But what happen if there aren\u2019t procedure that effectively detect when fraudulent devices are logging onto their sites and requesting transactions? Organizations and their customers are vulnerable to evolving schemes such as credit card fraud , account takeover, card-not-present (CNP) fraud, phishing and identity theft.\n\nSimilar to legitimate economy, this growth has impacted the illegal underground marketplace that has demonstrated to be driven by innovation and opportunities. For cyber crooks, it\u2019s all about exploiting the latest technology before the security gaps are identified and closed.\n\nIt is necessary to implement fraud preventative strategy that includes device reputation technology critical to identifying anomalous behavior that indicates fraud possibility.\n\nHow to protect our business?\n\nThe numbers show a growth difficult to stop, a relentless progression that requires us to implement, in both Government and private sectors, a series of measures to contain the threat.\n\nFirst step is to become aware of the threat and risks \u2026 second step, action!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/economic-crime-survey/assets/GECS_GLOBAL_REPORT.pdf\n\nhttp://us.norton.com/theme.jsp?themeid=cybercrime_report\n\nhttp://www.odt.co.nz/news/technology/180572/cyber-crime-hits-431-million-adults-24-countries\n\nhttp://blog.iovation.com/2011/10/11/cybercrime-growth-fueled-by-new-opportunities/\n\nhttp://www.computerworlduk.com/news/outsourcing/3272871/pwc-fined-46m-over-satyam-fraud/?intcmp=in_article;related\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crisis", "topic_name": "crisis"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/industry", "topic_name": "industry"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl", "topic_name": "SSL"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Social Network Poisoning \u2026 they want to spy on us, we evade", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/352/digital-id/social-network-poisoning-they-want-to-spy-on-us-we-evade.html", "title": "Social Network Poisoning \u2026 they want to spy on us, we evade\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 2, 2011", "body": "\u201cBe Social\u201d is the imperative of the last years.

The application of this kind of attack on a large-scale could lead to the collapse of Social Networking platforms affect its value for commercial purposes, as well as the utility in terms of knowledge and correlation of data provided by users, with a significant impact on its economic value.\n\nIn the same way as the \u201croute poisoning\u201d (affecting the telecommunications network), the \u201cpoisoning action\u201d are conducted with the aim to pollute the contents of this social network profiles typically introducing artifacts and relationships exist between them and real ones thus making the information unreliable. The result is the consequent failure of the chain of trust which are based on all social networks, in order not to allow search engines specifically developed to retrieve information of any kind relating to a particular profile.\n\nStarting from the assumption that the Internet and in particular the social network lacks a coherent and safe management of digital identity, it is possible to introduce the main tools currently poisoning hypothesize new and viable in a future scenario\nCurrent tools\n\nFuture instruments:\n\nHow easy to understand the interest in social networks are the stars. Complex systems analyze information, scan faces and places, building new relationships and providing new information.

The impairment of some famous CA as Diginotar and dissemination of news related to the mode of spread of the dreaded Stuxnet and of its successors have allegedly cracked the mechanism underlying the trust model.\n\nThere is a very important consideration to be done by analyzing the case Stuxnet, the malware used valid stolen certificates. Consequense of that is that other malware acts in the same way, for example the Zeus bot looks for any certificates stored on an infected host for possible later usage.\n\nThe use of digitally signed code of an application has main purpose is to increase the trust in the development process, avoiding fraud and software alterations. Using digital signed code the malwares are able to elude all controls and related alert provided for the execution of software developed by non-accredited firms.\n\nThere are two main problems that are implied by the above examples. First related to the development process that must be improved to protect application certificate and private keys. Software certificates stored on a development box that has Internet access is not a good idea. Ideally, but also more expensive and cumbersome, hardware certificates should be used to sign code. Likewise, signing certificates should be kept on a separate host that does not touch the rest of the network or the Internet.\n\nSecond problem is the wide-scoping inherent trust given to any signed certificate from a valid Certificate Authority. Why would my system inherently trust software that says it was developed by a credit union? Right now, the answer is because the Certificate Authority told it to. Too little, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThe malware spreads through malicious PDF files that drop it after exploiting Adobe Reader 8 but according F-Secure blog\n\n\u201cThis particular malware does not gain much advantage of the signature any more, as the mardi.gov.my certificate expired in the end of September.\u201d\n\nThe malware is currently detected as Trojan-Downloader:W32/Agent.DTIW.\n\n \n\nhttp://www.cybersquared.com/the-rise-of-digitally-signed-malware/\n\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/researchers-spot-malware-using-a-stolen-government-certificate/9813\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certificate", "topic_name": "Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Social Network \u201cin-security\u201d", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/192/cyber-crime/social-network-%e2%80%9cin-security%e2%80%9d.html", "title": "Social Network \u201cin-security\u201d\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 17, 2011", "body": "In recent years social networks have succeeded  in the historic feat of bringing to the web a growing number of users. Jupiter users, the elderly, individuals and businesses all within the large network, many, too much, share the total awareness of what happens when they put their credentials or when attracted by a novice or by a video click on a link.\n\nOr this behavior often blind managers of the major social platforms do not provide useful information because it can spread real awareness of the threat they face. Social networks have a primary purpose, they are designed to stimulate the sharing of personal information, more data a person discloses, more useful he is to the entire business.\n\nRecent events have demonstrated that social platforms implement policies very strict in terms of security, consider for example that they don\u2019t encourage users to choose strong passwords, they don\u2019t encourage users to change passwords periodically exposing them to serious risk. 80% of the users reuse the same weak credentials in different context, business and economic usage included.\n\nConsider that around 5 millions of FB accounts were compromised during last year and the numbers is expected to grow. This means that the entire trust chain can be compromised decreeing the end of the business model behind the Social network.  To contribute to the growth of the risks of using social networks is the massive use of mobile computing. The perception that a mobile device can be exposed to the same threats of a desktop pc is virtually nothing in common use. Some studies of the major antivirus software companies show that the user ignores even the possibility of \u201cinfecting\u201d a mobile device. If we project this conception in a work context, the entire security infrastructure could be undermined by what is the weak link in the chain, the undisciplined use of a social network perhaps even through a mobile device.\n\nAnother possible threat that affects social networks is the social engineering. Unprecedented growth of user base, ease of finding information about the victims through common search engines expose each user the possibility of being defrauded. The crime industry is well aware of the problem and potential revenues to the point that it is organized by providing real services for the collection of information relating to a potential victim of an attack. The social networking platforms have a huge quantity of information and knowledge for this reason  cyber criminals are interested to it.\n\nFor this thriving industry specific applications are designed to collection information, to aggregate profiles sharing particular attributes, systems able to analyze the social behavior of the victims identifying vulnerabilities  with the study of customs, traditions and relationships. The new frontier of social engineering. An example? Suppose we want to circumvent the user X, deputy manager for the project Y of a famous company. Knowing him relationships, creating new ones with fake profiles and managed ad hoc building for them a false reputation may soon come into possession of confidential info related to the project Y.\n\nBegin to make you an idea of the potential dangers? Another threat is carried by hackers who are able with various kinds of raids to insert malicious code directly into the social network through links or apps. Most of the time the user is redirected to sites designed to access personal information of the victim.  Incidents of hacktivism and cybercrime are growing, according official statistics because the increase over last year of similar events is about 300%.  The numbers are alarming but they represent only the tip of the iceberg of the phenomenon being referred to official cases and then analyzed. Most often  Cybercriminals use a technique called typosquatting, registering domains such as faecbook.com, fcaebok.com and so on in the hope of catching unwitting users.\n\nThese typosquatted domains are malicious in nature and pose a direct threat to your computing assets.  Websense, a leading content filtering company, has found that over 62% of active domains based on the most common misspellings of Facebook directed the user to malicious websites.  Consider the traffic volumes and the number of users involved in order to imagine the speed and capacity of spreading all kinds of malware.  This is called typosquatting. Cybercriminals are registering domains such as faecbook.com, fcaebok.com and so on in the hope of catching unwitting users.\n\nThese typosquatted domains are malicious in nature and pose a direct threat to your computing assets.  Researchers at Websense, a leading content filtering company, found that over 62% of active domains based on the most common misspellings of Facebook directed the user to malicious websites.  In a business context the above exponentially increases the risk of exposure. Social networks are a logical choice, the need to expose themselves in a market without borders, characterized by instant communication and the possibility to create an unlimited number of new relationships and then to run their business.\n\nBut the main risk in this case is the total absence of policies on the use of social media. Employees must have a thorough knowledge of the instrument, its potential and its risks, it is necessary to establish the objectives and parameters of a social initiative for the company, otherwise it goes against a disaster foretold. You must determine who is authorized to use social media on behalf of the company and what it is it allowed, what information can be managed in this area and what not at all.\n\nWhat are the conclusions? \u2026 Social networks are essential carrier in today\u2019s scenario, however we still have much to do in terms of user education. The cybercrime refines their weapons and before the threats  become unmanageable we must face the problem of security in depth.\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "SSL replacement?

KPN stopped issuing certificates after the detection of DDOS Tool on Server during an audit. First investigations have illustrated that the CA has been attacked four years ago.\n\nWhat really scares KPN of the story is that the same company, even before being a CA, is a state telephone company, and this opens up frightening scenarios on the security of information managed by it so far.\n\nAfter shocking hacker attacks on DigiNotar, GlobalSign, Comodo, and other SSL certificate authorities new scenarios and technologies are assuming great appeal.  Many expert says that  the CA model is dated and ill-suited to current needs. The alternative that more parties claim is \u201cConvergence\u201d.\n\nThe authentication process called Convergence implements a decentralized model which can allow anyone to run one or more \u201cnetwork notary servers\u201d.\n\nConvergence is radically different from the actual scenario where the Web of trust is based on a SSL server certificate signed by a CA and recognized by the user\u2019s browser, based on recognition of the certificate authority.\n\nThe trouble is that the entire framework based on root CAs being impenetrable, which the recent CA attacks prove not true. Attackers can break into a CA and use its secret key to sign rogue certificates of their own invention compromising the entire chain of trust. There is also the possibility of CAs being compromised by criminals or governments to create rogue certificates. The signature on a rogue certificate checks out as authentic, brealing the entire chain of trust.\n\nIn the Convergence model a network notary server is connected to the Internet and is able to monitors websites building an history of the SSL certificate managed by each site. Notary servers or groups of notary servers may be operated by public organizations, private companies, or even individuals.\n\nNotaries were in a position to track browser behavior by collecting a set of connection information  for each request and logging the SSL certificates it queried. Convergence attempts to guard against this by enabling each notary to serve in two distinct modes, either making SSL certificate queries, or acting as a relay (\u201cbounce node\u201d function).\n\nRather than validating an SSL certificate by checking for certificate authority approval, the browser validates a certificate based on the history related to the certificates observed by the network notaries over time. This mean that using a network notary servers located everywhere around the world and building an history of data, it is impossible for an attacker to launch a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nRather than employing a traditionally hard-coded list of immutable CAs, Convergence allows you to configure a dynamic set of Notaries which use network perspective to validate your communication.\n\nNo more cost to acquire HTTPS certificate, it is one of the main advantages.\n\nAny web-server in fact can simply auto generates an SSL certificate that can be observed by notaries and as a result trusted by user\u2019s browsers. All that is necessary is that the server is plugged into the network and automated probing by notary servers takes care of the rest. Each notary can only make security decisions for the clients that have chosen to trust it and this mean that the security, integrity, or accuracy of a notary does not effect those who haven\u2019t selected it.\n\nConvergence allows you to choose who you want to trust, rather than having someone else\u2019s decision forced on you. You can revise your trust decisions at any time, so that you\u2019re not locked in to trusting anyone for longer than you want.\n\nIt is very fast.\n\nSo what is missing today because of the convergence will become a new de facto standard?\n\nTo be successful, the model will need a critical mass, actual notary number are still limited despite the rapid growth.\n\nOther convergence problems are:\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ca", "topic_name": "CA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certificate", "topic_name": "Certificate"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/certification-authority", "topic_name": "Certification Authority"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/convergence", "topic_name": "Convergence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ssl", "topic_name": "SSL"}]}]}]
