Although the marketplaces were never identified, one can assume by the sheer amount of profit that the marketplaces were big-named ones like AlphaBay and Dream Market.\u201cHe would post fake links on forums to these markets which would direct users to a fake login page hosted on a laptop at his house. The login page would look exactly like the real login pages for the various market sites. When users would attempt to log in, he would steal their usernames and passwords.\u201dAfter logging in, Richo was able to transfer money from his victims\u2019 bitcoin wallet to his own. From there, he\u2019d convert the Bitcoin dollars into real dollars and deposit the funds into his Bank of America account. Richo also obtained the Bitcoin dollars via Green Dot prepaid debit cards, Western Union withdrawals, and MoneyGram transfers.The profit totaled over $365,000. Richo finally took a fall in 2013, when a criminal complaint was filed against him after he spent time bragging on dark web forums about his illegal business.After keenly monitoring his activity over the gollowing year, authorities were finally able to gain access to his home. This allowed them to confiscate all electronics; including computers, hard drives, and various other storage devices.Richo now faces up to 30 years in prison with the charges \u201caccess device fraud\u201d and \u201cmoney laundering\u201d.

A group calling themselves the Tsar Team hacked into the Grozio Chirurgija servers and stole over 25,000 private photos (including nude ones). After stealing the private files, the group demanded ransoms from the patrons of the clinic. Although the number of affected clients is unknown, the victim-base is 60 countries wide and dozens have come forward to report the blackmailing.However, the pictures were only the tip of the iceberg. Tsar Team obtained sensitive data ranging from passport scans to national insurance numbers. Before targeting the individual clients, the group attempted to demand a ransom from the clinic itself. Their price for the entire database was 300 bitcoin \u2013 over $6 million dollars in USD. Despite the Tsar Team\u2019s desperate efforts for cash, it was clear the clinic and its clients weren\u2019t going to satisfy their demands.In retaliation of their failed advances, the Tsar Team released several hundred of the private images back in March. After months of silence, the unaffected felt they were safe from the fire. They were wrong. On May 30th, 2017 the Tsar Team released the rest of the clinic\u2019s database. Although little is known on this hacker group, rumors are beginning to surface the web. A blogger at The Guardian writes,\u201cTsar Team is another name for the hacking group known to security researchers as APT28 or \u201cFancy Bear\u201d, which has been linked to hacks on the Democratic National Committee, En Marche and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. It is not yet known whether the hackers that attacked Grozio Chirurgija are linked to APT28, or if they\u2019re an unrelated group that adopted the same name for disinformation purposes.\u201d"}, {"topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Hacking News", "News"], "title": "New Bill Proposing the Legalization of Revenge Hacking", "authur": "Mandee", "date": "June 1, 2017", "body": "Earlier this year, a bill was proposed by GOP congressman Tom Graves.
