[{"authur": "Waqas", "body": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Europol and Dutch National Police have seized two of the most popular Dark Web marketplaces including AlphaBay and Hansa.According to Europol, \u201cthe infrastructure of an underground criminal economy responsible for the trading of over 350 000 illicit commodities including drugs, firearms and cybercrime malware.\u201dOn 4th July, AlphaBay, apparently the biggest dark web marketplace after the Silk Road, went offline and users believed that the site\u2019s admins had scammed them. However, one of its admins committed suicide in a Thai prison cell, and it turned out that the domain was busted and in the control of the FBI since 4th July.Now, those visiting the AlphaBay marketplace can see a page explaining that the domain had been seized since July 4, 2017. Here is a full preview of the warning page uploaded by the FBI:\u201cThis hidden site has been seized since July 4, 2017. A s a part of law enforcement operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and European law enforcement agencies acting through Europol \u2013 In accordance with the law of European member states and obtained pursuant to a forfeiture order by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California and the US Department of Justice\u2019s Computer Crime & Intellectual Property Section.\u201dLike AlphaBay, Hansa was also a popular dark web marketplace where vendors could sell illegal drugs, weapons, documents, malware and databases stolen from Internet giants. In fact, Hansa made news for being home to vendors selling database including Dropbox, MySpace, LinkedIn, Anti-Public Combo list and thousands of other high profile databases.Now, Hansa has also been seized by the feds and right now its domain is displaying a similar message to that of AplhaBay. The alert message on Hansa domain reveals that the Feds took control of the marketplace on June 20, 2017 and kept an eye on the activities of buyers and sellers for over a month.It can be expected that sooner or later Feds will bust those involved in buying and selling illegal goods. Here is a full preview of the alert message visitors can see on Hanse marketplace:\u201cThis hidden site has been seized and controlled since June 20 by the Dutch National Police in conjunction with the Bundeskriminalamt, Lietuvos Policija, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Europol, under the authority of the Dutch National Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Attorney General\u2019s office of the Federal State of Hessia (Germany).\u201dIn a press release, Europol has stated that: \u201cThis is an outstanding success by authorities in Europe and the US. The capability of drug traffickers and other serious criminals around the world has taken a serious hit today after a highly sophisticated joint action in multiple countries,\u201d Rob Wainwright, Europol Executive Director said. \u201cBy acting together on a global basis the law enforcement community has sent a clear message that we have the means to identify criminality and strike back, even in areas of the Dark Web. There are more of these operations to come.\u201dRemember, in 2015, Feds also seized anonymous marketplace \u2018Silk Road\u2019 and arrested its owner Ross William Ulbricht who is now in prison for life.This is the third successful joint operation in the last two years conducted by law enforcement authorities from the United States and Europe to shut down illegal online platforms. In July 2016, authorities successfully closed down the Kickass torrent site and arrested its owner Artem Vaulin.Apple and Facebook played a vital role in Vaulin\u2019s arrest by providing the IP address of an iTunes transaction he conducted. The same IP Address was used on the same day to login into the KAT Facebook account and rest was history.Although authorities are busting dark web marketplace, it\u2019s only a matter of time before a new platform emerges to sell illegal goods. For now, both AlphaBay and Hansa sites are seizedSponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "dark web", "Europol", "FBI", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "security"], "title": "Dark Web\u2019 AlphaBay and Hansa Marketplaces Seized by Feds", "date": "July 20, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "If you have stored funds at Parity Technologies, a smart contract coding firm, multi-signature wallet then it is the right time to move them to normal wallets. Parity has issued security alert of \u201ccritical\u201d nature to make customers aware of an exploitable vulnerability in its multi-signature wallet software. Reportedly, the vulnerability has been identified in the software\u2019s versions 1.5 and above. As a result, their wallet software became the target of malicious objectives of threat actors as hackers stole 150,000 eth Ethereumers (equivalent to $32 million) from Parity. Etherscan.io has confirmed the data loss.According to Parity, a bug in its popular wallet software called \u201cwallet.sol\u201d allowed hackers to access it and steal such a hefty amount from the company. The issue has now been dealt with and hackers from the White Hat Group have recovered around 377,000 potentially exploitable Ethereum. The firm has urged its customers using 1.5 or a later version of the software to transfer their tokens to some other secure address immediately. It must be noted that the data breach has affected multi-signature wallet software only and normal wallets are safe.Gavin Wood, the founder and CTO at Parity, wrote on Parity Gitter channel that hackers managed to breach three Ethereum addresses. Wood further acknowledged that the company is currently trying to transfer funds in other wallets to make them secure from being stolen.Manual Araoz, the creator of Proof of Existence, claims that this particular wallet is of very significant nature since the compromised Ethereum belongs to famous entities.

However, the various, far-reaching drawbacks associated with connecting every system and machinery with the Internet are being continually ignored by organizations. KQED, a prominent public TV and radio station in San Francisco, is an example that shows how badly a corporation suffers when ransomware hits these internet linked devices. KQED has been trying to recover from the damages of a huge ransomware attack since over a month, but still many of its systems have failed to respond.The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the station received a massive ransomware attack on June 15. The attack and its incurred damages are so severe that it has been \u201cbombed back to 20 years ago, technology-wise\u201d as per the analysis of one KQED\u2019s senior editor Queena Kim.It is being said so because, after the attack, the station\u2019s computer systems\u2019 hard drives got locked, station\u2019s internal email server went offline and pre-recorded segments were totally wiped out. For over 12 hours the online broadcast of the station remained offline, and official Wi-Fi connection also went offline for many days.However, the FM broadcast of the station was not interrupted. Due to the yet irreversible damages, the station is operating by manually printing and distributing scripts while broadcasters are using stopwatches instead of content management system for generating timestamps. Furthermore, the station\u2019s technical support staff disconnected all devices, tools, and machinery connected to the internet to restrict the infection.Experts believe that this attack cannot be linked with Petya, a cyber-sabotage tool attacking corporate entities across Europe including high-profile firms FedEx and Maersk. FedEx said earlier that the company is still suffering the aftermath of Petya attack and might cause permanent damage to their Key Systems.However, this particular ransomware, which attacked KQED, proved to be incredibly devastating for the station since the attackers demanded thousands of dollars for returning a single encrypted file bringing the total cost of decryption to millions of dollars.Attackers demanded 1.7 Bitcoin (approx. $3,637) per encrypted file, and there were tens of thousands of encrypted files. The ransom amount was way higher than the station\u2019s annual revenue of $71.6 million. The station was unable to pay such a hefty sum for the data, and hence, it resorted to its technical support staff to resolve the issue.The whole experience has been a challenging one for KQED. According to its executive editor Holly Kernan, it was an \u201castonishing\u201d experience that showed then the kind of changes required to \u201cmake going forward\u201d easier. Kernan stated that they had learned a lot from this attack such as they need to have \u201cseparate networks in different parts of the organization so that we\u2019re all working in a more secure environment.\u201dIt is indeed upsetting that despite having embedded latest technology, up-to-date antivirus system, updated firewalls, a number of reliable malware detection programs and email scanning software, the station could not thwart the attack. This means malware developers are well-aware of the currently available tools and software that could help in containing ransomware attacks and that\u2019s why they are coming up with bigger and more dangerous software to attack organizations and mint money.The attack has been reported to the FBI, and the station is busy in rebuilding the lost systems and making its network secure enough to avoid future malware attacks. However, the FBI has a history of engorging victims to pay the ransom, therefore, one should not expect much from the investigations.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Petya", "Ransomware", "security"], "title": "Ransomware attack on KQED TV, Radio Station wiped out pre-recorded segments", "date": "July 19, 2017"}, {"authur": "Owais Sultan", "body": "If e-commerce had seven dirty words, chargeback (a demand by a credit-card provider for a retailer to make good the loss on a fraudulent or disputed transaction) would definitely be one of them. A chargeback is what happens when a credit card customer disputes a and your e-commerce store is forced to refund the transaction. In cases of fraud, this means you could wind up repaying the amount of the disputed transaction\u2014in addition to related shipping costs and chargeback fines\u2014as well as losing your merchandise to the fraudster. It\u2019s enough to make any merchant reconsider accepting credit cards in the first place. This is why Verified by Visa, and MasterCard SecureCode were created to prevent e-commerce chargebacks.The two most commonly encountered chargebacks stem from instances of Fraudulent Transaction claims and Cardholder Does Not Recognize Transaction complaints. Very simple for consumers to initiate, a cardholder can easily open a claim online, and you will be required to defend the charge\u2014or forfeit the revenue.Verified by Visa (VbV) and MasterCard SecureCode (3DS) require a customer to provide a personal identification number (PIN) in addition to the card number, expiration date, and security code when conducting a transaction.Known as 3-D Secure systems, their PINs serve as the customer\u2019s digital signature. It\u2019s very difficult for perpetrators of fraud to conduct transactions using pilfered card numbers with this added layer of authentication in place. So much so, if a claim is filed against a 3-D Secure transaction, the card companies shift the burden of proof from the merchant to the bank that issued the card.In an environment in which 51 percent of people with internet access choose to avoid engaging in online transactions due to privacy and security concerns, next to conducting a careful e-commerce solutions comparison before setting up your store, this can be one of the most important choices you can make for your store.Merchants get the following protections when VbV and 3DS protocols are in place.\u00b7 Guaranteed payment of full authentications when a PIN is entered\u00b7 Guaranteed payment on attempted authentications when a cardholder is not enrolled on all domestic Visa transactions and all international MasterCard transactions\u00b7 Liability is shifted from a secure payment merchant to the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank in instances of fraud\u00b7 Heavily reduced fraud-screening costsOver 75 percent of online transactions are protected from fraudulent chargebacks and guaranteed for payment with 3-D Secure Payment Authentication in place. Further, consumers have proven more confident shopping on Verified by VISA, and MasterCard SecureCode enabled sites. The average dollar value of a Verified by VISA transaction is $173, which is more than triple the $56 standard online VISA transaction.However, some merchants have found consumers will abandon shopping carts when confronted with the additional step of entering a PIN to complete their purchase. While this seems counter-intuitive, keep in mind any obstacle placed in the path of an e-commerce consumer at checkout can make them decide to abort the transaction\u2014even one designed to ensure the security of their personal data.To avoid this, offering alternative methods of payment such as PayPal can stave off a sudden spike in abandonment after instituting the protocols. While you will incur more in fees, the logic is it\u2019s better to make the sale and pay more than not make the sale at all.Another strategy to overcome this reticence is to give your frequent shoppers a pass when it comes to deploying Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode to prevent e-commerce chargebacks. After all, returning shoppers tend to be less likely to engage in fraudulent transactions.Either way, these 3-D Secure Systems have proven to be a very useful tool.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Banking", "hacking", "internet", "MasterCard", "Phishing", "Scam", "security", "Technology", "Visa"], "title": "How Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode Can Prevent E-commerce Chargebacks", "date": "July 19, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Satellite antenna systems are not spared from vulnerabilities and are quite prone to cyber-attacks, which makes devices and machinery from which these systems are connected to potential targets of hackers.

Moreover, the VSAT system can be connected to other devices onboard and used as a gateway for gaining access to any vessel\u2019s broader onboard network. This would allow a hacker to cause considerable damage.Interestingly, VSAT systems are used in certain aircraft too. This means, not only ships but aircraft are also vulnerable to hack attacks. It must be noted that VSAT communication systems are quite common in large shipping vessels and aircraft, military and passenger planes and private jets.Exposed VSAT devices could also impact connected airplanes.

It is a hand-held USB stick easily available at Amazon and can substantially help in deactivating wireless burglar alarm systems.Priced at just $142 (\u00a3109), this gadget is going to increase problems for users of wireless burglar alarm systems that do not have external sirens since criminals can switch them off conveniently with just a click.The revelation was made by The Mail after a thorough investigation on YARD Stick One. It was identified that criminals could easily switch off an alarm within mere seconds through jamming the signals of battery-operated sensors installed across the premises of the alarm system.The purpose of these sensors is to create a sound whenever someone tries to gain entry to a property discreetly. This USB stick has a small antenna that has to be connected to a laptop and then the signals can be jammed. It is quite surprising that YARD Stick One is so easily available on Amazon considering that selling and buying of jamming devices are banned across the UK.To probe the issue, The Mail\u2019s team bought this device from Amazon along with a wireless alarm system called ERA miGuard from Maplin, a famous electronics store. miGuard wi-fi alarm system can be installed manually or remotely using its smartphone app. Once activated it protects the household by producing siren like sound and sending out a notification to the smartphone alerting homeowners regarding any attempt of an unauthorized entry.To tests the possibility of hacking of this system, The Mail\u2019s investigation team installed the miGuard alarm system in a house and with the permission of the homeowner tried to deactivate the alarm using YARD Stick One. Surprisingly, it took them only a few seconds to jam the alarm from outside the home. The team downloaded a computer code script, also easily available, to instruct the device to not create any sound or send a notification when someone enters the house.Hence, it was proved that deactivating wireless alarm of this particular brand was possible through YARD Stick One. Once done, the team notified alarm manufacturer regarding the issue. It must be noted that the testing was conducted in public interest only.However, renowned cyber-security testing firm Pen Test Partners\u2019 founder Ken Munro stated that the issue is not restricted to this brand only and many of the wireless burglar alarms available in the market currently are vulnerable. The reason being that majority of these alarm systems operate similarly. Munro further stated that there might be \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of burglar alarm systems installed at homes that are vulnerable to this sort of hacking.He urged alarm system manufacturers to intensify their product\u2019s security to avoid major mishaps in the future. Moreover, Munro requests consumers to be wise and watch-out for two-way systems having the capability of detecting jamming.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Privacy", "security", "USB"], "title": "Hackers Can Breach Burglar Alarm System with $142 Device", "date": "July 18, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "FedEx, a US based globally operating delivery firm, states that customers associated with its subsidiary company TNT Express are continually facing issues.

The company managed to restore IT and service systems immediately, but customers are still complaining about \u201cservice and invoicing delays\u201d even after the passage of three weeks since the systems were attacked with Petya.Details of the attack were released officially by FedEx in SEC 10-K filing on Monday. FedEx is still clueless regarding the revival of some of the affected systems.\u201cWe cannot yet estimate how long it will take to restore the systems that were impacted,\u201d FedEx\u2019s 10-K filing stated. SEC report also clarified that it was quite possible that TNT may never be able to \u201cfully restore all of the affected systems and recover all of the critical business data that was encrypted by the virus.\u201dReportedly, a majority of the affected computers were linked with the TNT Express\u2019s B.V.

The company maintains that none of the data stored on TNT Express\u2019s network has been stolen and only the \u201coperations and communications\u201d of TNT have been affected.FedEx is likely to receive hefty financial impact post malware attack. According to the 10-K filing, the company expects losses in revenues, the increment in bad debt expenses, widespread customer loss, considerable increase in remediation costs for systems restore, higher operational costs and requirement of massive investments for making systems fool proof to avoid future attacks. Furthermore, unavoidable reputational damage, costs involved in follow up the governmental investigation and critical business and third party data loss are also among the company\u2019s major obstacles.

Other targets of Petya include law firm DLA Piper, pharmaceutical magnet Merck, Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez, construction materials manufacturer Saint-Gobain, container transporter Maersk and oil firm Rosneft.In case you are wondering what Petya malware is, it is a cyber-weapon that has been created for targeting Ukraine based organizations. However, unfortunately, internal networks and VPNs facilitated the spreading of Petya to other countries.Experts state that Petya is a poorly coded malware that makes it impossible to recover data mainly because one of the encryption keys got misplaced. Moreover, Petya is not actually a ransomware but a cyber-sabotage tool. The ransomware started spreading in Ukraine from June 28th, and FedEx\u2019s trading was abruptly stopped after the Petya infection invaded TNT\u2019s systems through Ukraine tax-related accounting software M.E.Docs. This particular software is one of the two most important packages that are responsible for the company\u2019s business operations in Ukraine. As noted by FedEx in its 10-K filing:\u201cTNT Express operates in Ukraine and uses the software that was compromised, which allowed the virus to infiltrate TNT Express systems and encrypt its data.\u201dFedEx published its 10-K filing at the same time when world\u2019s insurance giant Lloyd\u2019s issued a report on the possibility of losses worth $121.4 bn worldwide due to a well-planned cyber-attack.

However, sometimes, scammers are much less sophisticated and simply play on a user\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding a few things.Many WhatsApp users might remember having to pay a little subscription fee amounting to $0.99 for having their WhatsApp service on. However, what we also know is that the social media giant ended the subscription long ago in January 2016. However, once it ended, the fake messages regarding the subscriptions did not.Indeed, scammers did not leave out such a simple way to have users duped. As such, the London police, specifically, the Action Fraud unit, which is the department that deals with cyber crime, recently discovered a campaign where spammers send emails to victims, notifying that their WhatsApp subscription is about to end.The email simply states that the user was running a trial version of the app and that the users have exceeded the one-year limit. As such, the user is asked to renew the service, to continue WhatsApp use.However, the emails have been asking the users to provide their banking details in order to pay for the subscriptions. This is where the scam relies on stealing a victim\u2019s bank details. The email has a link to a customer portal where the victim is tricked into entering his/her details.Although the exact reason for the collecting the bank details is not known, it is, however, quite obvious that the scam is meant to commit further frauds using the details stolen as such.The police have urged the victims not to report the email to the police immediately. Furthermore, the Action Fraud unit is working toward providing support to those who have been tricked into providing the details.Essentially, it is recommended to use antivirus software to prevent such emails. The software will prevent the user from accessing a page that might be infected with the malware.Lastly, the email apparently has a few spelling mistakes which make it quite obvious that it is not from the official WhatsApp team. But unsuspecting users can still fall for the scam \u2013 so watch out..u95131e46e1aef6d471feee7ec00a5731{padding:0px;margin:0;padding-top:1em!important;padding-bottom:1em!important;width:100%;display:block;font-weight:bold;background-color:#eaeaea;border:0!important;border-left:4px solid #34495E!important;box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-moz-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-o-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-webkit-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.17);text-decoration:none}.u95131e46e1aef6d471feee7ec00a5731:active,.u95131e46e1aef6d471feee7ec00a5731:hover{opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms;text-decoration:none}.u95131e46e1aef6d471feee7ec00a5731{transition:background-color 250ms;webkit-transition:background-color 250ms;opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms}.u95131e46e1aef6d471feee7ec00a5731 .ctaText{font-weight:bold;color:#C0392B;text-decoration:none;font-size:16px}.u95131e46e1aef6d471feee7ec00a5731 .postTitle{color:#000;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:16px}.u95131e46e1aef6d471feee7ec00a5731:hover .postTitle{text-decoration:underline!important}Related:  Researchers Warn Against \u201cfree internet without Wi-Fi\u201d WhatsApp ScamSponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Fraud", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Scam", "security", "WhatsApp"], "title": "Fake WhatsApp Subscription Email Stealing Banking Data", "date": "July 17, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Perhaps it is not so surprising to see powerful malware now being created to target Android devices. Researchers at Trend Micro recently discovered yet another malicious software that infects Android devices and ends up stealing pretty much anything for the attacker.The new malware goes by the name of GhostCtrl (a variant of OmniRAT) as Trend Micro discovered it as ANDROIDOS_GHOSTCTRL.OPS / ANDROIDOS_GHOSTCTRL.OPSA. Up till now, the team has found out three versions of the malware with each version having certain capabilities.The first version, as Trend Micro notes, is capable of gaining admin privileges and once the malware is in the system, it automatically starts to evolve so that more of the device can be hijacked.The second version, on the other hand, has mobile hacking capabilities as it can lock mobile screens while resetting mobile passwords. Furthermore, the second version can virtually take control of the infected phone\u2019s camera and secretly take photos along with videos and upload them to the command-and-control center.The third version is for making the detection of the malware incredibly difficult since it is associated with a wrapper APK which is used to cover up the actual APK that undertakes all the malicious routines.Essentially, the malware come as fake apps masked with legitimate names such as PokemonGO, WhatsApp, etc. If the app is downloaded, it launches an APK which is the linchpin of the entire malware.The APK will prompt the user to install the app and the user cannot undo the installation. That is, even if the user tries to cancel the installation, the APK will keep displaying the prompt.After the APK is installed, the wrapper APK will start to run and allow the actual APK to run in the background.One of the things that cause the user to think that the APK is legitimate is that once it is launched, it will start a process by the name of com.android.engine which causes the user to think that the app is running a real process.Subsequently, GhostCtrl connects with its command-and-control center through a domain and receives all sorts of commands that allow the malware to do anything from stealing text messages to manipulating the phone\u2019s camera, browser, Bluetooth, etc.Although the malware is quite powerful, the threat can be mitigated by keeping your device updated. Furthermore, Trend Micro recommends users and organizations to set their devices and systems to least privileges.

It is the first of its kind as it is being sold online at a low price which is between $7 to $13.It is not common to hear malware being sold at such a low price that can be easily accessed by potential criminals who are probably starting their journey as cyber criminals. However, Ovidiy seems to have changed all of that.According to Proofpoint researchers, the malware is essentially a password stealer that was available on the product\u2019s official website ovidiystealer[.]ru. And like any other consumer product website, it features customer reviews, statistics regarding the sales and efficacy of the product and much more.The website also mentions strong customer support along with providing updates regarding any future releases of the product. Furthermore, in order to make things easier, the website allows customers to pay using RoboKassa (Russian platform for online money transfer), which is similar to PayPal. Customers can use their credit cards to make payments.Ovidiy is currently being sold in the Russian market and has a number of versions. Research shows that the malware entered the scene in June last month. As of now, the researchers have detected versions 1.0.1 to 1.0.5.The malware is written in .NET and the executable files are encrypted making further analysis and investigation difficult. Furthermore, the author of the malware goes by the name of \u201cTheBottle.\u201dIt is being marketed in different modules with each module affecting a specific internet browser. Currently, the browsers which the malware modules affect include Google Chrome, FileZilla, Kometa, Amigo, Torch, Orbitum, and Opera \u2013 Customers can buy as little as a single module.The malware is being distributed as email attachments, downloadable links, software, game applications and as a hacking tool. It is being distributed through websites that offer file hosting and keygens.Once the attachment or the infected file has been executed, the malware will be stored in the victim\u2019s directory and will perform its commands from the directory. The malware connects to its command-and-control center through SSL/TLS connection and makes use of the same domain as that of the website.Furthermore, although the malware is detectable by antivirus software, it is, however, marked with only a heuristic detection which means that security analysists may disregard the significance of the malware, despite noting the odd behavior.It also means that corporate networks may result in sending alerts, but since the malware has not been specifically detected, no action might be taken.Quite surprisingly though, the researchers state that the malware does not come with a persistence mechanism. Essentially, it will stop working once the computer is rebooted.Proofpoint points out the way in which the malware market is innovating, making it ever harder for companies to upgrade their security systems in order to prevent the threats.Indeed, with the release of Ovidiy, anyone can easily hack into a computer and steal valuable information. With the increase in dark web marketplaces where stolen credentials can be cashed in for immediate profits, the market for such malware looks highly promising to criminals who want a quick return on investment.At the time of publishing this article, ovidiystealer[.]ru website has been removed.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "internet", "Malware", "Password", "Russia", "security", "Windows"], "title": "You can buy password stealing malware \u2018Ovidiy Stealer\u2019 for $7", "date": "July 15, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Gandi SAS, a French web hosting company has announced that it suffered a security breach after hackers got hold of the valid login details to one of the company\u2019s technical providers who manage a number of geographic TLDs.The hackers were then able to divert traffic for over 751 domains to a malicious website. Gandi had issued an incident report according to which the breach took place on July 7 at 11:00 UTC (4:00 AM PDT) when hackers modified the name servers [NS] of the targeted domains.The incident report also reveals that the traffic diversion to the malicious site exploited security flaws in several browsers. Furthermore, Gandi shared a full list of affected TLDs (Top-level domain) which included: Barry Shteiman, Director of Threat Research at Exabeam commented on the issue and told HackRead that: \u201cThe theft of IDs and passwords is by far the most common goal for today\u2019s cyber attackers. Valid credentials really are the keys to the kingdom, once a hacker has them, they have a legitimate means to access files and databases at will, or as in the Gandi case, make changes to critical services in order to cause havoc.\u201d\u201cTo stop such cases, businesses need to be able to detect the unusual use of valid credentials. This is why behavioral analytics has grown so quickly over the last couple of years. It can help combat insider threats by notifying the security team when someone is doing something that is unusual and risky, both on an individual basis and compared to peers.\u201dWhile Switch, the registry for .ch domains was also alerted about this incident in which attackers used domains to spread malware in \u201cdrive-by\u201d style attacks. In a security notice, Michael Hausding of Switch said that a .ch domain owner alerted the company that his .ch zone points to the wrong name servers. In some cases, the domains were diverted to Rig Exploit Kit.\u201cThe NS entries were ns1.dnshost[.]ga and ns2.dnshost[.]ga. We contacted the registrar and soon realized that this is not the only domain that had unauthorized changes. We identified 93 additional .ch and .li domain names that pointed to the two rogue name servers. While domain hijacking by pointing to a rogue NS is a known attack, 94 domains on a single day is very unusual. So we analyzed what the hijacked domains were used for and soon found out that they are used to infect internet users with malware,\u201d writes Hausding.At the time of publishing this article, both Gandi and Switch reported that issue has been resolved.

The malware is considered quite powerful as it can bypass Apple\u2019s gatekeeper and effectively steal users\u2019 credentials.It is relatively rare to hear news about Mac devices getting compromised due to malware. It is usually Windows that gets infected.Nevertheless, perhaps due to the increasing popularity of Apple devices, cybercriminals have started to shift their focus from Windows to Mac, making users realize that Mac is not as safe as it is believed to be.According got a blog post by Checkpoint, one of the things that the researchers pointed out is that the creators of the malware are purchasing as many Apple certificates as they can.This is because they attach the certificate with the malware so that it can bypass Apple\u2019s gatekeeper, which is essential, the only thing keeping away malicious software from entering devices.As soon as Apple was informed of this, it rushed to revoke the many certificates it believes have been compromised. However, new certificates are appearing on the scene at an ever-greater speed.The malware was first detected in May this year. However, at the time, all it did was steal credentials from websites and spied on network traffic. The new version, on the other hand, has many superior capabilities.The malware mimics known banking websites in order to trick the users into entering their credentials. The scam begins by tricking the user into downloading infected files in spam emails.As soon as the malware is installed, it disables all security protocols so that it is not detected and begins redirecting all the traffic from Apple servers to the local machine itself. Removal of the malware is difficult as it firmly embeds in the Apple system.Subsequently, it connects to its command-and-control center through a TOR enabled connection and reads the IP address of the victim\u2019s device. This allows it to tailor its infection accordingly. For instance, the malware will present fake websites of banks that are present in the specific location of the victim.The malware not only prompts the user into entering his/her credentials as part of logging into the fake websites but also makes the user download a legitimate message app called Signal. Victims are asked for their phone numbers in order to get SMS authentication for this.Although the intended purpose of making users download the messaging app is unknown, researchers, however, believe that it might be used to conduct further fraudulent activities or perhaps allow the attacker to assess the success rate of the scam by monitoring the number of downloads.In any case, the attacker can track all the communication of the victim through the malware.Retefe was a Trojan that targeted Windows in the same way that OSX/Dok is targeting Mac. As such, researchers believe that Retefe has essentially been ported from Windows to Mac.This is quite worrisome as researchers predict more of such malware being ported from Windows to Mac. Given that Mac lacks the required security protocols to prevent infections from such malware, it can be quite catastrophic for Mac users in the future.Despite the powerful threat the malware poses to Mac users, it is still not much of a concern as the malware relies on a very basic form of social engineering to execute itself.That is, the user needs to download the executable from a phishing email. As long as users are aware of spam emails from unknown addresses, infections can be limited.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Apple", "internet", "Mac", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "OSX/Dok malware hits Macs; bypasses Apple\u2019 Gatekeeper", "date": "July 15, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "A week ago we reported that AlphaBay, apparently the biggest dark web marketplace after the Silk Road went offline and users believed that they have been scammed by the site\u2019s admins.

However, unlike Silk Road which sold drugs, AlphaBay was involved in the selling of different types of products such as stolen credit card numbers and databases etc.Also, reports say that the sale of such credit cards alone amounted to USD 5 million in 2017. Furthermore, according to the director of Recorded Future Inc., Andrei Barysevich, the marketplace had transactions worth $600,000 to $800,000 taking place every day.Authorities in the U.S., Canada, and Thailand ran a coordinated plan to arrest the founder, Alexandre Cazes, a 46-year-old Canadian male, the Wall Street Journal reports. The operation led to the arrest of Cazes who was taken into custody on the 5th of July and put in prison in Thailand.The Wall Street Journal reports that after the arrest, the website was shut down leading the users of the marketplace to panic as they thought that it was an exit scam, in which scammers simply stop operating a site after they have raked in enough money.When Cazes was arrested, he was found to be in possession of four Lamborghinis and USD 11.7 million in Thai currency.According to Bangkok Post, during the time Cazes was about to be extradited to U.S, a prison guard found him dead in the cell. Reports say that he hanged himself with a towel at the Narcotics Suppression Bureau in Laksi district.Although the website has been shut down and the main perpetrator dead, there are concerns as to any accomplices that might have been involved in the operation of AlphaBay.In fact, previously, when Silk Road was taken down with Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the website, being arrested, there were no accomplices identified at the time.

In relation to this specific case, there are technologies available today that could have quickly, easily and cost effectively ensured the appropriate configuration of the cloud service, denied unauthorized access and encrypted the sensitive data at rest. Companies like Verizon must insist that third party vendors like Nice protect their customer data as they move it to the public cloud.\u201dThomas Fischer, threat researcher and global security advocate at Digital Guardian said that: \u201cThe advent of new computing platforms and data protection legislation, such as the GDPR, have combined to create the perfect storm. Now, threatened with significant fines for non-compliance, organizations must ensure data is secure across the entire supply chain and across all platforms. In order to adapt to these changes, organizations need to take into account new threat vectors that simply would not have existed even a few years ago. If Verizon had an effective security policy review process in place and was integrating third parties into this methodology, this incident could likely have been avoided. Outsourcing to new technology partners does not mean that you can reduce security initiatives. In fact, it actually means you need to put in place a stronger set of controls.\u201dThe question which remains unanswered is why an Israeli company is keeping call records of Verizon Wireless customers without informing them. It seems like the American telecom giant has put the privacy of its millions of customers at risk since it is the company\u2019s responsibility to secure user data.Also, if the data had gone into the hands of cyber criminals, one could have expected large-scale social engineering scams. In case the data was downloaded by a spy agency of another country, it would have been a jackpot for them.However, this is not the first time when Verizon Wireless had its data exposed online. In March 2016, the company suffered a massive data breach in which data of 1.5 million customers was stolen. In 2012, 3 million customer records of the company were leaked online after a hacker breached Verizon\u2019s database.Verizon is claiming that personal data of 6 million customers have been leaked online. However, UpGuard researchers are sticking with the initial number of 14 million users.Source: UpGuardSponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Amazon", "breach", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Verizon", "Vulnerability"], "title": "14 Million Verizon Customer Records Exposed", "date": "July 12, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Android mobile operating system is often in the news for being targeted by cyber criminals.

Therefore it can allow attackers to create a domain admin account and gain full control over the attacked network.As for the RDP, if you are a Windows user you may be aware of its functionality; it allows users to connect to a remote machine without volunteering their password to the remote machine that might be compromised. As a result, every attack performed with NTLM, such as credential relaying and password cracking, could be carried out against RDP Restricted-Admin.Preempt has alerted Microsoft about the issue and as a result, a patch for the first vulnerability has been issued while for the second one Microsoft stated that it\u2019s a known issue.It is recommended to visit Preempt\u2019s official blog post for more technical details and also watch the following demonstration video released by the security firm.It is a fact that Windows is responsible for 80% of malware infections which is possible due to critical security flaws that are discovered in the operating system now and then.

Almost every day, around 60 people signed up to the room and shared about 2,500 links to images depicting child abuse.The chat room was created in 2014 by Brett McBain who shared as many as 200,000 images of child abuse. Buckley, on the other hand, shared links to such images which amounted to 30,000.It was reported that Buckley and McBain met online through a similar dark web channel and managed to operate the chat room without meeting each other in person.The police were able to track down McBain after he used his name to sign up in his chat room. While Buckley appeared as a woman online, McBain registered himself as MrBrett.Essentially, the Western Australian Police told the National Crime Agency officers that a person with the username MrBrett was constantly online in the chat room. Consequently, McBain was arrested at his own home.McBain, who is from Balham, South London was charged with ten crimes involving child abuse and was consequently sentenced to five years of imprisonment. When McBain was arrested, he told that he is officially screwed.The police also discovered that he owned 160,000 images of child abuse along with an electronic diary in which McBain wrote his disturbing thought regarding child abuse.Buckley, on the other hand, was arrested and put to jail for three years having been charged for sharing images and serving as an accomplice to McBain.McBain has been described as an alcoholic while Buckley was apparently an individual with drug and alcohol issues. For Buckley, posing as a woman was a means through which he gained attention. He was registered as Ladybird in the chat room. As of now, the chat room has been disabled.Recorder Brian Altman QC stated that the case is particularly extreme given the numbers involved.Nevertheless, Western Australian Police has been working with the NCA to safeguard children against such abuse.Operation Amadeus was launched by the Western Australia police that led to the arrest of several men in Australia who were responsible for sharing disturbing images of children.Indeed, child abuse is a growing problem and according to Punam Chopra of the Crown Prosecution Service, dark web chat rooms such as these give easier access to indecent images which further fuels the demand for child abuse. And the images themselves are therefore a crime since, in each picture, a child is being abused.She stated that although authorities are working to mitigate the issue, a greater effort, however, is needed.It was just a few days ago when authorities in Germany shut down a dark web child porn site and busted the man responsible for creating it.

The machines use customer\u2019s credit card and fingerprints to authorize the transactions.According to Avanti Markets., approximately 1.6 million customers became the victims of the breach. Also, Avanti Markets stated in a blog post that the breach took place on the 4th of July, but the company learned about the incident only recently this week. Subsequently, a notice of data breach was published on its website.The hackers have apparently injected a malware in the network of the company\u2019s system. Avanti Markets stated that not all of the machines are configured in the same way, and therefore, some of the customers\u2019 accounts might have been breached while others may not have been affected at all.Avanti Markets decided to turn off all of their networks after the breach and stated that it is working with experts to fix the problem. Essentially, it said that steps are being taken to minimize the risk of further data breaches.However, according to a report, half of the kiosks do not use P2Pe, which is short for point-to-point encryption. It is a method to encrypt customer information so that incidents like these can be avoided.Last Thursday, a law firm reported that the kiosk in its premises was not accepting credit cards. A researcher from RiskAnalytics, Noah Dunker, subsequently wrote about the incident on his blog on the 4th of July.He stated the machine had been breached by a malware called PoSeidon which was transferring credit card information from the machine to the attackers. PoSeidon is a name for a family of malicious computer programs targeting Computerized Point-of-Sale systems.Also, the blog mentioned that along with the primary vendor, small local vendors who were supplying the technology were also affected by the malware. However, the names of the vendors were not revealed at the time.Later, a researcher from KrebsOnSecurity asked Dunker whether the primary vendor he mentioned was Avanti. Dunker confirmed and told KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor he was talking about was actually Avanti Markets and that the machine in the law firm was using an SSL encryption certificate to send out critical information.Dunker pointed out that the incident shows how vulnerable a network such as this one can be. He stated that since there are a number of systems involved, fixing or securing the overall network is not easy.Moreover, he mentioned that such devices are usually managed and controlled by third-parties which make finding vulnerabilities ever more difficult, let alone fixing them.In this modern day and age, there are increasing amounts of devices with biometric verification systems that scan a person\u2019s face, eyes, or fingerprints to grant access to protected accounts.In the incident mentioned above, hackers were able to steal biometric data as well implying that such systems are not that safe.In fact, a couple of months ago, the biometric verification system used by Samsung which scans a user\u2019s iris to grant access was easily broken into with just a high-definition photograph and contact lenses.The lens was placed on the photographic eye of a real person and put in front of Samsung\u2019s camera. Quite surprisingly, the phone unlocked granting access to the researcher.Whether such biometric systems are safe is moot. Nevertheless, devices using these systems need to ensure even greater security since unlike credit cards or passwords, such information cannot be changed or renewed instantly.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Avanti Markets\u2019 kiosks hacked; credit card, biometric data stolen", "date": "July 11, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Back in 2012, a team of five German scientists from Ruhr University in Bochum, published a research paper in which they delineated the method to decrypt communication signals transmitted through satellite phones.In 2016, a report from Chatham House revealed that hackers and even terrorists can exploit security flaws in the computer system of satellites. Now, however, two Chinese researchers propose (1 & 2) an even more practical and quicker way to do so.Satellite phones may not have many practical applications in a commercial setting. However, they are heavily used by the military and in areas where regular phone signals are unavailable.People who go to rural areas or are in the sea, usually use satellite phones to communicate. As you may realize, the communication may be critical, and hence it needs to be secure so as to avoid cyber eavesdropping.Essentially, in order to protect the user, the GMR-2 standard is utilized to encrypt all the communication that takes place. GMR-2 is a GEO-Mobile Radio interface and is the most recent version for satellite communication.The GMR-2 primarily encodes a user\u2019s conversation with a 64-bit cipher. Two Chinese researchers have figured out a way to reverse engineer the encryption and hence decode the entire conversation within a matter of seconds.The researchers belong to the National University of Defense Technology in Changsha. They stated that the process simply involves understanding the way in which GMR-2 encrypts data in the first place.The method allows them to decrypt the entire conversation in real-time from the output itself.As mentioned earlier, the idea of decrypting satellite conversation existed since 2013 when a team of German researchers from Ruhr University published a paper explaining how the attack was to be carried out.They too exploited the vulnerabilities present in the GMR-2 standard and devised a method which although practical, was nevertheless, quite complicated. It involved some very sophisticated techniques to get the encryption key.The method was apparently a plaintext attack that was carried out multiple times. The attack was quite impractical as such.The new method, however, finds out the encryption in seconds and does not involve lengthy mathematical problem-solving techniques.The method has gained attention, and one teacher from Johns Hopkins University wrote in a blog post that although the research indicates a scientific breakthrough, it is, however, dangerous and not yet practical.The researchers themselves emphasized the weakness of the GMR-2 standard and stated that it needs to be upgraded immediately to avoid major catastrophes.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["China", "Cyber Attack", "hacking", "internet", "NASA", "Satellite", "Science", "Technology"], "title": "Satellite Communication Can Now Be Cracked In Seconds", "date": "July 10, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Capable of intercepting data from more than 40 apps, the SpyDealer malware has been recently discovered by researchers at the Palo Alto network. The malware has a number of capabilities that allow it to extract personal information from a compromised Android device.According to the researchers, the malware has different versions. They are 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3. The latest version of the malware, 1.9.3, has all the configuration settings encrypted and contains an accessibility service which allows it to decrypt app databases.The researchers reported that the malware was probably in digital space since October 2015, given the data obtained from infected devices.Also, the malware infects Android versions 2.2 till 4.4. Data suggests that 25% of the Android devices are still running on these versions. Nevertheless, the malware can work with later versions as well but with fewer privileges.Up till now, the malware takes data from 40 different apps that include Facebook, WeChat, WhatsApp and other social media and messaging apps. The malware is codenamed as GoogleUpdate and is available via third-party app stores.It is not on Google Store which means that users need to be wary of app offerings from unknown app stores.SpyDealer has a very sophisticated system which allows it to record audio and video, receive calls automatically, retrieve personal messages, determine a person\u2019s exact location along with taking photos.The malware works by gaining privileges in the infected device. It does this by rooting the device. The exact method by which the malware is installed in the system is not known. However, the following process has been revealed.The infected device is registered with two broadcasting receivers that listen for certain events to take place. One event is when the device boots up while the other occurs whenever a network connection is established.If either of the two events occur, the AaTService is launched which subsequently retrieves the readme.txt files that contain all the configuration for the malware.The file contains the IP address of the C2 server from which the malware gets instructions, the commands for mobile networks and the commands for Wi-Fi networks.According to Palo Alto Network, once the configuration file is downloaded, the rooting procedure is then started. Versions 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 use the exploits from Baidu Easy Root to gain root privilege. Baidu Easy Root is a third-party commercial app that is usually used to jailbreak a device.It is mainly used to allow users to access certain settings of their phones that would otherwise be impossible due to security protocols.The malware essentially downloads a file called raw.zip which contains all the exploits featured in Baidu Easy Root 2.8.3.Version 1.9.3 along with the other two also use another method to gain root privileges. However, this method does not use Baidu Easy Root. Rather, the procedure executes the files \u2018png\u2019 and \u2018toor.sh\u2019 to gain root access.After rooting the target device, the malware executes a file called power manager which creates a backup of the malware. Whenever a user tries to uninstall the malware, it gets reinstalled after which it executes its code.The malware then establishes a connection with remote C2 servers or passively receives commands. There are essentially three channels through which it communicates with the servers; SMS, TCP, UDP.The SMS channel uses a broadcasting receiver that listens for incoming SMS messages. These messages contain the commands that are to be executed.Similarly, the TCP connection passively listens for commands from the 396568 port.The UDP connection, on the other hand, actively establishes a connection with the remote server and receives encrypted commands allowing the attacker to exfiltrate various types of information.Many apps encrypt the data that is being transmitted through them. This prevents hackers from hijacking a person\u2019s messaging service. SpyDealer, however, uses accessibility service to receive plain text messages from the screen directly.The accessibility service is enabled remotely since the attacker has root privileges in the target device.As mentioned earlier, SpyDealer spies on a victim using a number of different techniques.It records phone calls and any surrounding audio. To do so, the malware uses a PhoneStateListener to listen for any incoming calls.Also, the malware records a video through both the rear and front cameras of the infected device. Since Android devices require a preview for recording video, the malware creates a small preview surface measuring 3dip x 3dip in size.Furthermore, SpyDealer can secretly take photos as well and again creates a small preview surface in order to prevent the user from noticing that a picture is being taken.Also, an attacker can configure the malware to answer phone calls automatically.Lastly, the geographic location of the victim can be determined through the malware which uses the phone\u2019s GPS. This functionality is activated whenever the phone\u2019s screen is turned off, and the procedure stops as soon as the screen comes on.This allows the malware to go undetected since the GPS status bar appears to be inactive to the user. Moreover, the map service of Baidu Easy Root is also by the malware to determine the location based on GSM.All of the information thus gained is saved in a file with appropriate formats and uploaded to the attacker\u2019s servers.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Android", "Cyber Crime", "Google Play", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "security"], "title": "SpyDealer Rooting Malware Steals Data From Android Devices", "date": "July 8, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "CopyCat, apparently a variant of a much larger family of malware, infected around 14 million Android devices with adware and rooted 8 million of them, making it impossible to remove the malware.According to CheckPoint, the malware generated a revenue of $1.5 million through installing fake ads and apps. Also, the virus has been in the wild since last year.The majority of the devices infected were found to be in Southeast Asia, followed by the U.S where 280,000 devices were infected.Essentially, Asia accounted for 55% of the devices infected while Americas accounted for 12% of the total. The rest comprises of Africa (18%), Oceania (8%) and Europe (7%).The malware is installed in apps that can be downloaded from third-party app stores. Once downloaded, the malware activates only after the infected device is restarted.When a device is restarted, CopyCat starts to root the device in order to gain admin privileges. It does so through a group of exploits downloaded from the Amazon S3 bucket.After the device has been rooted, the malware starts to install a component in the system\u2019s directory which makes it impossible for the malware to be removed.Finally, the malware reaches for Zygote, which is Android\u2019s core process for downloading and installing apps. Once Zygote is infected, CopyCat gets admin rights and subsequently installs fake apps on the infected device.The attacker gets revenue for replacing a genuine app\u2019s referrer\u2019s ID with a fake one. Moreover, the admin rights allow the attacker to generate revenue through having the malware post fake ads and install fraudulent apps.Researchers at Checkpoint also investigated the malware\u2019s C&C server to get more insight as to how the malware works. Upon investigation, it was revealed that the data found on the server dates back to 2016 and earlier.In fact, around 3.8 million devices were infected last year between the months of April and May while 4.4 million devices were infiltrated to install fake apps on Google Play and thereby generate revenue for the attacker.Also, the researchers stated the malware exploited vulnerabilities which were quite common, some of which have been in digital space since 203. Also, the reason they were able to access users\u2019 devices was probably that users did not upgrade their systems.There is no evidence leading to any particular culprit but experts believe that an ad network based in China might be behind the scene.When asked, Google said that it was aware of the malware and believed it was a variant of a larger malware family. It stated that an update is released to patch the vulnerable devices whenever a related malware is discovered.However, a researcher from Check Point stated that the malware demonstrated some very different techniques which show that CopyCat does not belong to any malware family.Nevertheless, it does have similarities with other malware types, particularly HummingBad and Gooligan. The former broke into 1 million Google accounts last year while the latter, like CopyCat, was part of an ad fraud campaign.Google referred to PlayProtect, which is the company\u2019s malware detecting software.

Like last time, the hacking tools are meant for attacking Linux and Windows platforms and use a similar technique to perform cyber espionage on an unsuspecting user.The documents in the discussion are about BothanSpy and Gyrfalcon implants developed and used by the CIA to \u201cintercept and exfiltrate SSH credentials\u201d from devices on Linux and Windows operating systems.One of the hacking tools is called the BothanSpy and targets systems running on Windows. The tool is essentially after the SSH credentials of a user\u2019s system and steals them by infiltrating the XShell program on Windows.SSH credentials or Secure Shell credentials and contain secure keys that can be used to gain remote access to a system. Stealing them would mean the CIA can get its hands on these keys and remotely hijack a system.The credentials also include a person\u2019s username and password along with the details associated with the SSH key for every SSH session.Once the tool is activated, it exfiltrates the relevant data directly to one of CIA\u2019s servers. As such, no internal hardware of the victim\u2019s computer is affected, and the data might be saved in an encrypted file for later use.RELEASE: #CIA implants targeting SSH on Windows and Linux #BothanSpy #Gryfalcon #KitV #Vault7 https://t.co/OMJYH3sLmA pic.twitter.com/KYCbXwmow8\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 6, 2017The next tool revealed is called the Gyrfalcon. This is meant for all Linux platforms including Centos, Rhel, Debian, SuSE, and Ubuntu.A custom toolkit, built by the CIA, is needed to install the tool on a victim\u2019s computer. Like the BothanSpy, Gyrfalcon also looks for the SSH credentials and hence the key to remotely spy on a victim.However, in addition to that, it can steal either the complete or partial session traffic generated through OpenSSH.The data collected is again stored in an encrypted file from which the data can be later exfiltrated.Recently, the Vault 7 series featured another hacking tool called OutlawCountry which was again meant for Linux machines. Exactly why CIA is targeting Linux alongside Windows is not exactly known.However, the tool is yet another method to exfiltrate data by intercepting outbound network traffic and redirecting it to CIA for analysis.The majority of the hacking tools target vulnerabilities in the Windows platform that allows the CIA to conduct a range of operations from spying to wiping out the entire system like the WannaCry incident.Last week, documents related to ELSA were revealed by WikiLeaks, which is yet another tool that exploits certain vulnerabilities in Windows to figure out the exact location of a computer through detecting the location of a nearby public Wi-Fi hotspot.Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["CIA", "hacking", "internet", "Linux", "security", "Technology", "Vault 7", "wikileaks", "Windows"], "title": "CIA Implants Steal SSH Credentials From Linux & Windows Devices: WikiLeaks", "date": "July 7, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

Essentially, they do so in order to prevent smugglers from entering the country.Jamie Bamford, the general manager of Intelligence Investigations Customs, stated that the examination of a passenger\u2019s device could be quick or it can take longer than that.To see exactly how much longer it can be indicated by mentioning the experience of one New Zealander who has been a citizen of the country for almost 30 years.Ashraf Almoukdad, who is originally from Israel says that the customs took as much as 5 hours to investigate his digital devices. He stated that they made him feel like a terrorist.Apart from the fact that the customs sometimes copies the traveler\u2019s data and passes it onto the government agencies for further inspection, the general manager also revealed that the department has all the necessary tools to break into an individual\u2019s device if he/she refuses to provide the password.Up till now, around 1,350 people have been subject to the digital strip since 2015 with New Zealanders accounting for the majority. That is, of the total, 296 were from New Zealand followed by 269 Chinese. The rest belonged to Taiwan.The primary airports in which it has taken place are those in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.Whether this behavior is legal is a matter of debate.

Let\u2019s have a look at what these vulnerabilities are.The first vulnerability is associated with privilege rights to the system. In essence, the CVE-2016-9038 is a vulnerability that provides an attacker the privileges to a local system. The vulnerability is present in the SboxDrv.Sys driver.An attacker can send custom data to the SandboxDriverApi device driver that comes with a Dell device. The vulnerability allows read and write capabilities to the attacker. If carried out correctly, the attacker gains privilege escalation.Also, Noga stated that the fault not only exists with the device driver but also with Workspace 6.1.3-24058 and Invincea-X.The CVE-2016-8732 is a vulnerability which virtually allows an attacker to disable protection protocols in Dell\u2019s systems. The software associated with the vulnerability is the Dell Protected Workspace 5.1.1-22303 with InvProtectDrv.sys driver containing further vulnerabilities.The driver has inferior protection and lacks proper validation. The attacker can, therefore, use the vulnerability to infect a system by executing applications that will disable certain security protocols, allowing the attacker to infiltrate a system.Also a protection bypass vulnerability, the CVE-2017-2082 involves Dell\u2019s PPO service and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.Initially, the vulnerability arises as a result of poaService.exe searching for the DLL library called atiadlxx.dll. The attacker can, however, use a customized version of this library file and run arbitrary code.Nevertheless, version 4.0 comes with a patch and users are recommended to update their systems as quickly as possible.Hi.

Details of how he was found have not been revealed.A DDoS attack involves sending a huge amount of illegal traffic to compromised machines and therefore disrupting them completely.The system can crash and lead to a massive loss of data, particularly, in the case of companies which host a significant amount of information regarding their clients and customers.The teenager has not only been charged with misusing computers under the Computer Misuse Act but has also been charged with money laundering and assisting others in cybercrime.It has also been revealed that the teenager was sharing the rewards with another American national whose name and whereabouts have not been revealed.Chappell will be appearing in front of the Manchester Magistrates Court where his sentence will be announced.Chappell has been alleged to have been associated with the NatWest incident back in 2015 in which the bank suffered a malicious DDoS attack locking out its users from logging into their accounts.It is now that the police believes that the malware which allowed criminals to hack into the bank\u2019s network was in fact, provided by Chappell.Large corporations are under serious threat from such cyber crimes as the rate of attacks is rising tremendously. The recent WannaCry incident, Petya attack along with the Erebus malware incident which compelled a web hosting company to pay a million dollars in ransom, have brought corporations to their knees.While Europol brought down a cyber criminal group a few weeks go that was responsible for selling malware which could bypass antivirus software.

The FBI officials essentially interviewed the employees as part of investigating any government links that they might have.Following this investigation, the Senate came up with the decision to ban Kaspersky\u2019s software from the Pentagon, where it is currently being used by military officials.The ban was proposed in the recent defense bill and is yet to be approved by the House and subsequently by President Donald Trump before it becomes law.However, Eugene Kaspersky is determined to turn away such suspicions as he has repeatedly stated that neither he or any of his employee has any links with the Russian government.\u201cIf the United States needs, we can disclose the source code,\u201d he said, adding that he was ready to testify before U.S. lawmakers as well. \u201cAnything I can do to prove that we don\u2019t behave maliciously I will do it, said Eugene.\u201dIt is quite surprising that even after repeated claims by the CEO and his decision to reveal his company\u2019s entire source code for investigation, it has not calmed down the rising suspicions by the U.S officials.Perhaps this has got something to do with certain employees working at the company who previously held positions in Russian intelligence firms.In fact, Kaspersky himself acknowledged the reason of why they have come under the limelight. However, he also said that the structure of his company does not allow for any particular employee to have links with the government and carry out illegal activities secretly.Moreover, he stated that there have been times when the government has approached him so as to coax him into hacking, but he never did incline toward what he calls the \u2018dark side\u2019.Given these facts, it is unlikely that even getting his company\u2019s code audited will quell the suspicions that are surrounding Kaspersky. It is not the software that is the threat, but it is the people that work in the company.Also, the fact that Russia is primarily a state with many government-owned businesses only raises the suspicions of Kaspersky being influenced by the Kremlin even further.It is not new for Kaspersky to be held under suspicion as there have been a number of critics in the past that have questioned the legitimacy of the software company. But Kaspersky only has this to say, \u201cWe stay on the bright side, and never, never go to the dark side.\u201dUp till now, no proof exists that establishes Kaspersky having any ties with the Russian government.[Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.]", "topics": ["cyber security", "FBI", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Kaspersky", "Malware", "Russia", "security"], "title": "Kaspersky Willing to Share Its Source Code with US Govt", "date": "July 3, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});As you may know, WikiLeakes has been releasing sensitive documentation associated with CIA\u2019s hacking tools as part of its Vault 7 series.

Primarily, OutlawCountry\u2019s Kernel modules only work with compatible Linux Kernels. These kernels are usually the default ones since the tool works with the 64-bit CentOS/RHEL 6.x module.Details related to ELSA were released last week in which it was revealed that this tool could track down a person\u2019s exact geo-location using a Windows PC through public Wi-Fi hotspot even if the system is not connected to it.RELEASE: CIA 'ELSA' malware can geolocate your Windows laptop or desktop by listening to surrounding WiFi signals https://t.co/XjyyXIqXAz pic.twitter.com/WCw6dgF9ql\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 28, 2017The documents show that ELSA works by firstly getting into the system through certain exploits and then scans the infected computer\u2019s Wi-Fi hardware to see if there are any Wi-Fi hot spots nearby, along with the MAC address and the signal strength.It then stores the information in an encrypted form. The CIA operator can then download these files using further exploits and decrypt them for further analysis.Essentially, once the CIA operator has the data, he/she can run a quick search on Google\u2019s database using back-end software to see all the locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and match the hotspot extracted from the data to filter out its exact address.As such, the CIA can know your exact location even if you are not connected to the internet per say.

Terrorist groups can now trade and collaborate over the dark web and make illegal dealings without being noticed by authorities.Dark web, as you may be aware, is a part of cyberspace that is (kind of) undetected and allows greater privacy to the user. This means that terrorists along with other types of criminals can carry on their activities with complete anonymity.Furthermore, Nakamitsu stated that although the technology of providing privacy to authorities who engage in legal activities involving WMDs is beneficial, it, however, still poses threats and hence there needs to be a balance between how much security authorities are willing to compromise in order to prevent proliferation.Among the various technologies considered to be dangerous, 3D printing and drones were seen as another major threat concerning enabling terrorists to easily access the means to develop WMDs, if not the weapons themselves.That is, 3D printers have already been used for creating weapons such as guns. Essentially, the technology is being used to develop parts for specific weapons that are hard to get otherwise.Likewise, drones can potentially be used to deliver such parts or weapons themselves without being intercepted.3D printing, unmanned aerial vehicles along with online tools that allow for greater privacy were acknowledged by Nakamitsu, as useful technologies that are incidental to globalization.However, what she is concerned about is the fact that such technologies should be kept away from the hands of criminals.As such, her take is to work with security agencies worldwide to restrict the proliferation of WMDs.And although she says that terrorists still need to overcome a number of barriers to make use of technologies to access WMDs effectively, she is, however, concerned that technological advances are making the path toward WMDs much easier.As such Nakamitsu believes that governments worldwide need to collaborate more and work not only with security agencies but also with organizations that develop such information-sharing technologies.Doors to international dialogues need to be open if proper measures are to be implemented.Via: VOA \u2013 3ders Source: UN News Center Terrorist\u2019s illustration: SaurinSlais/Deviantart[Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.]", "topics": ["3D", "dark web", "Drones", "internet", "security", "Technology", "Terrorism"], "title": "UN: Terrorists can access WMDs via Dark Web", "date": "June 30, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Russia has had pretty strained relations with the U.S ever since Russia was reportedly discovered to have been involved in manipulating U.S elections. This time, the Senate seems to be more cautious and has hence asked for a ban on Kaspersky\u2019s software.Kaspersky, as you may know, is based in Moscow, Russia and sells products concerning security including a world-renowned anti-virus software. However, the Senate Armed Services Committee wants a ban on Kaspersky\u2019s products so that the U.S Defense Department can not use them.This is because the Senate fears the organization has links with the Russian government and is therefore likely to be influenced by it. They believe that U.S national security could be under threat.In fact, according to Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic Senator, Kremlin, and Kaspersky have surprisingly got strong ties and was, therefore, the one to amend the defense bill to include the ban on Kaspersky.Furthermore, the Congress is of the opinion that using Kaspersky can pose great risks to U.S\u2019 infrastructure regarding computer networks.SHAHEEN: \"Kaspersky Labs cannot be trusted to protect critical infrastructure, particularly computer systems vital to our nation\u2019s security\"\u2014 Dustin Volz (@dnvolz) June 28, 2017The ban was perhaps not a result of random conjecture by U.S officials over the risk of Kaspersky. Rather, before the ban was put into the bill, the FBI undertook an in-depth investigation of the organization.Particularly, the FBI interviewed a number Kaspersky employees that were based in the U.S and went to different cities to meet them in person. FBI made it clear that these interviews were not part of an investigation into Russian involvement in the elections.Rather, they were meant to see whether the organization has any government influence in particular. The company categorized these activities as part of a due diligence act.It was after this, on Wednesday, that the bill was amended to include the ban on Kaspersky.Kaspersky is repeatedly denying any ties with the government and has stated that such allegations are based on no hard evidence. In fact, the CEO of the organization has stated that he will be willing to talk to the Senate and confirm that his organization is not influenced by the Russian government.He says that in the organization\u2019s 20-year history, the company has not been involved in anything that would compromise ethical behavior as such.Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such claims will deter the Senate\u2019s strong stance over Kaspersky\u2019s links with the government, especially after 2012, when a number of new hires were inducted to the company having ties with three major Russian intelligence firms.The Bill will now have to pass through full Senate and the House of Representative and will eventually become law once President Donald Trump approves of it.Via: Reuters | Dustin Volz (Twitter) Source: NBC News Coverage: BuzzFeed News[Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.]", "topics": ["Infosec", "internet", "Privacy", "Russia", "security", "Spying", "Surveillance", "USA"], "title": "U.S Senate wants to ban Kaspersky\u2019 Software for Links to Russia", "date": "June 30, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system seems to have been having a really bad year given the major cyber attacks taking place including the WannaCry incident and the most recently discovered Petya campaign.As a result, Microsoft has responded with a new and improved anti-virus software that is integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities designed to detect malware before it infects a system.Microsoft will be launching its Windows 10 Creator Update during the month of September or October, and along with it, Microsoft has left no table unturned that could threaten its security.As such, Microsoft stated that it would be releasing a new and improved AI based antivirus software. Essentially, the tech giant will be upgrading its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) with AI that analyzes files for malware.The software will be collecting data from various cloud service platforms such as those of Azure, Endpoint, and Office to build effective machine learning models for the anti-virus software that can detect malware-infected files immediately.The system will be self-evolving and will, therefore, provide more effective security by creating automated signatures for a particular malware that is discovered. Also, the software will be implemented so that it detects malware in the entire network to which a PC is connected.This means that there will be no need to create signatures and configure systems manually. This is highly beneficial since most attacks involve zero-day and new malware. Creating signatures for all of them is inefficient and risky.Hence, the AI platform will ease admins of the need to keep configuring PCs across a network.The software will be checking for unusual behavior by apps and will instantly update so as to prevent the attack from the file if it is found to be malware. Moreover, the software will be learning from 400 million PCs that have Windows 10 installed on them.The intelligent software will also work with frequently used applications such as Word. This will provide an extra layer of safety for users.In their blog post, Microsoft explained that: \u201cThe stack will be powered by our cloud-based security intelligence, which moves us from a world of isolated defenses to a smart, interconnected, and coordinated defense grid that is more intelligent, simple to manage, and ever-evolving.\u201dApart from the anti-virus software, Microsoft has already decided to remove the SMB v1 protocol for file sharing in response to the WannaCry attack.It will also be integrating new security features in Windows 10 such as an Application Guard for browsers along with a Device and Exploit Guard.This is not the first time when Microsoft vowed to fight malware attacks on Windows 10. In 2015, Microsoft said it will be offering a totally new mechanism in its Windows 10 which will allow software developers to embed their apps with almost any anti-malware program existing on the user\u2019s computer. This new mechanism was called AMSI/antimalware scan interface. However, it seems the mechanism is not working as it was planned since Microsoft is going for Artificial Intelligence mechanism.

It has been the second major global cyber attack after the WannaCry incident. However, the latest research reveals that the ransomware is not a ransomware at all.Petya was discovered two days ago and has its root in Ukraine. The malware entered cyberspace through an update mechanism for an accounting software used by staff members working for the Ukrainian government.However, this was the first phase of infection. The next one used a more conventional and probably an amateur technique of sending infected malware through email attachments.Also, Petya spreads across the network to which an infected PC is connected and uses the same EternalBlue exploit as the WannaCry ransomware.However, given that Windows released a patch for the vulnerability, Petya uses another technique by exploiting administrative tools in Windows. Furthermore, researchers found that Petya spreads more rapidly than WannaCry.The ransomware infected the systems of major organizations including WPP, Mondelez, and Maersk locking their entire data for ransomware that amounts to $300 in Bitcoin.The name Petya may have rung some bells as the name associated with a criminal enterprise called Petya which launched a money-making campaign. However, researchers from the Grugq stated that Petya was not meant for making money.In fact, Petya is a destructive tool as discovered by Comae Technologies and Kaspersky Lab. The experts stated that Petya, is in reality, a disk wiper that locks a victim\u2019s data files and throws away the decryption key.This means that Petya simply takes the shape of ransomware, probably to avoid being noticed as something serious by security researchers. According to Kaspersky researchers:\u201cOur analysis indicates there is little hope for victims to recover their data. We have analyzed the high-level code of the encryption routine, and we have figured out that after disk encryption, the threat actor could not decrypt victims\u2019 disks.\u201d Update on #NotPetya #ExPetr: threat actors CAN'T decrypt files. Don't pay ransom. It won't help -> https://t.co/Df7tGqXO2Q\u2014 Eugene Kaspersky (@e_kaspersky) June 28, 2017Petya, on the other hand, simply generates random data making the decryption of the files unlikely as revealed by Kaspersky.Most ransomware usually generates a decryption key for every infected PC that is given to the victim once they have paid the ransomware. This is specifically true for ransomware that operates without a command-and-control server.Researchers at Comae Technologies discovered that Petya executes itself in an unusual way that makes the recovery of the Master File Table (MFT) impossible. Petya does permanent damage to the disk in which the file is stored.Since MFT manages the location of all other files on a system, having MFT encrypted forever implies that there is no way in which the data can be recovered.Although the Petya campaign asks for a ransom, it, however, does so very crudely by giving a specific email address through which a victim can contact the attacker.As of now, the email provider has locked the email, and therefore there is no way to contact the attacker.Furthermore, given the permanent damage that Petya does to a system, even if the victim pays the ransom, the files encrypted cannot be recovered since no decryption key exists to do so.As such, researchers have concluded that primary motive of the campaign was to cause serious damage rather than make money.In fact, the original author of Petya tweeted that Petya was not a variant of Petya. Therefore, nothing less than a data wiper disguised as ransomware.Although no particular leads have been discovered, Ukraine, however, suspects Russia to be behind all this given Russia\u2019s past attempts to hack into the federal systems of the US and France.Now that Petya has been reclassified as a destructive cyber-weapon, researchers say that they will be able to look at the issue in a different light.[Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.]", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "GoldenEye", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Petya", "Ransomware", "security", "WannaCry", "Windows"], "title": "Petya not a ransomware but much worse", "date": "June 29, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Armada Collective, a group of online attackers, is demanding a ransom payment of $315,000 from South Korean banks \u2013 In the case of refusal, the group has threatened the banks with a series of massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.The threats came days after South Korean web hosting company NAYANA paid over $1 million to cyber criminals who held the company\u2019s Linux-based servers for ransom for over a week after infecting them with Erebus ransomware.[Sponsored: DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.]The Yonhap News Agency has published a list of banks who received the threat from Armada Collective.

It\u2019s even more frightening to think about how many unknown data breaches might have occurred without anyone finding out. In many cases, large companies will learn that their system has been breached, only after subsequent performance issues cause their network to malfunction. Before becoming aware of the breach, the company has no way of securing its data because the theft is taking place behind the scenes.Fortunately, many companies are using the following methods to keep better track of who is accessing their data in real-time:One way IT specialists at major corporations are keeping track of data security is by using web analytics and tracking tools to generate stats about network usage. There may even be separate systems for analyzing each kind of platform used on the network. For example, many businesses are now using third-party SharePoint analytics solutions to keep a closer eye on how files are being used and accessed within the SharePoint system. Such tools can quickly raise red flags when an excessive amount of data is being downloaded or viewed on the platform in a short period of time. Defensive hacking is the practice of hacking into one\u2019s network to find and repair vulnerabilities that nefarious hackers could exploit. Sometimes data breaches are discovered when defensive hackers are searching for weak points in the system and accidentally stumble upon a point of entry that a hacker has already used.  From there it doesn\u2019t take long for the IT team to trace whether the loophole has already been exploited, and if so, to what extent.Companies are also taking user account complaints more seriously, with IT teams investigating signs of suspicious activity more frequently and implementing stricter anti-spam and anti-phishing technologies. By making it easier for network users to report hacked accounts, the company can stay on top of breaches as soon as they begin to affect the network\u2019s usability. Unfortunately, many hackers will never change the account passwords and can, therefore, go unnoticed for a long time before any network users notice anything. Most companies will begin working to close the loophole that the hackers have exploited; sometimes even before publicizing the discovery of the breach. The reason for keeping things initially under wraps is to gain the competitive edge on hackers who may have a contingency plan in place to attack the server or site in the event they\u2019re discovered. Rather than prompting a hacking war and making things more difficult on their IT team, most corporations will give their staff a chance fix the problem that allowed the breach before notifying network users that their accounts may have been compromised.

The hacking tools are capable of infecting air-gapped PCs via USB drives and are collectively named as the Brutal Kangaroo.Brutal Kangaroo is not just a single hacking tool. Rather, it is a collection of tools that are designed to execute a very complicated attack that can affect air-gapped PCs \u2013 PCs not connected to the internet \u2013 through an infected USB drive.Drifting deadline is one of the tools that is the primary starting point of creating malware. This is followed by Shattered Assurance which automates the generation of malware created from Drifting deadline through USB drives.Next, comes Shadow, which allows the attacker to control and coordinate the attack. Lastly, Broken Promise is used to extract data from the infected systems.According to the user manual, CIA can start off an attack through Brutal Kangaroo by using Drifting Deadline to generate and inject malware. The malware thus created is used in a two-staged process to infect air-gapped computers.Initially, the attacker, or in this case the CIA, can infect a targeted computer called the primary host. The malware is injected into this PC and when a user inserts a USB drive into it, the malware, through Shattered Assurance generates a more powerful virus and loads it in the USB.Once the user inserts this USB into another PC, the more powerful malware affects this new PC, and the chain goes on depending on how many more computers share the USB.Reports say that the tools have already been used by a hacking group called Longhorn and that around 40 instances of hacks have been found in 16 countries.RELEASE: CIA 'Brutal Kangaroo' and 'Emotional Simian' USB air gap jumping viruses https://t.co/dHDfcHQWIv pic.twitter.com/xU6e3ucPB6\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 22, 2017According to the documents, the second-stage malware exploits certain LNK files on Windows. These files execute the malware once they are viewed in Windows Explorer.Furthermore, two distinct exploits facilitate the attack \u2013 Okabi and Giraffe. Okabi is more powerful as it can target machines that are operating on Windows 7 and later versions, while Giraffe can now only affect Windows XP as later versions have been upgraded.Once the second-stage malware is executed, an attacker or the CIA can easily co-ordinate the infections through the Shadow tool. The tool can be used to execute multiple commands once initial data has been extracted using Broken Promise.This implies that newer versions of Shadow can be generated that have different instructions of infecting a system. However, the user needs to insert the USB in the primary host so that the new malware can be loaded onto it.The manual listed certain antivirus software that can detect Brutal Kangaroo. These include Avira, Bitdefender, Rising Antivirus, and Symantec.Moreover, Microsoft has released security patches that deal with the vulnerabilities associated with the LNK files and WikiLeaks has stated that it is working with software developers to fix security flaws that can be exploited by this malware.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["CIA", "hacking", "internet", "LEAKS", "security", "Surveillance", "USA", "Vault 7", "wikileaks"], "title": "WikiLeaks\u2019 Latest Dump Exposes CIA Hacking Tools for air-gapped PCs", "date": "June 23, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "In a recent investigation, researchers at \u201cWhich?\u201d discovered that Virgin\u2019s Super Hub 2 router could be easily hacked in as little as four days.

That\u2019s not all; the device aims to crack down suspects by recording their every click, tap or swipe. It would even know what apps the drivers are using. Police officers can also download all the data from the suspect\u2019s smartphone within a few seconds right on the spot.Once the police officer witnesses a driver driving recklessly or under the influence, they will simply connect the device to the driver\u2019s smartphone and scan their emails, calls or even text messages sent while driving.Think about it like a breathalyzer device which helps to measure the amount of alcohol in a driver\u2019s breath. However, in the case of Textalyzer, the officer will have complete access to user data.Textalyzer is developed by Cellebrite, an Israeli hacking firm which previously made news when it was reported that FBI used its services to unlock San Bernardino Gunman\u2019s iPhone device. It must be noted that Cellebrite once claimed it could crack any locked smartphone. Also, about four months ago the company revealed that its researchers could unlock and extract data from iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S7.As for Textalyzer, the device was tested by NBC\u2019s Jeff Rossen who visited Cellebrite\u2019s headquarters to see how it works \u2013 which ended up being quite a shocker. Rossen took his cellphone and drove in the company\u2019s parking lot. While driving, he made a call, scrolled his Facebook account, sent a text message and a message via WhatsApp. He then gave his phone to the Cellebrite\u2019s CEO Jim Grady who plugged the phone with Textalyzer which started to download its data and activities.It also downloaded the information regarding apps used on Rossen\u2019s smartphone.

Proton Technologies AG has also been the pioneer in developing an encrypted email service called Proton Mail.The development of the VPN service took around one year of hard work followed by four months of rigorous testing, as stated by Proton Technologies AG. Also, the service has been built by the very same individuals at CERN and MIT who were also responsible for creating ProtonMail.In its address to the general public, the company wrote a letter to its community on its blog stating that the service is meant for everyone and by that they mean that the VPN is completely free.It was stated that making it free was in line with the organization\u2019s commitment to making the internet as a medium of social progress and advancement of mankind \u2013 the original vision which led researchers at CERN to create the World Wide Web. In the official press release ProtonMail Co-Founder, Dr. Andy Yen said that\u201cThe best way to ensure that encryption and privacy rights are not encroached upon is to get the tools into the hands of the public as soon as possible and widely distributing them. This is why, as with ProtonMail, we\u2019re committed to making a free version of ProtonVPN available to the world.\u201dAccording to ProtonVPN\u2019s privacy page, the company does not save user logs.Proton VPN is a Virtual Private Network that essentially encrypts and reroutes users\u2019 data to the many servers located in Switzerland, Iceland, and Sweden. This implies that users will be able to protect their privacy as their original identity will be hidden.Also, the developers state that the VPN is unlike any other as it offers a very high standard of privacy since the VPN comes with a secure core architecture which channels internet traffic through more than one encrypted tunnel.This implies that it would be nearly impossible for potential attackers to intercept a user\u2019s traffic. Moreover, the service allows users to add a further layer of anonymity since the VPN can be easily integrated with Tor.It was stated on the company\u2019s website that the VPN would further fuel the security of Proton Mail which is the first end-to-end encrypted email service. The developers believe that together, ProtonVPN and ProtonMail can provide a very high level of security to users.The rollback of privacy protection laws and the need for protecting privacyAccording to Proton Technologies, back in April this year, FCC\u2019s 2016 Broadband Privacy Order, which was meant to prevent ISPs from selling private user information to third-parties, was rolled back.The current Trump presidency repealed the law, leaving users vulnerable to agencies and third-parties to virtually intrude upon their privacy.In such circumstances, the company states, it is ever more necessary to build tools that will allow users to take full advantage of the internet and not be restricted by severe censorship laws.As such, the VPN comes at the right time to address the growing concerns around privacy and is the only way through which better security can be offered.", "topics": ["Censorship", "internet", "Privacy", "ProtonMail", "security", "Surveillance", "Technology", "VPN"], "title": "ProtonMail Launches Free ProtonVPN to Fight Online Censorship", "date": "June 21, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "The WannaCry incident is indeed going to be remembered in history as one of the most devastating and dreadful ransomware attacks. Not only did it affect the victims shortly after its release, but its self-spreading mechanism is still causing havoc.In the latest report, it has been revealed the ransomware has attacked a Honda plant in Sayama, located northwest of Tokyo. As a result, the automobile giant was forced to shut down its operations on the 19th of June, to avoid any further accidents.Little did Honda know that after the break-out in mid-May, the ransomware will still be lurking in cyberspace and would step foot in one of Honda\u2019s plants where more than 1,000 cars are manufactured.The ransomware was found in Honda\u2019s systems on the 18th of June and as expected, the entire network was affected severely.As you may already know, the WannaCry ransomware was created as a result of NSA-based hacking tools being leaked out by a hacking group called the Shadow Brokers.The tools included EternalBlue and DoublePulsar which were used to install the malware in the system and allow it spread to computers running on Windows operating systems. The malware essentially exploited a vulnerability existing in Windows\u2019 Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.Once the ransomware is loaded into the system, it encrypts all the files and the user can only access them if he/she pays a certain amount of ransom in Bitcoins. It was reported that the ransomware amounted to USD 300.Just two days after the attack, it was reported that as many as 200,000 users had been infected in 150 countries and those affected included large organizations including the entire British National Health System (NHS).As far as Honda is concerned, although the effects are significant, other plants, however, have not been affected.Andrew Clarke, the director of One Identity, stresses that these incidents compel organizations than ever before to spruce up their security and regularly check their networks to identify any inconsistencies.Clarke also stated that usually, individuals could access an organization\u2019s system for a short time, although not indefinitely. However, this is enough for unscrupulous attackers to find a loophole in the system and abuse the privileges as such.Indeed, with the advent of WannaCry, ransomware attacks have reached record-high levels with network-level malware being released very frequently. This implies that attackers only need a little amount of time to find a particular vulnerability and exploit it to their advantage.Case in point, just recently a ransomware named Erebus infected the networks of a web hosting company in South Korea, called NAYANA. As many as 3,500 clients were affected that were operating on NAYANA\u2019S platform. The firm was then forced to pay 1 million USD ransom to get their files back. As for the Erebus malware, it was designed to infect Linux-based networks and it did so quite effectively, so much so that the company was compelled to pay more than a million dollars in ransom to have their system restored.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "hacking", "internet", "Japan", "Malware", "Ransomware", "security", "WannaCry"], "title": "Honda hit by WannaCry ransomware attack; shuts down plant", "date": "June 21, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "In April this year, DarkOverLord a Dark Web hacking group stole and held season 5 of popular TV show Orange Is the New Black (which was yet-to-be-released at that time ) to ransom but ended up leaking it on the Internet after failed negotiations with Netflix and Hollywood-based Larson Studios.Now, details have emerged highlighting how the hackers were able to steal the show from Larson Studios. It turns out that the group took advantage of a vulnerability in Window 7 operating system allowing them to access the original content account of Netflix.This was discovered after Larson Studios hired a cyber security company to detect the point of breach. Upon investigating, the security researchers found that the studio was still using Windows 7 which does not match the latest security protocols.Although it is unclear what kind of vulnerability the hackers exploited, the chief engineer of Larson Studios Mr. David Dondorf told Variety in an interview that the hackers were looking for random computers using Windows 7 and ended up breaching the one with the unreleased Season 5 of Orange Is the New Black TV show.\u201cThey were basically just trolling around to see if they could find a computer that they could open,\u201d Dondorf explained. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t aimed at us,\u201d said Dondorf.Furthermore, Dondorf revealed that the studio paid a sum of 50 Bitcoins to the hackers which were around $50,000 at that time (now equivalent to $136,505) to prevent them deleting and leaking the data, however not only did they end up leaking the TV show online but they also deleted all the data from the targeted computer because the studio contacted the FBI regarding the incident.The DarkOverLord hackers have also confirmed to Variety that they were indeed paid, 50 Bitcoin but due to the breach of contract, the group was forced to punish the studio. The group works in a way that after targeting its victim, it sends them a written agreement for signature to agree to the terms of the agreement which involves not contacting the law enforcement authorities.\u201cWe found Larson Studios was in great delinquency of the agreement after sources confirmed law enforcement cooperation.\u201d \u201cOur agreement provides us the right to execute a harmful action against any client who defrauds our agreement.\u201dIs is unclear if the group had access to other unreleased TV shows, however, a couple of weeks ago the same group also released first eight episodes of Steve Harvey\u2019s \u201cFunderdome\u201d TV Show on ThePirateBay website. Therefore worse can be expected from the group in the coming days.Remember, the Dark Over Lord is the same hacker who hacked WestPark Capital investment bank last year and demanded ransom from the authorities. He was also responsible for hacking healthcare database of 34,000 patients in the US and selling them on DarkWeb BTC 20 ($29020).Also, for Windows 7 users, maybe it\u2019s time for an upgrade or moving to another operating system to secure their systems from such breaches and avoid situations which try to force them to pay a large amount of ransom payment.

We have grown so used to the fact that now, we seem to think email is the primary way to attack for spammers. However, here you will see how this reality has a totally different side to it.Most of you may be familiar with the term \u2018URL padding.\u2019 This is the technique that has been observed by researchers at PhishLabs as being used by a majority of the spammers to target mobile users in particular.Why mobile users you ask? Well, the simple answer to this question is that spammers have realized how careless users can get when it comes to accessing their mobile phones as compared to the case of accessing your emails on a laptop or PC.So, let us begin with what URL padding is. Essentially, URL padding is the technique by which spammers can hide a malicious address by masquerading it in a legitimate looking domain name and hence tricking users into giving out their credentials.To understand how URL padding works and why mobile phones have been the target, we first need to understand what URL padding looks like.The following example has been provided by PhishLabs:As you may see, the initial address is a legitimate Facebook domain. However, the real address of this link is \u2018rickytaylk[dot]com.\u2019 This implies that clicking this link will not lead you to Facebook but this fake address.Now, if the link is sent through email, the user can easily figure out by hovering the link that the link is fake.With a mobile phone, however, this is not the case as the browser address bar is much smaller and does not allow for the entire address to be visible. Hence, the only thing visible will be the part which shows the Facebook address. Hyphens will pad the rest.As such, an unsuspecting user will visit the link thinking that it will redirect him/her to Facebook. However, once the link is loaded, a fake-looking page will appear that will look exactly like the login page of Facebook.This acts as a further illusion since the user will, without much thought, enter his/her username and password, thereby revealing his/her credentials.Researchers at PhishLabs stated that the method works well since people are more inclined to visit websites like Facebook rather instinctively on mobiles, and do not pay much attention to things like the URL.As such, this is indeed a well-thought-out technique which leverages upon a very specific behavior of mobile users.According to the experts, the spam links are likely being sent through SMS messages or as notifications since links can be hidden more effectively through these channels. That is, in an email one can view the entire link by just hovering the cursor over it.Unfortunately, this is not the case with an SMS.PhishLabs has a conjecture. The researchers believe that the real motive behind these scams is to use victim\u2019s accounts for further phishing scams. After all, attackers can scam way more easily by directly sending messages through a person\u2019s private account.Furthermore, since users have a single username and password, getting credentials of one social media account, may allow the attackers to infiltrate other accounts.There are no hi-tech methods to make yourself immune to such attacks. It is a known side-effect of being on social media and it cannot be avoided.However, one can restrain from accessing links sent via unknown SMS messages as Facebook does not send notifications to users through a text message.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "Facebook", "internet", "Phishing Scam", "Scam", "security", "Social Media"], "title": "URL Padding: Facebook Mobile Users Hit by Phishing Scam", "date": "June 20, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Almost four days ago, HackRead reported that a new version of ransomware called Erebus has affected more than 153-Linux based networks and has targeted one South Korean web hosting company, NAYANA in particular.The ransomware caused a massive data infiltration whereby various multimedia files, databases, and other critical network-level information were encrypted. The attackers demanded a ransom whose amount at the time was not disclosed.The most recent update by the company says that the total ransom demanded amounted to $4.4 million to be paid in Bitcoins. The ransom, however, was brought down by NAYANA from $4.4m to $1.8m. This was again reduced to a further $1.2m.The company allegedly paid the ransom in four installments and now the payments have been made. This implies that around $1 million have been paid due to a mere ransomware attack that affected more than 3,000 clients of the company.Indeed, this is a loss to an extraordinary extent as not only did NAYANA suffer a loss in reputation due to having its customers getting attacked, but also suffered an enormous financial loss by paying the ransom.This certainly acts as a motivator for other ransomware developers to exploit similar companies for exorbitant returns.One would expect that after paying the entire amount, the system would recover in time. However, to the clients\u2019 disappointment, the network has not yet been restored and officials of the company say that the recovery process will take time.This incident perhaps acts as leverage for other ransomware developers who will now use the same techniques to entrap the victims and force them to pay ever larger amounts in ransom.In fact, Erebus was present in the cyber landscape since 2016 when it only affected machines running the Windows operating system. The malware simply used conventional hacking techniques to hijack computers.Through the years, however, the ransomware evolved into becoming more versatile only to end up exploiting the vulnerabilities in Linux-based networks.In fact, in February 2017, it was reported that the malware is capable of bypassing User Account Control (UAC) on Windows and hence gain easy access to a person\u2019s computer.Experts say that the ransomware has probably found a lurking vulnerability in Linux due to which it has been possible to affect networks running on Linux so easily.In NAYANA\u2019s case, it is hypothesized that since the company\u2019s networks were running on an older version of Linux \u2013 Linux 2.6.24.2, it is likely that the ransomware leveraged upon the DIRTY COW flaw to gain root access to the system.This in combination with vulnerabilities found in older versions of Apache and PHP, which NAYANA happens to have been using, provides some clue as to how the virus got in.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Privacy", "Ransomware", "security"], "title": "Erebus Ransomware: Hosting Firm Pays Hackers $1m Ransom", "date": "June 20, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "A marketing firm that was employed by the Republican National Committee accidentally exposed data belonging to 200 million US citizens.

Now, researchers have noticed that since 2016, a new variant of this malware (also known as Pinkslipbot) with its credential stealing and keylogging capabilities has been using millions of computers as its control servers even if its binaries were removed by the anti-virus security software of those devices.The variant not only steals credentials but also downloads other malware by opening a backdoor on an infected computer. The worrying part of it is that Pinkslipbot uses the infected device as HTTPS-based proxies to the actual control servers and steals over half-million records every day.Pinkslipbot\u2019s prime targets are unsuspecting users and large enterprises in the United States. The malware uses keyloggers, password stealers, and man-in-the-browser attacks to steal personal and financial data including emails, passwords, social security numbers (SSN), credit card numbers, digital certificates and online account credentials, etc.The malware also controls a massive botnet of 500,000 infected machines, therefore, making it one of the most extensively used malware against the banking industry. Additionally, researchers found that Pinkslipbot uses universal plug and play (UPnP) networking protocols to remain stealthy while using IP addresses of infected devices linked to the malware server as HTTPS-based proxies to the actual control servers.Sanchit Karve of McAfee Labs explains that:\u201cAs UPnP assumes local applications and devices are trustworthy, it offers no security protections and is prone to abuse by any infected machine on the network. We have observed multiple Pinkslipbot control server proxies hosted on separate computers on the same home network as well as what appears to be a public Wi-Fi hotspot.\u201dAs of now, it is unclear if an infected device can be turned into a proxy; however, researchers did mention three important factors determining the possible outcome. Those three factors are IP address located in North America, High-speed Internet connection, and Capability to open ports on an Internet gateway device using UPnP.If a targeted machine has all three of the aforementioned components, Pinkslipbot looks for Internet gateway devices (IGD) and downloads a Trojan binary \u201ctmp_{timestamp}.exe\u201d to create a proxy component. When launched, the proxy component creates port-forwarding rules and that is when a targeted device can be used as a control server over HTTPS and move forward with further infections.However as mentioned earlier thePinkslipbot malware remains active even if user\u2019s antimalware software removes its binaries; their system can still be used for outside attacks. According to McAfee Labs:\u201cThe port-forwarding rules created by Pinkslipbot are too generic to remove automatically without risking accidental network misconfigurations. And as most malware do not interfere with port-forwarding, antimalware solutions may not revert such changes. Unfortunately, this means that your computer may still be vulnerable to outside attacks even if your antimalware product has successfully removed all Pinkslipbot binaries from your system.The good news is that McAfee Labs has released a free utility tool which detects Pinkslipbot control server proxy infections and removes malicious port mappings for the user. It is advised that users should refrain from downloading files from unknown emails, do not install third-party apps or software and change the default login and password of their Internet of Things (IoT) devices otherwise cyber criminals can use their devices as a botnet to carry out large-scale cyber attacks.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Botnet", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "security", "TROJAN"], "title": "Your anti-virus may remove this malware but it will still remain active", "date": "June 19, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "The authorities in Calgary, Alberta have arrested a 42-year-old who took photos of random women without their consent.

According to Vice, several terabytes of data was confiscated from his house and that includes hundreds of thousands of different images that were taken over a long period.As for his Twitter account, it got suspended, but only after having around 500 posts of photos or videos that Williamson has taken. He visited events like fandom convention Calgary Comic, as well as Entertainment Expo where he took hundreds of pictures of victims from their backsides as well as private areas.One of his victims, a 22-year-old Alexandra Constantinidis has stated that she was shocked after discovering a 45-second long video of her walking down the street. The video was taken without her consent or knowledge, and as soon as she discovered it, she contacted the police.She also said that the videos were seen and shared thousands of times, which she described as shocking and disgusting. She was also surprised that the account was not taken down earlier since many were reporting it because of its content. When the police were notified of the matter, the account was shut down in less than 24 hours which was pretty impressive.Sgt. Cory Dayley of the Calgary Police Service Staff has stated that taking these pictures could cross into criminal territory. Even more alarming is the fact that content like this was not reported for so long. People have just ignored it or even worse, supported it.Constantinidis wants to see criminal charges against Williamson, as well as to get justice for other victims. This includes bans from social events like the comic conventions.For now, police are expecting, even more, charges, but the investigation is still ongoing so that nothing can be known for sure at this point.

That is, even if the user tries to force close the advertisements, the ads do not go away.Up till now, the 47 apps have been downloaded up to 6 million times as identified by researchers of the SophoLabs.Research shows that the apps which hide these types of adware are using a third-party library called the MarsDae. The MarsDae library is configured as such that even if the user tries to force close the ad, it will not stop popping up on the home screen.Also, even if you try to wipe out your memory, the ads will keep on display on the screen.The MarsDae library supports Android versions from 2.3 till 6 and is also compatible with other mobile devices including Samsung, Huawei, Mizu, Mi, and Nexus.Now deleted Snap Pic Collage Color Splash (cache view) is one of the apps that was tested by SophoLabs. The app contains the adware and has been downloaded around 50,000 to 100,000 times.According to researchers, the library has a built-in algorithm that deploys a number of processes which keep on repeating themselves. Whenever a process is run, a file gets locked.Essentially, if there is a Process A, it will create a file a2 and will keep checking if Process B has created another file b2.If b2 has been created, it implies that file b1 has been locked and Process A deletes file b2 with Process B deleting a2 simultaneously. This iterative process prevents the user to stop the ads from appearing even after force closing the app.It is recommended that people use legitimate anti-virus software to protect themselves from such adware which is growing quite common in the Android space.

However, the identity and location of the perpetrators remain to be unknown.The senior manager of FireEye Charles Prevost unclear why Canada has been the primary target. However, it has been identified that the criminals might be native English speakers.How was the attack carried out? The group has used the conventional ransomware method wherein FIN10 has been able to inject ransomware into the networks belonging to mines and casinos.FireEye states that the campaign involved the usual method of spam emails in which malicious links, attachments, and documents were contained. The user was tricked into clicking these for the attack to launch itself.Essentially, once the user clicked one of the links, he/she would be led to a website that would be masked as either a legitimate holiday scheduling system or a document. Clicking or accessing these would activate the ransomware.Further investigation showed that although the attacks were far-reaching, they were not as high-profile as those launched by Russian hacking groups. In fact, the group used common tools such as PowerShell to infiltrate the system.Data stolen included information on customer betting habits from casinos and other relevant information belonging to mining companies. Also, the malware allowed the hackers to delete or change files and affect critical databases.The ransom demanded: The ransom demanded was around 100 to 500 bitcoins, equivalent to 35,000 to 170,000 Canadian dollars, to be paid in 10 days if the victims did not want their data to be released publicly.Those who did not comply with the group\u2019s terms had their systems completely shut down, closing down all operations altogether.Victims\u2019 names not yet revealed: When asked about who were the victims, FireEye did not tell the specific names and simply told that less than ten companies have been infected.

When it comes to malware, they prefer sending malicious attachments in an email but times have changed and these threat actors are coming up with new ways to target their victims. One of the new ways requires an e-cigarettes or a vape pen and some modification to convert it into a hacking tool and infect a targeted computer.Security researcher Ross Bevington (@FourOctets on Twitter) had a presentation at BSides London that showcased an e-cigarette attacking a computer by tricking it to believe that it was a keyboard. It was also able to hack the computer by interfering with its network traffic.It is done because most of the e-cigs come with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which can be plugged into a cable or directly connects to the USB port of a computer.In a conversation with Sky News, Bevington said that:\u201cHe had modified the vape pen by simply adding a hardware chip which allowed the device to communicate with the laptop as if it were a keyboard or mouse \u2013 A pre-written script that was saved on the vape made Windows open up the Notepad application and typed \u201cDo you even vape bro!!!!\u201dIt is unclear what kind of malware infection can be done through the e-cigarettes however based on WannaCry malware attack one can expect the worst, therefore, require to be careful while using e-cigarettes or vape devices on their computer.

In 2014, a company executive had their computer infected with a malware and no amount of cleaning, robust security or anti-malware protection was able to thwart the data compromise. The IT security experts failed to nail the problem and decided to investigate if executive routine had any changes.It was then that they found out that the executive had switched to e-cigarettes in an attempt to quit smoking and lead a healthy life. The IT experts discovered that the charger of the e-cigarette was compromised and the moment it was connected to the computer, the malware would connect it to a remote server and download the malicious software.To avoid such risks, it is advised to disable data pins on the USB and keep only cable charge to prevent any information exchange between the devices it connects.

However, as RiskIQ, found, users need to be more careful as the anti-malware solutions might just be another prank disguised as authentic software.RiskIQ researched a number of apps that appeared to be anti-virus software and scanned them using its own mobile database. It was revealed that most of them were simply another form of adware.A total of 6,295 Android apps popped up when the word \u201cAntivirus\u201d was searched and of the total, over 700 apps were shown in the blacklisted category, implying that in reality, the apps were not what they claimed to be.Moreover, the test was run to see how many apps have been listed on Google Play Store and the results showed that out of the 655 apps on Google play, 131 were blacklisted.

The malware, called Erebus, has been responsible for hijacking 153 Linux-based networks of a South Korean web-hosting company called NAYANA.Erebus is a ransomware capable of infecting Linux operating systems. As such, around 3,400 of NAYANA\u2019s clients were affected due to the attack with databases, websites and other files being encrypted.The incident took place on 10th June. As of now, NAYANA has not received the keys to decrypt their files despite having paid three parts of the ransom. The fourth one, which is allegedly the last installment, is yet to be paid. However, according to NAYANA, the attackers claimed to provide the key after three payments.According to Trend Micro\u2019s report, Erebus was originally found back in September 2016. At the time, the malware was not that harmful and was being distributed through malware-containing advertisements. Once the user clicked on those ads, the ransomware would activate in the usual way.The initial version of the Erebus only affected 423 file types and did so using the RSA-2048 encryption algorithm, thereby encrypting the files with the .encrypt extension. Furthermore, it was this variant that was using a number of websites in South Korea as a command-&-control (C&C) center.Later, in February 2017, the malware had seemingly evolved as now it had the ability to bypass User Account Control (UAC). For those who may be unfamiliar with UAC, it is primarily a Windows privacy protection system that restricts anyone who is not authorized, to alter the user\u2019s computer.However, this later version of the Erebus was able to do so and inject ransomware ever so conveniently. The campaign in which this version was involved demanded a ransom of 0.085 bitcoins \u2013 equivalent to USD 216 at present \u2013 and threatened to delete the files in 96 hours if the ransom was not paid.Now, however, Erebus has reached new heights by having the ability to bypass not only UAC but also affect entire networks that run on Linux. Given that most organizations today use Linux for their networks, it is no surprise to see that the effects of the malware are far-reaching.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});According to Trend Micro, the most recent version of Erebus uses RSA algorithm to alter the AES keys in Windows and change the encryption key as such. Also, the attack is accompanied by a Bluetooth service so as to ensure that the ransomware does not break, even after the computer is rebooted.This version can affect a total of 433 file types including databases, archives, office documents, email files, web-based files and multimedia files. The ransom demanded in this campaign amounts to 5 bitcoins, which is USD 12,344 currently.Although ransomware affecting Linux based networks are rare, they are, however, not new. Erebus is not the first ransomware to have affected networks running on Linux. In fact, Trend Micro claims that such ransomware was discovered as far back as in 2014.Some of the ransomware include Linux.Encoder, Encrypter RaaS, KillDisk, KimcilWare and much more. All of these were allegedly developed from an open-source code project that was available as part of an educational campaign.The ransomware for Linux, despite being somewhat inferior to those for Windows, are still potent enough to cause damage on a massive scale. This is because, a number of organizations and data centers use Linux, and hijacking such high-end systems can only mean catastrophe.To avoid any accidents happening, IT officials and organizations running Linux-based networks need to take some serious precautions. The most obvious one is to simply keep the server updated with the latest firmware and anti-virus software.Furthermore, it is always a good idea to keep a back-up of your data files in two to three separate locations. It is also repeatedly advised to avoid installing unknown third-party programs as these can act as potential gateways for such ransomware.Lastly, IT administrators should keep monitoring the traffic that passes through the network and looks for anomalies by identifying any inconsistencies in event logs.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Ransomware", "security", "Windows"], "title": "Erebus Ransomware Targets Linux Servers", "date": "June 16, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The whistleblowing site WikiLeaks is back with yet another Vault 7 series related document.

It wasn\u2019t that long ago when hackers had to steal your credit card info or your bank card itself to get the money out of your account. Now they don\u2019t have to since the ATMs are just giving away money as soon as they get infected by the new malware.Several security agencies have already warned banks that their ATMs are being breached and robbed. The thieves don\u2019t have to break into the hardware, nor do they need to steal credit cards.Instead, they use Rufus, a new Chinese software that makes the ATMs simply give up the money. Several reports of such thefts have already been received, and they came from many different places. West Bengal, Gujarat, Odisha, and Bihar were all affected by this new way of stealing the money.According to some sources, the Rufus malware can exploit old and outdated ATM software. All of the affected ATMs were found to be still using the old versions of Windows XP. This was discovered despite the fact that they were notified about the system\u2019s vulnerability to the WannaCry attack.So far, only the ATMs with this software were affected, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee that the others are completely safe either. This system is mostly targeted because it\u2019s easy to hack. The first hacking incident apparently happened in Odisha city. Soon after, the reports from other areas started coming in as well.It was confirmed by the Bihar police and the West Bengal cyber crime branches that the attacks are the work of the cyber criminals. The police are consulting cyber experts in an attempt to get any help that they can with cracking this case.This isn\u2019t the first time that something like this has happened either. The last case of ATM hack was reported last year when similar strategies were used. Back then, the targets were Begusarai, Jehanabad, and Bihar\u2019s Patna.As for the method they used, it\u2019s reported that the hackers are targeting unguarded ATMs during the night. They insert the infected pen drive in the USB port, and that way they infect it with malware. The malware would restart the system, which breaks the connection with the service provider\u2019s servers.Malware also generates a code after it\u2019s used on the ATM, and that code can be translated into a password. When the password is entered, the ATM releases the money. The worst thing is that this kind of attack wouldn\u2019t immediately raise the alarms. Meaning that the hackers can do their thing and simply walk away.Partial blame lies on the ATM vendors for not ensuring an adequate security for the machines, which is a major rule violation, as pointed out by the security agencies. Prashant Mali, a cyber lawyer from Mumbai, says that the government should make sure that ATM makers are installing decent security in their products.He also says that the government\u2019s plans to increase the number of ATMs should include enhancement of security.

Its purpose was to help users by suggesting which other popular apps they could use. It all worked fine for everyone until the company stopped supporting the service.According to MotherBoard, apparently, during the last couple of months, the software wasn\u2019t supported by Samsung anymore. That lead to failed renewal of the ssuggest.com domain, which left it wide open for someone else to use. Fortunately for Samsung, as well as for all of its users, the domain was taken over by a security researcher Jo\u00e3o Gouveia.Gouveia is Anubis Lab\u2019s chief technology officer and he stated that he has taken over the platform for fear that someone else might do it instead. In case that they did, any of the older Samsung smartphones might end up being infiltrated by hackers, malware, trojans, or alike.Gouveia reportedly detected over 620 million connections in only 24 hours.

Both tools are used in testing and scanning malware samples to evade anti-virus and security software detection. It must be noted that the first phase of Operation Neuland was carried out on 5th April 2016 targeting suspected operators of counter antivirus and crypter services along with their customers based in Germany. During the first phase of the operation, authorities raided houses in Canada, France and Netherlands. Furthermore, houses and offices of 170 suspects were raided in Germany while a 22-year-old was also arrested.According to the Europol\u2019s press release:\u201cEuropol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre provided extensive support for secure information exchange, the preparation of the target packages per country, and in-depth malware analysis.

However, it would seem that the attacks they feared were even more common than previously believed.Telecoms have been using a private Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) network that has been vulnerable to cyber attacks. And on the other side, users being ignorant to complete even their simple security puzzle like installing a good antivirus program \u2013 are making it easy for the cybercriminals to do what they want. Now, a service on the Dark Web is asking users to pay $500 and in return, it will track the targeted smartphone for them. The tracking will include intercepting texts, track phones and even completely cut off the cellular service to other people.This service can be accessed at zkkc7e5rwvs4bpxm.onion to those who uses the Tor network. It\u2019s called the \u2018Interconnector,\u2019 and besides the $500-worth full access, it also offers deals for smaller fees. For example, you can intercept texts for $250 or only get a report about the certain cell phone for $150.Some of the wealthier users may even choose to pay the ultimate price of $5,500 and get direct access to the SS7 port itself. Basically, for this amount, they\u2019ll get everything they could need to start their telecom service.According to a report from TheVerge, there were reports of people paying to the manager of this website, but then being ignored. Many have thus labeled this offer a scam. However, this was followed by a sudden website activity in which it offered a new and free page where you\u2019ll be able to test the service yourself.The access won\u2019t be free, of course, but heavily limited. So far, everything seems to indicate that this is real SS7 hacking and that it\u2019s not a scam. SS7 network is a closed network and not like the internet. It was only supposed to be accessed by several phone companies.For that reason, there are a few authentication systems for those who use it. The researchers were concerned that SS7 can be hacked through the telecom companies or even reprogrammed directly.The manager of this website (Interconnect0r) refused to say how they managed to get or keep access to this network. They did mention that accessing and maintaining access didn\u2019t come with some significant technical difficulties. This was surprising considering that the phone companies put in a lot of effort and interventions to keep the network safe.Not only that, but they also said that many others have had access to this network by using similar methods and that it\u2019s much easier to do so than someone might think. All you need is the right info, or the right guidance, according to Interconnect0r.As for the network itself, it\u2019s vulnerabilities aren\u2019t a new thing. In fact, it was known for years that it had problems, but nobody bothered to do something about them. The flaws and dangers of hacking this system were demonstrated back in 2014 by Karten Nohl. It was said even then that this system could be used for tracking people\u2019s real location, read their texts and redirect calls.

In fact, research showed that there had already been a hacking tool going by the name of MZD-AIO-TI.The MZD \u2013 All-In-One Tweaks Installer or, MZD-AIO-TI for short, simply allows the user to play with the system\u2019s settings letting them install apps and do all sorts of things to alter the original configuration.However, this was followed on by another enthusiastic car system researcher, Jay Turla, a security engineer at Bugcrowd, who used the former knowledge of the MZD-AIO-TI and other tools to devise a new tool called the Mazda-getInfo.The Mazda-getInfo is a unique tool that lets the user infect MZD Connect\u2019s system through just a USB.In an interview with BleepingComputer, Turla said that he was inspired to carry on with the project after he visited a Car Hacking Village which was a conference dealing with such systems. He later released the code on GitHub and opened it for anyone who wanted to try the technique on their car.Once the code is in the system, the user can easily launch an attack that may involve quite harmless things. However, it has been noted that the malware thus injected can be used for far more unscrupulous crimes than just changing the settings.Essentially, the user just needs to copy the chunk of code released on GitHub, and load it onto one\u2019s USB. Then, the user simply needs to insert the USB into the dashboard and the magic will work by itself. That is, the entire thing is automatic and does not require the user to interfere in any way.Nevertheless, doing so has certain limitations. One of them is that the car\u2019s engine needs to be running or it must be in accessory mode. Otherwise, the malware will not work.Although this is a disadvantage regarding hacking, it, however, acts as a defense mechanism against attackers who might want to steal a car by manipulating the car\u2019s smart system. This is because the malware will not allow them to start the car in the first place.But this is just for the time-being, as Turla noted. Hackers may well come up with botnets which can do the job for them. Also, a remote access trojan attack can also be executed through the vulnerability in the system.BleepingComputer noticed that an updated version of the MZD connect firmware has been released that prevents anyone from injecting malware with a USB.This is not the first time when an Internet-connected vehicle has been found vulnerable to cyber attacks. Previously, Jeep Cherokee onboard system was hacked putting more than 470,000 vehicles at risk.

Dragos also stated that (PDF) while the previous malware only caused an outage for some hours, Crash Override can do so for days.Researchers fear that this latest version is highly potent regarding its capability to understand industrial processes and manipulate them as the attackers have directed it. Essentially, when it comes to power grids, researchers say that the malware can communicate between relay points and hence control the system altogether.The industrial communication protocols of the virus are much more sophisticated and can therefore not only be applied to hack into power systems but can also be deployed in other major services such as transportation, water supply, and other similar nation-wide systems.What is more frightening is the fact that the malware was designed to affect systems that were created without any security protocols. This means that attackers today, need not search for any glitches or flaws as the entire infrastructure does not have any immune system in the first place.This is combined with the fact that the malware works as a digital switch, meaning the damage that can be caused by the malware can be much more far-reaching as it can simply switch on or off the power supply anytime.According to reports, the researchers at Dragos were given cryptographic hashes of the malware from their partners ESET. It was during the investigation of these that Dragos stumbled over the mighty Crash Override.Dragos got involved into the investigation as it believed that the malware could be used against the U.S. The firm stated that the virus only needed a little bit of tweaking to hack into U.S systems and those of wider Europe.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});According to ESET\u2019s findings and blog post: \u201cIndustroyer is a particularly dangerous threat since it is capable of controlling electricity substation switches and circuit breakers directly. To do so, it uses industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power-supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems (such as water and gas).These switches and circuit breakers are digital equivalents of analog switches; technically they can be engineered to perform various functions. Thus, the potential impact may range from simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and more serious damage to equipment. The severity may also vary from one substation to another, as well. Needless to say, disruption of such systems can directly or indirectly affect the functioning of vital services.Industroyer\u2019s dangerousness lies in the fact that it uses protocols in the way they were designed to be used. The problem is that these protocols were designed decades ago, and back then industrial systems were meant to be isolated from the outside world. Thus, their communication protocols were not designed with security in mind. That means that the attackers didn\u2019t need to be looking for protocol vulnerabilities; all they needed was to teach the malware \u201cto speak\u201d those protocols.\u201dResearchers at Dragos stated that although the malware is quite powerful in that it can fluently communicate with the industrial process, it is, however, even more, dangerous as it deploys conventional malware attacking methods.That is, the malware has the ability to distort information and as such, make troubleshooting systems all the more difficult. Also, the malware can use various methods to attack as was evidenced by the fact that it hacked into a control system manufactured by Siemens by exploiting a certain vulnerability that existed therein.Nevertheless, the ubiquity of platforms like Tor, making it ever easier for attackers to hide their traces and use commands through hidden servers to control the malware regarding how it attacks.As of now, Dragos claims that the malware is more than likely to be associated with the hacking group called Sandworm. This is because the same group had been identified perpetrating another attack back in 2014.In this attack, the targets were the Ukrainian and Polish governments along with European industries and the tool used to launch the attack was discovered to be BlackEnergy. In the 2015 attack, it was found that a more enhanced version, BlackEnery3 was used to hack into the power supply network.It is likely that the malware will evolve even further as the likes of it are already out there in the wild.

Now, things have changed as hackers and cyber criminals are bypassing Google\u2019s security implementation on Play Store and uploading apps infected with malware.The IT security researchers at Trend Mirco have discovered that over 800 Android apps on Google Play store contain a malware called Xavier that is silently stealing personal and financial data of users. The infected apps belong to categories like photo manipulators, utilities, ringtone chargers, anti-virus, volume booster, speed booster, video converter, call recorder, and wallpaper apps downloaded millions of times by users around the world.The majority of downloads came from countries like Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam while some of the downloads attempts were from European countries and the United States. Here\u2019s a list of 75 apps that Google has already removed.According to Trend Micro\u2019s blog post:\u201cXavier\u2019s stealing and leaking capabilities are difficult to detect because of a self-protect mechanism that allows it to escape both static and dynamic analysis. In addition, Xavier also has the capability to download and execute other malicious codes, which might be an even more dangerous aspect of the malware. Xavier\u2019s behavior depends on the downloaded codes and the URL of codes, which are configured by the remote server.\u201dXavier is not a new malware, in fact, it belongs to AdDown family which was discovered two years ago with remote code execution capabilities. Its first version appeared in 2015 and dubbed by researchers as \u201cJoymobile\u201d while Xavier itself was detected in September 2016.Other than evading detection, Xavier comes with capabilities including collecting, leaking user data and installing other APKs in case the infected device is rooted. Furthermore, it also communicates with the Command & Control (C&C) server without encryption. However, all constant strings were encrypted in the code. Xavier does that all by remaining undetected.While Google is removing the infected apps it does not mean the malware will completely vanish from Play Store or that it will not make a come back. Xavier is a nasty piece of malware developed to take control of users\u2019 device and data, therefore users are advised not to download apps unnecessarily.Android users are also advised to use a verified security software and always scan their devices. Another noteworthy thing about Android is that it is one of the most targeted smartphones operating systems in the world.

To be precise, the UAE InvestBank was in May 2016 while Qatar National Bank (QNB) suffered a data breach in April 2016.In the Sharjah-based InvestBank\u2019s case, a hacker leaked a 10GB file containing personal and financial details of customers and clients including thousands of records showing full names of account holders, addresses, passport numbers, phone numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers along with their CVV codes and other highly confidential data.The data was stolen by a hacker calling himself \u201cHacker Buba.\u201d He also demanded $3 million in ransom. However, the bank refused to pay the ransom after which the data was leaked on the Internet using Google Drive.Currently, the UAE InvestBank\u2019s data is being sold on a popular Dark Web marketplace for only USD 22.80 (BTC 0.0071).The data according to the sample data provided by the vendor includes bank accounts, bank beneficiaries, bank cards, bank customers, customer ids, branch codes, bank cards and full names of account holders.The Qatar National Bank also suffered a massive data breach in which 1.4GB of data from the database containing personal data of its customers was leaked. The dump included hundreds of thousands of financial records including credit card numbers and their PIN codes and customer transaction logs. Moreover, the hackers also claimed to leak banking details of the Al-Thani Qatar Royal Family and Al Jazeera journalists.One of the leaked folders among the leaked data was labeled as \u201cSPY\u201d catching the eyes of anyone who had access to the leaked data. Upon scanning, it was found that there were financial details of what appears to be UK\u2019s intelligence service MI6, Qatari Ministry of Defence and Qatar State Security Bureau \u201cMukhabarat.Qatar National Bank acknowledged the breach after hackers released an inside video showing how they hacked bank\u2019s servers. However, now the data is being sold on the Dark Web for  USD 22.80 (BTC 0.0071).The sample data shows that the leaked records contain bank accounts, bank beneficiaries, bank cards and personal details of its customers.This incident is similar to the LinkedIn (hacked in 2012), DropBox (hacked in 2012), and MySpace (hacked in 2013) who did a lot of damage to the users since they were using the same old passwords. However, in the case of these two banks, it is unclear whether the banks issued new credit cards to thousands of customers who were affected by these breaches.Therefore, customers are urged to keep an eye on their banking card transactions and contact their respective banks in case of any suspicious activity.

Usually, the user is prompted to click the link in order for the malware to do its job. However, researchers at Trend Micro have recently uncovered a malware that only needs you to hover your mouse over a link for the malware to execute itself.According to researchers, the malware is essentially a banking Trojan which, automatically steals a victim\u2019s credentials and banking information when inside users\u2019 system.Primarily, the researchers analyzed the Trojan and found it to be an OTLARD variant, otherwise known as Gootkit. This banking Trojan has been in cyberspace since 2012 and has evolved into being a Trojan capable of remote access, network traffic monitoring and other similar tactics.The Trojan can steal bank information and has done so in the past in a campaign that involved France. The perpetrators sent out files which seemingly appeared as letters from the French Ministry of Justice.The malware is activated right after the victim hovers over a link that is present in the PowerPoint file, sent as an email attachment. The email contains other files such as an invoice and a purchase order as well along with the PowerPoint file, PPS or PPSX.When the victim opens the PowerPoint slide, he/she hovers over a link in the slide and if the user chooses to run the associated file from the pop-up that appears in Microsoft Office, the malware will execute itself instantly.However, this is assuming that the user is operating older versions of Microsoft Office. This is because, in the latest version, Microsoft Office originally opens files in Protected View thereby preventing any malicious infections to get into the system.As such, the method largely relies upon adept social engineering so as to effectively trick the user into opening the file and disabling the Protected view so as to hover over the link.The technique of a mouse-hover may work effectively in corporate environments where Office files are regularly sent and received with employees paying little attention to what the file is. According to Trend Micro:\u201cThe trick will not work in Microsoft PowerPoint Online or Office 365\u2019s \u201cweb mode\u201d, as these don\u2019t provide the actions functionality that is present in offline/desktop versions.

Recently, the IT security researchers at Fortinet discovered a ransomware campaign that uniquely targets Mac OS and is being offered as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) on dark web. Although this is not the first instance of RaaS, it is, however, still troubling as it can shift the focus from Windows to the seemingly safe Mac devices.Dubbed as MacRansom, this Mac ransomware malware is not all that harmful in its operation. Nevertheless, it is still a subject of concern as it can lock a victim\u2019s files and demand ransom and threaten users by stating that all their files will be deleted within a week if the payment is not made.The service is offered to newbies as well which means that it is safe to predict that after Windows, Macs will now become the focal point of mainstream ransomware.According to the researchers, the ransomware comes with a trigger that is set as per demanded by the buyer. The trigger is associated with a time switch that activates once the trigger gets active.It is only after the trigger is activated that files start to get encrypted in a victim\u2019s system. This means that the ransomware does not start encrypting files as soon as it enters the system. Rather, the attack is delayed.Nevertheless, researchers say that only 128 files can get encrypted and therefore the virus is not as harmful as others, albeit, it is still able to alter the Time Date Stamp, implying that no recovery tools will serve a useful purpose.The ransom demanded amounts to 0.25 bitcoins which are equivalent to $700, and victims need to email the perpetrator if they are to pay the amount and have their files unlocked.According to Rommel Joven and Wayne Chin Yick Low of Fortinet:\u201cIt is not every day that we see new ransomware specifically targeting Mac OS platform. Even if it is far inferior from most current ransomware targeting Windows, it doesn\u2019t fail to encrypt victim\u2019s files or prevent access to important files, thereby causing real damage.\u201d\u201cLast but not the least, this MacRansom variant is potentially being brewed by copycats as we saw quite a lot of similar code and ideas taken from previous OSX ransomware. Even though it utilizes anti-analysis tricks, which differs from previous OSX ransomware, these are well-known techniques widely deployed by many malware authors. MacRansom is yet another example of the prevalence of the ransomware threat, regardless of the OS platform being run. There are no perfect mitigations against ransomware. However, the impact can be minimized by doing regular backups of important files and being cautious when opening files from unidentified sources or developers.\u201dResearchers worry since a Mac ransomware has now emerged in cyberspace, it is only a matter of time before other spammers and hackers develop a copy which can be much more sophisticated in terms of damage caused than MacRansom.Furthermore, it has been revealed that the developers of MacRansom have other offerings, one of which is the MacSpy malware which was discovered by AlienVault.The malware is similar to MacRansom and has features which allow attackers to use key logs and obtain files that are synced with iCloud. There is a paid version as well which contains more advanced functionalities.Given that it was mostly Windows that became the target of ruthless ransomware attacks, it is surprising to see that Macs have now been taken into the fold as well. Perhaps this is due to the fact that Mac users have grown in the past years.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "dark web", "hacking", "internet", "Mac", "Malware", "Privacy", "Ransomware", "security", "Technology"], "title": "\u2018The Most Sophisticated Mac Ransomware\u2019 Being Sold on Dark Web", "date": "June 12, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Most of you who might have shopped from GameStop might be aware of the incident that took place almost two months ago in April when the retail giant announced that many of its customers\u2019 credit card information had been hacked and stolen.What is surprising though, that it is only now that the company is notifying the customers about the breach telling them that their credit card information including the CVV2 numbers has been stolen.Essentially, GameStop was notified by KrebsOnSecurity that most of their customer accounts had been hacked with attackers stealing private information related to credit cards along with CVV2 numbers. Also, it was reported that hackers were selling this information on a marketplace.The breach had allegedly occurred between August 2016 and April 2017, but GameStop did not notify its customers regarding the attack at the time.All it said that it has involved a number of forensic experts to investigate the matter further and that it has notified the relevant legal authorities. It also stated that it had hired an expert cyber security firm to help them identify the perpetrators.

Since then, three other malware families have emerged with each one competing for space by blocking the other. These malware families according to Trend Micro\u2019s blog post include: \u2013\u2013 DrvHelper\u2013 Mirai\u2013 The MoonEach malware family, once in the system, prevents the other from entering the compromised device.Let us begin by Persirai, as this was the first in line to have launched a DDoS attack on quite a large scale. Essentially, the malware works by exploiting certain vulnerabilities in IP cameras that let an attacker get admin privileges and hence launch an attack accordingly.The vulnerability lets an attacker obtain a victim\u2019s admin password and use this to inject and command malware. Since the attacker already has access, he/she can easily execute arbitrary code to launch attacks.Trend Micro reports that around 64% of IP cameras tracked in the US, Japan, Taiwan and Korea were infected by Persirai putting it ahead of all other malware families.Mirai is another interesting malware with unique features that already emerged in cyberspace even before Persirai. It was discovered in August 2016 when it too, launched one of the biggest DDoS attacks ever to be seen.However, developers of Mirai published its code in the wild making it easier for other hackers and developers to improve upon the malware family.It was not long after the code was published that attackers developed an enhanced version of Mirai. This time, DvrHelper came with better immunity against the security protocols built to restrain Mirai. This even included bypassing as an anti-DDoS solution.Last but not the least, the moon appeared on the show as far back as in 2014, making it precede all other malware families mentioned above.TrendMicro researchers identified newer versions of the Moon in which there are different binaries for different vulnerabilities. Also, there are certain iptables rules which allow The Moon to prevent any other malware invading its space once it has launched itself on a specific machine.According to Kenny Lu Tim Yeh Dove Chiu of Trend Micro:\u201cLooking at the data from infected devices from the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Korea, we see that Persirai is the clear frontrunner. However, the landscape is constantly changing and many vulnerable IP cameras are still exposed to the internet. With the success of these four families, other developers might be releasing their own IP camera-targeting malware and the results could be completely different very soon.\u201dThere is no denying the fact that malware attacks have become pervasive to the extent that is almost unrestrainable. Nonetheless, users can still protect their IP cameras by having stronger passwords and following best standards to create one.But given that Persirai can easily crack such strong passwords, a more robust precaution is to disable any plug-and-play routers connected to your IP camera. Also, manufacturers need to be more careful with their software and regularly launch updates to provide better security.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Botnet", "Cyber Attack", "DDOS", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Mirai", "Persirai", "security"], "title": "Persirai malware in action: IP cameras all across the world compromised", "date": "June 10, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "The IT security researchers have discovered a malware in China that has mimicked WannaCry ransomware attack to some extent and has been named \u201cWannaLocker.\u201d The ransomware is similar to WannaCry regarding how it appears on the screen and how it demands ransom in order to unblock one\u2019s files.Android phones become the victim: The research from Avast based on Chinese security firm Qihoo 360\u2019s finding says that it is only Android phones that have been infected and that the ransomware has not caused any damage outside China.

It does so by masquerading as an innocent plug-in required to play the game, \u201cKing of Glory.\u201dOnce downloaded, the phone\u2019s home screen displays an anime wallpaper and it starts to encrypt files in the background. One cannot locate where the app is stored as the app icon simply vanishes from the home screen.How does it work? The ransomware is similar to WannaCry and as such, encrypts files while demanding payment from users if they want to access their files.However, it has been observed that the ransomware uses a much more advanced level encryption technique. This applies in particular in the context of Android as ransomware targeting this software has not gone beyond simply blocking the user\u2019s screen.Essentially, WannaLocker encrypts files using the Advanced Encryption Standard and does not affect files that are over 10 KB in size or start with a dot. Also, files that have \u201cAndroid, \u201cdownload,\u201d \u201cmiad,\u201d or \u201cDICM\u201d in their extensions also do not get affected by the infection.The ransomware is mostly likely a work of a novice: Unlike the WannaCry campaign which used Bitcoins as the primary currency in which it expected its victims to pay the ransom, the WannaLocker campaign instructs the victims to pay in actual currency with the amount being around $6.Apart from the amount being incredibly low, the more surprising aspect of the campaign is it asks its victims to pay in actual currency. It is like asking to get caught.This is because actual currency payments can be easily tracked and given that this is China we are talking about, the authorities in the country already have access to vital information regarding people\u2019s locations, bank accounts and more.It would not have taken more than a minute for the Chinese authorities to figure out from where the attack was being launched and who were the actual perpetrators.

According to Microsoft\u2019s blog post:\u201cUpon discovery of this unique file-transfer tool, Microsoft shared information with Intel, and the two companies collaborated to analyze and better understand the purpose and implementation of the tool. We confirmed that the tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself, but rather misused AMT SOL within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications.\u201d\u201cThe updated tool has only been seen in a handful of victim computers within organizational networks in Southeast Asia\u2014PLATINUM is known to customize tools based on the network architecture of targeted organizations. The diagram below represents the file-transfer tool\u2019s updated channel and network flow.\u201dAs mentioned earlier, the AMT firmware runs at low-level so as to allow remote access to networks. However, this low-level operation can be hazardous as it can allow an attacker to inject and connect to malware without being detected.Essentially, whatever traffic that goes through the AMT is handled from within. That is, the AMT itself controls the traffic. Given that the traffic can contain malicious viruses and that AMT is running on low-level, the traffic can easily bypass Windows\u2019 firewall.This is because the traffic never gets out and hence does not get filtered through Windows firewall to be detected for any inconsistency. However, the PLATINUM group uses the AMTs virtual serial port through which it can connect to the malware and hence link itself with the entire network.Combining all this, the technique involves using serial-over-LAN traffic to send the malware and connect it to the network using the serial port without being detected.Microsoft says that although attackers can exploit machines through AMT, it, however, does not mean that the technology is flawed. It is simply the way that it is designed which allows attackers to take undue advantage.Furthermore, experts say that AMT has to be enabled to connect to the remote network. As such, if AMT is switched off, there is no way that attackers can exploit it. However, this is a debated issue as some experts say that it might be the malware itself that enables AMT automatically.In any case, Microsoft believes that its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection technology is enough to detect such malicious traffic.

However, researchers at Trend Micro discovered that (PDF) APIs of these platforms could be exploited to serve as C&C centers for different types of malware.Application programming interface or API for short is a set of tools and protocols that allow apps to be integrated with other primary systems so as to be used in a complete and seamless manner.That is, with the use of APIs, primary systems can be enhanced regarding functionality. It is perhaps because of this that businesses are so obsessed with apps like Slack which allow them to easily integrate the advanced functionality of the chat platform with their primary system.This eases the staff from using different apps for different functions and thus makes the process of communication much smoother.However, it seems that it is the same APIs that can be manipulated by attackers to turn the innocuous apps into malicious C&C centers for malware that can be used by the attacker to communicate with the malware and launch attacks accordingly.The main threat to businesses and users operating such third-party apps is that the attacks are immune to security. That is, attackers can turn the entire app into a C&C system without being detected by any anti-malware or security.This is because, in essence, the attacker is simply using a chat app to communicate; albeit, with malware. Hence, the mere act of communicating does not get captured by the relevant security protocols, implying that the attacker can launch any attack conveniently.Reports say that normal ransomware is executed using an automated algorithm. That is, a ransomware controls itself using a pre-defined code and therefore harms a computer as directed by the code. This means there is no human intervention.In the case of chat apps being used as C&C systems, attackers can manipulate the malware as they wish once the infection has been injected into a victim\u2019s system. They only need to sign up to these apps like a normal user and start commanding the malware to perform all sorts of vicious attacks.Hence, rather than being automated, the malware can be controlled to do anything the attacker wants it to. This makes it far more dangerous than normal ransomware attacks.\u201cThe malware we found currently taking advantage of Telegram and Discord are proof of this. And it is not a remote possibility that we will see more and more examples of chat platform API abuse in the near future. For example, instead of writing a custom interface from scratch to communicate with a ransomware victim, a cybercriminal may just opt to use a third-party chat client wrapped in a custom chat window that opens a web socket to the appropriate channel. He can then immediately walk the victim through the payment process and start with the decryption once the ransom is paid,\u201d said Trend Micro.Perhaps the only way to remain secure is to keep monitoring any changes in data that is being transmitted through the apps while businesses need to secure their networks by installing anti-virus and other anti-malware tools.

Once the update is installed, the malware cannot be removed.According to Zscaler, a web security company the APK downloads itself from ads that have malware contained within them. Ads on online forums, in particular, have been found to host the malware.Once the app is downloaded, the user is presented with a message saying that the phone has a security loophole which puts the user\u2019s account and personal information at risk. In the end, the only option that is present is the \u201cOk\u201d button.Given that the user has no other choice and he/she believes it to be a legit security update from Google, the user taps the \u201cOk\u201d button upon which another APK is downloaded which is dubbed as \u201cUpdate.\u201dOnce the APK \u201cUpdate\u201d is downloaded in one\u2019s system, one cannot remove it due to the APK registering itself as an Android Receiver.An android receiver is essentially a component of the Android software which gets activated whenever a registered event or action gets performed.In this case, the APK, by registering itself as an android receiver gains administrative rights which imply that whenever a user tries to delete it manually, the registered event entitled \u2018DEVICE_ADMIN_DISABLED\u2019 triggers the malware with the phone simply getting stuck and the malware not being removed.And if you try to close the app by force, it will keep running in the background due to a .dex file that lets it run even if it is closed. According to the blog post by Shivang Desai of Zscaler: \u201cOnce the app gains admin rights, it becomes impossible to remove it from the device. The traditional \u2018Uninstall\u2019 option, by default, becomes disabled, because a user cannot remove apps with admin rights. Usually, one can uninstall such apps by first removing admin privileges via settings, but this app uses an unconventional method \u2014 registering as an Android receiver \u2014 to preserve its admin privileges.\u201dOnce the APK is in your system, you will keep seeing unnecessary display ads on your home screen. However, there is much more that the APK \u201cUpdate\u201d can do. For instance, it can manipulate your bookmarks, toggle with your settings and even download other apps without you even knowing about it.First and foremost, refrain from clicking on suspicious links and disable automatic download. This will ensure that no unknown apps or malware gets downloaded in the background.

For example, they\u2019re extremely vulnerable to hacking attacks that when an attack is performed, the cameras might allow the hacker to see video feeds, compromise other devices, download existing files and more.Up to 18 different vulnerabilities were documented by the researchers, first of which were reported several months ago. However, the company has yet to fix any of them. The brand that has all of these flaws is called Opticam i5 HD, while some flaws were found on the model marked Foscam C2. According to the report [Pdf], it\u2019s possible that other models developed by the same manufacturer may carry similar flaws.The research claims that the number of flaws can offer any attacker many ways of infecting the device. One of the flaws includes both unsecured, as well as hard-coded credentials. In both cases, a potential hacker can easily gain access to the devices. It\u2019s also possible to use other flaws for the purpose of getting remote command injections.The report also says that attackers can even modify the code of these devices or get to the root privileges by accessing world-writeable files. It\u2019s also possible for an attacker to use Telnet and find even more flaws in the device, or its surrounding network. Also, the firewall protecting the devices doesn\u2019t even act like one.\u201cThe sheer number of vulnerabilities offers an attacker multiple alternatives in compromising the device. Among the discovered vulnerabilities are insecure default credentials and hard-coded credentials, both of which make it trivial for an attacker to gain unauthorized access. Other vulnerabilities allow for remote command injection by an attacker. World-writeable files and directories allow an attacker to modify the code and to gain root privileges. Hidden Telnet functionality allows an attacker to use Telnet to discover additional vulnerabilities in the device and within the surrounding network. In addition, the device\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d doesn\u2019t behave as a firewall, and it also discloses information about the validity of credentials.\u201dAll in all, these vulnerabilities are leaving a lot of possibilities for capable hackers, including the chance to use them in a botnet and launch DDoS attacks. And of course, accessing private videos, or using the devices as a bridge to infecting other devices from the same network can also be expected. It\u2019s even possible to replace camera\u2019s regular firmware with a malicious one, and not even be detected while doing it.The report also mentioned that both models have the same file transfer protocol server that\u2019s built into them. It has an empty account password that can\u2019t be changed by the regular user. It also has a hidden telnet function that will allow hackers to widen the abilities of the device and the programming scripts have incorrect permissions which run whenever the device starts.These three flaws can be exploited heavily by the attackers and they can be used for getting remote access to the devices. The report says that the empty password can even be used for logging in, which leads to activation of the Telnet functionality. The hackers can then get to the world-writable file and use it to control which of the programs can run on boot. Even if the device is rebooted, the attacker will still have access.Researchers then said that the company was alerted and that these vulnerabilities were pointed out to them a few months ago. Still, it would seem that none of them have been fixed. There were no security updates and F-Secure has refused to release the proof of the exploits. They also said that they\u2019d found such flaws in 14 different brands, besides Opticom and Foskam.Those are Sab, Chacon. Ivue, 7links, Ebode, Thomason, Qcam, Opticam, Nexxt, Netis, Techanaxx, Turbox, Ambientcam, and Novodio.F-Secure suggests that for now running any of these devices is dangerous and users are recommended to do so only inside a dedicated local network and don\u2019t give them access to other devices.

They can do so using a malware named xLED, as reported by JPost.The Cyber Security Research Center at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negvu which is located in Israel have come up with a way to hack into a user\u2019s computer and steal vital data in the form of LED lights that are displayed on a router.Essentially, the operation would require a specially crafted malware named xLED which will need to be installed on a router in order to hack a victim. That is, the router needs to have a security flaw so as to allow the hacker to install the malware in the first place.It can also be possible if a flawed firmware has been installed in the router, thus making it easier for the attacker to break through the device.Once the malware is installed, the data can be exfiltrated in the binary form represented by the blinking of lights. Hence, when the light is off, it will represent a zero while when it is on, it will represent a one.A video recording device can be used to capture the blinking pattern and utilized to steal vital information that is being transmitted through the router. The device can be anything from a recording drone to a CCTV camera.As long as the camera captures the blinking lights, the data being transmitted can be easily stolen.The researchers indicated that since the rate of exfiltration of data depends upon the number of LEDs being present on a router, it goes without saying that the more number of LEDs on a router, the more amount of data can be exfiltrated at any one time.Furthermore, the researchers tested various video-recording setups to see which is the most efficient and found out that the method involving Optical Sensors was the best. This is because it received data at a higher rate and was able to sample the LED lights more quickly than any other methods.Primarily, a data exfiltration rate of 1000 bit/sec per LED was achieved using Optical Sensors.Although the researchers indicated that the method is the most effective one to steal a large amount of data, they, however, stated that since the method involves installing malware on a router, a number of other techniques can be used to extract data anyway.This is because once the malware is already on the router, there are other ways in which attackers can directly intercept the data being transmitted without the need of any video recording devices.Source: Ben-Gurion University / Research paper: ArxivDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Wireless"], "title": "Hackers can steal large amount of data using router\u2019s LEDs", "date": "June 7, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});A group of Russian-speaking hackers has been attacking multiple governments for years now. Not only that, but they also experimented with different methods of conducting those attacks with the help of the social media websites. Their approach was pretty clever, and they used those sites for concealment of the espionage malware.Antivirus provider called Eset has reported a backdoor Trojan that was discovered recently. Apparently, Eset\u2019s researchers have discovered that the Trojan used Britney Spears\u2019s Instagram account in order to find the control server that was receiving data and sending instructions to the devices infected with the Trojan.This new approach, allegedly by the hacker group called Turla, has made malware attacks even harder to predict and discover, since the servers controlled by the group were never directly referenced by anyone.Turla is a group of hackers who are known to be Russian-speakers infamous for their use of the newest and most modern espionage malware.During 2014, Symantec\u2019s researchers found and noted a malware named Wipbot. It was discovered that this malware was used for infection of Windows systems in multiple governments and embassies of several European countries. Many of these countries belonged to the Eastern Bloc.Several months after the discovery, Kaspersky Lab\u2019s researchers have uncovered a stealthy Linux allegedly used in the same campaign.It\u2019s also known that Turla has a capability of using the satellite-based Internet so that they could cover their tracks. On top of that, the group was also discovered to be using a zero-day Windows vulnerability back in March. Once again, they tried to infiltrate the computers of European militaries and governments.Eset\u2019s report also mentioned an extension in the Firefox browser that posed as a security feature. Of course, it was a fake and allowed a third party to take control over the infected device.Researchers further explained the process and said that the extension uses a bit.ly URL to reach the C&C. However, the path can\u2019t be discovered by the extension code and that it can only be detected by using comments found on Britney Spears\u2018s Instagram posts. The extension scans comments on each photo and then computes a custom hash value searching for the one that matches 183. It can then find a path to the URL.There was only one comment that served this purpose and it was left on February 6, 2017, while the photo was posted earlier in January. The examination of the data from the URL has uncovered that the URL itself had 17 visits only in February. This means that the malware is still in its testing phase, or that it was used against highly targeted people.The extension itself was spread by a certain security company that wasn\u2019t named, but that\u2019s known to be located in Switzerland. It\u2019s even believed that the extension could, in fact, be an update to another one from an earlier campaign.The backdoor in the newest extension has several abilities, including the execution of arbitrary files, downloads and uploads to C&C, as well as reading directory content. This includes sending file listings and even its dates and sizes to the same C&C.Eset also notes that the developers from Firefox are trying to patch up the browser so that this and similar extensions wouldn\u2019t be able to operate anymore.

Although the technology is advanced, it does not, however, rule out the fact that it is still in its infancy and attackers can mimic a user\u2019s voice to break into their system.Hence, in order to avoid this, a team of researchers from the University of Buffalo have developed an app that will stop cybercriminals from using the security flaws in the voice-recognition system to breach privacy.The app essentially uses the phone\u2019s built-in magnetometer to detect if a voice that is being played is recorded.It was designed keeping in mind the various ways an attacker can use a person\u2019s voice to infiltrate their system. One of the ways is to try impersonating the voice. However, this may not break open the phone as there are integrated algorithms which can find out a fake voice.The other way is to record the victim\u2019s voice and then play it so that the phone mistakes it for the actual user. It is this hacking that the app targets to stop. According to Kui Ren, Ph.D., director of the Ubiquitous Security and Privacy Research Laboratory (UbiSeC) at University of Buffalo: \u201cWe cannot decide if voice authentication will be pervasive in the future. It might be. We\u2019re already seeing the increasing trend,\u201d Ren said. \u201cAnd if that is the case, we have to defend against voice replay attacks. Otherwise, voice authentication cannot be secure.\u201dAlthough the app is still in the development stage, the idea, as mentioned above, is to use the phone\u2019s magnetometer to detect whether the voice being played is recorded.The magnetometer is a digital compass that is in sync with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field to figure out directions.The same system has been integrated with the app. This is because the researchers claim that any recorded voice will be played using a device. Since the recorded voice will emit magnetic waves, the app will be able to detect the magnetic patterns and thereby decipher the fake voice.But in order for the app to work, the device which is playing the recorded voice needs to be close to the smartphone being hacked. This may, however, not be a problem since the player will have to be close anyway if the attacker is seeking to break into the system.The problem though lies with the app only being able to detect the voice if the attacker is moving the playing device. Moving the device will alter the magnetic waves which will lead the app to detect that the voice is not real. Therefore, the researchers are still working on refining the app.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["internet", "Privacy", "security", "Smartphone", "Technology", "Voice Recognition"], "title": "New App Will Stop Voice Hacks Using Smartphone Compass", "date": "June 6, 2017"}, {"authur": "Owais Sultan", "body": "As a small business owner, you\u2019re bound to take great pride in what you do and use every opportunity you can to spread the word about your company.

Or, if most of your sales and revenue come from your website, it can be infected with ransomware \u2013 a type of malicious software that blocks access to your data until a ransom is paid.Hacking is a real, tangible threat to every website on the internet, and especially so for websites made and used by small business owners. All of that certainly doesn\u2019t do any good when it comes to convincing people to take their business online. However, there are ways you can protect your company\u2019s website and keep your content and data safe from harm.A quick Google search on the subject will yield thousands of articles listing ten, fifteen and even more steps you can take to secure your website. All of them include messing with the website\u2019s code, embedding safety widgets into your website and installing third-party apps and adding them to your website\u2019s core code.While taking all of those steps will certainly keep your website safer, it won\u2019t make it completely hack-proof. Also, the exact amount of protection can be achieved in much less time, just by taking these two simple steps.With so many different site building services available on the internet, the competition is getting pretty high and people are assuming they all offer the same perks and the same amount of protection.While a bigger, more popular website builders such as WordPress, Squarespace or Weebly might seem like a safer option, in reality, these platforms are always the first to be hit with malicious attacks. Such a complex platform with so many users requires a lot of maintenance, which in turn constantly bring forth the need for major updates to the software.Keeping your software up to date is crucial to your web security, but too many updates are actually more likely to decrease the overall safety of your website.That\u2019s why it\u2019s best you go with a trusted site-building service that tones down the updates for a more secure platform and a much simpler and easily manageable design. We recommend SITE123, an incredible website building platform that enables you to create professional-looking websites for free. It\u2019s extremely intuitive and user-friendly interface makes it a favorite among small business owners, and the simplicity of its modular design and powerful code makes it a much safer platform.So, unless you\u2019re a part-time web developer or an internet safety expert, we recommend skipping the popular, complex options and going with fast, easy and safe website builder out there.You can find everything and anything on the internet nowadays if you know where and how to look \u2013 and that includes your personal information.When you consider how easy it is for anyone to find out which school you went to, when you were born and where you vacationed last summer, let alone a skilled hacker, it\u2019s not surprising how easily passwords can be hacked.To stop hackers from having a quick and easy way into your accounts and websites, we suggest you get creative with your passwords. Here are a few tips on how to get started:\u25cf Use your name\u25cf Use the names of your family members, children or spouse\u25cf Use your or anybody else\u2019s birthday\u25cf Use both uppercase and lowercase characters\u25cf Use numbers\u25cf Use symbols\u25cf Use ambiguous symbols such as brackets, semicolons, and quotation marksHowever, if you\u2019re still having trouble coming up with a strong enough password, you can always use a password generating software to do the work for you. We recommend using the one created by Norton, or this incredibly simple and straightforward password generator.When it comes to internet security, most people go by thinking that it won\u2019t happen to them. The incredible amount of overly complicated and sometimes even downright unintelligible safety tips don\u2019t do any good when it comes to protecting people who aren\u2019t that tech-savvy.But, despite the real danger hacking is for small business owners, these two steps are more than enough to keep your website safe from most, if not all, malware you can encounter online.

The police arrested him while on a cyber patrol on the same day the ransomware was created.The 14-year-old created the ransomware on his own, the report said and did so by exploiting certain encryption programs. Like every other ransomware, the infection allowed the teenager to restrict access to users\u2019 files and demand a certain amount in digital currency if the users wanted to regain access.The ransomware was launched on a foreign website from where the kid tricked people into downloading the virus through the use of social media. However, as of now, there are no reports of any damage caused by the ransomware.According to the police, the teenager said that the reason he created the ransomware was to become famous. He also stated the virus had been downloaded more than a hundred times, although this is in contrast to the aforementioned report which says no victims had been identified.The boy used Twitter to suggest that he was up to something. Nevertheless, once the police identified the teenager, his computer was instantly confiscated.Reports say that the ransomware was created and launched in April right after the WannyCry incident.As most of you may already know, the WannaCry incident has been the most vicious malware attack to date affecting more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries. This included the British Health system \u2013 the NHS \u2013 which was utterly disrupted due to the attack.Since the incident, reports, and news regarding new types of ransomware have been taking the internet by storm. It has almost become an epidemic on a massive scale where cyber criminals are popping up every day with ever more sophisticated malware that is becoming harder to contain.Also, the ransomware epidemic is being fueled by the ubiquity of digital currency such as Bitcoins which makes it easier for criminals to receive payments without being tracked.Given the vulnerability of systems to such malware attacks, it is essential that users take extra precautions to protect themselves.

The EternalBlue exploit was leaked by the hacking group known as The Shadow Brokers and it was known for using the Server Message Block Protocol SMB vulnerability in Windows to hijack computers.Before it was discovered and got patched, this flaw was supposedly known and used by the US intelligence. There are allegations that the NSA used this flaw for the surveillance purposes, before the leak that made it public. That\u2019s why Microsoft slammed NSA and the CIA for hiding critical security flaws from vendors and manufacturers.When it comes to EternalBlue, the exploit itself possesses worm-like capabilities and it is able to move across the network it infects by using Windows\u2019 Server Message Block Protocol.Since the exploit went public, its first spread was via WannaCry ransomware that happened several weeks ago in May. For the most part, the spread has been stopped and it was believed that the threat has ended. Now, however, there\u2019s evidence that hackers have been using the same exploit to carry out other forms of attack, this time much more discreetly.According to researchers at FireEye, this attack includes the distribution of Backdoor Nitol, a Trojan which allows access to an infected device via the backdoor that it opens upon getting on it. Another form of attack that uses the same exploit is a Ghost RAT, which is a malware, and it has the ability to take complete control over the infected device. It can also be used for stealing data and conducting espionage in general.This malware has proved to be dangerous and a threat to industries, companies and even to the governments itself. And that was even before it got powered up by using EternalBlue exploit stolen from the NSA. Now, this malware is attacking Singapore, while the Trojan Nitol terrorizes the bigger area of South Asia.Researchers have warned that there are still devices vulnerable to SMB exploit, despite the ransomware which proves how important it is to patch the machines. Now, the hackers are using EternalBlue to get access to these devices.The first exploit that was used at the SMB level reminded the researchers of what WannaCry used to act like, but this time, the attack wasn\u2019t used for spreading ransomware. This time, the malware would get on the device and execute code that would help install a backdoor on the device. Both Ghost RAT and Nitol are being used in order to achieve this.Both of these attacks have been known to researchers for years. Despite the fact that they\u2019re being used in combination with such a serious exploit, there\u2019s no indication that they\u2019ll get as big as WannaCry managed to get. Also, this exploit is now public, and for a while too, which can only mean that we\u2019ll see more and more of it as the time passes.That\u2019s why it\u2019s extremely important for as many Windows users as possible to download the patch for the exploit as soon as they possibly can. The situation is serious, and the seriousness is outlined in a recent report. Such a report states that WannaCry was extremely damaging, and yet, it wasn\u2019t nearly as damaging as it could have been. Apparently, quick and sloppy coding has crippled it, and despite that, it still managed to bring half the world down.If Ghost RAT and Nitol decided to try and pull off a similar attack, they would probably be much stealthier about it.

It\u2019s believed that the terminals were infected with malware via phishing operations.The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has denied that Russia or any of the Russian hackers had anything to do with the election. Even the US president Donald Trump himself attempted to shut down similar investigations lead by the FBI.As for Winner, after the search warrant for her home was issued, it was indicated that she worked for Pluribus International Corporation, which is a security and intelligence contractor. Also, it\u2019s discovered that before she started working for Pluribus, she was a part of the US Air Force.Further investigation has uncovered that the documents that Winner shared with The Intercept were most likely printed and carried out of the workspace by hand. Also, one of the reporters from The Intercept itself has presumably shared the stolen documents with another government contractor. This other contractor was apparently asked for help to verify the document.The contractor then allegedly stated that the documents were faked, and then proceeded to report everything to one of the US agencies. Also, according to the reporter, the document arrived from \u201cAugusta, Georgia,\u201d which is also the location where Winner\u2019s residence was listed.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Elections", "internet", "NSA", "Russia", "security", "Snowden", "WhistleBlower"], "title": "Federal Contractor Caught Leaking Classified NSA Documents to News Outlet", "date": ""}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "The cyber security industry is well-thought of with the huge advancement of online technology and web development, and it means there are thousands of jobs available for people just like you that are interested in a well-paid technology-based career.

That is, for small companies, the cost of IoT breaches was 13.4% of the total revenues where small companies were considered as those which earned less than $5 million in revenues annually.For larger companies, the cost amounted to millions of dollars with an estimate indicating that around $20 million could be lost due to such cyber attacks for companies that were earning $2 billion annually in revenues.The survey revealed that companies consider price as secondary to factors such reliability and quality when it comes to choosing IoT security vendors.As such, it has been suggested that IoT security providers build their brands as organizations look for vendors that have an established reputation in the industry and offer superior services.This is, however, not surprising as security breaches can cost a lot and as such, regardless of how much the price of an IoT security service is, it is more than compensated by the safety with which an organization can operate its functions.The survey showed that those who have had invested significantly in IoT security had not experienced a breach as compared to those who had not.Furthermore, it was revealed that 74% of the organizations had their IoT security system centralized, even though different business units had different security needs.Overall, Altman Vilandrie & Company indicated that despite many companies having traditional cybersecurity measures in place, IoT security was still not the major concern in various organizations.Source: Altman Vilandrie & Company | Image Credit: Shutterstock/ChombosanDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["breach", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "security", "Vulnerability"], "title": "48% of U.S. Firms Using IoT Devices Suffered Security Breaches \u2013 Survey", "date": "June 5, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "From the beginning, hacking were all about taking over servers and stealing data but for the last couple of years the trend has changed and hackers have been targeting giants like Hollywood and TV industry.Now, the DarkOverLord, a famous hacking group that had been responsible for leaking the first ten episodes of season 5 of the show \u201cOrange is the new black\u201d have struck again with leaking the first eight episodes of Steve Harvey\u2019s Funderdome, that was set to premiere on the 11th of June.The ABC based show, Steve Harvey\u2019s Funderdome, is a reality series that comprises of 13 episodes where two budding entrepreneurs contest against each other to win funds for their startups from a live audience in the show.The show, however, had its first eight episodes leaked by the DarkOverLord with the torrent link available on Pirate Bay.You may have noticed the familiar name \u2013 The DarkOverLord \u2013 as the same hacking group that leaked season 5\u2019s first ten episodes of \u201cOrange is the new Black\u201d on Netflix last April. It also threatened that Netflix that if it does not pay up a certain amount of money, it might leak the rest.Netflix, however, did not comply. Nevertheless, the DarkOverLord also promised its followers that it had hacked into the databases of other TV channels such as FOX, NAT GEO, IFC and of course ABC.The DarkOverLord told in an interview that they were able to hack into an online database belonging to Larson Studio, Inc, which is a production company that works with various US-based TV channels. The DarkOverLord stated that the database did not have any security restrictions.It was on the 2nd of June, on Friday, that the DarkOverLord, announced that their next target would be ABC. Later, on Monday, they tweeted that they have released the first eight episodes of the reality show, Steve Harvey\u2019s Funderdome and provided a link to Pirate Bay. However, it has been reported that only three people had downloaded from the link.https://twitter.com/tdohack3r/status/870678201185353735Here\u2019s the message posted by hackers on Pastebin:\u201cHello, this is thedarkoverlord (@tdohack3r) here to deliver a message.

And, while these types of attacks are relatively new for Hollywood, intellectual property theft has been around as long as there have been cybercriminals. What sets this sort of attack apart from traditional data breaches is the fact that the hackers are attempting to use the stolen data (in this case TV shows) to extort the victim, instead of simply offering it up to the highest bidder. While it is unclear whether hacks of this nature will persist, considering studios have been reluctant to pay the ransom demanded, all organizations must keep the security of their intellectual property top of mind. Whether you\u2019re a Hollywood production house, a defense contractor, or a research institute, having the correct data-centric security controls is essential to preventing yourself from becoming the next victim.\u201dIt seems that not many people are interested in downloading content from illegal websites such as Pirate Bay. Perhaps this is because it is not worth risking your system for a show that is going to be aired later anyway.Nevertheless, production and broadcasting companies cannot be complacent as such.

Stepping up their bounty program at this time isn\u2019t that surprising, especially considering that it\u2019s only been a couple of days since the massive \u2018Judy\u2019 malware attack. Despite the unthreatening name, Judy has managed to infect over 30 million Android smartphones, which raised a massive red flag at Google.The company started their famous bug bounty program around two years ago, and the point is to find as many bugs as possible. No matter if they\u2019re big or small, as long as it\u2019s something relevant that might end up posing a problem, Google will reward the find and fix the bug. Paying for every bug might seem expensive, but it\u2019s a much better option than to have their system exploited by cyber criminals.Since the program was started, Google has already paid over $1.5 million for the discovered bugs. Now they aim to attract even more researchers and to do that; they\u2019ve increased the reward for the bugs found. The first reward that\u2019s mostly given for discovering smaller but still pretty serious bugs was around $30,000. These were the bugs that might let someone gain remote access to the system and use it for stealing users\u2019 personal data. After the increase, however, the reward is $150,000.The second reward is being saved for more serious bugs, including Verified Boot and Trust Zone bugs. Verified Boot bug ensures that the smartphone\u2019s software isn\u2019t altered, while the Trust Zone bug secures security software, fingerprint scans, biometric data, system settings and alike. The reward for discovering and reporting these bugs was $50,000. In order to stop hackers from exploiting these two most critical areas of the system, Google will now start paying $200,000 per bug.According to the official blog post by Android security team:\u201cRewards for a remote exploit chain or exploit leading to TrustZone or Verified Boot compromise increase from $50,000 to $200,000 \u2013 Rewards for a remote kernel exploit increase from $30,000 to $150,000.\u201dCheck Point, a cyber security company has submitted a report that says that dozens of the Play Store\u2019s apps were infected with \u201cFireball\u201d malware recently. All of those apps were taken down by Google\u2019s security team, but not before the massive amount of downloads took place. It\u2019 estimated that between 4.5 million and 18.5 million downloads occurred since the apps got infected.Some of these apps have even spent several years in the Play Store, hiding their real nature and waiting for unsuspecting users to download them. Despite the fact that \u2018Judy\u2019 has made such a mess when it comes to the Play Store, it\u2019s still only one type of malware.

Unfortunately, I screwed up badly.I was basically given a document detailing how to setup my local development environment. Which involves run a small script to create my own personal DB instance from some test data. After running the command, I was supposed to copy the database URL/password/username outputted by the command and configure my dev environment to point to that database. Unfortunately, instead of copying the values outputted by the tool, I instead for whatever reason used the values the document had.Unfortunately, apparently, those values were actually for the production database (why they are documented in the dev setup guide I have no idea). Then from my understanding that the tests add fake data, and clear existing data between test runs which basically cleared all the data from the production database. Honestly, I had no idea what I did, and it wasn\u2019t about 30 or so minutes after did someone actually figures out/realizes what I did.While what I had done was sinking in. The CTO told me to leave and never come back. He also informed me that apparently legal would need to get involved due to the severity of the data loss. I basically offered and pleaded to let me help in some way to redeem myself, and I was told that i \u201ccompletely fucked everything up.\u201dSo I left. I kept an eye on slack, and from what I can tell the backups were not restoring, and it seemed like the entire dev team was on full in panic mode. I sent a slack message to our CTO explaining my screw up. Only to have my slack account immediately disabled not long after sending the message.I haven\u2019t heard from HR or anything, and I am panicking to high heavens. I just moved across the country for this job, is there anything I can even remotely do to redeem myself in this situation? Can I possibly be sued for this? Should I contact HR directly? I am really confused, and terrified.\u201d\u201cEDIT Just to make it even more embarrassing; I just realized that I took the laptop I was issued home with me (i have no idea why I did this at all).\u201d/cscareerthrowaway567 also detailed that the company has more than 40 developers with more than 100 people in total. Well, that\u2019s a huge mess up.While /cscareerthrowaway567 is feeling guilty about what happened, those replying to the post came up with some valid questions and theories, for example, one Redditor going by the online handle of /Do_You_Even_Lyft questioned that:\u201cThe biggest WTF here is why did a junior dev have full access to the production database on his first day? The second biggest is why don\u2019t they just have full backups? The third is why would a script that blows away the entire fucking database be defaulted to production with no access protection? You made a small mistake. They made a big one. Don\u2019t feel bad. Obviously small attention to detail is important but it\u2019s your first day and they fucked up big time. And legal? Lol. They gave you a loaded gun with a hair trigger and expected you not to pop someone? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cYou made a small mistake. They made a big one. Don\u2019t feel bad. Obviously small attention to detail is important but it\u2019s your first day and they fucked up big time. And legal? Lol. They gave you a loaded gun with a hair trigger and expected you not to pop someone? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Another Redditor going by the online handle of /BostonTentacleParty commented and wrote that: \u201cI mean, real talk, they might be doomed. You might have destroyed that company, and that\u2019s fucking hilarious because they entirely deserve it. I\u2019ve worked for some fly by night Mickey Mouse shops but holy hell were they playing fast and loose. What was their tech stack, Jenga?The downside is that you\u2026 can\u2019t list this place on your resume. The upside is that you\u2019ve got a great story about instrumenting the downfall of a shitty company.\u201dAnother Redditor /YourUndoing commented that:\u201cThey fucked up, and badly. You did not fuck up badly, you did something that was preventable by them and also shame on them for not having an adequate backup scheme. Consider yourself lucky for not having to work for such a careless company anymore. On the project I\u2019m currently on, every dev has read/write and full update/drop privileges on the dev database. QA and admins have access to this for the QA databases. Only 2-3 people have access to do this in production. And it\u2019s all hosted through Amazon with daily backups and the data files processed in get archived for a short period as well.\u201dThere\u2019s no fucking way their DBA should keep their job after this. Assuming they have one.Redditor /CarrotStickBrigade wrote that it\u2019s the fault of the company.\u201cOP this is NOT your fault. Honestly? I\u2019d tell the CTO to fuck off when you return the laptop. This is 100% their fault. Legal will not do a god damn thing to you because they have no grounds.\u201dRedditor /MaxIntel said that:\u201cRight. The employer sounds like they left way too many holes. Why would something so important be so easily deleted by means of a common practice?. Even if lawyers get involved  pretty sure they would say the same.\u201dThe topic has more than 138 comments where most Redditors are backing /cscareerthrowaway567 and criticizing the company for not keeping any backup and handing over the entire critical database to a newbie. Although the other side of the story is yet to be revealed, the one thing we can learn from this incident is that be it a company, business or common user; one should always keep a backup of their data no matter what the circumstances are.What do you think? who\u2019s fault is it?", "topics": ["internet", "Reddit", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Man Accidentally Destroyed Production Database on First Day of His Job", "date": "June 3, 2017"}]
