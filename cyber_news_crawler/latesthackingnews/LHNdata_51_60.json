This vulnerability is actually a combination of two bugs, Fenske told Thursday.One main problem stems from the fact that they are using a static value to sign the Ruby on Rails session secret for the console. This secret value is supposed to be a randomly generated one per-machine value which is used to sign the cookie, not a static one.GitHub has acknowledged on Tuesday that this static secret was only supposed to be used for their testing and development, but \u201can unrelated change of the file permissions prevented the intended session secret from being used.\u201d\u201cFor testing purposes, they have replaced it with a static value and just forgot to change it back,\u201d Fenske told. In the production environment, there was a mechanism that should have replaced it with a random value. But it did not work.\u201dWhile GitHub shouldn\u2019t have been using a static secret to sign cookies that hold session data, the other problem, Fenske says, is that session data could be serialised with Marshal. Marshal, a library that converts collections of Ruby objects into a byte stream, has a method, .load, that can return the result of converted serialised data.By knowing this secret, any attacker could have forged a cookie, deserialized by the Marshal.load, and would have tricked GitHub into running whatever code he wanted.Source: Threatpost", "date": "March 21, 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News"]}, {"title": "Microsoft Edge Is The Most Hacked Browser At Pwn2Own 2017", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "The popular Pwn2Own 2017 hacking contest, which has celebrated its 10th anniversary, came to an end of their three days session in which various security teams have hacked away many browsers and operating systems.

The goal of the company was to have a browser which is much more secure and can keep up with Firefox and Chrome when it comes to supporting the latest web and internet standards. The Edge has even implemented sandboxing technologies which are similar to what the Chrome is using, which put it ahead of the Firefox. The Firefox is still trying to play catch-up in this game.But, despite all these improvements in the code cleanness and the security technologies, it did not quite proven itself when it was faced with experienced hackers at contests like Pwn2Own. In last year\u2019s edition of Pwn2Own, the Edge proved to be a little better than the Internet Explorer and the Safari, but it still ended up being hacked twice, while the Chrome is only hacked once.The condition this year seems to have gotten worse rather than better, for Edge. In the last year\u2019s Pwn2Own, the Microsoft\u2019s browser was hacked more than five times.On the first day, Team Ether (Tencent Security) was the first to hack Edge through an arbitrary write in the Chakra JavaScript engine. The team also used a logic bug in the sandbox to escape that, as well.

The result is a \u201ccomplete virtual machine escape.\u201dIn an e-mail, the Qihoo 360 Executive Director Zheng Zheng wrote, \u201cWe have used a JavaScript engine bug within the Microsoft Edge to achieve code execution inside the Edge sandbox, and we used a kernel bug in Windows 10 to escape from it and fully compromise guest machine.\u201d He continued, \u201cThen we have exploited a hardware simulation bug within the VMware to escape from the guest operating system to host one. All if this started from and only by a controlled a website.\u201dVirtual machines are very crucial to the security of large organisations and individuals everywhere. In server hosting environments, they are used as containers which prevent one customer\u2019s operating system and data from being accessed by another customer who is sharing the same physical server.

According to the Shivang Desai of ZScaler, \u201cThe Android apps and iOS for Netflix are very popular, properly turning a mobile device into a television using which users can stream TV programs and movies anytime and anywhere. \u201cBut these apps, with their popularity and many millions of users, have captured attention of the bad actors, too, who are now exploiting the popularity of Netflix to spread their malware.\u201dThe new variant comes with capabilities to perform actions including viewing contacts, reading text messages, turning on the microphone of an infected device, recording screen, listening to conversations, send user files to a Command & Control (C&C) set up by cyber criminals and take screenshots.", "date": "January 31, 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "Routers From Netgear Contain Bug that Allows Hackers to Gain Admin Credentials", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "Many owners of Netgear routers are at high risk of being getting hijacked by hackers as a serious security void hole was found by researchers.These are found by the security researcher Simon Kenin from the Trustwave and he shared the information with the folks at the Netgear. The company has managed to patch some bugs but still, it seems that some routers are still open to hackers.The security problem found here allows the attackers to access the router and collect the admin access passwords. Any remote hacker can use this vulnerability if remote administration is set to the Internet facing. Basically, this feature is turned off, but anyone with the physical access to a network that has a Netgear router can easily exploit it locally. A general example of this scenario is a caf\u00e9 with public WiFi or some other place which offers a relatively similar feature.We know that most people choose to reuse their passwords. So, once an attacker gains the admin password, he can check all the devices that are connected in that network and try to access them with the same password(which might actually work considering how many network admins do not take security seriously).Kenin also pointed out that, by using the existing malware along with ever so popular Mirai botnet can change all the infected devices into bots. If that is not possible, he can change the DNS to further infect more machines on the network.The researcher came upon this flaw almost a year ago. He figured out that he could trigger an error message on his own router, and then the router could be tricked into revealing the numerical code that can be used with the password recovery tool to get the admin credentials.\n", "date": "January 31, 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "Google Paid About $3 Million To WhiteHat Hackers as Bug Bounty", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": " The bug bounty program of Google has awarded hackers with $3million throughout 2016. This indicates us how important such programs are for the safety of everyone. Using the knowledge of these bug bounty results, Google has successfully managed to escape from backdoors in their systems and get hacked. The hackers put their minds to test and get paid for sending the bugs to the home company.The company\u2019s 2016 year in review reports puts the spotlight on bug bounty program, this insists that this is an important part of Google, especially since they are on a mission to keep their users safe. Over 350 researchers have contributed to this program in 2016, and they all come from all over the world, or, 59 countries to be more specificIn total, they are over 1,000 bugs found in the Google\u2019s services and apps reported back to the Google. If you are wondering how profitable it can be for the hackers to spend their time looking for the bugs in Google, you should know the highest payout given for a single vulnerability report was $100,000. Yes, you read that one right. Given the fact that normal bugs are not rewarded which heftily, that particular vulnerability must be quite an important one.By comparison, in 2015, Google paid $2 million in the bug bounty program, so it\u2019s a pretty large hike up last year\u2019s $3 million. This is easily explained by the fact that Google increased the minimum payout last year, in some areas even by a 50%.Google isn\u2019t the only company that\u2019s been known to have bug bounty programs. In fact, most companies do and it\u2019s clear that it can be quite lucrative even when working as a white hat hacker. Many private researchers make quite a bit of money just by looking for bugs, without taking into account the extra they make in their day jobs.\n", "date": "January 31, 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News", "News"]}, {"title": "Woman steals a man\u2019s laptop look what happened next", "authur": "Harikrishna Mekala", "body": "Stu Gale, A Canadian of Cochrane, Alberta lost his laptop when he left it in his car.It was reported in CTV News Calgary saying that a truck has been stolen from the parking lot where Stu\u2019s car is parked nearby but the Thief didn\u2019t recognize that the laptop is installed with the Remote logging Software like Team Viewer or VNC.So, Stu was able to log into his laptop remotely only to find that the thief who stole his laptop is a woman,She was using her Facebook account when Gale logged into his laptop while she went away he snooped into her laptop and extracted information about her friends as well as making a call to one of her friends. CTV News Calgary quotes Gale:I went through and got her phone numbers, friends list and pictures, and while I was doing that, two [chat] conversations started. I called one of them and told her [that the person in possession of his computer] was on a stolen laptop and told her I\u2019d give [that person] the opportunity to return it.But he didn\u2019t stop there he texted all phone numbers found in her account, conveying that he planned to report the woman to the Police.He also left a note on her Facebook page more over he posted the information to a number of Facebook groups. Once the woman noticed, she deactivated her Facebook profile.She was however convicted without trial (So to speak), even though people may think that she stole the laptop because she was caught using it, there may have been other reasons for her being in possession of it.If somebody gets caught at the crime scene it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they have actually committed the crime as there maybe a vast case  scenario, for example she may have bought the goods from a thief unwittingly or been gifted the laptop.Whilst we can\u2019t blame Gale for his actions, there is also a law that states an individual can\u2019t invade the privacy of an another individual.A computer Security expert Tom Keenan said,If you take somebody\u2019s Facebook and you repost it, that\u2019s a form of privacy invasion. You really do need to think about what you\u2019re doing. Probably a better idea to take it to law enforcement.In this Scenario, Gale victimized the thief by invading the privacy of the Woman.Gale took the information and handed it over to the police, they stated that they are confident they will catch the thief.Take your time to comment on this article.
