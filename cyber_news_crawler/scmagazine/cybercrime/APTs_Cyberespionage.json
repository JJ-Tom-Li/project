But in 2017, the adversary \u2013 also known as Group123 \u2013 reached beyond the Korean peninsula, reports FireEye. Among its targets were a Middle Eastern financial company that provides telecommunications services, a Vietnamese trading and transport company, and also possibly individuals who help Olympics organizations procure resources for athletes.\n\nOne possible reason the Middle Eastern financial firm was chosen as the target of an APT37 spear phishing campaign was because a business relationship it had formed with an unnamed North Korean company had publicly soured, FireEye suggests. \u00a0Reportedly, Reaper actors sent one of the company's board members a fake bank liquidation letter, in the form an attachment that exploited the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 to deliver \u201cSHUTTERSPEED\u201d backdoor malware, capable of harvesting system information, grabbing screenshots and downloading other malicious files.\n\nOther recent targets, according to FireEye, include individuals tied to North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations, an unnamed entity in Japan linked to United Nations sanctioning and human rights missions, and South Korean academic and strategic institutions.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional redlines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity,\u201d FireEye states in its report. \u201cWe anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\u201d \n\nJust last month, Cisco Systems' Talos research team similarly profiled APT37's 2017 activities in its own research blog post. Additional reports linking the Adobe Flash attack to Reaper then broke in early February.\n\nFireEye has also observed Reaper grow in sophistication, noting a \u201chigh operational tempo and specialized expertise,\u201d with a particular affinity for quickly utilizing exploits \u2013 especially Flash ones \u2013 shortly after they are publicized. The group is also known to use a combination of spear phishing emails, website compromises, and torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware.\n\nInterestingly, one of the strongest clues that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government was reportedly uncovered after the presumed developer of several Reaper malware payloads mistakenly disclosed his own personal data, revealing he was operating from an IP address and access point linked to the dictatorial nation. FireEye also has noted that the compilation times of APT37 malware programs are consistent with North Korea's typical workday hours, and that Reaper's targets are consistent with North Korean objectives.\n\nFireEye reports that APT37 generally favors malware that exfiltrates information from victims \u2013 although one of its payloads, RUHAPPY, can also serve as a destructive disk wiper.\n\nWary of Pyongyang's cyber aggression and threats of nuclear strikes, the U.S. may be developing plans to strike North Korean targets with a \u201cbloody nose\u201d attack that relies primarily on cyberwarfare tactics, as opposed to conventional weapons, according a report in Foreign Policy magazine that cites two former intelligence officials. The article further states that the U.S. government has spent the last six months installing fiber cables, remote bases, and listening posts in Japan and South Korea, as a means for hackers to attempt to access North Korea's Internet.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/zero-day/topic/49474/", "topic_name": "Zero Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Calif. man pleads guilty to ID fraud in deal with Mueller probe", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/calif-man-pleads-guilty-to-id-fraud-in-deal-with-mueller-probe/article/745194/", "title": "Calif. man pleads guilty to ID fraud in deal with Mueller probe", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "February 16, 2018", "body": "While all eyes were on the Robert Mueller's indictment of 13 Russian nationals and three organizations, the special counsel's office unsealed a plea deal cut earlier in February with a 28-year-old man accused of committing identity fraud in connection with the Russian meddling investigation.\n\nSanta Paula, Calif.-based Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty to selling to persons overseas bank account numbers that were opened using identities stolen from U.S. citizens.

They also created fake email accounts that they linked to social media accounts. They used, without permission, the social security numbers and birth dates of American citizens to open PayPal accounts and create fake IDs, such as driver's licenses. \n\nLast year the group tried to avoid detection by law enforcement by deleting and destroying emails, social media accounts and other data.\n\nCautioning that the charges carry a presumption of innocence,\" Rosenstein said, \"This indictment serves as a reminder that people are not always who they appear to be on the internet.

The first two are 32-bit, Windows-based dynamic link library (DLL) executables, which configure the Windows Firewall to allow incoming connections, thus allowing machines to function as proxies.

They, too, disguise malicious C2 communications as encrypted HTTPS traffic, but in actuality they encrypt their activity using a rudimentary cipher (XOR/ADD and SUB/XOR, respectively).\n\nThe third file, meanwhile, is an Android Package Kit (APK) that, according to the BADCALL report, acts as a RAT program \"capable of recording phone calls, taking screenshots using the device's embedded camera, reading data from the contact manager, and downloading and uploading data from the compromised Android device.\" It can also execute commands and scan for open Wi-Fi channels.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Cyber a top priority, Russia will flex its muscle in 2018 midterms, intel chiefs tell Senate", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-a-top-priority-russia-will-flex-its-muscle-in-2018-midterms-intel-chiefs-tell-senate/article/744145/", "title": "Cyber a top priority, Russia will flex its muscle in 2018 midterms, intel chiefs tell Senate", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "February 13, 2018", "body": "Russia has continued its assault on the underpinnings of U.S. democracy, sowing discord among the electorate in some instances by marshaling bots to mount disinformation campaigns, and will likely ply its cyber and propaganda skills to intrude on the 2018 midterm elections much as it did during the presidential election in 2016, members of the intelligence community told the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday.\n\n \u201cThere should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,\u201d Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dan Coats testified during the committee's annual Worldwide Threats hearing.\n\nWhile the White House earlier this year declined, for the time being at least, to impose additional sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2013 with the State Department saying a sanction law is already \u201cserving as a deterrent\u201d \u2013\u00a0Committee Vice Chairman Sen.

However, the use of a zero-day vulnerability to spread ROKRAT in this latest aggression represents a first for this group.\n\n\"Group 123 [has] now joined some of the criminal elite with this latest payload of ROKRAT... They did use exploits in previous campaigns but never a... new exploit as they have done now,\" states a Feb. 2 Talos blog post written by\u00a0researchers\u00a0Warren Mercer\u00a0and\u00a0Paul Rascagneres. \"This change represents a major shift in Group 123's maturity level.

The exploit downloads a shellcode payload from legit, third-party, South Korean websites that have been compromised.

The document was served up by a malicious SFX file (distributed via a phishing campaign) that executes the malware infection when opened.\n\nUpon further investigation, the researchers soon found additional Vermin samples, revealing a larger command-and-control infrastructure that since late 2015 has been infecting individuals with Vermin or, alternatively, Quasar RAT, an open-source malware family used in criminal and espionage attacks. Many of these additional samples didn't even use a decoy document; instead, they consisted of only the payload and a dropper disguised as an icon for a document viewing app such as Microsoft Word.\n\nIn an unusual development, Unit 42 researchers learned that Vermin leverages the HTTP encapsulated Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messaging protocol to establish a secure command-and-control communication -- a behavior that is \"something not often seen in malware samples,\" according to Unit 42 blog post authors and researchers Tom Lancaster and Juan Cortes.\u00a0\n\nResearchers also found that Vermin is composed of mostly original code, written using the Microsoft .NET Framework and often packed with the .NET obfuscation tool\u00a0ConfuserEx.\u00a0\n\nFollowing execution, the malware checks if the victim's system is configured with Russian as the installed input language (often a telltale clue that the attackers are Russian and don't want to attack their fellow countrymen). If the machine is not set to Russian, the malware performs an API call and decrypts an embedded resource that contains the main code for communications and RAT functionality.\n\nAt this point, the malware begins collecting information, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address and the presence of anti-virus software.

A fourth email targeted college students belonging to the organization Friends of MOFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), using content taken from a blog operated by the actual organization.\n\nThe emails contained malicious attachments created in the format for Korean word processor Hangul documents. Embedded PostScripts in these opened documents would trigger an exploit for CVE-2017-8291, an Artifex Ghostscript vulnerability that ultimately allowed attackers to infect user machines with a malicious DLL payload designed to collect device information and exfiltrate files. Further analysis revealed that this malware shares significant chunks of code with Destover, a Lazarus-linked information stealer that was used in an early WannaCry ransomware attack that took place prior to the global May 2017 attack.\n\nBlog post authors and Recorded Future researchers\u00a0Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade and Priscilla Moriuchi also noted that code in the malicious PostScripts contained some transliterated Chinese words, one of which was misused -- leading analysts to theorize these additions may have been intended as false flags to cast suspicions on China.\n\n\"This late 2017 campaign is a continuation of North Korea's interest in cryptocurrency, which we now know encompasses a broad range of activities including mining, ransomware, and outright theft,\" the blog post states. \"Outside of the May WannaCry attack, the majority of North Korean cryptocurrency operations have targeted South Korean users and exchanges, but we expect this trend to change in 2018. We assess that as South Korea responds to these attempted thefts by increasing security (and\u00a0possibly banning cryptocurrency trading) they will become harder targets, forcing North Korean actors to look to exchanges and users in other countries as well.\"\n\nRecorded Future's report serves as further proof that cryptocurrency platforms, exchanges and users remain alluring targets for cybercriminals and adversarial nation-states. (Of course, this trend certainly bears watching, following a rough two days for Bitcoin, which lost more than 50 percent of its peak market value over Jan. 16 and 17, dipping below the $10,000 mark.)\n\nEarlier this month, for example, Morphus Labs'\u00a0Chief Research Officer Renato Marinho, and\u00a0Johannes B. Ullrich, dean of Research at the\u00a0SANS Technology Institute, reported on a January 2018 campaign that was secretly deploying XMRig, a legitimate Monero cryptominer, in victims' machines via Oracle's\u00a0WebLogic application servers.\n\nThe unattributed attackers accomplished this feat by exploiting\u00a0CVE 2017-10271,\u00a0a remote code execution vulnerability found in the servers' WLS Security component. (Oracle issued a patch for the bug late last year, but server owners who failed to implement it remain vulnerable.)\n\nUllrich reported that the exploit appears to be a script released last December by a Chinese security researcher, while Marinho remarked that it's \"pretty simple to execute and comes with a Bash script to make it easy to scan for potential victims.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Oracle's PeopleSoft HR software, which can use WebLogic as a web server, was also found to be vulnerable and, in some cases, was exploited. \"As you can probably imagine, a compromise of a PeopleSoft system is pretty much a worst-case compromise for an organization,\" Ullrich summarized in his write-up.\n\nFurthermore, Onapsis\u00a0reported\u00a0on Jan. 17 that its researchers confirmed that the Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS), which typically stores\u00a0business, sales, and financial data,\u00a0can also be compromised by the exploit.\n\nBased on additional research, Ullrich stated that the attacker successfully mined 611 Monero coins, which as of Jan. 17 equates to roughly $188,000 (it was $226,070 at the time of Ullrich's writing).\n\nAs for the victims, \"Based on a quick reverse DNS lookup and an ASN lookup, I found a high concentration of affected IPs at cloud providers,\" Ullrich reported. \"This isn't a surprise, since many organizations are moving their most critical data to the cloud to make it easier for the bad guys to get to it. Also, not a big surprise is the relatively high percentage of IPs in Oracle's cloud.\"\n\nIn related news, Radware\u00a0has asserted in its just released 2017-18 Global Application & Network Security Report\u00a0that the soaring value of cryptocoins (this most recent downtrend notwithstanding) is inviting increased malicious activity, including ransomware and stolen-content-for-ransom attacks against organizations, as well as distributed denial of service attacks against cryptocurrency platforms.\n\n\u201cThe rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies and their subsequent rise in price has presented hackers with a clear upside that goes beyond cryptocurrencies' anonymity,\u201d said Carl Herberger, VP of security solutions at Radware, in a press release.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "DETER Act aimed at punishing Russia, other nation-states for election interference", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/deter-act-aimed-at-punishing-russia-other-nation-states-for-election-interference/article/737317/", "title": "DETER Act aimed at punishing Russia, other nation-states for election interference", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "January 16, 2018", "body": "A bipartisan bill that takes aim at protecting the U.S. elections from nation-state attacks would compel the Trump administration to levy harsh punishment on Russia for further interfering in U.S. elections and outlines the actions that would prompt the government to retaliate against other countries like China and North Korea if they similarly meddle.\n\nThe Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines Act (DETER), unveiled by Sen.

If Russia would take any further action against the U.S., perhaps in the 2018 midterm elections, the DEFER Act would bolster the penalties already in effect under the Countering America's Adversaries Act of 2017.\n\nSaying that election integrity \u201cis an issue that knows no party,\u201d Van Hollen said, the U.S. has \u201cno time to waste\u201d considering the mid-terms are just months away. \u201cThe DETER Act sends an unequivocal message to Russia and any other foreign actor who may follow its example: if you attack us, the consequences will be severe.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}]}, {"news_name": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apparent-korean-actor-group123-linked-to-six-phishing-campaigns-including-evil-new-year-scam/article/737293/", "title": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 16, 2018", "body": "Researchers have attributed six separate phishing campaigns targeting South Koreans in either 2017 or 2018 to a single threat actor called \"Group123,\" including multiple operations designed to infect victims with the remote administration tool ROKRAT.\n\nThe six campaigns -- Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are You Happy?, FreeMilk, North Korea Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018 -- have been linked through shared code and tactics, according to researchers with Cisco Systems' Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group.\n\nCommonalities include not just ROKRAT, but also the use of Korean Hangul Word Processor (HWP) documents, similar Program DataBase patterns and reconnaissance codes, and the presence of a browser stealer in certain payloads. Also, many of the campaigns have used email lures that reference the longstanding North Korea-South Korea reunification movement.\n\nDue to the phishing emails' use of Hangul -- a product of\u00a0South Korean\u00a0company\u00a0Hancom Inc. -- and their strong command of the Korean language, Talos believes it is likely that \"the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula\" and that\u00a0\"we are dealing with a new Korean actor.\" However, while state-sponsored North Korea hackers have a history of launching attacks on South Korea, Talos does not outright state if the threat specifically comes from the north.\n\nThe most recent campaign, Evil New Year 2018, is essentially a reboot of the threat actor's original Evil New Year operation that ran from November 2016 through January 2017, explains Talos in a Jan. 16 blog post authored by researchers Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres (with contributions from Jungsoo An).\n\nThe newer campaign, which launched on Jan. 2, 2018, lures victims in with a malicious HWP decoy document, supposedly written by South Korea's Ministry of Reunification. The doc\u00a0claims to offer an analysis of a New Year's speech made by the leader of North Korea (presumably Kim Jong-un, although Talos doesn't specifically name him in its analysis).\n\nThe document exploits a vulnerability in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format in order to download and execute shellcode hidden in a fake image on a previously compromised website. In this case, the shellcode downloads and decodes a fileless variant of ROKRAT from memory as the final payload. Much like the ROKRAT samples distributed in previous Group123 campaigns, this variant leverages cloud providers, including Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox, and Box, to exfiltrate documents and communicate with the attackers.\n\nAccording to Talos, the 2017 Evil New Year campaign similarly involved spear phishing emails that appeared to come from the\u00a0Korean Ministry of Unification and used malicious\u00a0Hangul attachments to drop ROKRAT. \"The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in. This would have been particularly true for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target of choice,\" the Talos blog post states.\n\nThe malicious documents in the earlier campaign featured two links that opened up additional decoy documents containing malicious OLE objects used to drop binaries, which\u00a0 in turn injected shellcode that unpacked and executed reconnaissance malware designed to communicate with the C&C server.\n\nThe Talos report detailed four additional phishing campaigns from Group123:\n\nGolden Time, August 2016 - March 2017: This campaign infected targets with ROKRAT via spear phishing emails that lauded recipients for joining a panel at a phony Korean reunification conference. Other phishing emails purported to be a help request from a resident of the South Korean city Munchon.\n\nAre You Happy?, March 2017: This campaign dropped a ROKRAT module called named ERSP.enc that acts as a disk wiper, capable of\u00a0opening an infected system's drive and writing data to the Master Boot Record. After the malware reboots the affected machine, the MBR displays a string that reads \"Are you Happy?\"\n\nFreeMilk, May 2017: Because this campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, the attackers used Microsoft Office documents instead of HWP docs. \"The attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 [a flaw in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface]\u00a0in order to download and execute a malicious HTA document inside of Microsoft Office,\" Talos explains. This scheme resulted in two payloads: The first, PoohMilk, creates persistence and checks specific files on an infected machines, paving the way for the second malware, Freenki, which collects information on the infected system and can download a third executable.\n\nNorth Korean Human Rights, November 2017: This campaign served another version of ROKRAT, via a malicious HWP document authored by a representative from the Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reunification Of Korean Peninsula. Purportedly, \"the main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items related to \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and \"Enactment of a Law,\" which was passed in 2016 in South Korea. Of course, the document's true purpose was to infect unwitting victims.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Mole on Trump team fed FBI info, Steele worried about political influence on FBI, Fusion GPS head says", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mole-on-trump-team-fed-fbi-info-steele-worried-about-political-influence-on-fbi-fusion-gps-head-says/article/735967/", "title": "Mole on Trump team fed FBI info, Steele worried about political influence on FBI, Fusion GPS head says", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "January 09, 2018", "body": "A \u201cwalk-in\u201d whistleblower inside the Trump campaign fed information to the FBI, according testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Glenn Simpson, CEO of Fusion GPS, the firm that hired former British spy Christopher Steele, author of the controversial Trump dossier, to conduct oppositional research on the then presidential candidate.\u00a0\n\nSteele, allegedly concerned that his research was uncovering unsavory and illegal activities involving foreign interests, reported his findings to the FBI.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy understanding was that they believed Chris at this point \u2014 that they believed Chris might be credible because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization,\u201d Simpson told the committee, according to a transcript of his testimony released by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who defied GOP lawmakers to make the testimony public.\u00a0\n\nThe dossier, containing sometimes salacious allegations about Trump, became a flashpoint for his critics who said the findings pointed to inappropriate contact between members of the campaign and Russian operatives and his supporters who have questioned the veracity of the file because it was funded as oppositional research by Hillary Clinton's campaign.\u00a0\n\nMore recently Steele has come under fire for his role in creating the dossier with Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee member Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sending the Justice Department a recommendation to open a criminal investigation of Steele and any potential bias against the president.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI want a special counsel to look not only at how Mr. Steele conducted himself, what the FBI did with the dossier,\u201d Graham said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. He also questioned \u201cwhat involvement\u201d the Justice Department's Bruce Ohr might have had in the dossier, noting that Ohr's wife worked at Fusion GPS. \u00a0\n\nFeinstein expressed frustration with the recommendation from Graham and Grassley last Friday. \u201cI wasn't consulted about this referral nor were any of my Democratic colleagues,\u201d said in a statement. \u201cI think this referral is unfortunate as it's clearly another effort to deflect attention from what should be the committee's top priority: determining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election and whether there was subsequent obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nTrump proponents have contended that Steele's dossier had prompted the FBI probe into potential collusion between the Trump and Russia, implying that he had worked with the FBI to smear derail Trump's campaign.\n\nBut right before the New Year, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported that drunken boasting to an Australian diplomat in the U.K. by George Papadopoulos, a volunteer tapped by the Trump campaign as a foreign policy advisor, likely prompted the investigation\u00a0into the campaign's potential collusion with Russian operatives.\n\nDuring a night at London's Kensington Wine Rooms in May 2016, Papadopoulos, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation being run by special counsel Robert S. Mueller, revealed to Australian Alexander Downer that Russia had damaging information on Trump opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nAfter WikiLeaks began leaking emails pilfered from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and others affiliated with Clinton, Australia officials reported Papadopoulos's revelations to U.S. intelligence, prompting the FBI to open a probe into Russian meddling into the U.S. presidential election.\u00a0\n\nAnd Simpson said in his testimony that Steele \u201csevered his relationship with the FBI\u201d after becoming concerned \u201cthat the FBI was being manipulated for political ends by the Trump people and that we didn't really understand what was going on.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Turla cyber-espionage group fakes Adobe Flash Player to drop malware on embassies", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/turla-cyber-espionage-group-fakes-adobe-flash-player-to-drop-malware-on-embassies/article/735753/", "title": "Turla cyber-espionage group fakes Adobe Flash Player to drop malware on embassies", "author": "Staff Report", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/staff-report/author/3603/", "date": "January 09, 2018", "body": "Attacks using The new malicious tool are believed to have begun by July 2016; they shares similarities with other malware families spread by the group including use of Mosquito, a backdoor believed created by Turla, as well as using IP addresses previously linked with the group. \n\nESET point out that Turla's malware is not known to have tainted any legitimate Flash Player updates, nor is it associated with any known Adobe product vulnerabilities.\n\nPossible attack vectors ESET researchers considered are:\n\nOnce the fake Flash installer is downloaded and launched, one of several backdoors is dropped.

(Intezer released a similar report on Dec. 12.)\n\nThe emails used in this campaign, which is likely still ongoing, include a Word attachment containing malicious macros. The attackers attempt to socially engineer recipients into enabling these macros by asking the user to accept the Enable Editing and Enable Content functions. Doing so opens a decoy document, while secretly installing a first-stage remote access trojan capable of downloading additional malware.\n\nSecureWorks notes that elements in both the macros and the first-stage RAT, as well as components in the custom command-and-control protocol, share commonalities with former campaigns attributed to Lazarus.\n\nThe company also warns that this latest attack is part of an larger overall movement on North Korea's part to engage in malicious activities related to cryptocurrency. Indeed, SecureWorks reports that it has found evidence dating back to 2013 of \"multiple usernames originating from a North Korean IP addresses... taking part in bitcoin research,\" and using proxies to mask the originating IP address.\n\n\"CTU researchers assess that the North Korean threat against cryptocurrency will remain elevated in the foreseeable future,\" SecureWorks predicts.\n\nMeanwhile, The Chosun Ilbo, the Yonhap News Agency, the BBC\u00a0and other news agencies have reported, citing unnamed sources, that South Korea's National Intelligence Service believes its neighbor to the north hacked the Seoul-based Bithumb cryptocurrency exchange last February, stealing millions of dollars as well as the personal information of roughly 30,000 people.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the BBC, the stolen funds were originally worth $7 million but jumped in value to $82.7 million at time of publication last Saturday. The hackers reportedly compromised Bithumb via an employee's home PC, and subsequently began trading bitcoin and ethereum on the exchange.\n\nThe BBC also cited reports that the hackers attempted to extort Bithumb, offering to delete traders' stolen personal information in exchange for an additional $5.5 million payment.\n\nThe Chosun Ilbo reports that the South Korean government has fined Bithumb the equivalent of nearly $54,000 for the breach.\n\nThe National Intelligence Service also reportedly believes\u00a0that North Korea hacked the exchanges Youbit (formerly known as Yapizon) and Coinis this year.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "StrongPity2 spyware takes over for FinFisher", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/strongpity2-spyware-takes-over-for-finfisher/article/713100/", "title": "StrongPity2 spyware takes over for FinFisher", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "December 08, 2017", "body": "The cybergang behind the now defunct FinFisher man\u2013in-the-middle attacks has switched over to using a new spyware dubbed StrongPity2 and is now using a several popular websites to conduct watering hole attacks to help install this malware.\n\nESET researcher Tomas Kafka reported StongPity2, which is named after the group StrongPity, took over from FinFisher, shortly after that malware disappeared from the scene in September.

Since at last July 2017, these two malwares have been used in previous campaigns attributed to APT34, which FireEye says \"loosely aligns\" with reports of a group commonly referred to in cybersecurity circles as OilRig.\n\nTo launch the campaign, the attackers sent a spear phishing email with a malicious Rich Text Format file attachment to its intended victim, whom FireEye does not name. This file is specifically crafted to exploit CVE-2017-11882, which was previously discovered in the Microsoft Equation Editor component of Microsoft Office and subsequently patched on Nov 14.\n\nAccording to FireEye, the exploit \"corrupts the memory on the stack and then proceeds to push the malicious data to the stack.\" At that point, the malware overwrites the function address with a instruction that calls for a certain function that creates a child process, which in turn downloads a malicious script from a domain.\n\nThis script contains a PowerShell command for downloading a dropper, which sneaks the final payloads, as well as several other key components, into the directory C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Microsoft\\java\\.\n\nOne of the two last-stage payloads, the backdoor POWRUNER is capable of communicating host data to its command-and-control server, including information about the logged-in user, hostname, network configuration data, active connections, process information, local and domain admin accounts, an enumerations of user directories, FireEye reports. Additionally, the malware can\u00a0capture and store a screenshot of a victim's system.\n\n\"Recent activity by APT34 demonstrates that they are capable group with potential access to their own development resources,\" FireEye states in its blog. \"During the past few months, APT34 has been able to quickly incorporate exploits for at at least two publicly vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882)\u00a0to target organizations in the Middle East. We assess that APT34's efforts to continuously update their malware, including the incorporation of DGA for C2, demonstrate the group's commitment to pursing strategies to deter detection.\"\n\nIn a separate blog post on Friday, Palo Alto Networks addressed a recent bevy of CVE-2017-11882 exploits found in the wild.

One website defaced by Turk Black Hat even credits both Mesri and ArYaIeIrAN for the attack, suggesting the two knew each other, ClearSky explains.\n\nClearSky found that ArYaIeIrAN's email address appears in the SOA (Start of Authority) record of multiple domains used by Charming Kittens, all of which used persiandns[.]net as their NS (name server). ArYaIeIrAN \u201cregistered persiandns[.]net, potentially indicating that he is the administrator of the services and an employee in the company,\u201d ClearSky reports.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers found that persiandns redirects to mahanserver[.]ir, which is run by CEO Mohammad Rasoul Akbari, aka ra3ou1, who is a Facebook friend of Mesri.\n\nConsequently, ClearSky has assessed that Mesri, ArYalelrAN, and Mohammad Rasoul Akbari are directly involved with Charming Kitten's operations and, along with others, may constitute the threat group.\n\nThe report also details a previously undisclosed backdoor/downloader trojan called DownPaper that Charming Kitten uses to conduct cyber espionage operations against a variety of international targets. The main purpose of the backdoor, often delivered as sami.exe, is to download and execute a second-stage payload.\n\nAdditionally, ClearSky described a campaign in which Charming Kitten actors created a fake British news agency along with corresponding phony websites in order to infect specifically whitelisted visitors with a web browser-based penetration testing tool.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}]}, {"news_name": "UPDATE: Flynn pleads guilty to lying to FBI over interactions with Russia ambassador", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/update-flynn-pleads-guilty-to-lying-to-fbi-over-interactions-with-russia-ambassador/article/710853/", "title": "UPDATE: Flynn pleads guilty to lying to FBI over interactions with Russia ambassador ", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "December 01, 2017", "body": "As reports mount that President Trump urged Congressional leaders to wrap up the probe of potential collusion by his campaign with Russia, his former National Security Adviser Gen.

After speaking with Kislyak shortly thereafter, Flynn contacted the very senior official\u00a0to recap the conversation with the Russian ambassador, including a discussion of the sanctions. A couple of days later after Flynn received word that Russian President Vladmir Putin had decided not to retaliate over the sanctions in response to Flynn's request, the former national security adviser contacted \"senior members\" of the president's transition team to relay the information.\n\nA plea deal submitted to the court and posted by Lawfareblog.com shows that Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller's investigation and others at the federal, state and local levels that the special counsel office sees fit.\n\nEmails pilfered by Russian hackers from the DNC and other Democratic entities then funneled to WikiLeaks, which trickled them out during the campaign, dominated the latter part of presidential election cycle and prompted investigations by different congressional committees and special counsel Mueller. The president has said the Russian probes - over collusion allegations and Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election - have cast a cloud over his administration.\u00a0\n\nCalling Flynn's guilty plea \u201cshattering for the Trump presidency\u201d and noting that Mueller \u201chas breached the White House gates,\u201d Sen.

Specifically, Flynn lied about issues of preeminent Russian interests \u2013 sanctions, the United Nations, and Russian exchanges,\u201d said Blumenthal. \u201cFlynn's betrayal of national security is an enduring black mark on our country's history and a stunning violation of his oath of office.

And because it has automatic updating capabilities, it can add new capabilities at any time.\n\n\"Terdot goes above and beyond the capabilities of a Banker trojan,\" states Bitdefender in its report. \"Its focus on harvesting credentials for other services such as social networks and e-mail services could turn it into an extremely powerful cyber espionage tool that is extremely difficult to spot and clean.\"\n\nAn offshoot of the Zeus banking trojan, Terdot primarily targets users of Canadian financial websites including PCFinancial, Desjardins, BMO, Royal Bank, the Toronto Dominion bank, Banque Nationale, Scotiabank, CIBC, and Tangerine Bank, Bitdefender reports. Targeted non-financial services include Microsoft's live.com login page, Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and YouTube.\n\nHowever, it does not attempt to victimize users of vk.com, Russia's largest social media platform -- an indicator that the perpetrators behind Terdot could be linked to Russia.\n\nTypically, the malware is delivered via the Sundown Exploit Kit, or through malspam communications, while the actual infection chain relies on a series of droppers, injections, and downloaders that helps Terdot avoid detection.\n\nOnce activated, Terdot steals credentials by injecting HTML code in visited web pages and by performing man-in-the-middle attacks, directing user queries and website responses to its own local proxy server, possibly altering the communications along the way.\n\nThe trojan even has the ability to bypass Transport Layer Security (TLS), Bitdefender explains, by forging its own certificates for every visited domain. \"For Internet Explorer, the malware installs hooks to Win32 API certificate checking functions to trick the browser into trusting these forged certificates, and for Mozilla Firefox, Terdot adds the root certificate to the browser's trusted CA list, using legitimate tools provided by Mozilla.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/social-media/topic/47245/", "topic_name": "Social Media"}]}, {"news_name": "New Kaspersky report offers alternate theory for how NSA hacking tools were stolen", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/new-kaspersky-report-offers-alternate-theory-for-how-nsa-hacking-tools-were-stolen/article/707844/", "title": "New Kaspersky report offers alternate theory for how NSA hacking tools were stolen", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "November 16, 2017", "body": "Seeking to dispel allegations that its anti-virus software helped Russian cyber spies identify and steal\u00a0U.S. hacking tools from an NSA contractor's laptop, Kaspersky Lab\u00a0on Thursday released findings from its own internal probe, including apparent evidence that the laptop had been infected with malware.\n\nKaspersky believes it pinpointed the contractor's computer system in question, after its investigators linked said system to an unusually large volume of Equation Group malware signatures that were recorded by its anti-virus software and saved to the company's server. (The Equation Group APT has been widely linked to the NSA.)\n\nIf, indeed, this is the contractor's computer system, then the hacking incident appears to have taken place sometime between\u00a0Sept. 11, 2014 and Nov. 17, 2014, Kaspersky explains in an online report. However, this assessment does not jibe with previous accounts that said the incident took place in 2015 -- an inconsistency that could theoretically weaken the Russia-based company's defense.\n\nKaspersky is also claiming that the contractor's computer system was\u00a0compromised by an external malicious actor\u00a0on Oct. 4, 2014 -- a date that lies within the window of time during which the company believes the hacking tools were stolen. Allegedly, the system was infected with\u00a0a malicious downloader and backdoor program called\u00a0Smoke Loader\u00a0or\u00a0Smoke Bot,\u00a0which was delivered via a malicious Microsoft Office ISO file.\n\nKaspersky notes that the contractor had to have temporarily disabled his anti-virus program in order to run and install this malware program. Once re-enabled, the AV software successfully blocked Smoke Loader's attempts at accessing a known malicious domain. But even if Smoke Loader's damage was limited, Kaspersky asserts that the same system also downloaded other questionable software that triggered 121 non-Equation specific\u00a0AV alerts between Sept. 11 and Nov. 17, 2017.\n\n\"The possibility exists that there may have been other malware on the system which our engines did not detect at the time of research,\" states the Kaspersky report. \"Given that system owner's potential clearance level, the user could have been a prime target of nation states. Adding the user's apparent need for cracked versions of Windows and Office, poor security practices, and improper handling of what appeared to be classified materials, it is possible that the user could have leaked information to many hands.\"\n\nKaspersky acknowledges that in September 2014, its AV software detected Equation Group malware in a 7zip archive stored on the computer system in question, and then subsequently downloaded this archive onto Kaspersky's servers, as it is programmed to do. However, the company is insisting that only the malware binaries were saved, while any remaining files that were incidentally collected -- including Equation Group source code and classified documents --\u00a0were promptly deleted.\n\n\"The reason we deleted those files and will delete similar ones in the future is two-fold; We don't need anything other than malware binaries to improve protection of our customers and secondly, because of concerns regarding the handling of potential classified materials,\" the report states.\n\nAlso Kaspersky denied that its\u00a0products can be secretly leveraged to exfiltrate data to Russian spies, noting that it relies on a secure signature system that external parties would not be able to forge without being detected by third-parties, or recorded in internal databases and historical records.\n\n\"In relation to Equation research specifically, our checks verified that during 2014-2016, none of the researchers working on Equation possessed the rights to commit signatures directly without having an experienced signature developer verifying those. If there was a doubtful intention in signatures during the hunt for Equation samples, this would have been questioned and reported by a lead signature developer,\" the report asserts.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "UK cyber chief fingers Russia for cyberattacks", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/uk-cyber-chief-fingers-russia-for-cyberattacks/article/707705/", "title": "UK cyber chief fingers Russia for cyberattacks", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 15, 2017", "body": "The head of the UK GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on Wednesday accused Russia of staging attacks on critical infrastructure and other sectors within the past year. \n\nThe accusation, from Ciaran Martin, executive director of the NCSC, confirmed a previous statement made by Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, when she blamed Russia for a coordinated series of cyberattacks aimed at undermining election systems and conducting cyberespionage.\n\n\u201cI can't get into too much of the details of intelligence matters, but I can confirm that Russian interference, seen by the National Cyber Security Centre, has included attacks on the UK media, telecommunications, and energy sectors,\u201d Martin said during a speech at the The [London] Times Tech Summit.\n\nThe Times of London said one such attack aimed saw 45,000 messages posted on Russian-operated Twitter accounts during last year's referendum that attempted to sway the vote.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacking/topic/47220/", "topic_name": "Hacking"}]}, {"news_name": "CIA director stands by intel on Russian meddling after Trump defends Putin", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cia-director-stands-by-intel-on-russian-meddling-after-trump-defends-putin/article/706857/", "title": "CIA director stands by intel on Russian meddling after Trump defends Putin ", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 13, 2017", "body": "\"The Director stands by and has always stood by the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment entitled: Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,\" CNN cited the CIA as saying in a statement. \"The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed.\"\n\nIn an August 2016 report shrouded in secrecy the CIA revealed to former President Barack Obama and three top aides that Putin was directly involved in the cyber campaign meant to upend the U.S. presidential election by causing damage to Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump's bid for the White House.\u00a0\n\n\"He said he didn't meddle.

Ted Lieu, D-Calif., a vocal critic of the president, tweeted that he was either not savvy in his dealings with the Russian leader\u00a0\u201cor Putin has something on Trump.\u201d\n\nBy the next day, Trump seemed to walk back his previous remarks, noting \u201cI am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership,\u201d but maintaining that \"I believe that [Putin] feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.\u201d\u00a0\n\nPutin Press Secretary Dmitri Peskov denied the two leaders spoke of meddling, resounding with a simple \u201cno\u201d to a CNN reporter's query.\n\nTrump also indicated that sanctions against Russia are hamstringing efforts between the two countries to solve pressing issues in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere.\u00a0\n\n\"And you know, people don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned,\" said Trump. \u201cThey were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently.

An attack is conducted through email when an attacker sends the intended victim a specially crafted file with a name designed to entice the victim to open it. Unlike other attacks that use Word docs, with DDE the victims do not have to manually enable macros for the payload to download. Instead, infection happens automatically. \n\nMicrosoft offered several suggestions for stopping these attacks. For Word documents, the company says to not open suspicious email attachments or to manually create and set registry entries for Microsoft Office. The latter task should only be handled by someone familiar with the system because if Registry Editor is used incorrectly the operating system may have to be reinstalled.\n\nAn attack through Publisher would likely take place using a Word document, so the Word mitigation will solve this problem as well.\n\nExcel documents require DDE to open, but this can be disabled by going to Set File->Options->Trust Center->Trust Center Settings\u2026->External Content->Security settings for Workbook Links = Disable automatic update of Workbook Links, Microsoft said.\n\nHowever, disabling this feature could prevent Excel spreadsheets from updating dynamically if disabled in the registry, Microsoft noted.\n\nOutlook can also be adjusted through the Registry Editor, but this will disable automatic updates for the DDE field OLE links. These updates will have to be completed manually.\n\nDDE is a protocol used for interprocess communications, such as the transferring of data between applications. Earlier this year, researchers at SensePost determined that DDE could be essentially exploited to execute malicious code in Microsoft Word.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0reportedly chose not to act on the findings, calling this functionality an intentional feature. However, SensePost noted in a\u00a0blog post\u00a0that Microsoft said it\u00a0would consider reclassifying the feature as a bug in the next version of Windows.\n\nLater, in October, Cisco Talos reported that\u00a0a spear phishing campaign impersonating the\u00a0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0was discovered attempting to infect victims with\u00a0DNSMessenger\u00a0malware, using\u00a0malicious Word attachments that abuse the DDE protocol.

However, until March the malware was not associated with Sowbug, tying the APT group to the backdoor was not accomplished until now, Symantec reported.\n\nA lot remains unknown about the group behind the operation other than who and what information it is targeted. Sowbug is focusing its efforts mainly on government and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously and has a strong and often operates when the group knows the local staff is at work, the report stated.\n\nWith that said figuring out whether or not this is a nation-state backed attack is not known, but certain assumptions can be made Dick O'Brien, security researcher at Symantec, told SC Media.\n\n\u201cWe were unable to identify any technical or operational aspects of the attack that would indicate possible origin of this activity. However, we can say the targets are likely of interest to a nation-state and the malware used in these attacks is at the level of sophistication we would expect to see with state-sponsored attackers. The kind of information the attackers appeared to be looking for is also consistent with a state-sponsored group,\u201d he said.\n\nO'Brien also was not sure at this point if this invasive technique can be used against targets with more sophisticated defenses. \n\n\u201cThe investigation is ongoing and there are several things we still don't know about Sowbug, such as how they initially compromise organizations, which means it's hard to make a judgement on who is better protected against them,\u201d he told SC.\n\nAnother point that remains a mystery is how Felismus is being injected into the target systems. Symantec said neither the attackers nor the software leaves any type of trail to follow. However, in other instances where Felismus was discovered there was evidence that a tool known as Starloader was used for installation, possibly using a fake update as bait. Symantec pointed out a few cases where Starloader files were named AdobeUpdate.exe, AcrobatUpdate.exe.\n\nOnce Sowbug has an inroad into a system it begins a systematic search, sometimes for very specific documents.

In an online security bulletin, Adobe describes the bug \u2013\u00a0officially designated CVE-2017-11292 \u2013 as a \"critical type confusion vulnerability that could lead to code execution.\"\n\nThe bulletin also acknowledges the existence of an active exploit that is \"being used in limited targeted attacks against users running Windows.\" Even so, the patch applies to all major operating systems \u2013\u00a0Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Chrome \u2013\u00a0and includes fixes for the Desktop Runtime, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 versions of Flash Player.\n\nDiscovered on Oct. 10 by\u00a0Anton Ivanov, lead malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, the exploit was initially found contained within an ActiveX object that was in turn embedded in a malicious Microsoft Office document, which was likely delivered via a phishing email. According to a Kaspersky blog post,\u00a0the exploit is the work of BlackOasis, an APT group known to gather intelligence on activists,\u00a0United Nations figures,\u00a0regional news correspondents, and think tanks \u2013\u00a0particularly those affiliated with the Middle East. The group also appears fixated on the African nation of Angola.\n\n\"The exploit is a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the 'com.adobe.tvsdk.mediacore.BufferControlParameters' class,\" the blog post explains. \"If the exploit is successful, it will gain arbitrary read/write operations within memory, thus allowing it to execute a second stage shellcode.\"\n\nThe exploit's final payload is mo.exe, an new and improved version of FinSpy, which is typically sold to governments as a surveillance tool. \"This newer variant has made it especially difficult for researchers to analyze the malware due to many added anti-analysis techniques,\" Kaspersky states.\n\nKaspersky also found that mo.exe shares the same command-and-control servers with another FinSpy payload that was delivered via a different zero-day exploit attack reported by FireEye in September 2017. This previous exploit was delivered via\u00a0Microsoft Office RTF documents that\u00a0took advantage of CVE-2016-8759, a a SOAP-based parser code injection vulnerability within the Microsoft .NET framework.\n\nInterestingly, on Oct. 13, a\u00a0Malwarebytes\u00a0blog post reported on an email-based malware campaign that leveraged Microsoft Office Word and RTF documents and a CVE-2016-8759 exploit in order to infect recipients with the Orcus Rat Remote Administrative Tool.\n\nKaspersky says that it first discovered BlackOasis in 2016, but the APT has leveraged at least five zero-day exploits in attacks since as far back as June 2015.

In a report filed last July, Palo Alto stated that the webshell had been actively operating on a specific organization's network since at least June 2016.\n\nTwoFace was designed to operate on web servers that support Microsoft's\u00a0open-source\u00a0web application framework\u00a0ASP.NET, and is so named because it features two distinct components \u2013\u00a0its primary payload, and a loader whose main mission is to implant the payload onto the infected web server.\u00a0The final payload is capable of executing an application or command, uploading a file to or downloading a file from the server, uploading data to or deleting data from TEMP folder files, and reviewing or setting files' MAC timestamps.\n\nIn its July report, Palo Alto noted that the webshell received commands from five IP addresses \u2013 likely all compromised \u2013 from four different countries. Much of the malicious activity involved using the Mimikatz post-exploitation tool\u00a0to collect and save the passwords of accounts that were logged into the system, before ultimately exfiltrating them. The actors also leveraged TwoFace to download additional webshells and move laterally around the infected organization's other servers.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Palo Alto learned even more about the presumably compromised IP addresses linked to TwoFace, the company revealed this week in a new blog post.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFor instance, researchers looked into the passive DNS entries for a TwoFace IP address\u00a0that was traced to France. This inquiry turned up fraudulent domain names and websites that were designed to impersonate the log-in portals of genuine organizations, in order to trick visitors into entering their credentials so they could be harvested for malicious use.\u00a0\n\nThe organizations being imitated were all either based in Israel or exhibited strong Israeli connections, including the Institute of National Security Studies think tank, Tel Aviv University, consulting firm Macros Advisory Partners, real estate and property management company Tidhar Group, telecom firm Bezeq International, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\n\"Credential harvesters in general are not uncommon, but it is significant to have a grouping of region- and company-specific harvesters. This grouping leads us to believe that this adversary is likely to have had a specific mission to accomplish, which involved breaching specific organizations,\" states the Unit 42 blog post, co-authored by threat intelligence analysts Robert Falcone and Bryan Lee. \"And it is highly unlikely that it is a coincidence that these specifically designed spoofing sites were on the same infrastructure as TwoFace when both target the same geopolitical region.\"\n\nResearchers also found links between TwoFace and five other webshells, including one called RunningBee, which was found\u00a0hosted on an unnamed Middle Eastern educational institution. A TwoFace IP address, traced to the U.S. and\u00a0owned by a Middle Eastern nation-state's Ministry of Oil,\u00a0was used to upload post-exploitation tools to the RunningBee shell.\n\nWhile investigating four other webshells tied to TwoFace, Unit 42 was also able to uncover a remote connection tool known as PuTTY Link (plink) and a custom Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) web server backdoor called RGDoor.\n\n\"We believe the threat actors may have used plink to connect to additional systems on the compromised network after obtaining legitimate credentials using a tool such as Mimikatz,\" the blog post reported. \"RGDoor is an HTTP module that the threat actors are likely loading into the IIS web server to maintain an additional, backup access point should the compromised organization detect and remediate the installed webshell...from the server.\"\n\nThe multi-pronged infrastructure tied to TwoFace hints at an actor with significant resources. And that actor potentially could be OilRig, according to Unit 42 researchers. One key clue: a specific version of the Mimikatz tool that was uploaded to an institution infected with the TwoFace shell was also observed in use during an investigation of OilRig APT activities.\n\n\"While we cannot be absolutely certain that this is the same adversary in both attacks, we are able to ascertain that this specific entity does have access to OilRig tools and also has access to a very specific sample of Mimikatz only found in this attack infrastructure,\" the blog post states.\n\nIn an email interview with SC Media, Christopher Budd, senior threat communications manager at Palo Alto Networks, provided deeper context regarding the OilRig group and how it could be connected to TwoFace.\n\n\"We've seen previously that\u00a0OilRig\u00a0attacks are highly targeted spear phishing attacks that use malicious Microsoft Office documents to deliver malware. We have named the family of malicious documents used \u201cClayside.\u201d We have found Clayside documents dropping malware we've named \u201cHelminth,\u201d said Budd. \"In the latest\u00a0blog, we do note that 'one possible scenario of how\u00a0TwoFace\u00a0and\u00a0OilRig\u00a0are used in conjunction could be where the adversary uses the\u00a0ClaySlide\u00a0documents to deliver Helminth, which is then used as an initial landing point or beachhead into the target's network. From there, the adversary may use the initial ingress point and its corresponding permissions to install the\u00a0TwoFace\u00a0webshell\u00a0on accessible systems.'\u201d\n\nPalo Alto Network also notes that TwoFace and OilRig share many of the same geographic targets. Additionally,\u00a0one of the passwords needed to interact with the aforementioned RunningBee shell is the same one used for webshells observed an Iranian industrial cyberespionage campaign that Cylance described in a 2014\u00a0report\u00a0as Operation Cleaver.\n\n\"As we have continued our research into operations in the Middle East, we are beginning to uncover more and more overlaps between the various adversary groups and campaigns outlined by us and others in the public domain,\" the Unit 42 blog post concludes. \"In this incident, we were able to follow a trail starting from a single webshell to a bevy of compromised sites, credential harvesters, post-exploitation tools, and even an operational overlap with what we originally thought was an unrelated attack campaign. The Middle East region has proven to be a hotbed of threat activity in recent times, with continued acceleration of pacing as well as development in the tactics and techniques used.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI's Wray says nat'l security, crime all have cybersecurity element", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/fbis-wray-says-natl-security-crime-all-have-cybersecurity-element/article/696482/", "title": "FBI's Wray says nat'l security, crime all have cybersecurity element", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "September 28, 2017", "body": "Every security and criminal threat that the FBI faces has a cyber or tech component that is increasing in frequency and sophistication, presenting tremendous challenges for FBI investigators, the bureau's director, Christopher Wray, told members of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Wednesday.\n\nWe face sophisticated cyber threats from foreign intelligence agencies, hackers for hire, organized crime syndicates, and terrorists. Threat actors\u2014foreign intelligence agencies, organized groups, terrorists and hackers for hire\u2014\u201cconstantly seek to access and steal our nation's classified information, trade secrets, technology, and ideas\u2014all of which are of great importance to our national and economic security,\u201d Wray said in his opening statement, noting that critical infrastructure and the U.S. economy are in their crosshairs. \u201cThe frequency and impact of cyberattacks on our nation's private sector and government networks have increased dramatically in the past decade and are expected to continue to grow,\u201d as is reporting of malicious activity, gauged \u201cby the amount of corporate data stolen or deleted, personally identifiable information compromised, or remediation costs incurred by U.S. victims.\u201d \n\nWray said the FBI is increasing its efforts to intertwine intelligence and operations, asking Congress to renew Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) without a sunset provision.\n\n\u201cSection 702 is a critical tool that the intelligence community uses properly to target non-U.S. persons located outside the United States to acquire information vital to our national security,\u201d he said, offering assurances that the program won't encourage government overreach. \u201cTo protect privacy and civil liberties, this program has operated under strict rules and been carefully overseen by all three branches of the government.\n\nEchoing his successor, Wray expressed frustration with the \u201creal and growing gap between law enforcement's legal authority to access digital information and its technical ability to do so.\u201d\n\nNoting that \u201cthe exploitation of encrypted platforms presents serious challenges to law enforcement's ability to identify, investigate, and disrupt threats that range from counterterrorism to child exploitation, gangs, drug traffickers and white-collar crimes,\u201d Wray said the FBI's \u201caim is not to expand the government's surveillance authority, but rather to ensure that we can obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to the legal authority that Congress has provided to us to keep America safe.\u201d\n\nThe challenge will continue to grow as society becomes more reliant on electronic devices to communicate and store data. \u201cWhen changes in technology hinder law enforcement`s ability to exercise investigative tools and follow critical leads, those changes also hinder efforts to identify and stop terrorists who are using social media to recruit, plan, and execute an attack in our country,\u201d he said. \n\nIf the bureau can't access evidence stored in laptops and other devices, \u201cit will have ongoing, significant impacts on our ability to identify, stop, and prosecute these offenders,\u201d Wray said, noting that \u201cin the first 10 months of this fiscal year, the FBI was unable to access the content of more than 6,000 mobile devices using appropriate and available technical tools, even though there was legal authority to do so,\u201d\u2026or \"slightly over half of all the mobile devices the FBI attempted to access in

Although the alert suggested that it was primarily administrative and business systems that were breached, Symantec believes that operational systems could be compromised as well.\n\n\"Symantec has seen machines that are in operational networks that have been compromised,\" Eric Chien, technical director at Symantec, told SC Media in an interview.\u00a0\"The example behavior we have seen thus far on those machines is taking screenshots.\"\n\nIndeed, Symantec has taken notice of the APT group's use of the string \u201ccntrl\u201d (control) in its naming convention for screen captures of infected machines. Symantec theorizes that \"cntrl\" in this instance could indicate that these particular infected machines have access to operational systems. If so, then the APT actors could very well have the ability to take over and disrupt these systems.\n\nChien confirmed that the targets include \"organizations and facilities responsible for power generation, transmission, and distribution,\" with some specializing in traditional energy and others in nuclear energy. While many of these\u00a0facilities, for security reasons, don't connect their operational systems to the internet, they nevertheless can still be penetrated by first\u00a0breaching the administrative network, he explained.\n\nThe APT group, dubbed\u00a0Dragonfly\u00a0or Energetic Bear, is commonly linked to Russia. Symantec reports that the hackers first struck in 2011, but their operations eventually tapered off, until a second campaign commenced in 2015. Dragonfly's malicious activity has only grown more aggressive in 2017, with silent attacks on facilities in at least the U.S., Switzerland and Turkey since the \"Dragonfly 2.0\" campaign began. (A recent\u00a0Cisco Talos report\u00a0has also linked the group with hacks on Irish power facilities.)\n\nSymantec notes that the original Dragonfly campaign also targeted the U.S. and Turkey. But that's not where the similarities end: Both past and present Dragonfly operations share key malware programs that are unique to the ATP group, and utilize the same infection vectors to access victims' networks, including\u00a0spear phishing emails, trojanized software and compromised websites (aka watering holes).\n\n\"The Dragonfly group appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so,\" the report states.\n\n\"The notion that there may be nation-state or rogue actors who have been resident in the networks of nuclear facilities, electrical grids, and dams isn't far-fetched. Many of these infrastructure providers are relying on outdated security systems with limited detection capabilities,\" said Ken Spinner, VP of field engineering at data security company Varonis Systems, in emailed comments. \"We got a glimpse of what's possible when the Ukraine's power grid was partially disrupted in 2015 and again in 2016,\" he added, referring to the BlackEnergy attacks that were widely attributed to Russia.\n\nAnd while malware attacks have targeted the energy sector for years, \"The key difference today is that attackers are equipped with far more sophisticated malware that is designed specifically to infiltrate and damage things like electricity substation switches and circuit breakers,\" Spinner warned.\n\nSymantec reports that the earliest Dragonfly 2.0 attack it observed was a December 2015 malspam campaign that sent energy sector workers what appeared to be email invitations to a New Year's Eve party. This was followed by additional phishing emails featuring content related to the energy industry and general business.\u00a0\n\nVictims of these campaigns were infected with malware that would leak their network credentials to an external server. In other instances, the attackers harvested credentials by employing a template injection attack, using malicious phishing attachments to download a template file via an SMB connection (as described in the aforementioned\u00a0Cisco Talos\u00a0report).\n\nAs with prior campaigns, Dragonfly continues to compromise legitimate software to infect victims, currently using the\u00a0evasion framework Shellter develop trojanized applications, Symantec reports. And the group also appears to be compromising websites to deliver malicious backdoors posing as Flash updates.\n\nThe malware families associated with Dragonfly include the backdoors Goodor and\u00a0Dorshel; the trojans Karagany,\u00a0Karagany.B, Heriplor, and Listrix; and the Phishery toolkit. Of these,\u00a0Heriplor is exclusive to Dragonfly, further proving the group is behind both the current and older wave of attacks against energy companies, Symantec asserts.\n\n\u201cWhat's interesting here is the relatively unsophisticated methods the hacking group has used,\" said\u00a0Leigh-Anne Galloway, cyber security resilience officer at\u00a0vulnerability and compliance management company\u00a0Positive Technologies, in emailed comments. \"These hackers have bet that, in spite of the critical importance of the systems, the people using them don't have the security wherewithal to think before clicking on a link or opening an attachment... The implications are life threatening to personnel and the general public, and attackers could cause a short circuit disrupting safety mechanisms, or cause a complete outage.\u201d\n\n\"Attributes of this attack are similar to those perpetrated by nation-states with deep pockets and long-term goals,\" said\u00a0Josh Douglas, chief strategy officer with cybersecurity and government\u00a0defense contractor Cyber Services at\u00a0Raytheon.\u00a0\"Reports show that in addition to using open-source software and common means of attack, the aggressors deployed one proprietary piece of malware designed to give an attacker remote access to a victim's machine. That indicates they have invested strongly in their capabilities \u2013 some of which we have yet to see \u2013 and that we may not yet know the full extent of this attack.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the IBM Managed Security Services team on Thursday published its own blog post\u00a0detailing increasing attacks launched against the energy sector. According to IBM, attacks targeting industrial controls systems increased by more than 110 percent in 2016. And based on data from the first half of 2017, the volume of attacks in 2017 are expected to exceed last year's totals.\n\nIBM also observed that the top attack method leveraged against its energy and utilities clients was the use of malicious input data, for the purpose of controlling or disrupting a system. Such attacks targeted 60 percent of its clients in this sector.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/critical-infrastructure/topic/47217/", "topic_name": "Critical Infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}]}, {"news_name": "Turla APT group linked to Gazer backdoor that spies on embassies", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/turla-apt-group-linked-to-gazer-backdoor-that-spies-on-embassies/article/685230/", "title": "Turla APT group linked to Gazer backdoor that spies on embassies", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 30, 2017", "body": "A previously undocumented backdoor program used to spy on foreign embassies and consulates appears to be the work of suspected Russian APT group Turla, researchers from ESET have reported.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday blog post published by the cybersecurity company, the spyware, dubbed Gazer, has been targeting organizations primarily in Southeastern Europe and in former Soviet nations.\n\nESET researchers tied Gazer to Turla, aka Uroburos and Snake, because it shares many commonalities with the hacking group's previous malware operations, including its targets, method of delivery, anti-detection methods, use of compromised websites as infrastructure, and other processes.\n\nJean-Ian Boutin, senior malware researcher at ESET, told SC Media that this backdoor has been in used for at least a year . \"The complexity of tools used by Turla is quite high. We're seeing them really trying to change any type of data or strings (the binaries) so that we lose track of them,\" said Boutin. \"We're observing that they fight back to modify the backdoors, so that it's harder to stop them and harder to find them.\"\n\nConsidered a second-stage backdoor, Gazer is distributed via spear phishing emails that initially infect victims with a first-stage backdoor such as Skipper, which is commonly used by Turla in its campaigns. Skipper, in turn, delivers Gazer as the primary payload.\n\nGazer itself is very similar to other second-stage backdoors used by Turla, such as Carbon and Kazuar, ESET reports.\u00a0For instance, they all receive tasks (e.g. file uploads/downloads, configuration updates, command executions) from command-and-control servers that can be executed by the actual infected machine or by a connected machine on the same network. Gazer includes a communication module that specifically spearheads this process.\n\nThe C&C servers typically consist of legitimate websites that have been compromised to act as a first-layer proxy. ESET further notes that Gazer, Carbon and Kazuar all have \"a similar list of processes that may be employed as a target to inject the module used to communicate with the C&C\u00a0server embedded in the binary.\"\n\nA\u00a0technical report analyzing Gazer reveals that researchers uncovered four different versions of the backdoor.\u00a0The malware is written in C++ language, achieves persistence six different ways, and relies heavily on encryption. Additionally, it stores its\u00a0components and configuration within the Windows Registry, much like Carbon\u00a0and\u00a0Kazuar uses encrypted containers for such storage.\n\nAll three of Gazer's key components communicate with each other\u00a0via a named pipe, and they keeps logs of their actions in a file.\n\nAs with prior attacks, the hackers took several key steps to avoid detection, such as wiping files and changing the code strings, in this case modifying them to include sly nods to video game references.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Chinese national arrested in relation to OPM breach", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/authorities-arrest-chinese-national-linked-to-opm-breach-malware/article/684280/", "title": "Chinese national arrested in relation to OPM breach ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "August 25, 2017", "body": "U.S. officials arrested a Chinese national who is accused of being involved in the 2015 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach that compromised the data of nearly four million people.\n\n\u00a0Authorities arrested 36-year-old Yu Pingan of Shanghai on Aug. 21 when he flew into Los Angeles International Airport after he was accused of conspiring with others to use the Sakula malware in a series of cyberattacks against unnamed U.S. companies, according to court documents.\n\nWhile the OPM breach wasn't mention specifically in the indictment, Sakula was used in the OPM breach and authorities said Yu used \u201crare\u201d hacking tools including the named malware and said Yu was involved in cyberattacks occurred between 2014 and 2015.\n\nAn FBI official said he believed Yu provided versions of Sakula to two unnamed men that he knew would be used to carry out attacks on the firms, in an affidavit linked to the complaint. \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Judge rules Fancy Bear APT must forfeit malicious domains to Microsoft", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/judge-rules-fancy-bear-apt-must-forfeit-malicious-domains-to-microsoft/article/684283/", "title": "Judge rules Fancy Bear APT must forfeit malicious domains to Microsoft", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 25, 2017", "body": "A federal district court judge in Eastern Virginia has granted Microsoft Corporation permission to seize domains that Russian APT group Fancy Bear has historically used to target the software giant and its users.\n\nThe default judgement, issued this week, also included a permanent injunction forbidding the threat actors from further engaging in cybercriminal activities against Microsoft. For obvious reasons,\u00a0representatives from Fancy Bear or the GRU, the Russian intelligence agency to which the APT group is linked, did not appear in court to defend themselves.

This key clause is a blatant rebuke of President Donald Trump, who fleetingly announced a U.S.-Russian cyber unit in July before backing off the idea amidst backlash.\n\nUnder the terms of the bill, which is sponsored by Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), any report submitted by the DNI would need to explain the purpose of forming such a joint cyber unit, specify what cyber intelligence would be shared, communicate the value of such an alliance to national security, express any counterintelligence concerns arising from such an arrangement, and recommend steps to mitigate these concerns.\n\nThe proposed act also directs key executive branch officials to submit a series of reports, assessments and recommendations regarding election security in the recent past, present and future.\n\nSpecifically, the bill states that within 90 days of the legislation's passage, the DNI must coordinate with other relevant officials and agencies to develop \"a whole-of-government strategy for countering the threat of Russian cyberattacks and attempted cyberattacks against electoral systems and processes in the United States, including federal, state, and local election systems, voter registration databases, voting tabulation equipment, and equipment and processes for the secure transmission of election results.\"\n\nThis comprehensive strategic plan would include suggested measures for securing voting machines and related electoral technologies, detecting threats, improving attack attribution, deterring future threats, and communicating with state and local election officials.\n\nThe DNI (who is currently Dan Coats) would also be tasked with conducting a postmortem assessment of the U.S. intelligence community's ability to adequately analyze Russia's interference in the 2016 elections, including whether intel resources were properly aligned to detect and respond to the threat, and the effectiveness of information sharing efforts. This report would be due one year after the bill's passage.\n\nStarting one year before any regularly scheduled federal election, the DNI, along with other key intelligence community members, would be required to evaluate the vulnerabilities of state election systems and send\u00a0Congressional leaders the results of this assessment within 180 days of the official vote.\n\nWithin 60 days of the bill's enactment, the\u00a0Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis would be expected to submit to Congress a report describing cyberattacks attempted or perpetrated by any foreign government on the 2016 elections, as well as any anticipated future attacks. Separately, this same official would be required to submit within 180 days\u00a0a plan for implementing bug bounty programs at various U.S. agencies and departments, much like the Department of Defense recently did.\n\nFinally, the DNI, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security and directors of the CIA, NSA and FBI, would be asked to submit a report on any foreign government's attempts to conduct surveillance on Americans by exploiting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in U.S. telecommunications networks, including SS7.\n\n\"...We continue the Committee's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\" said Sen.

Kaspersky analysts later\u00a0traced this activity to a NetSarang software package \u2013\u00a0one of several to be affected.\n\nImpacted packages include Xmanager Enterprise 5 Build 1232,\u00a0Xmanager 5 Build 1045,\u00a0Xshell 5 Build 1322,\u00a0Xftp 5 Build 1218, and\u00a0Xlpd 5 Build 1220. Kaspersky suspects that the culprits \"either modified source codes or patched software on the build servers,\" in order to embed shellcode into \"nssock2.dll,\" one of the code libraries used by the software.\n\nNetSarang software is found on servers and workstations used by companies across a wide range of business sectors, any of which could be a potential target. Kaspersky has already confirmed an activated payload in a Hong Kong-based company, but did not name the affected business.\n\nAfter being informed of the sabotage, NetSarang removed the malicious files and updated its software earlier this month. Kaspersky believes the files were first altered around July 13, which is the compilation date of the earliest known ShadowPad sample. The tainted software would be released just days later.\n\n\"Regretfully, the Build release of our full line of products on July 18, 2017 was unknowingly shipped with a backdoor, which had the potential to be exploited by its creator,\" acknowledged NetSarang in a Kaspersky press release issued yesterday.\n\nNetSarang followed up on its release with a statement issued to SC Media: \"We've exhausted all avenues of communication to our users regarding this issue and have urged all users to update their software immediately. Emails have been sent out and if the customer is connected to the Internet and has opted to periodically have the software check for updates, they've been notified through the software itself. As the security of our user base is our highest priority, we've pushed the update to all users, including those using pirated copies of our software.\"\n\nThe software company also said that in response to the incident, it has incorporated \"additional security protocols and checks\" to ensure that future releases don't suffer the same fate. Moreover, it has decided to abandon its network infrastructure as a result of the compromise.\n\n\"Over the course of several weeks, we'll be migrating to an entirely new and separate network infrastructure where each device is wiped, examined, verified, and whitelisted,\" NetSarang said in its statement. \"Each whitelisted device will then be placed into our new network infrastructure one-by-one. ensuring we're operating with a clean slate.\"\n\nAccording to Securelist, the sabotaged ShadowPad files work in two distinct stages, leveraging a tiered architecture that stops the backdoor from activating until a designated command-and-control server sends a specially crafted DNS TXT record for a specific domain. The attackers implemented a domain generation algorithm for these C&C servers, whose domains were registered from July through December.\n\nOnce the payload is activated, the module exchanges data with the server, which sends backs a decryption key for the next stage of the code. A separate technical analysis published by Kaspersky explains that the second stage effectively executes the backdoor by acting \"as an orchestrator for five main modules responsible for C&C communication, working with the DNS protocol, [and] loading and injecting additional plugins into the memory of other processes,\" allowing for data exfiltration.\n\nAlthough the perpetrators were careful not to leave traces of their activity, analysis did find one clue that could potentially assist early attribution efforts: some of the techniques employed in this attack were also used to spread the PlugX remote access tool and Winnti backdoor programs, which were allegedly developed by Chinese-speaking authors.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Ukrainian malware author is key witness against Russia in DNC hack investigation", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ukrainian-malware-author-is-key-witness-against-russia-in-dnc-hack-investigation/article/682137/", "title": "Ukrainian malware author is key witness against Russia in DNC hack investigation", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 16, 2017", "body": "A Ukrainian man who authored malware that U.S. intelligence officials say was used by an Russian APT group to hack the Democratic National Committee has become a witness for the FBI, after turning himself in to his home country's authorities early this year, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe man, who goes by the online alias Profexer,\u00a0is the first known living witness to emerge in the DNC hack investigation, according to the article.

Microsoft patched this bug in April 2017.\n\nThe newly discovered attack technique is tied to a spear phishing campaign that has largely focused on companies in the electronics manufacturing industry. In this instance, the intent is to infect businesses with\u00a0a trojanized version of the REMCOS remote access tool (RAT), which comes with myriad features for attackers, including the ability to download and execute commands, a keylogger, a screen logger, and webcam and microphone recorders.\n\nIn an Aug. 14 blog post, Trend Micro threat analysts Ronnie Giagone and Rubio Wu\u00a0said that the adversaries likely swapped RTF files with PPSX files to change things up and \"evade antivirus detection.\"\n\nThe threat first arrives in the form of a spear phishing email that appears to be sent from a cable manufacturing provider looking to place a large order. The email specifically asks if the recipient can supply a list of items, requesting a price quote and estimated delivery date.\n\nHowever, upon opening up the attached file, all the recipient actually sees is a PPSX\u00a0document that displays the vulnerability identifier \"CVE-2017-8570.\" Strangely, this is not the vulnerability actually being exploited (as referenced before, the vulnerability being abused is CVE-2017-0199) \u2013\u00a0 a quirk that Trend Micro chalks up to an error on the part of the toolkit developer.\n\nThe malicious PPSX file leverages the exploit to download another file, which Trend Micro detects as JS_DLOADER.AUSYVT, from an abused VPN or hosting service. This XML file, written in JavaScript, is essentially a malicious downloader program that runs a PowerShell command in order to retrieve the main REMCOS payload, which is camouflaged using various obfuscations and protections.\n\nThe first sample of PPSX malware that Trend Micro came across was on July 28. At first, \"there was very little traffic in the days following this initial detection. It's only in the last week that we've seen a increase in this malware in the wild,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Mark Nunnikhoven, VP of cloud research for Trend Micro, in an email interview with SC Media.\n\n\"Cases like this highlight the need for users to be cautious when opening files or clicking links in their emails \u2013\u00a0 even if they come from seemingly legitimate sources,\" the blog post advises. \"Spear phishing attempts can be rather sophisticated, and as seen with this example, can trick most users into downloading malicious files.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trend Micro reported on a different\u00a0spear phishing campaign, targeting Russian-speaking businesses, that infects victims with a backdoor program, using malformed RTF files that also exploit\u00a0CVE-2017-0199.\n\nTod Beardsley, research director at Rapid7, said in emailed comments that while the attackers' use of Power Point Slide Show may be of interest to security researchers, the more significant takeaway is that these campaigns continue to work because many users fail to patch vulnerabilities and open suspicious attachments.\n\n\u201cSecurity researchers continue to be fascinated with novel attack vectors, exotic cryptography attacks, and zero-day vulnerabilities, but out in the real world, people are dealing with 120+ day vulnerabilities that depend on users failing to install patches and running malicious code emailed to them by strangers,\" said\u00a0Beardsley.\u00a0Spearphishing with malicious attachments continues to be a devastatingly effective technique for online criminals, and we in security need to be doing a better job when it comes to partnering with our friends in IT operations and software development to make this attack more expensive and less effective.\"\n\n\"The fact is, the headlines around CVE-2017-0199 could have been written any time in the last 15 years,\" Beardsley continued. \"This alone tells me that we're clearly not making enough headway against phishing campaigns.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"},

employed in the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, as well as a recent campaign, detailed in April, that\u00a0targeted Korean-speaking individuals. Therefore, researchers contend that this latest attack is being carried out by the same group that either spearheaded or closely collaborated on these earlier campaigns, both of which were allegedly executed by Lazarus.\n\nTo infect victims, the attackers are using Microsoft Office document files \u2013 most likely hosted on compromised servers and distributed via phishing emails \u2013 that are weaponized with the same malicious VBA macros that were found in the previous campaign targeting Korean speakers.\n\nBut this time, the decoy documents are written in English. One such document describes a purported job opening for a mechanical\u00a0engineering integration manager for the THAAD interceptor, an anti-ballistic\u00a0missile defense\u00a0system, while another shows a job listing for a director of sales and business development at Sikorskys Mission Equipment.\n\nThe final malware payload is \"extremely similar\" to the one used in the campaign targeting Korean-speakers, notes the blog post, authored by Palo Alto researchers Anthony Kasza\u00a0and\u00a0Micah Yates.\n\n\"The payload is a pretty generic backdoor that gives the attacker the ability to execute commands on the infected system,\" said\u00a0Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Unit 42.\u00a0\"While this capability is rather simple, it acts as a foothold in the network which would allow the attacker to install additional tools or attempt to spread laterally to other hosts in the network.\" Clearly, such abilities are especially alarming when the infected machine belongs to an individual working within the defense sector.\n\nThe decoy documents distributed in both the latest campaign and the previous one targeting Korean-speakers both feature the same metadata author \"ISkyISea,\" and both campaigns share of the same IPv4 addresses for hosting the Word documents on command-and-control servers.\n\nPalo Alto researchers also found plenty of ties between this new operation and the Sony Pictures hack, such as the \"reuse of macro source code, XOR keys used within the macro to decode implant payloads, and the functional overlap in the payloads the macros write to disk.\" Other shared techniques include \"use of a fake TLS communications protocol, encoded strings within samples, filenames and contents of batch files embedded within implants, as well implants beaconing directly to IPv4 addresses (and not resolving domains for command and control).\"\n\nAccording to the blog post, there is little reason to believe that this threat actor will stop reaching its same bag of tricks, considering that it has continued to do so even after being publicly exposed.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Trump signs Russian sanctions bill", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/trump-signs-russian-sanctions-bill/article/679355/", "title": "Trump signs Russian sanctions bill", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "August 02, 2017", "body": "Just two days after Russian President Vladmir Putin sent 755 members of the U.S. diplomatic staff packing in retaliation for Congress-approved sanctions against Russia \u2013 enacted partly over the Kremlin's hacking campaign during the U.S. election \u2013 President Donald Trump signed the sanctions bill into law. \u00a0 \n\nTrump has long contended that others could have orchestrated hacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Democratic organizations and election systems, even as the U.S. intelligence community has laid the blame on Russia.

For context, the World Bank says there were 25.37 million North Koreans in 2016. \u00a0\n\nThe firm notes however, \u201cthe vast majority of North Koreans do not have access to the internet.\u201d North Koreans are buying mobiles devices enabled with few 3G services, and are restricted to operating only on North Korea's partly state-run network, Koryolink, also part-owned by Dutch firm Global Telecom Holding.\n\n \n\nOnly a small select group of university students, scientists, and select government officials, are allowed access to North Korea's domestic, state-run intranet via common-use computers at universities and internet cafes, says Recorded Future.\n\nSlate described the domestic intranet this way: \u201cThe network, called Kwangmyong, currently connects libraries, universities, and government departments and is slowly making its way into homes of better-off citizens. It houses a number of domestic websites, an online learning system, and email. The sites themselves aren't much to get excited about: They belong to the national news service, universities, government IT service centres, and a handful of other official organisations. There's also apparently a cooking site with recipes for Korean dishes.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAmong the select few with permission to use the country's intranet are an even slimmer group of the most senior leaders and ruling elite who are granted access to the worldwide internet directly,\u201d says Recorded Future.\n\n \n\nHow are the select few using the internet?\n\n \n\nSpeaking of the period in which it collected data, Recorded Future says 65 percent of all internet activity in North Korea was either from gaming and content streaming.\n\nIn general terms, the content consumed by readers came mostly from the Chinese video hosting service Youku, iTunes, and various BitTorrent and peer-to-peer streaming services.\n\nNorth Korean users, says Recorded Future, seem to prefer games hosted by Valve and a massively multiplayer online game called World of Tanks.\n\n \n\nLess than one percent of North Korean internet activity during this period was encrypted or protected in any way. Among the activity that met this criteria, methods of protecting information varied broadly from incorrect implementations of TLS/SSL, and utilising nearly untraceable chains of multiple virtual private networks (VPNs) and virtual private servers (VPS) to transfer large amounts of data.\n\n \n\nAs an example of incorrect implementation, Recorded Future says it observed a North Korean user who went to the trouble of using Tor to cover their track but then used torrent file sharing and exited the Tor network from the same node every day for over three months.\n\n \n\nThis generally poor level of encryption is, according to Recorded Future, what has given such insight into the North Korean leadership and elite interests that the West never had before.\n\nThe firm notes that some users, who were using high-end technology such as iPhones, iPads, and Blackberries to communicate, were utilising VoIP services to talk and message others overseas.\n\nOthers, who regularly checked their AOL accounts, also might have frequented health and beauty sites or bought designer clothes online.\n\nNorth Korea on the world stage\n\n \n\nThe data collected by Recorded Future reveals that North Korea's leadership and ruling elite are likely aware of the impact that their country's missile tests, suppression of the population, and criminal activities have on the international community.\n\n\u201cThese decisions are not made in isolation nor are they ill-informed as many would believe,\u201d according to the firm.\n\n \n\n\u201cResearchers and scholars have hypothesised that there may be a connection between North Korean cyber-activity and missile launches or tests,\u201d says Recorded Future, claiming \u201cwe may be able to forecast or anticipate a missile test based on North Korean cyber or internet activity.\u201d\n\nThey report however that there does not appear to be a correlation between North Korean internet activity at large and missile tests or launches.\n\n \n\n\u201cThis current data set is too short a duration of time to apply any long-term conclusions about the utility of internet activity as a warning device for missile tests\u201d, says Recorded Future, however, it said its analysis does suggest that if there is a correlation between North Korean activity and missile tests, it is not telegraphed by the leadership and ruling elite internet behaviour.\n\nSuspect activity\n\n \n\nWhile the majority of activity from North Korea during the timeframe Recorded Future analysed was not malicious, the firms note\u00a0the start of Bitcoin mining in North Korea on 17 May. Before that day, there was very little to no activity on Bitcoin-related sites or nodes, or even the use of Bitcoin-specific ports or protocols.\n\nBeginning on 17 May, that activity shot from nothing to hundreds per day. The timing of this mining is important because it began very soon after the May Wanna Cry ransomware attacks, which the NSA has attributed to North Korea's intelligence service, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), as an attempt to raise funds for the Kim regime.\n\n \n\nBy this point (17 May) actors within the government would have realised that moving the Bitcoin from the three WannaCry ransom accounts would be easy to track and ill-advised if they wished to retain deniability for the attack.\n\n \n\nIt is not clear who is running the North Korean Bitcoin mining operations; however, given the relatively small number of computers in North Korea coupled with the limited IP space, \u201cit is not likely this computationally intensive activity is occurring outside of state control,\u201d says Recorded Future.\n\nOther countries in the mix\n\n \n\nAccording to Recorded Future, North Korea is not using territorial resources to conduct cyber-operations and most North Korean state-sponsored activity is likely perpetrated from abroad, which presents an opportunity to apply asymmetric pressure on the Kim regime.\n\n \n\n\u201cThis analysis demonstrates that there are likely other regime pressure points, and as a result, other tools, techniques, and partners that could be explored toward a path for North Korean denuclearisation,\u201d says Recorded Future.\n\n \n\nThis data and analysis from Recorded Future demonstrates that there are significant physical and virtual North Korean presences in several nations around the world \u2014 nations where North Koreans are possibly engaging in malicious cyber and criminal activities. These nations include India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nepal, Kenya, Mozambique, and Indonesia.\n\n \n\nIt has been widely reported that North Korea has a physical presence to conduct cyber-operations in China, including co-owning a hotel in Shenyang with the Chinese from which North Korea conducted malicious cyber-activity. Nearly ten percent of all activity observed during this time frame involved China, not including the internet access points provided by Chinese telecommunications companies.\n\n \n\nRecorded Future's analysis finds that the profile of activity for China was different than the seven nations identified above, mainly because North Korean leadership user's utilised so many Chinese services, such as Taobao, Aliyun, and Youku, which skewed the data. After accounting for use of Chinese internet services, which of course do not signify either physical or virtual presence in China, the pattern of activity to local Chinese resources, news outlets, and government departments mirrored the seven previously identified nations.\n\n \n\nThis Chinese example, where the distinct pattern of activity discovered combined with the already known facilities for cyber-operations, provides a model that can be applied to the other seven nations.\n\n \n\nRecorded Future notes: \u201cWe are not implying that the governments of these seven nations identified above (excluding China) are complicit with, supportive, or even knowledgeable of the North Korean presence in their country.\u201d\n\nImpact\n\n \n\nThe international policy and engagement strategy toward North Korea has struggled to be impactful for decades because it has relied on the same set of tools (sanctions, increasing international isolation) and engaged the same nations (China, Russia, UN Security Council Permanent Five) as partners, says Recorded Future. There are likely other pressure points on the regime and as a result, other tools, techniques, and partners that should be explored.\n\n \n\nTeam Cymru's intelligence and Recorded Future's analysis have revealed two separate realities.\n\n \n\nFirst, \u201cdespite the sanctions and massive international pressure, North Korea's leaders are not isolated from the outside world. They are active and engaged participants in the contemporary internet society and economy; meaning that attempts to shut North Korean leadership off from the global economy have largely failed.\u201d\n\n \n\nSecond, \u201cnew tools that do not focus on Pyongyang and territorial North Korea are needed to achieve a lasting negative impact on the current Kim regime. The researchers have identified other nations with which the West could partner and alternate tools and techniques that could be utilised to apply asymmetric pressure on North Korea. Partnering with nations such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, or others identified above, would enable the US and other Western nations to circumvent uncooperative partners in China and Russia and exert pressure on the broad North Korean operational diaspora, which, because of the regime's dependency, would likely impose larger real costs on leadership.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Tick threat group linked to multiple malware families", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/tick-threat-group-linked-to-multiple-malware-families/article/677249/", "title": "Tick threat group linked to multiple malware families", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "July 25, 2017", "body": "The Tick hacking group known infecting Japanese and South Korean targets with its malicious\u00a0backdoor \"Daserf\" has been linked to other campaigns leveraging an eclectic assortment of malware, including two additional backdoors, two remote access trojans and a downloader.\n\nAccording to a Monday\u00a0blog post\u00a0from\u00a0Palo Alto Networks'\u00a0Unit 42 threat research team, Tick's Daserf malware (aka Muirim, Nioupalewas) has been observed sharing infrastructure with the backdoors Invader and Minzen, the trojans\u00a0Gh0st RAT\u00a0and\u00a09002 RAT, and the downloader HomamDownloader.\n\nMoreover, at least some of these malware weapons were used to attack a high-profile target based in Japan over the last three years, Palo Alto senior threat communications manager Christopher Budd\u00a0confirmed with SC Media via email.\n\nOne of the most recent findings linking Daserf\u00a0to another malware took place in July 2016, when Unit 42 identified a compromised Japanese website whose web server was hosting both a Daserf variant and the modular malware Minzen, aka XXMM, Wali, or ShadowWali. (The company operating this website is different from the aforementioned Japanese organization that Tick has targeted for three years.) \"The attackers' playbook is to compromise external websites and use them as part of their attacks against organizations,\" said Budd to SC Media.\n\nMinzen typically leverages compromised web servers in Japan and the South Korea, Palo Alto reported, and some of its samples are known to install a backdoor module called NamelessHdoor, which opens a TCP port in order to receive commands from a remote attacker.\n\nAdditional research turned up older links between malware families as well. For instance, Palo Alto determined that Daserf \u00a0shared command-and-control infrastructure with both 9002 RAT (used in targeted attacks) and Invader (which logs keystrokes and mouse movement, and captures screenshots) between July 2012 and April 2013.\n\nDaserf shared not just infrastructure, but also cipher code with a custom variant of Gh0st RAT spyware that Unit 42 researchers observed. The shared code consisted of\u00a0substitution ciphers used for hiding strings.\n\nFinally, Palo Alto reported that Daserf has also shared malicious servers HomamDownloader, a malware that theTick group has spread via spear phishing campaigns. For instance, an early 2014 campaign featured spear phishing emails featuring a Happy New Year message on January 1, while asking the recipient to rename the attached file's extension before opening it with a specific password.\n\n\"Tick was spotted last year, but they are actively and silently attacking various organizations in South Korea and Japan for a number of years,\" warned Unit 42 cyber threat intelligence analyst\u00a0Kaoru Hayashi, who authored the blog post. Despite this additional intelligence on the threat group,\u00a0Hayashi added that \"it is likely there is much that still remains uncovered.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "600+ samples of Spring Dragon APT malware spotted", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/spring-dragon-targeting-high-profile-entities-around-south-china-sea/article/677106/", "title": "600+ samples of Spring Dragon APT malware spotted", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "July 24, 2017", "body": "The Chinese speaking ATP group Spring Dragon, a.k.a., LotusBlossom, has increased attacks against high-profile organizations around the South China Sea.\n\nKaspersky researchers managed to collect more than 600 samples of malware from the group suggesting they are operating on a massive scale. \n\nThe group is known for using spearphishing and watering hole techniques to target governmental organizations and political parties, educational institutions, as well as companies from the telecommunications sector, according to a July 24 blog post. \n\nResearchers said the threat actors behind the campaigns have been developing and updating their range of tools, which consists of various backdoor modules with unique characteristics and functionalities, throughout the years.\n\nThe threat actors own a large C2 infrastructure which comprises more than 200 unique IP addresses and C2 domains and all the backdoor modules in the APT's toolset are capable of downloading more files onto the victim's machine, uploading files to the attacker's servers, and also executing any executable file or any command on the victim's machine, researchers said.\n\n\"The main tools in the attackers' toolset are backdoor modules, with a customized set of command and control servers and also customized file names, service names and description for each sample,\" Kaspersky\u00a0Senior Security Researcher\u00a0Noushin Shabab told SC Media \"This means that each malware sample has different detection characteristics in terms of IOCs.

Thankfully, it appears that the targets in question have taken significant steps to isolate their ICS/SCADA environments from their general computing infrastructure, which would make a remote attack on the stations themselves significantly more difficult for a well-funded attacker.\"\n\n\"The notion that there may be nation-state or rogue actors who have been resident in the networks of nuclear facilities, electrical grids, and dams isn't far-fetched,\" said Ken Spinner, VP of field engineering at Varonis Systems.\u00a0\"Many of these infrastructure providers are relying on outdated security systems with limited detection capabilities.

China had attempted to hack both the Obama and McCain campaigns in 2008 and the same happened in 2012. He expected the possibility, that similar groups would try again.\n\n\u201cIf you pulled me aside in 2015,\u201d \u00a0said Mook, \u201cI would have said that its very likely they'll get in there. But what we didn't understand is that this didn't necessarily just need to be espionage.\u201d\n\nWhat separated this from earlier attempts was what they did with that information. Previous attempts were likely espionage operations. This was information warfare. \n\n\u201cWhen we heard it was the Russians\u201d, added Mook, \u201cwe realised this could be something a lot worse.\u201d\n\nBoth the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign's chairman, John Podesta were subject to separate breaches. The emails were then leaked through Wikileaks and spread heavily throughout coverage of the campaign. \n\n\u201cI think that concept was so wild to people that it was largely brushed back\u201d, said Mook. When he went to the Democratic convention, \u201cit was totally treated as spin, that it was a deflection from what really mattered, which was the emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn retrospect we weren't a good messenger because people thought we were spinning,\u201d\n\nIn the longer run, the world did take notice. Voting publics in several European elections the next year were highly cognisant of that possibility. \u201cFrance is a good example to tee off of\u201d, said Mook. While there were attempts at foreign influence in France's recent election, you also had a media blackout which mitigated false, or embarrassing information proliferating. Second, \"social media platforms, particularly facebook, were very aggressive about pulling down malicious sites.\" Thirdly, added Mook, \"you had a non-military, non-law enforcement governmental body that was actively collaborating with the campaigns to harden their security and would help them in the event of a breach.\"\n\n\"We need to really study that in the United States,\" said Mook. Unfortunately, intelligence agencies will never be able to hand over the intelligence that campaigns need but, \"as campaigns we need to come together and better support ourselves.\" \n\nConversely social media and news media \u201cneed take a step back and in this environment, what are the new rules of the road?\" Journalists and social media companies restrict themselves from reporting on certain things, so why not documents stolen and publicised for political ends?\n\n\u201cThere is a soft underbelly to the digital space that I don't think we were really aware of\u201d, said Mook. He added that though he is not a national or cyber-security expert, he thinks this kind of threat will have to be taken account of at such critical democratic junctures as elections. \u201cRussia was so wildly successful that we have to expect that - North Korea, Iran - others will do this.\u201d\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Survey: Experts say 'fake news' changing UK's political landscape", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/survey-experts-say-fake-news-changing-uks-political-landscape/article/671009/", "title": "Survey: Experts say 'fake news' changing UK's political landscape", "author": "Max Metzger", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/max-metzger/author/3966/", "date": "June 26, 2017", "body": "An overwhelming majority of UK cyber-security experts believe the UK to have been politically manipulated by fake news.

Like past versions, the malware is being used primarily within Vietnam itself.\n\nIn a blog post\u00a0published on Thursday, Palo Alto's Unit 42 threat intelligence team reported that the this version has been active for more than a year, and was spotted in the wild as recently as early June 2017. It is not clear from the report exactly when this variant was first discovered.\n\nFeaturing low anti-virus detection rates, the backdoor is distributed via zip file, most likely through email attachments, Unit 42 reports. This file contains a directory with what appears to be a Microsoft Word document, but in actuality is an application bundle that conceals the trojan. This is a notable difference from other macOS malwares, including the previous version of the OceanLotus backdoor, which typically pose as application installers for programs like Adobe Flash.\n\nTo diminish suspicions, the new variant opens a decoy document, a trick that reportedly is much more common in Windows malware than in Mac malware, the report continues. Moreover, the lack of command-line utilities and suspicious strings helps conceal the malware's malicious purpose, while curtaining analysis.\n\n\"This shows a deep level of understanding of the macOS platform by the author of this backdoor, compared to other threat actors that will commonly copy and paste scripts from the Internet,\" wrote Palo Alto blog post authors and researcher engineers Erye Hernandez\u00a0and\u00a0Danny Tsechansky, adding that the strings are particularly hard to find because they are encoded using \"a combination of bit shifting and XOR operations with a variable key that depends on the length of the string that was encoded.\"\n\nAnother new addition is the malware's customized binary protocol for communicating with the command-and-control server. These communications take place via TCP port 443, which Palo Alto reports is \"unlikely to be blocked by traditional firewalls due to its use in HTTPS connections.\"\n\nEarlier this year, researchers from FireEye/Mandiant tied the OceanLotus group, also known as APT32, to various malicious campaigns, including the 2017 compromise of\u00a0a global consulting firm's Vietnamese offices, a 2016 malware attack on a hospitality developer with plans for expansion into Vietnam, and the 2016 targeting of Vietnamese and foreign-owned corporations operating in the fields of network security, technology infrastructure, banking and media.\n\nAlso this year, Cybereason blamed OceanLotus was the brains behind Operation Cobalt Kitty, a sophisticated spearphishing attack against an\u00a0an Asia-based corporation.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apple/topic/47233/", "topic_name": "Apple"}]}, {"news_name": "Russia pressures Western tech firms for security source code, many will comply", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/western-tech-firms-pressured-into-disclosing-security-source-code-to-russian-officials/article/670867/", "title": "Russia pressures Western tech firms for security source code, many will comply", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "June 23, 2017", "body": "Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) is demanding the security product source code from top Western tech firms including Cisco, IBM and SAP, and many of the firms say they are planning to comply.\n\nThe move come at a time when tensions are already high as more information about Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election comes to light.

Finally, this compromised flash drive infects the ultimate target when it is used on a closed network or air-gapped machine.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks, infected thumb drives use one of two Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities to execute malware: Older versions of Brutal Kangaroo leverage an exploit called EzCheese, while newer iterations use a \"similar, but yet known vulnerability.\" The tool suite's components consist of various components including Drifting Deadline, a thumbdrive infection tool; Shattered Assurance, a server tool responsible for automated infection of USB drives), Broken Promise, a post processor that evaluates collected information; and Shadow, the main persistence mechanism.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Mexican government used spyware for surveillance on activists, lawyers, journalists", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mexican-government-used-spyware-for-surveillance-on-activists-lawyers-journalists/article/669926/", "title": "Mexican government used spyware for surveillance on activists, lawyers, journalists", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "June 20, 2017", "body": "The Mexican government used spyware intended for surveillance of terrorists and criminals to spy to journalists, activists and human rights lawyers\n\nFederal agencies in Mexico purchased around $80 million of\u00a0Pegasus\u00a0software from the Israeli firm NSO Group since 2011 and \u00a0used it, in part, to target those dedicated to protecting human rights, including an academic responsible for writing legislation to thwart corruption, according to a report by Citizen Lab.\n\nThe group said that in February, working in conjunction with Mexican non-governmental organizations R3D and SocialTic, it previously detailed how links were sent to government food scientists, consumer advocates and health advocates apparently in an attempt to get them to install Pegasus on their phones.

If successfully implanted the malware can give a malicious actor the ability implement a Man-in-the-Middle attack allowing him to interact with or take control of the network it runs.\n\n\u201cCherryBlossom provides a means of monitoring the Internet activity of and performing software exploits on Targets [sic]of interest. In particular, CherryBlossom is focused on compromising wireless networking devices, such as wireless routers and access points (APs), to achieve these goals.,\u201d Wikileaks said.\n\nHome routers are particularly vulnerable because most are bought, installed and then never looked at again by the owner, Chris Hinkley, Armor's lead ethical hacker told SC Media.\n\n\"Most routers and WiFi access points are neglected so much by users that they are rarely ever patched and updated. In a large number of cases, the default login credentials are never changed. These facts alone make these devices quite vulnerable to attack,\" he said.\n\nThe malicious firmware update creates the following set up on the router. The router becomes a FlyTrap, capable of handling a variety of malicious tasks. The FlyTrap will beacon to its command and control server, dubbed CherryTree. The hacker will then use a browser based administration panel called CherryWeb to control monitor CherryTree's status and send along missions to perform.\n\nSome of these missions could include, WikiLeaks wrote, \u201cscan for\u00a0email addresses,\u00a0chat usernames,\u00a0MAC addresses\u00a0and\u00a0VoIP numbers\u00a0in passing network traffic to trigger additional actions, the copying of the full network traffic of a\u00a0Target, the redirection of a\u00a0Target's browser (e.g., to Windex for browser exploitation) or the proxying of a\u00a0Target's network connections.\u201d\n\nIn addition, FlyTrap\u00a0can setup VPN tunnels to a\u00a0CherryBlossom-owned VPN server to give an operator access to clients on the\u00a0Flytrap's WLAN/LAN for further exploitation.\"\n\nWhile Wikileaks did not leak the tools the CIA allegedly uses, the current state of router handling across the board allows the CIA and other malicious actors to potentially infiltrate networks in a way that is not much thought about,\" Hinkley said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacking/topic/47220/", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "DHS and FBI dish out details on North Korea's APT group Hidden Cobra", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/dhs-and-fbi-dish-out-details-on-north-koreas-apt-group-hidden-cobra/article/668601/", "title": "DHS and FBI dish out details on North Korea's APT group Hidden Cobra", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "June 14, 2017", "body": "The Department of Homeland Security and FBI on Tuesday jointly released a technical alert detailing IP addresses, infrastructure and tools used by Hidden Cobra, a North Korean advanced persistent threat group better known as the Lazarus Group.\n\nPublished by the US-CERT, the alert included .csv and .stix files containing IP addresses and various indicators of compromise corresponding to the APT's distributed denial of service (DDoS) botnet malware, known as DeltaCharlie. \u201cDHS and FBI recommend that network administrators review the IP addresses, file hashes, network signatures, and YARA rules provided, and add the IPs to their watchlist to determine whether malicious activity has been observed within their organization,\u201d the alert states.\n\nIn describing Hidden Cobra's tactics, the alert notes that the state-sponsored APT especially targets the U.S. and international media, aerospace, financial and critical infrastructure sectors with campaigns leveraging not only DDoS botnets, but also remote access tools, spyware, backdoors like Wild Positron/Duuzer and Hangman, and wiper malware such as Destover. Potential consequences of an attack include loss of data, operational disruption, financial losses, and a damaged reputation, the alert continues.\n\nTo help better understand and defend against this threat, the DHS and FBI are encouraging additional research on Hidden Cobra cyber activity. Moreover, the two agencies are recommending that organizations patch applications and operating systems; harden web applications and their host servers, take advantage of application whitelisting; restrict privileges, permissions and access controls; secure the log-in process; segment and segregate networks; implement input validation; use strong file reputation settings; and optimize firewall configurations.\n\nThe alert notes that Lazarus Group has been known to exploit vulnerabilities found in older, unsupported versions of Microsoft operating systems, as well as Hangul Word Processor, Adobe Flash Player, and Microsoft Silversight \u2013 which makes regular, timely patching especially important.\n\nSome malware analysts have recently reported on evidence potentially tying the WannaCry ransomware to the Lazarus Group, although other experts has emphasized that it is premature to attribute the attack to a particular group or nation. The APT has also been blamed for the Sony hack and the Bangladesh central bank cyber heist.\n\nFollowing the rapid spread of last month's WannaCry ransomware, and the suspicions that it may have originated from North Korea, the alert on the DeltaCharlie malware family from US-CERT, the FBI and the American Department of Homeland Security will do little to abate the public's fears around North Korea's growing cyber arsenal,\" said\u00a0Jan Zika, web threat lead at\u00a0Avast, in emailed comments. \"As with all malware risks, I'd recommend that people ensure all their software and apps are fully up to date with security patches, and their devices such as PCs, smartphones and routers\u00a0have the latest firmware and operating systems.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ddos/topic/47213/", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Sessions denies Russian collusion to undermine election", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/sessions-denies-russian-collusion-to-undermine-election/article/668308/", "title": "Sessions denies Russian collusion to undermine election", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "June 13, 2017", "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions called allegations of him colluding with Russian officials to undermine the election an \u201cappalling and detestable lie,\u201d during a Tuesday Senate hearing.\n\nSessions also said it appears that the intelligence community has come to the consensus that Russia did attempt to influence the election, but that most of his knowledge of this came from the media.\n\n\u201cI have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States,\u201d Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nSessions went on to say that he recused himself from any investigations into Russian interference into the 2016 U.S. presidential election in March because he felt it was in line with Department of Justice policy to prevent a potential conflict of interest since he was a key foreign policy adviser in the campaign.\n\nSessions also told the committee that former FBI Director James Comey did speak with him and his chief of staff concerning proper communications protocol with the White House and with President Donald Trump; however, Sessions said Comey didn't provide him with any of the substance of his private communication with the president.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}]}]}]
