Opponents have slapped at the current House bill for allowing warrantless surveillance.\n\n\u201cWe strongly oppose this legislation,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, ACLU legislative counsel, said in a\u00a0statement earlier in the week. \u201cThis bill is not reform by any stretch of the imagination.

A White House statement released late Wednesday spurned the amendment and called for Congress to \"reject this amendment and preserve the useful role of FISA's Section 702 authority plays in protecting American lives,\"\u00a0according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\n\"This amendment would re-establish the walls between intelligence and law enforcement that our country knocked down following the attacks of\u00a09/11\u00a0in order to increase information sharing and improve our national security,\" said Sanders. \n\nTrump tweeted his seeming reservations about FISA after \u201cFox & Friends\u201d ran a piece on the upcoming House vote that had shown contributor Judge Andrew Napolitano, saying, \"Mr. President, this is not the way to go. Spying is valid to find the foreign agents among us.

John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said in a statement. \"While this bill contains some changes I did not feel were necessary, I recognize that it's the culmination of an extensive and transparent legislative process that included input from legislators all across the political spectrum and from the White House and Executive Branch alike.\"\n\nSaying that \"the tools we just reauthorized are critical for the safety of our homeland,\" Ratcliffe claimed \"they have successfully stopped terrorists like Hajji Iman and thwarted planned attacks like the 2009 attempted New York City Subway bombing.\"\n\nHe urged the Senate \"not to play politics with national security and to send this bill to the president's desk as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU said the bill expands the administration's surveillance authority. \u201cThe House voted today to give President Trump and his administration more spying powers,\" said Singh Giuliani. \"The government will use this bill to continue warrantless intrusions into Americans' private emails, text messages, and other communications.\"\n\nShe noted that \u201cno president should have this power,\" particularly the Trump administration, which\u00a0\"has labeled individuals as threats based merely on their religion, nationality, or viewpoints.\"\u00a0\n\nContending that \u201cmass government surveillance makes all of us less safe\u201d and a reauthorization of \u201cineffective and illegal spying powers,\u201d Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said the act is \u201ca nightmare for all those who believe in basic liberty, due process, and freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nSingh Giuliani called on the Senate to \"reject this bill and rein in government surveillance powers to bring Section 702 in line with the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAnd Greer echoed the sentiment, calling for \"the Senate to listen to security experts, civil liberties advocates, and the majority of voters from both parties, and vote to stop these illegal and dangerous government spying programs.\u201d\n\nBut the Senate took its first steps Thursday toward passing the bill and will likely vote on it next week.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Mole on Trump team fed FBI info, Steele worried about political influence on FBI, Fusion GPS head says", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mole-on-trump-team-fed-fbi-info-steele-worried-about-political-influence-on-fbi-fusion-gps-head-says/article/735967/", "title": "Mole on Trump team fed FBI info, Steele worried about political influence on FBI, Fusion GPS head says", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "January 09, 2018", "body": "A \u201cwalk-in\u201d whistleblower inside the Trump campaign fed information to the FBI, according testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Glenn Simpson, CEO of Fusion GPS, the firm that hired former British spy Christopher Steele, author of the controversial Trump dossier, to conduct oppositional research on the then presidential candidate.\u00a0\n\nSteele, allegedly concerned that his research was uncovering unsavory and illegal activities involving foreign interests, reported his findings to the FBI.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy understanding was that they believed Chris at this point \u2014 that they believed Chris might be credible because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization,\u201d Simpson told the committee, according to a transcript of his testimony released by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who defied GOP lawmakers to make the testimony public.\u00a0\n\nThe dossier, containing sometimes salacious allegations about Trump, became a flashpoint for his critics who said the findings pointed to inappropriate contact between members of the campaign and Russian operatives and his supporters who have questioned the veracity of the file because it was funded as oppositional research by Hillary Clinton's campaign.\u00a0\n\nMore recently Steele has come under fire for his role in creating the dossier with Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee member Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sending the Justice Department a recommendation to open a criminal investigation of Steele and any potential bias against the president.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI want a special counsel to look not only at how Mr. Steele conducted himself, what the FBI did with the dossier,\u201d Graham said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.

Mueller, revealed to Australian Alexander Downer that Russia had damaging information on Trump opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nAfter WikiLeaks began leaking emails pilfered from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and others affiliated with Clinton, Australia officials reported Papadopoulos's revelations to U.S. intelligence, prompting the FBI to open a probe into Russian meddling into the U.S. presidential election.\u00a0\n\nAnd Simpson said in his testimony that Steele \u201csevered his relationship with the FBI\u201d after becoming concerned \u201cthat the FBI was being manipulated for political ends by the Trump people and that we didn't really understand what was going on.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "FTC fines VTech toy firm over data breach", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vtech-fined-650000-as-part-of-a-settlement-for-violating-a-us-childrens-privacy-law/article/735932/", "title": "FTC fines VTech toy firm over data breach", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "January 09, 2018", "body": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined toy firm VTech $650,000 as part of a settlement for violating a U.S. children's privacy laws.\n\nThe FTC alleged the toy company violated (COPPA) Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule by collecting personal information from hundreds of thousands of children without providing direct notice, without obtaining their parent's consent, and failing to take reasonable steps to secure the data it collected.\n\nVTech allegedly collected personal information from parents on its Learning Lodge Navigator online platform and through a now-defunct web-based platform called Planet VTech.

India started collecting the information into a centralized government database called Aadhaar to create a voluntary identity system in 2010.\n\nThe publication was also able to purchase software\u201d that could enable a user to print Aadhaar cards after entering the Aadhaar number of any individual.\n\nLast November UIDAI, the\u00a0Unique Identification Authority of India, asserted the database is safe and secure and that no leak or breach had occurred. When the Tribune contacted the government agency about the breach, officials expressed shock and admitted it seemed to be a major national security breach before consulting UIDAI technical consultants.\n\nThe Tribune estimates that a racket may have started around six months ago when anonymous groups were created on WhatsApp to target more than 300,000 village-level enterprise (VLE) operators hired by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (ME&IT) under the Common Service Centres Scheme (CSCS) across India. The operators would have had access to the UIDAI data and any compromised operators would have provided a potential entry point for the breach.\n\nMore than 100,000 village-level enterprise operators are suspected to have gained illegal access to UIDAI data to provide \u201cAadhaar services\u201d to common people for a charge, including the printing of Aadhaar cards, the publication said.\n\nThe database was also vulnerable as anyone can access or become admins of the official Aadhaar database\u00a0as long as they are invited by someone who is already an admin, according to The Quint.\n\nThe Tribune's report was dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d by India's Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party.

By and large, these various services are reportedly using vulnerable tracking location software developed and licensed by ThinkRace, an Indian GPS tracker manufacturer, which also operates five of the affected services.\n\nAs of Jan. 2, four of the impacted websites have been confirmed fixed \u2013 https://www.one2trackgps.com (aka One2Track), http://kiddo-track.com, http://www.amber360.com, and http://tr.3g-elec.com (in this case, the subdomain was removed). Another 15 no longer appear vulnerable to the researchers' proof-of-concept exploit code, although it cannot be conclusively affirmed that they have been permanently patched.\n\nThe report states that ThinkRace also agreed to repair their own five affected websites by Jan. 2; however, the researchers claim the fixes so far are \u201cincomplete.\u201d SC Media has reached out to ThinkRace for comment and will update the story upon receiving a response.\n\nStykas and Gruhn's work updates and expands upon\u00a0previous research\u00a0conducted by fellow security researcher Lachlan Temple, aka @skoooch, who found similar or possibly identical issues back in 2015. According to the latest report as well as two accompanying technical advisories, the vulnerabilities, discovered in November, can be divided into two subsets.\n\nOne subset is a\u00a0series of authorization bypasses\u00a0in gpsui.net, a website that facilitates the master server for at least 615,000 GSM and GPS location tracking devices. When exploited, this flaw enables attackers to escalate their privileges until they can force disclosure of all location tracking information, as well as send commands to and take control of all connected devices.\n\nThe other subset of vulnerabilities consists of various\u00a0information disclosures as well as exposed APIs\u00a0in multiple websites that act as the web control panel server for roughly 6.3 million devices, comprised of an estimated 367 different product models. The report states that these coding errors can allow unauthenticated actors to \u201ctake full control of the exposed API features to control and manage the registered GPS tracking devices,\u201d as well as \u201cextract the locations as well as associated phone numbers (if set) and device model type[s] from the user database via the exposed API on each affected website.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, attackers may also be able to access images and audio recordings uploaded by devices, as well as on-board diagnostics features on devices used by vehicles.\n\nStykas and Gruhn say they tried to give notified vendors sufficient time to fix the vulnerabilities before public disclosure, but also felt the need to come forward so that device owners could start to protect themselves, especially against the threat of having their live locations identified by malicious actors.\n\nThe researchers recommend that consumers stop using any location-tracking device that relies on an unpatched service, and remove as much data as possible from these vulnerable websites. Users are also advised to change their passwords for their device's online service, even if the site has been adequately patched.\n\nMark James, security specialist at ESET, told SC Media UK that data such as GPS location could enable bad actors to tailor an attack, both digital or physical, with optimum effectiveness. \u201cWith this type of information, it shows a very clear footprint of your every move \u2013 something that, if exploited, could be the difference between a failed or successful attack,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn attacker with access to the data could use this information to determine your whereabouts and tailor a specific attack either with you, or without you present, depending on the attack vector.\u201d\n\nIn emailed comments, Lamar Bailey, director of security research and development at Tripwire, said that this report demonstrates how many small IoT device manufacturers and services providers \u201care very small and do not have adequate security practices, training, or staff to setup secure product and services, or they are more interested in getting products to market instead of spending the time and money to make sure the products are secure.\u00a0Think of them like a new bank that just popped up and they are giving 10 percent interest on savings accounts to gain customers, but the bank branches are built like tents with no vault or security guards.\u201d\n\nMoreover, added Bailey, many of these companies have no establish means for researchers to easily report security concerns or disclose vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "State Dept. releases Abedin emails found on Weiner laptop", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/state-dept-releases-abedin-emails-found-on-weiner-laptop/article/733757/", "title": "State Dept. releases Abedin emails found on Weiner laptop", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "December 30, 2017", "body": "But Comey defended his decision, saying that when faced with what he saw as two choices \u2013 speak or conceal \u2013 speaking out was the least damaging. \u201cLordy that would be really bad,\u201d Comey recalled thinking when considering alerting Congress so close to an election that additional emails had been found on Weiner's computer.

The letter, which prompted Judge\u00a0William\u00a0Alsup to delay the case, was subsequently made public last Friday in a court filing, although some information has been redacted.\n\nThe letter was written by an attorney on behalf of a Richard Jacobs, Uber's manager of global intelligence from March 2016 through February 2017, who had sued the company for unlawful termination. The document alleges that Jacobs \u201cwas aware of many instances where computer hacking tactics were deployed to obtain trade secrets and to infiltrate closed social media groups.\u201d\n\nJacobs alleges in the letter that Uber accessed an unnamed competitor's protected computer database containing driver employee information, for the purpose of luring these drivers to Uber instead. Such an act violates the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the document asserts.

If ISPs are no longer required to pass traffic unaltered, they can simply stop end-to-end encryption entirely.\u201d\n\nErlin explained that without net neutrality security could easily become a premium service. \u201cWhy wouldn't an ISP charge businesses and individuals more for supporting encrypted traffic?\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be the first impact, but losing net\u00a0neutrality\u00a0opens up the possibility of ISPs mining previously encrypted traffic for valuable data.\u201d\n\nThe commission, which said in a statement that it \u201cis returning to the traditional light-touch framework that was in place until 2015,\u201d noted that it also had \u201cadopted robust transparency requirements that will empower consumers as well as facilitate effective government oversight of broadband providers' conduct.\u201d \u00a0The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will once again have the jurisdiction \u201cto act when broadband providers engage in anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive acts or practices,\u201d the FCC said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut critics viewed the move as political and expressed skepticism that promises of transparency and oversight can be met. Calling the FCC's move \u201ca giant step backwards for the greater internet community,\u201d Michael Patterson, CEO of Plixer, said it was \u201ca prime example of lobbyists having too much power in Congress and U.S. representatives not understanding the ramifications that these decisions can lead to.\u201d\n\nPatterson said most consumers only have one viable option for internet access \u2013 their broadband provider. \u201cCreating choice and competition, as the FCC has said this will do, requires there to be consumer options,\u201d he said. \u201cService providers now have the ability to take an a la carte approach to service delivery, which will result in higher consumer cost.\u201d\n\nNoting that \u201csince the end of the dial-up era, the FCC has enforced network\u00a0neutrality\u00a0principles and helped create the internet as we know it,\u201d Jay Stanley, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) senior policy analyst, called the FCC action \u201cmisguided\u201d and said it \u201crepresents a radical departure that risks erosion of the biggest free speech platform the world has ever known.\u201d\n\nBut Comcast Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer David L. Cohen rejected the notion that net neutrality was coming to an end with the commission's vote. Commending Pai and the other two Republican commissioners for \"returning to a regulatory environment that allowed the Internet to thrive for decades by eliminating burdensome Title II regulations and opening the door for increased investment and digital innovation,\" Cohen said, \"today's action does not mark the \u2018end of the Internet as we know it;' rather it heralds in a new era of light regulation\" of benefit to consumers.\n\nIn the wake of that discovery, 28 senators in a letter called on Pai to delay its vote on repealing net neutrality and investigate several unusual issues centered on the net neutrality docket's public comment record. And 18 state attorneys general led by New York AG Eric Schneiderman, also urged the FCC to hold off on its vote. But Pai pressed on, drawing the ire of critics.\n\n\u201cWhy did @FCC and @AjitPaiFCC rush this vote on #NetNeutrality despite known fraud & criminal activity in the public process?\u201d tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. \u201cI look forward to Chairman Pai one day testifying under oath to Congress as to why he ignored 18 Attorneys General.

United States\u00a0seeks to challenge what lawyers representing defendant Timothy Carpenter\u00a0said\u00a0was government overreach. Phone records \u2013 which covered 127 days and exposed 12,898 data location points \u2013 helped convict Carpenter, who then\u00a0appealed\u00a0to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court decision and opined that a warrant was not needed under the\u00a0Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe high court has grappled with similar questions of how the digital era is reshaping legal protections. \"More fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties,\u201d Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurred in\u00a0United States v. Jones, a case in which law enforcement put a GPS tracker on a suspect's vehicle without first obtaining a warrant \u2013\u00a0an act the court deemed a search under the Fourth Amendment. \u201cThis approach is ill-suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"\n\nNoting the rise in the types of electronic surveillance, Carpenter's attorney Harold Gurewitz, called for the Supreme Court to clarify Fourth Amendment protections for all. \u201cThe mere fact that we carry cellphones should not mean that our every location is trackable by the government at will,\u201d said Gurewitz.\n\nIndeed, \u201ccell phones have become part of the basic social infrastructure,\u201d vital to public safety, job hunting, scheduling work, accessing information and socializing on the internet, Julia Ticona, postdoctoral scholar at the Data & Society Research Institute, told reporters, voicing concern that low income, more vulnerable people who rely heavily on smartphones for internet access might be more adversely affected by government overreach.\n\n\u201cSearching people's phones without a warrant would go against the Fourth Amendment that protects from unreasonable searches,\u201d said Marty P. Kamden, CMO of NordVPN. \u201cCitizens' right to privacy is being eroded in many different forms, and this could only mean that with the disappearance of privacy, everyone will become more vulnerable to their private information, address and location falling into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nIt is that kind of privacy protection that the ACLU is seeking from the Court's decision.\n\nNoting that the organization is asking the court to \u201ccraft a rule to provide protection in the digital age and the basis to determine other data that should be protected,\u201d Wessler said the ACLU wants clarity that \u201cthe third party doctrine isn't an on/off switch. You don't turn off Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nThe rule we're asking for is quite narrow,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe ACLU also has taken issue with the length of the time period during which authorities accessed Carpenter's data, saying 127 days was too long. In a \u201cnormal investigation,\u201d law enforcement interviews witnesses at the scene of a crime and follow up. \u201cNever before have they had the reach that they have here\u201d via technology, said Wessler. \u201cIf government wants to draw a bright line, we say 24 hours\u201d is a sufficient time period to access location data related to a crime. \u201cIt's important there should be some limits so we can provide guidance to the public,\u201d he said.\n\nNordVPN's Kamden encouraged wireless carriers \u201cto be more proactive in voicing their support for the privacy of their customers,\u201d saying that it seems \u201cISPs are actively participating in the disappearance of customers' privacy rights.\u201d\n\nTech companies Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Apple and Verizon are among those filing an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0with the court, saying \u201cFourth Amendment doctrine must adapt to the changing realities of the digital era\u201d and advocating for \u201cconsideration of reasonable expectations of privacy in the digital age.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "Is Barton victim of revenge porn?", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/is-barton-victim-of-revenge-porn/article/709479/", "title": "Is Barton victim of revenge porn?", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 24, 2017", "body": "\u201cLegally speaking, as far as I'm concerned, Congressman Barton is a victim,\u201d Washington, D.C. lawyer Mark Zaid told the Huffington Post Thursday.\n\nThe photo as well as revealing texts and videos were sent to a woman with whom Barton had a consensual relationship.

And assuming the regulator found them in breach of the regulations, they would have to pay a fine of four percent of global annual turnover, or 20 million Euros, whichever is higher,\u201d said Dean Armstrong QC, cyber law barrister at Setfords Solicitors. \u201cAs Uber hasn't released its figures, we can't speculate as to the potential final cost of the fine, but it is fair to say the regulator would come down hard, and under the regulations it would likely be in the tens of millions.\u201d\n\nBut the company will likely feel the biggest impact on \u201creputation, which although harder to quantify than a fine could far outstrip any penalty handed to them by a regulator,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cThe U.K. and Europe are adopting stricter rules on personal data protection for precisely this kind of event.\"\n\nAttackers lifted a set of login credentials from a GitHub coding site that Uber software engineers used, then accessed an infrastructure account where computing tasks are handled, only to find a treasure trove of archived driver and rider data. \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe hack wasn't sophisticated \u2013 the digital thieves broke into the accounts of two Uber engineers on Github, where they found the passwords to some online data storage that contained the personal info, according to the report,\u201d said Imperva CTO Terry Ray.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be a prime example of good intentions gone bad. Using an online collaboration and coding platform isn't necessarily wrong, and it isn't clear if getting your accounts hacked on these platforms is even uncommon,\u201d said Ray, who flagged as problematic the use of live production data \u201cin an online platform where credentials were accessible in Github. \u201cSadly, it's all too common that developers are allowed to copy live production data for use in development, testing and QA. This data is almost never monitored or secured, and as we can see here, it is often stored in various locations and is often easily accessed by nefarious actors.\u201d\n\nContending that Uber \u201cplayed a risky game\u201d by concealing the incident and paying the hackers $100,000 to delete the purloined data, which will likely embolden bad actors to steal personal information from other organizations, Armstrong said GDPR's eminent arrival pointed to \u201ca huge shift in thinking towards this issue.\u201d \n\nNow Uber is left \u201cto navigate a labyrinth of financial and state breach notification laws given a user base spanning the globe,\u201d particularly GDPR, said Mark Sangster, vice president and industry security strategist at eSentire.\n\nSitting on the breach for a year could cause untold damage for the company, its employees and customers. \u201cWhile comedians and senators are finding out that they can't keep sexual harassment under wraps, companies are learning that they can't bury the news when they get hacked,\u201d said Jeff Williams, CTO and cofounder of Contrast Security.\u00a0\u201cIn this case, Uber was legally required to disclose this breach, and I'm sure there will be repercussions.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWilliams called the breach likely \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d While some incidents \u201cdon't legally require disclosure,\u201d they \u201cwould outrage consumers if they knew,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAnd most organizations are sitting on mountains of unfixed vulnerabilities that don't require disclosure. Another outrage.\u201d \u00a0\n\nSangster finds Uber's response baffling, after a series of mega-breaches that rocked organizations should have been wake-up calls. \u201cIt's fascinating that even in light of the mega-breaches of 2016 and 2017, companies consider non or delayed breach disclosure as an option,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of records compromised in the Uber hack far exceeds the entire population of Canada. We're not talking small beans, here.\u201d\n\nMaintaining that \u201ccompanies today have no excuse when it comes to cybersecurity controls,\u201d since they have an abundance of tools and guidelines to choose from, Sangster said, \u201cin Uber's case, you have a company already enduring a PR firestorm. Mix in a significant one-year-old, non-disclosed breach, and that storm suddenly becomes a hurricane.\u201d\n\nSangster fully expects that the Uber breach \u201cwill set new precedents when it comes to regulatory compliance and disclosure mandates.\u201d\n\nIndeed, after the GDPR takes effect in May, \u201c\u2018doing an Uber' will be unacceptabl,e so organizations need to be working overtime now to get their technology, people and processes ready for compliance,\u201d said Simon Townsend, chief technologist, EMEA, for Ivanti\u00a0and an expert in GDPR best practices.\n\n\n\nThe decisions of the ride-sharing company to delay notification and pay hackers not only stands to sully Uber, but security organizations on whole. \u201cWhile I suspect most will rest the blame squarely on Uber as a corporation and its well-known lack of leadership, it's the choices made by the Chief Security Officer [Joe Sullivan] and one of his deputies that are the most shocking part of this data breach,\u201d said AsTech Chief Security Strategist Nathan Wenzler, who said that legitimate security professionals know better.\n\n\u201cThe community at large is built upon integrity in all matters,\u201d said Wenzler. \u201cWhen you act as the front line of defense for an organization, it is imperative that your security team operates in the most honest and forthright manner possible.\u201d\n\nMark Orlando, CTO for cyber services at Raytheon, noted that \u201cany time companies suffer a large data breach, they\u00a0run the risk of making things worse, both for their customers and for the larger community.\u201d\n\nSince \u201chackers talk to each other,\u201d Uber in its silence \u201chas empowered them for a year, where they could have brought this into the light, raised public awareness of the threat and made some good come of this,\u201d said Orlando. \u201cInstead, the company gave its attackers exactly what they wanted \u2013 a lot of money, and a reason to try this again and again.\u201d\u200b\n\nThe morality of paying the hackers might be up for debate, but \u201cthe lack of responsible disclosure in reporting the incident to regulators is something every security professional should consider to be an unforgivable crime,\u201d Wenzler said. \u201cWe're here to protect people's identities and critical data, and when the worst happens, we must do all we can to mitigate the damage; inform people that their data may be compromised, so they can be more aware and vigilant of misuse; and ultimately, help educate them on what they can do to protect themselves.\u201d \n\nUber must account for its actions, the pros said. \u201cSome of the questions that should be answered include: Why did engineers have access to 57 million records of personally identifiable information? Did they go through an approval workflow to move that data online? Did Uber security have any monitoring in place to alert them when such vast amounts of data were accessed?,\u201d said Ray. \u201cControls to alert on suspicious data access do exist, but my guess is that they were not used, which is all too typical in today's enterprises.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Uber is not alone in security foibles and its massive breach underscores the need for all organizations to be accountable and step up their security. \u201cWhen a company places data in the public cloud, they are ultimately responsible for the security of that data. Reminiscent of when, in the movie The Blues Brothers, John Belushi yelled at Carrie Fisher, \u2018It wasn't my fault,' it was in fact very much his fault,\u201d explained Bob Noel, director of strategic relationships and marketing for Plixer. \u201cCompanies can no longer brush off responsibility for the loss of personally identifiable information (PII)\u201d and should \u201cbegin to require documentation providing best practice security controls are in place\u201d from their third-party cloud providers. \u00a0\n\n\u201cUntil businesses stop saying that they take security seriously and actually start doing it, we will continue to see the list of breaches grow,\u201d said Wayne Reynolds, vice president of security at Armor, noting the low impact and ease of implementing basic blocking and tackling of security controls. \u201cThreat actors are fully aware that development/engineering environments typically have the weakest security within a business. These malicious actors will continue to target these areas until we response by stepping up the game and start securing them as production assets.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "Senators introduces USA Liberty Act of 2017", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/senators-introduces-usa-liberty-act-of-2017/article/708346/", "title": "Senators introduces USA Liberty Act of 2017", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 17, 2017", "body": "A bill designed to curb warrantless government surveillance as introduced in the Senate today is a marked improvement over a version that debuted in the House earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said Friday. \n\nThe USA Liberty Act of 2017 (S. 2158), which takes aim at the overreach that rights groups have said the government justified under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), was ushered in by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.\n\n\u201cThis bill is a dramatic improvement over the House version of this legislation. For years, the NSA, CIA, and FBI have engaged in illegal \u2018backdoor' searches, deliberately looking for and accessing Americans' private information collected under Section 702 without a warrant,\u201d ACLU Legislative Counsel Neema Singh Guliani said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThese searches are unconstitutional, inconsistent with Section 702 itself, and open the door to abusive spying focused on government critics, minorities, or even journalists.\u201d\n\nNoting that the proposed legislation \u201cdoes not address all constitutional concerns with Section 702, it represents an important step forward from the dismal status quo,\u201d she said. \u201cThis bill would help to rein in these illegal searches by requiring the government to get a warrant when they deliberately search for and then subsequently seek to view Americans' private communications.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU was similarly supportive of a bill proposed in the House in late-October by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that sought to extend\u00a0Section 702\u00a0of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for another four years but with critical reforms aimed at curbing government surveillance.\n\nThat proposed legislation would require government to obtain a warrant to search for communications of people in the United States and alert targets when the information collected under Section 702 is being used against them. It would also require government authorities to report on Section 702 use to set the stage for its use in the future.\n\n\u201cImportantly, it would close the so-called \u2018backdoor search loophole' that allows the government to search Section 702 data for information about individuals in the U.S. without a warrant,\u201d Singh Guliani said in a\u00a0statement then, calling the bill a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d in protecting the constitutional rights of Americans. \u201cIt would also put a stop to the illegal practice of collecting communications that are not to or from a surveillance target.\u201d\n\nBut a coalition of rights organizations, including the ACLU, told the House Judiciary Committee in mid-October that it would not support its proposed version of the USA Liberty Act.\n\nIn a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the committee, the coalition of more than 40 organizations, including the NAACP and the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the bill needed to be bolstered to address concerns over the backdoor search loophole.\n\n\u201cThe bill's most glaring deficiency is that it does not require a warrant to access content in cases where the primary purpose is to return foreign intelligence,\u201d the group wrote, noting that \u201cunder this exception, the government would have free rein to search and access the content of religious organizations and civil society groups, Congressional staff, and other innocent Americans without a warrant simply if it asserted that the primary purpose was to gather information related to the policies of a foreign country.\u201d\n\nThe coalition also took issue with the broad language of the bill, which it said \u201cleaves room for the government to conduct queries and access content for law enforcement purposes without a warrant.\u201d\n\nThe committee gave a thumbs up to its version of the bill anyway in early November.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "Phishing kits meet $2,100 second hand iPhones on black market, study", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime-meets-physical-crime-on-the-stolen-phone-black-market/article/707392/", "title": "Phishing kits meet $2,100 second hand iPhones on black market, study ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "November 14, 2017", "body": "As Americans begin to worry more\u00a0about cybercrime than the conventional kind, researchers warn users to remain cautious of both, as stolen iPhones are so valuable in criminal circles that they can go for as much as $2,100 in some countries.\u00a0\n\nWhile a Gallup\u00a0study found more Americans worry about hackers stealing their personal information and identity theft than having their vehicle stolen, new research by Trend Micro suggests Americans may want to reprioritize their fears as cybercriminals have found a new use for swiped iPhones.\n\nHowever, the bad guys are not interested in just obtaining an overpriced smartphone, but instead have in place an elaborate scam that will have the phone's former owner willingly giving up all the information needed to not only unlock the phone, but give the criminals access to their iCloud account.\n\nLast year alone 23,000 phones were stolen from the Miami International Airport and the demand for these devices is staggering with even long out of date stolen iPhones going for as much as $2,100 in Eastern European countries, according to a Nov 14 report. At retail Apple's most expensive phone costs $1,149 for the flagship iPhone X with 256 GB of storage in the U.S. to put the markups in perspective. \n\nCybercriminals are stealing the phones, waiting for victims to activate the Find My iPhone services and then sending a phishing email designed to spoof an Apple notification prompting the victim to log in to their iCloud accounts. The thieves then use this information to log into the victim's account and unlock the stolen device so that it can be reused and resold. \n\nResearchers found that thieves will often contract with third-party phishing services to unlock the devices and that they were using tools including MagicApp, Applekit, and Find My iPhone (FMI.php) framework to automate iCloud unlocks.\n\nMany of the providers also offer additional resale services and rent out servers for sending phishing messages. The phishing kits are actively advertised on social media and include full tutorials on how to use them. \n\nSome of the services offer the attackers email notifications which included the victim's IP, HTTP referral, browser user-agent and other information. Kits were also spotted with anti-crawler and AV scanner capabilities.\n\nTo combat these threats, the researchers said users should always apply best practices when securing their mobile devices, enable two factor authentication on iCloud accounts, and set up or enable the device's internal security features.\n\nUsers should also frequently back up their data to mitigate the impact of a device loss and report device's loss or theft to your carrier to deter fraudsters from reusing it. To combat phishing threats, researchers recommend users beware of unsolicited emails requesting iCloud and Apple ID credentials.\n\nThose purchasing second hands phones should also do their due diligence. \n\n\u201cDo your research: if purchasing a secondhand device, verify with the vendor or carrier that they're not blacklisted,\u201d researchers said in the report. \u201cThe Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) created a\u00a0website\u00a0that verifies the IMEI to help customers and law enforcement check if an iPhone has been blacklisted or stolen.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "FISA court allows NSA surveillance transparency lawsuit to continue", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/in-historic-decision-fisa-court-allows-nsa-surveillance-transparency-lawsuit-to-continue/article/707204/", "title": "In historic decision, FISA court allows NSA surveillance transparency lawsuit to continue", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "November 14, 2017", "body": "In a historic en banc decision, the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled last week that there is sufficient standing\u00a0to proceed with a lawsuit that could require the court to publicly disclose the secret justifications behind the NSA's electronic surveillance program that was exposed by Edward Snowden.\n\nNever before have all 11 FISC judges collectively heard a case in an en banc review.\u00a0The 6-5 ruling reverses a previous FISA court decision by FISC Judge Rosemary Collyer, who had ruled\u00a0that the ACLU and Yale Law School's Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic lacked the necessary standing to pursue their case in court.\n\nAccording to the majority opinion, Collyer's original ruling prematurely hinged on the merits of the movants' case, rather than their standing. \"As that is not what concerns us today, we hold that Movants have sufficiently alleged the invasion of a legally cognizable interest as necessary to establish an injury-in-fact,\" states the opinion, written by Judge James Boasberg.

About 36 percent are agraid being a victim of terrorism. \u00a0\n\nThe poll, which conducted between October 5-11 this year, had results that were consistent with those found in during previous studies with the percentage of Americans who worry frequently or occasionally about being a victim of identity theft hovering between 66 and 70 percent since 2009. \n\nResearchers noted that respondents were more likely to report being a victim of a cybercrime than they were being a victim of another crime. \n\n\u201cSince 2009, Americans' anxiety about identity theft has consistently topped their fears about other crimes by at least 19 percentage points,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThis year's gap between fear of cybercrime and the next-greatest level of crime worry, having a car broken into, is a wide 28 percentage points.\u201d\n\nResearchers also noted that Americans cybercrime concerns stem from the the fact that many have already been hit with such a crime. About 25 percent of those surveyed reported that they or a household member has had personal information stolen from them within the last 12 months. \n\nThis is almost double the number of people impacted by traditional crime. The study said stolen money or property were the most common conventional crimes to affect U.S. adults, with 12% saying they had been a victim of this activity within the same time period. \n\nThe general fear of cybercrime was pretty even across most age groups, but middle aged Americas were the more likely to experience both identity theft and loss of personal information to hackers than seniors or those who were 30 yeas old or less. \n\nTo make matters worse and help keep anxiety levels high, law enforcement is fighting an uphill battle to stop cybercrime, High-Tech Bridge Chief Information Officer\u00a0Ilia Kolochenko told SC Media. \n\n\u201cEven in developed countries, law enforcement agencies face paucity of financing, lack of competent personnel, reluctant international investigatory cooperation and skyrocketing number of cybercrime incidents,\u201d Kolochenko said. \u201cThus, investigation of the overwhelming majority of digital crimes becomes virtually impossible.\u201d\n\nHe added that cryptocurrencies and modern anonymization techniques, can effectively preclude almost any technical investigation by private companies with the necessary resources.

Ninety percent of the respondents said they do not have a complete and accurate inventory of all SSH keys so there is no way to determine if keys have been stolen, misused or should not be trusted.\n\nOnly twenty-three percent of respondents rotate keys on a quarterly or more frequent basis.

The government then petitioned the court for a rehearing before the full panel of judges, but a subsequent January 2017 split\u00a0vote, 4-4, slapped down the government's request for a rehearing, meaning that the earlier ruling in Microsoft's favor would stand.\n\n\"The opposite ruling could have resulted in chaos and a privacy disaster,\" Greg Nojeim, director of the Center for Democracy & Technology's Freedom, Security & Technology Project, said in a\u00a0release at the time. \"Providers would have been subject to conflicting obligations to an even greater extent than is the case today, and users' communications privacy could become, over time, subject to the whims of not just the U.S. government, but also other countries seeking their data.\"\u00a0\n\nBut the high court's decision to review the case means the justices \u201cwill now have to decide whether a warrant issued by a U.S. court can compel a communications provider to produce its users' content no matter where it's stored in the world,\u201d Nojeim said in a release. \u201cThis is something that Congress should be addressing, rather than the Court.\u201d \n\nIf the Supreme Court decides U.S. warrants have authority overseas, \u201cit will open the floodgates to demands from other countries that their legal processes be able to compel other providers to disclose content that they hold in the U.S., including the content held by Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would create chaos.\u201d\n\nInstead the court should stand by the Second Circuit decision that said government should \u201cuse the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the U.S. and Ireland in order to gain access to the information in the case,\u201d Nojeim contended, renewing the call for Congress to \u201cresolve the issue of cross-border law enforcement data demands, with a clear focus on strong human rights protections for all internet users.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe case pits the interests of law enforcement access to information against concerns over government overreach, and could have ramifications globally as other nations likely will adapt their policies regarding access to information stored in other countries based on what the U.S.\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0decides,\u201d said Robert Cattanach, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney law firm.\u00a0 \u201cPrivacy advocates have decried the prospect of borderless search authority by governments across the world, while law enforcement have painted the specter of criminal activities being shielded by convenient placement of data.\u201d\n\nThe case is drawing particular attention as major data privacy regulation is mulled in Europe.\u00a0\u201cAll of this is being played out as the European Union continues its review of the Privacy Shield measure that allows the transfer of personal data of EU residents to the US under the presumption that it can be adequately protected,\" said Cattanach.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told the House Judiciary Committee Friday that it will not support the USA Liberty Act, the latest version of a surveillance reform bill meant to extend the

including the NAACP and the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the bill needed to be bolstered to address concerns over the \u201cbackdoor search loophole.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe bill's most glaring deficiency is that it does not require a warrant to access content in cases where the primary purpose is to return foreign intelligence,\u201d the group wrote, noting that \u201cunder this exception, the government would have free rein to search and access the content of religious organizations and civil society groups, Congressional staff, and other innocent Americans without a warrant simply if it asserted that the primary purpose was to gather information related to the policies of a foreign country.\u201d \n\nThe coalition also took issue with the broad language of the bill, which it said \u201cleaves room for the government to conduct queries and access content for law enforcement purposes without a warrant.\u201d\n\nThe bill's consent and emergency exception are also overly broad. \u201cFor example, the emergency provision does not parallel analogous provisions in FISA and require imminence or that the government go back to the FISA court for a warrant after beginning the emergency surveillance,\u201d the coalition said. \u201cAt the same time, the consent provision could be read to allow individuals who are not a party to a communication to consent to its access.\u201d\n\nExpressing concern that \u201cthe bill fails to require any court approval to access what it terms \u2018noncontents' information,\u201d the rights groups said that made the proposed law \u201cat odds with current law, including the reforms passed as part of the USA Freedom Act, which recognized the need for a court order to access metadata.\u201d\n\nThe coalition urged Congress to bring the language of the bill in line with Title III provisions, to clarify that \u201can independent judge\u2014not the government\u2014must make a finding of probable cause as part of the warrant process.\u201d \u00a0\n\nSaying that the bill falls short of protecting Americans, Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the ACLU, in a statement, noted \u201cthe bill still allows the government to read emails, text messages, and other communications of Americans without a probable cause warrant or even a shred of evidence suggesting that the person has information necessary to protect against an imminent threat\u201d and called for lawmakers to improve it.\n\nSection 702 is set to expire at the end of 2017.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

Rather, it's an ongoing process as companies expand and change their data collection.\n\nGDPR compliance requires changing the \u201cthe processes and culture across an organization [as to] how information is used and processed,\u201d he said. \n\nCompanies, too, must get a handle on how third-party partners and vendors handle data and comply with GDPR.\n\nThe second phase is actual implementation of a GDPR compliance program, which Durbin said will likely bump up individuals' understanding of how their data is collected, protected and used. Consumers likely assumed, for example, that a company like Equifax handled data much better, but got a rude awakening after the company's recent massive breach. That will change with GDPR.\n\n\u201cIndividuals will understand much better how to ask about data,\u201d he said, adding that as a result, he expects \u201cmuch more individual frustration\u201d regarding breach notifications.\n\nDurbin urged companies not to simply view GDPR as a compliance issue but as a launching point for bringing real, positive change to their business operations.\n\n\u201cData protection and legal compliance should not be perceived solely as a burden. The GDPR provides organizations with an opportunity to move programs beyond risk reviews and data analysis to deliver tangible operational change, thereby securing competitive advantage,\u201d he said in a release. \u201cWhile every organization should judge the risks and rewards of its own data protection investments, the GDPR offers a unique opportunity to translate necessary compliance actions into tangible business benefit. Leading organizations are structuring GDPR compliance programs to exploit these opportunities and our GDPR Implementation Guide offers a method for doing just that.\u201d\n\nThe threat of hefty fines \u2013 four percent of annual turnover \u00a0- and the potential hits to reputation should push even the stragglers to eventually comply, even if it means calling in outside help.\n\n\u201cI don't think anyone wants to be the first one to fall afoul of GDPR,\u201d said Durbin.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "Trump lawyers hit Facebook with warrants for activists' account info", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/trump-lawyers-hit-facebook-with-warrants-for-activists-account-info/article/696608/", "title": "Trump lawyers hit Facebook with warrants for activists' account info ", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "September 29, 2017", "body": "Armed with search warrants, Trump administration lawyers have demanded Facebook turn over account information on three Facebook users who are anti-administration activists.\u00a0\n\nOne of the users targeted is Emilio Talarico who ran the disruptj20 page that organized protests on Inauguration Day, according to a CNN report.\n\nThe Justice Department had previously tried to get web hosting provider DreamHost to hand over information on visitors to the disruptj20 website.\n\nAfter DreamHost pressed the U.S. government in superior court over a warrant to access more than 1.3 million IP records of a website, the Justice Department backed off its request and modified the warrant to narrow its scope.\n\nA superior judge subsequently ruled that the information must be handed over but ordered that\u00a0the time period specified by the search warrant should be reduced.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "State surveillance tool uses ISP to deliver malware to privacy seekers", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/state-surveillance-tool-uses-isp-to-deliver-malware-to-privacy-seekers/article/694968/", "title": "State surveillance tool uses ISP to deliver malware to privacy seekers", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "September 22, 2017", "body": "Unnamed major internet providers are reported to be the distribution route for the spread of a new variant of government spyware\u00a0FinFisher\u00a0(also known as FinSpy) in two countries, with surveillance campaigns using the new malware variant detected in a total of seven unnamed countries.\n\nResearchers at ESET say these campaigns are the first where the probable involvement of a major internet provider in spreading malware has been publicly disclosed.\n\n\u201cIn two of the campaigns, the spyware has been spread via a man-in-the-middle attack and we believe that major internet providers have played the role of the man in the middle,\u201d\u00a0explains Filip Kafka, the ESET malware analyst who conducted the research.\n\nFinFisher describes itself as a law enforcement tool; it is known to be used by various oppressive regimes.

The whole redirection process occurs without the user's knowledge and is invisible to the naked eye.\n\nKafka,adds, \u00a0\u201cThese FinFisher campaigns are sophisticated and stealthy surveillance projects, unprecedented in their combination of methods and reach.\u201d\n\nESET takes the view that there is no such thing as good malware, as outlined in its\u00a0 response\u00a0to an open letter by Bits of Freedom, a digital rights activist group.\n\nFinFisher campaigns use various infection mechanisms, including spearphishing, manual installations with physical access to devices,\u00a00-day exploits, and watering hole attacks \u2013 poisoning websites the targets are expected to visit (which ESET says it observed used to serve a mobile version of FinFisher).\n\nAmong the recent campaigns, FinFisher spyware was being targeted at people seeking stronger privacy as it masqueraded as an executable file named \u201cThreema\u201d which would provide secure instant messaging with end-to-end encryption. \n\nAnother \u00a0installation was a file of TrueCrypt \u2013 the once-very-popular disk encryption software \u2013 trojanised with FinFisher.\n\nESET explains that it would be technically possible for the \u201cman\u201d in these man-in-the-middle attacks to be situated at various positions along the route from the target's computer to the legitimate server (eg compromised Wi-Fi hotspots). However, the company says, \u201cthe geographical dispersion of ESET's detections of latest FinFisher variants suggests the MitM attack is happening at a higher level \u2013 an ISP arises as the most probable option.\u201d\n\nIt says this assumption is supported by a number of facts: First, according to leaked internal materials that have been\u00a0published by WikiLeaks, the FinFisher maker offered a solution called \u201cFinFly ISP\u201d to be deployed on ISP networks with capabilities matching those necessary for performing such a MitM attack. Second, the infection technique (using the HTTP 307 redirect) is implemented in the very same way in both of the affected countries, which is very unlikely unless it was developed and/or provided by the same source. Third, all affected targets within a country are using the same ISP. Finally, the very same redirection method and format have been used for internet content filtering by internet service providers in at least one of the affected countries.\n\nThe deployment of the ISP-level MitM attack technique mentioned in the leaked documents has never been revealed \u2013 until now. If confirmed, these FinFisher campaigns would represent a sophisticated and stealthy surveillance project unprecedented in its combination of methods and reach.\n\nESET has a free online scanner\u00a0which allows users to check their computer for FinFisher and remove it if detected.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "D.C. appeals court overturns conviction in warrantless stingray case", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/dc-appeals-court-rules-warrantless-stingray-use-unconstitutional/article/695127/", "title": "D.C. appeals court overturns conviction in warrantless stingray case", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "September 22, 2017", "body": "D.C.

worldwide cyberattack, the emergence of an IoT-enabled surveillance state, and the weakening of encryption were among the chief security and privacy fears expressed by experts who were polled for a sweeping new report about the internet and its future impact on mankind.\n\nThe 2017 Global Internet Report, published by the non-profit Internet Society (ISOC), is the culmination of an 18-month research project aimed at predicting what factors will most influence the internet's evolution in the next five-to-seven years, and the impact of such changes. To get a consensus view of the internet's prospects, the organization surveyed 3,000 members, professionals and partners in 160 countries.\n\nAccording to the study, stakeholders worldwide still believe that the internet's benefits will continue to outweigh the risks in the coming years, transforming lives through the efficient delivery of critical services and revolutionizing industries across multiple sectors. But they also sense that the threat is growing, especially as\u00a0businesses create new attack vectors by relying on a growing number of interconnected data sources.\n\n\"Cybersecurity will be the most pressing challenge of the next decade,\" the report states. \"Responses to date have been thoroughly insufficient and the costs are escalating.\" And based on recent precedent, \"...it is not far-fetched to imagine a digital pandemic with attacks crippling entire economies.\"\n\nThe ISOC also expects to see more destructive acts of cyber war, coupled with online disinformation campaigns in an effort to destabilize countries and their economies. However, the organization believes these acts will be perpetrated by not only nation-states, but also \"their surrogates, and by independent political movements and private actors.\"\n\nUltimately, the growth of the internet could largely depend on how well the security community at large responds to attacks, the report cautions. With the stakes so high, some nations may feel compelled to scale back online freedoms and restrict global connectivity in the name of national security, resulting in the creation of \"walled gardens,\" the balkanization of the internet, and the weakening or banishment of encryption technologies. Indeed, ISOC's survey-takers generally said they believe future\u00a0government regulations will be more intrusive and restrictive than they are today.\n\nTo prevent such a scenario, the report calls for \"new accountability, incentive and liability models\" to \"increase cybersecurity readiness and reduce vulnerabilities but also to ensure end-user security.\" The ISOC is also pushing for worldwide, multi-stakeholder collaboration to address these threats, as opposed to fragmented, unilateral efforts.\n\n\"I think there are some major architectural changes which need to take place in the internet,\u00a0and I'd like to see more effort put forward [toward] new innovative architectural changes,\" said Leonard Kleinrock, a renowned computer scientist, considered among the fathers of the internet, in an ISOC webcast panel discussion on Monday.\u00a0\n\nBut even such architectural changes won't necessarily secure the \"edge\" of the internet, where IOT devices reside. This unprotected edge, where you'll find\u00a0devices \"put together by a small company, thrown on your wall with a camera, with a microphone, with access to the internet in a typically unprotected, insecure fashion \u2013\u00a0that's where the penetrations will take place,\" Kleinrock added.\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise then that the ISOC devoted a large section of its report to IoT devices, noting that as we rapidly approach a connected world,\u00a0devices will generate and collect vast amounts of personal user data that nations could potentially leverage to create a surveillance state.\n\nIn addition to seeing even more attacks from threats modeled after the Mirai IoT botnet, \"We may see increased mass surveillance, the further erosion of privacy, and a growing dependence on data collection, analytics, and curation,\" the report states. \"The implications for privacy are profound. Without essential safeguards, greater amounts of data will be collected and used without the user's knowledge or control.\"\n\nISOC has recommended pursuing a collaborative and proactive effort among stakeholders to instill effective IoT safeguards. For instance, device manufacturers and service providers should be taking steps to bake privacy and security into the actual design process, the report suggests, while the insurance industry could do its part by requiring IoT devices to have security certifications before owners of these products can be insured.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Motel 6 to revamp privacy, data sharing policies after Phoenix locations send guest info to ICE", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/motel-6-to-revamp-privacy-data-sharing-policies-after-phoenix-locations-send-guest-info-to-ice/article/689360/", "title": "Motel 6 to revamp privacy, data sharing policies after Phoenix locations send guest info to ICE", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "September 18, 2017", "body": "Motel 6 employees in the Phoenix area who voluntarily and routinely handed guest registers to ICE officials without the benefit of a warrant may not have run afoul of the company's privacy policy, but the hotel chain said it would take steps to shut down or prevent similar operations at its other properties nationwide.\n\nThe Phoenix New Times reported last week quoted an employee at one of two Phoenix-area Motel 6 locations as saying, \u201cevery morning at about 5 o'clock we do the audit and push a button and it sends it to ICE,\u201d prompting the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to call out the motel chain on both Twitter and Facebook. \u201cIs this your official company policy?\u201d the ACLU tweeted.\n\nThe company's privacy policy not only notes that it collects an abundance of data on its guests but that it \u201cmay disclose guest information to law enforcement agencies, or may be required to disclose it during the discovery process in litigation, pursuant to a court order, or in compliance with any applicable law, regulation, rule or ordinance.\"\n\nHowever, as experts have pointed out there is no law that compels hotels to voluntarily give up guest information to law enforcement.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe Motel Six had said the Phoenix operation was orchestrated by locals and was shut down when corporate caught wind of it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMoving forward, to help ensure that this does not occur again, we will be issuing a directive to every one of our more than 1,400 locations nationwide, making clear that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists to ICE,\u201d according to a Motel 6 statement. \u201cAdditionally, to help ensure that our broader engagement with law enforcement is done in a manner that is respectful of our guests' rights, we will be undertaking a comprehensive review of our current practices and then issue updated, company-wide guidelines.\u201d\n\nWhile ICE hasn't offered any additional information, it did say, \u201cIt's worth noting that hotels and motels, including those in the Phoenix area, have frequently been exploited by criminal organizations engaged in highly dangerous illegal enterprises, including human trafficking and human smuggling.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}, {"news_name": "Facebook hands over ads, account info to Mueller", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/facebook-hands-over-ads-account-info-to-mueller/article/689319/", "title": "Facebook hands over ads, account info to Mueller", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "September 18, 2017", "body": "After issuing repeated denials, Facebook said last week that an internal investigation found a Russian \"troll farm\" bought ads from the social media giant that and apparently planted them, some in targeted markets, \"to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2014 touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,\" company CSO Alex Stamos wrote in a blog\u00a0post.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that\u00a0Facebook shared copies of ads with Mueller's investigation as well as the criteria the accounts used to target the those ads.\n\nRep.

Among the alleged Playpen visitors who were subsequently identified and arrested were Zachary Halgren of San Antonio, Tex. -- the defendant in this case.\n\nWestern Texas U.S. District Court Judge Xavier Rodriguez ruled that the warrant the FBI obtained from a local magistrate judge to implant the NIT was not too broad in its scope to violate the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement.\n\nWhile Rodriguez\u00a0agreed that under the laws of 2015, local magistrate judges were prohibited from issuing warrants to collect evidence located outside their jurisdictions, he noted that an exception applied to tracking devices that were initially installed in the magistrate's district, only to move outside the jurisdiction along with the individual under surveillance.\u00a0Rodriguez opined that this scenario was \"exactly analogous to what the NIT Warrant authorized,\" in that the defendant's computer allegedly contacted an FBI-controlled server in Virginia, which tracked the device back to its location in Texas.\n\nThe judge also ruled that the defendant \"lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP address when using the internet\" and allegedly accessing the Playpen website. And even if Halgren did have a reasonable expectation of privacy, or the local magistrate judge did exceed her jurisdictional authority, the \"good faith\" exception would still apply to the search of the defendant's property.\n\nFinally, the judge rules that the affidavit used to establish probable cause for the search did not contain misrepresentations.\n\nThe legality of FBI investigations relying on an NIT warrant has been closely scrutinized in recent years, with courts in different jurisdictions issuing conflicting rulings. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Minnesota ruled that the FBI exceeded the scope of the Virginia magistrate's Playpen search warrant, but did not suppress evidence in the case because he believed the agency acted in good faith.\n\nIn April 2016, a Massachusetts federal court judge did suppress evidence in another Playpen case, after ruling that the Eastern Virginia magistrate overstepped her authority. One month later, a Washington State judge also\u00a0tossed evidence in a Playpen case\u00a0because the FBI refused to disclose the NIT code used to obtain the evidence. And in another case, a judge in Eastern Virginia sided definitively with U.S. law enforcement, ruling that investigators do not even need a warrant to remotely hack into suspects' computers.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/legal-action/topic/47242/", "topic_name": "Legal Action"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "MLB: Red Sox used Apple watches to steal, transmit pitching signs", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mlb-red-sox-used-apple-watches-to-steal-transmit-pitching-signs/article/686757/", "title": "MLB: Red Sox used Apple watches to steal, transmit pitching signs", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "September 05, 2017", "body": "Major League Baseball investigators have found that the Boston Red Sox used Apple watches to steal hand signals from competitors' catchers and pass them on to their own players, according to a report in the New York Times.\u00a0\n\nThe conclusion is the culmination of a two-week investigation launched after the New York Yankees lodged a complaint with the MLB commissioner and provide video that showed the Boston dugout when the Bronx Bombers faced the Red Sox on their own home turf during a three-game series in August.\n\nStealing signals is not illegal per se as long as teams don't rely on anything more than what they visually observe.

SC Media asked some of the top executives in the field for what they see as the biggest threats and problems that will be faced in the next few months. This will be a living list with more threats being added as they appear.\n\n1. Malware with worm capabilities \n\nJerome Segura - Lead malware intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes\n\nWannacry shocked the world by its rapid spread and this wouldn't have been possible without its worm component. It reminded us of how quickly malware can propagate with devastating effects. Sadly, other malware authors have realized it also and are starting to add worm capabilities to their malware, such as recently with the Trickbot banking trojan.\n\n\n\n2. Release of more Shadow Brokers tools\n\nJeff Schilling - Chief Security Officer at \u200eArmor\n\nEternalBlue and DoublePulsar, the critical component of the WannaCry worm are potentially just the tip of the iceberg of what may be coming from the Shadow Brokers.\u00a0 These sophisticated tools, in the hands of a less than a sophisticated adversary, had massive global impact.\u00a0 Expect more to come.\n\n3. Getting back to basics (patching, endpoint, hygiene)\n\nMatt Pascucci\u00a0- Cybersecurity Practice Manager at CCSI\u00a0\n\nThis is the biggest issue of the year and the malware has shown just how easy it is to comprise systems.\n\n4. The vulnerability of mobile carriers\n\n\u00a0Elad Yoran - Executive Chairman of KoolSpan\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly one of the more important security challenges facing us today is the growing realization that the carrier networks that transport the world's voice and data communications are systemically vulnerable to interception and monitoring. Hackers, terrorist organizations, foreign governments and others take advantage of these internetworking protocols and exploit them on a regular basis from anywhere around the world.\n\n5. Stop overwhelming clients with alerts!\n\nBen Herzberg, head of application security research at Imperva \n\nSecurity controls generate a lot of alerts that can easily overwhelm an organization. In large organizations such as banks, it is common to have over 100,000 security alerts per day.\u00a0 As you can imagine, this requires a battalion of security engineers and analysts to sort through.\n\n6. Adapting the firewall to face new threats\n\nJody Brazil, co-founder and chief product strategist, FireMon\n\n\u201cThe evolution of the firewall is not complete. Networking technology is changing rapidly and the firewall will have to adapt. Cloud, SDN and containers threaten the traditional role of the firewall. The traditional network segmentation is being replaced with very flat networks - which removes a lot of network complexity, but introduces a significant challenge to the firewall.\n\n7. Monitoring Cloud Configuration and Security\n\nTim Erlin, Vice President, product management and strategy at Tripwire\n\nOrganizations continue to adopt cloud technologies at a rapid rate, but information security isn't keeping up. There have been discovered misconfigurations leading to data leaks, but for every one of these found, there are likely many more that aren't published. With a rapid rate of technological change, huge variation of skills, and fast paced adoption, it's clear that monitoring cloud assets and infrastructure will continue to be a challenge.\u00a0 \n\n8. High Impact Attacks\n\nLimor Kessem - executive security advisor at IBM Security \n\nThinking about the biggest challenges for the remainder of the year, the one that stands out the most to me is \u201cimpact.\u201d No one can deny the destructive effect of attacks we encountered this year so far, from Shamoon v2, to WannaCry, and NotPetya, the world witnessed the power of malicious code at its highest impact to date. For the rest of year, organizations cannot ignore the overall increasing risk of highly advanced leaked code which has been used widely against organizations of all types and sizes and spreads quickly without discrimination. These attacks have shown us that it's not just simply an organizations customer data, trade secrets, or finances that are at stake \u2013 entire operations have been shut down with devastating effects on business, employees and end users. \n\n9. The Insider Threat\n\nItsik Mantin - head of data security research at Imperva\n\nSimilar to previous years, many of the breaches seen in the last year were not the result of hackers penetrating the organization and stealing data from it, but employees and third-parties that have access to sensitive data for the sake of their work, that in some cases steal the data, where in other cases leak it by sending it accidentally to unauthorized recipients. The challenge with data breaches involving insiders and third-parties is double. Not only do the attackers have much more inside info than an external attacker, but since no malware is involved and no penetration happens through the organization perimeter, many of the common security mechanisms, like firewalls and anti-viruses, become blind to these attacks happening.\n\n10. Operationalizing GDPR\n\nChris Olson - CEO of The Media Trust \u00a0\n\nThe EU's pending data protection regulation ushers in a world of change for enterprise security teams. Beyond identifying and documenting data elements and data collection activity, IT and security professionals will join forces with privacy, risk and compliance officers to operationalize data governance policies. Implementation of compliance mechanisms to ensure data protection policies--including data unknowingly collected by third parties from everyday website operations--are actively monitored and enforced will be a key focus leading up to May 2018.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud-security/topic/49913/", "topic_name": "Cloud Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacking/topic/47220/", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/insider-threat/topic/52185/", "topic_name": "Insider Threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Justice presses DreamHost for info on visitors to Trump protest site", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/justice-presses-dreamhost-for-info-on-visitors-to-trump-protest-site/article/681804/", "title": "Justice presses DreamHost for info on visitors to Trump protest site", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "August 15, 2017", "body": "The Justice Department has pressed DreamHost to hand over what amounts to more than 1.3 million IP addresses associated with visitors to disruptj20.org, the group that organized protests against President Donald Trump on Inauguration Day 2017.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter its bid that the government narrow the scope of its request was rebuffed, DreamHost petitioned a Superior Court in D.C. to deny the government's motion because it violates both the Fourth Amendment and the Privacy Protection Act.\n\n\"Because it requires the disclosure of every piece of electronic information related to a website, including a large amount of information about the protected activities of third parties, the government's Search Warrant requires scrutiny of 'particular exactitude.' Scrutiny of this type demonstrates that the warrant lacks the specificity required by the Fourth Amendment and is unreasonable as a whole,\" the company wrote in its motion\u00a0before the court. \"Without any specification from the government, particularly given the over-expansive language of the Search Warrant, the Court should not compel DreamHost to provide all material to the government without a determination whether such material is intended for publication and if such material qualifies either as 'work product' or 'documentary material'\" protected by the Privacy Act.\n\nDigital rights advocates have thrown their support behind the web-hosting company. \"No plausible explanation exists for a search warrant of this breadth, other than to cast a digital dragnet as broadly as possible. But the Fourth Amendment was designed to prohibit fishing expeditions like this,\" the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Staff Attorney Mark Rumold wrote in a blog post that applauded DreamHost for its response. \"Those concerns are especially relevant here, where DOJ is investigating a website that served as a hub for the planning and exercise of First Amendment-protected activities.\"\n\nThe Superior Court will entertain the DreamHost motion at an August 18 hearing.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}]}]}]
