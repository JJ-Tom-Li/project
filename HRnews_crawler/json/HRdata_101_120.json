Now, one by one new details about the attack is surfacing the Internet.Also Read: Internet Connected Car Hacked and DDoSed via SmartphoneIn the latest, a Chinese electronics company Hangzhou Xiongmai has acknowledged that hackers compromised its webcams and used it to conduct DDoS attacks on Dyn through the Mirai botnet that is known to be a nightmare for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with default or weak login credentials.In a statement to BBC, Xiongmai rejected allegations that its webcams made up the bulk of the devices used in the attacks. It also said that the attackers were able to take over cameras because users did not change the default passwords of these devices yet the company has decided to recall its circuit boards and components that go into webcams.Also Read: Hackers take over security camera; live stream girls\u2019 bedroom on InternetThere are thousands of unprotected security and webcams in the United States ready to used by hackers to conduct further cyber-armageddon.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Remember, it was the Mirai botnet that played a vital role in the DDoS attack on Dyn servers. The fact that Mirai\u2019s developer leaked its source code online also played a vital role in the rapid increase of this botnet. Last month, the same botnet was used for conducting the Internets largest ever DDoS attack of 1 Tbps on OVH hostings as well as the 665 Gbps attack on Brian Krebs blog by hacking over 145,000 webcams.If you own a security camera or any IoT device HackRead urges you to change their default login credentials now to avoid getting your device compromised and used in further DDoS attacks.Featured Image Via: WikiMedia", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Firm recall webcams after confirming involvement in Dyn DDoS attack", "date": "October 25, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Botnet", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "internet", "IoT", "security", "Social Media"], "body": "By now you should be aware of what happened with Dyn\u2019s DNS servers two days ago when Internet was almost taken down by a series of massive DDoS attacks. Several IT security companies already discovered Mirai botnet being linked to the attack. But with time passing, researchers are sharing new and shocking details about this DDoS attack.Also Read: Brian Krebs site hit with 665 Gbps DDoS attack; Largest Internet has ever seenIn the latest, according to the official blog post by Dyn\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer Kyle York, it has been revealed that the attacks on their server were not only massive but also sophisticated and involved 10s of millions of hacked IP addresses.Last month, OVH suffered Internet\u2019s largest ever DDoS attacks of 1 TBPS in which 145,000 hacked webcams were used. As each camera is assigned with a special IP address the total number of hacked IP addresses involved in OVH attack should have been no more than 145,000. In Dyn\u2019s case 10s of millions of hacked IP addresses were used. It is too early to conclude, but with the number of IP addresses involved, it is tempting to speculate that the recent DDoS attack was much bigger than the one on OVH. Maybe even several times bigger.Sophisticated attack:Dyn will come up with complete findings once the ongoing investigation unearths facts but for now, the company has confirmed that the attack was highly sophisticated. According to WhiteHatSec, a sophisticated attack is one in which the attackers know what application they are going to attack, collect intelligence to attack specific points in their target and not just a random system on the networks.While it is unclear why this attack was conducted and or who was behind this attack, one thing is crystal clear. The sophistication and target selection was not done by kids. Both New World Hackers and RedCult have claimed responsibility. The latter is also promising further attacks. Remember, New World Hackers also claimed responsibility for 600 Gbps DDoS attack on BBC\u2019s server that forced all of its websites to go offline and unavailable for readers for several hours.That said, it\u2019s too early to speculate or blame someone but for experts, the usual suspects in such cases are China and Russia. Just like a security expert Bruce Schneier explained in a blog post:Wolf, you don\u2019t know who is behind this, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s foreign or domestic. What I do know is over the years we have tried to pass data security legislation. There\u2019s been bipartisan agreement in the House. It has not moved forward into the Senate. We also know that a few years ago we tried to do a bill called SOPA in the House which required the ISPs to some governance on these networks and to block some of the bad actors.What are DDoS attacks?

The campaign, which was launched just three months before, has managed to save more than $1million or 1.3 million Euros.It must be noted that the No More Ransom campaign was launched on July 25th, 2016 collectively by Europol, the Dutch National Police, Intel Security, and Kaspersky Lab. Such a high-level cooperation between law enforcement agencies from different countries around Europe has never been witnessed before. The private sector is also on board with the ongoing campaign.Eurojust is supporting the campaign\u2019s objectives along with the European Commission. The sole objective of this campaign is to help out the victims of ransomware. On the campaign\u2019s online portal, victims can receive all sorts of information from understanding the way ransomware attacks and performs encryption to how to decrypt data and how to protect their computers from ransomware in future.With the efforts of law enforcement agencies, 2,500 people were able to decrypt their data and didn\u2019t have to pay the ransom, which is no ordinary feat. This was made possible by the decryption tools available at the campaign\u2019s website. The main tools at the site include WildFire Decryptor, CoinVault, RannohDecryptor, RakhniDecryptor, and Shade.The campaign has received a lot of praise and following from law enforcement agencies. Recently 13 more countries\u2019 agencies joined the campaign to thwart the ransomware threat. The new members include the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Latvia, Hungary, Portugal and Spain, etc.It is also expected that more agencies and private organizations will become part of this campaign in the coming months, due to which it will be possible to get hold of a wider range of free decryption tools. This way, many more victims of ransomware will be receiving help for retrieving their data and saving their hard earned money from going into the pockets of cyber-criminals.There is no doubt about the fact that ransomware is currently the top threat for law enforcement across Europe since over two-thirds of the EU member states are continuously threatened by these attacks.

Although it is unclear who was behind this attack the security researchers are linking the Mirai DDoS botnet malware to this attack.If you don\u2019t know what Mirai is then let us tell you. It is the same botnet that was behind the DDoS attacks on Krebs on security blog and the OVH hosting website a couple of weeks back. The attack on Krebs\u2019s website was 665 GBPS whilst OVH suffered Internet\u2019s largest ever DDoS attacks of 1 TBPS in which 145,000 hacked webcams were used.Mirai uses Internet of Things (IoT) devices like routers, digital video records (DVRs), and webcams/security cameras, enslaving vast numbers of these devices into a botnet, which is then used to conduct DDoS attacks.You may be wondering why Mirai is such a badass botnet? It may have something to do with the fact that \u201cAnna_Senpai shared their code in public. Yes, the owner of this botnet recently published its source code online and since then the use of Mirai has been steadily increasing \u2013 wreaking havoc globally. Researchers at FlashPoint have revealed that they discovered similar patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in yesterday\u2019s DDoS attack.Chris Sullivan, General Manager of Intelligence/Analytics at Core Security Inc told HackRead that IoT devices are cheap and don\u2019t have the necessary memory and processing power to be secured properly. This is the main reason that they are easy to hack and use for malicious purposes.According to Chris:\u201cThis outage appears to have resulted from a new breed of very high volume DDoS, or denial-of-service attacks, that will be difficult to handle with the defenses that most enterprises have in place today. The really frightening part of this is not that we will be struggling with these new attacks for some time, but that the underlying weakness which makes them successful can and will be used to unleash more serious attacks that steal credit cards and weapons designs, manipulate processes like the SWIFT global funds transfers, and even destroy physical things the 30,000 PCs at Saudi Aramco.IoT devices are the very cheap computers that we use to control the heat, lights and baby monitor in your home or tell UPS when a truck needs service \u2013 some cost less than $1. Unlike your PC or your phone, IoT devices don\u2019t have the memory and processing to be secured properly, so they are easily compromised by adversaries and it\u2019s very difficult to detect when that happens.This is what\u2019s driving the new ultra-high volume DDoS attacks like we saw today. Ultra-large IoT botnets are instructed to make so many superfluous requests of the target that legitimate requests cannot get through. No real damage is done but service is denied for legitimate users. Maybe you can\u2019t get to twitter for an hour. But these same devices also have access to what we think are highly secured corporate, nations state and defense networks. They can be used to launch attacks on those networks from the inside where all of the net-generation firewalls, intrusion prevention and user-based analytics tools won\u2019t even see them.Companies should move immediately to get control of this situation both to protect themselves and because, in the wake of these new high-profile events, it\u2019s likely to be mandated by new law. What is required now is the deployment of systems that don\u2019t try to control the IoT devices but rather watch and learn how they behave so that we can identify malicious activity and isolate them when necessary.\u201dIt is unclear who was behind these large-scale attacks or if these attacks are connected with what we saw a couple of weeks ago directed at the OVH and Krebs\u2019 websites. One thing is quite obvious, though. Someone was trying to take the Internet down \u2013 and they almost succeeded. Let\u2019s all just wait for the next barrage and ponder if the Internet of Things is actually turning into the Botnet of Things.Let\u2019s see what\u2019s next and how Internet of Things are turning into Botnet of things.

They can even access information like personal ID pictures and drivers\u2019 licenses.But, this sort of research and collection of data is in violation of the citizens\u2019 right to privacy, freedom of speech and protection from unjustified and irrational seizure and searching.The executive director of the Center for Privacy & Technology, Alvaro Bedova, states that facial recognition technology allows the police to \u201cidentify you from far away and in secret without ever talking to you.\u201d\u201cUnless you\u2019ve been arrested, the chances are you\u2019re not in a criminal fingerprint database or a criminal DNA database either, yet by standing for a driver\u2019s license photo at least 117 million adults have been enrolled in a face recognition network searched by the police or the FBI,\u201d added Bedova.Bedova refers to this database as \u201ca national biometric database that is populated primarily by law-abiding people.\u201dAlso Read: Tattoo Recognition System Could Identify Criminals Very SoonIt is also narrated in the report that, as of now, none of the states within the US have underlined the parameters of the way facial recognition database can be used for investigations. There isn\u2019t any comprehensive legislation passed by any of the states as well, but some departments have voluntarily imposed restrictions on the use of this database during searches. According to their policy, the database can be searched if the crime is of serious nature and there is reasonable suspicion.There are also concerns about the probability of racial biases during the searches. It is often argued by law enforcement agencies that the biometric tools minimize racially policing because a computer program cannot segregate between individuals on the basis of gender or skin color, it just matches pictures.However, according to the report, the program used to recognize faces isn\u2019t as impartial as it is being promoted. Research reveals that American facial recognition systems cannot accurately identify African Americans. Furthermore, since the rate of arrests of African Americans in the US is higher than other races, and facial recognition systems use mug shots for identifying suspects, so, there is every possibility of the system providing inaccurate matches and falsely targeting black race.Also Read: These Iris scanners can now identify people from 40 feet awayIn response to the concerns raised in the report, the FBI has not commented as yet but previously the bureau has stated that they would prioritize the protection of privacy and civil liberties beyond the legal jurisdictions. The bureau also stated that while searching the database, two human reviewers are separately involved in the process to counter check the matches returned by the system.The report also identified that use of real-time facial recognition is becoming quite common within the law enforcement authorities especially the Police. In some major cities including Chicago and Los Angeles, five departments are either regularly observing or trying to use real-time facial recognition data of people in public areas using live feed video cameras.Also Read: FBI builds mammoth facial recognition database raising huge privacy concernsPublic concern is rising since the publishing of this report and many civil rights organizations are coming to the forefront to register their protest against this sort of data collection and use.

This obviously makes data decryption very difficult.The ransomware was identified by Kaspersky researchers while looking for a particular security flaw, which allows attackers to upload and implement a PHP Shell Script to an exploitable Israeli web server, in the Magento Content Management System. This server serves as the command and control center for CryPy while the data is transferred in clear text format to the server. This allows attackers to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks as well as insert additional PHP scripts. These scripts then instruct the CryPy ransomware to invade the targeted computer(s).

The team identified that CryPy has two main files namely boot_common.py and encryptor.py. The first one error logs on Windows OS and the second one is the main locker. After the computer has been infected the Registry Tools are the first to be disabled by CryPy and then the focus is shifted to Task Manager, Run and CMD. Afterward, boot status policy and recovery tools are disabled. When the disabling function has been performed successfully, the malware begins encrypting the files using a different encryption key for each file.When the malware finishes locking of system and data encryption, the threat actor sends commands to inform the victims of the attack and to contact through email to pay for the decryption program. If the victims do as directed and contact the attacker via email, they are provided with a sample decryption key with which they can decrypt some of the files for free.

Currently, there are two promising providers.

Andy Yen believes that Yahoo!\u2019s unprecedented cooperation with the NSA is not shocking at all. Whistleblower Edward Snowden taught us that US-based tech giants and telecom firms collaborated with the NSA.\u201cThis should really come as no surprise because we already saw from the Snowden leaks that most major US tech companies and telecoms have collaborated with the NSA in the past when issued secret court orders. However, the recent Yahoo case is unprecedented because active surveillance and interception were performed on ALL Yahoo users, and not just a targeted subset. This includes even the hundreds of millions of Yahoo users based in Europe and Asia who are technically outside of US jurisdiction,\u201d Yen told HackRead.Mr. Yen feels he has ample reason to suspect that both Google and Microsoft also have cooperated with the US government. We at HackRead share that suspicion and think that this is not the end of this scandal. We will keep our readers up to date in the coming months.\u201cI believe that similar active surveillance capabilities must have also been introduced to Gmail and Outlook email at around the same time because it seems unlikely that the NSA would target Yahoo but ignore Gmail, the largest email provider in the world. It is telling that Marissa Mayer decided to comply with the order because, in the view of Yahoo\u2019s legal counsel, a successful challenge to the order could not be mounted.

Wardle has come up with the idea of a malicious app that uses a webcam and lets the attacker spy through Skype.

This can lead to the generation of hypoglycemic reactions. It must be noted that such reactions can be fatal for the patient.Must Read: Hell Hacking Forum on Dark Web Hacks Car Breathalyzers ManufacturesDue to the security flaws, the attacker can interrupt the connection between the pump device and its remote control unit and can send his own commands causing the dose to be increased to extreme levels.However, Radcliffe, the one who identified the vulnerabilities, states that as of now there is no need to get worried because his research has revealed a risk that was not known until now and that the attacker has to be physically closer to the pump to conduct the attack. In fact, the attacks can be conducted from remote locations since the devices communicate through a 900MHZ radio frequency. The attacker has to be in a 90m range to carry out the attack if using radio equipment and if the equipment is more powerful, the attacker can launch an attack from 1 to 2 km\u2019s distance.Radcliffe further stated that:\u201cSome people will choose to see this as significant, and for that, they can turn off the rf/remote features of the pump and eliminate that risk. [\u2026] If you are concerned, work with your endocrinologist and device vendor to make sure you are making the best choices. Removing an insulin pump from a diabetic over this risk is similar to never taking an airplane because it might crash.\u201dAccording to the researcher, the way the pump connects and takes commands from its remote controller is the primary cause behind the creation of the flaws. The three flaws, as identified by Radcliffe include: communications are not encrypted and conducted in cleartext format, the same key is used by the pump-remote pairing system that makes it easier to be exploited, commands can easily be replayed by the attacker because the pump isn\u2019t protected from replay attacks.

In fact, the researchers have revealed that this method could help in tracing down Tor users with a high degree of accuracy.Tor or Onion router is a very popular web browser that is operated by the non-profit Tor Project. It lets people surf the internet without disclosing their identities and almost two million users visit it on a daily basis. It is a relays and nodes based network that keeps the IP addresses of Tor users hidden. Its users mainly include journalists, activists and privacy-conscious individuals from across the globe. But Tor is also widely used by users who want to access Dark Web to perform illegal activities.Must Read: New System by SafeDNS to Detect Malicious Internet ResourcesAccording to the research team, the Tor project is quite \u201cupfront about its limitations.\u201d They further stated that low-latency anonymity networks like Tor are useless against global passive adversaries.\u201cWe define such adversaries as those with the ability to monitor both network traffic that enters and exits the network. Then the adversary can run a correlation attack, meaning that it can match packets that go into the network to packets that leave it, or in other words, it can link a client\u2019s identity to her activity, and thus, break anonymity,\u201d the team further explained.The DNS\u2019 job is to map domains into IP addresses, which are easy-to-read by machines, which let users access websites via human-readable identities instead of the numeric string. DNS is the internet\u2019s building block but this vital system can also be used to expose identities of Tor users. Research suggests that the DNS requests monitoring when combined with fingerprinting techniques can generate a different kind of \u201cDNS-enhanced website fingerprinting attack.\u201dThe researchers said:\u201cThe Tor Project is upfront about its limitations. [..] It is well understood that low-latency anonymity networks such as Tor cannot protect against so-called global passive adversaries.The fingerprinting is a key technique to break the anonymity privilege offered by Tor because such passive adversaries utilize Tor network weaknesses to keep track of hidden services to be accessed prior to revealing the true IP addresses and the physical location of users and their servers.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Companies like Google that operate open DNS [PDF] resolvers can facilitate or make use of such techniques. Through DNS traffic monitoring, attackers can easily implement highly reliable fingerprinting attack especially on websites that aren\u2019t visited frequently.The research team has also identified that around one-third of the sent DNS requests via Tor\u2019s exit relays are routed through public resolvers of Google and this is an alarmingly high \u201cfraction for a single community.\u201d\u201cAlthough Tor is reasonably decentralized, our work shows that this does not hold for the wider ecosystem that Tor exists in,\u201d added the research team.According to security experts, users of Tor has no immediate reason to feel concerned because the \u201cadversaries that can already monitor large fractions of the internet \u2026 will not do any better with our attack.\u201dA tool named DNS Delegation Path Traceroute (ddptr) has also been released by the team that helps in tracing DNS delegation path for a qualified domain name.

Naturally, web security analysts are expecting a series of online attacks from malicious threat actors.

These bots can then be used to attack websites and to take them offline.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Mirai\u2019s code is suspected to be responsible for the attack on Brian Krebs\u2019s KrebsOnSecurity website since Krebs informed public about the publishing of the Mirai code. Krebs warned people about the high probability of the Internet of Things devices getting exploited and hacked in days to come. The code can be used to bombard the websites handling the IoT devices remotely with so many requests that the sites would eventually shut down, rendering the IoT devices vulnerable to exploitation. DDoS attacks play a phenomenally important role in this process.DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks have become so common nowadays in the west that the US and UK have become the first and second most targeted countries respectively. DDoS attacks entail flooding the website or a machine with so many requests for information that the device or site becomes unable to function. This makes internet-connected devices enslaved to attackers because these then act according to the commands sent through the botnet or a C&C server. This is how hackers strengthen their ability to conduct successful attacks. In fact, recently we have seen huge attacks, some over 665 gigabits of data per second. This kind of humongous traffic can easily take down any website within a short span of time.In this regard, the most important aspect that often gets overlooked is that these IoT devices come with default usernames and passwords, which often becomes an issue while dealing with vulnerabilities. Since these internet connected devices have default credentials that are usually either too easy to guess or too difficult to change so people just choose to let them be. This is a grave mistake as the presence of default credentials would make the job of a botnet much easier.For instance, the following usernames and passwords can help Mirai botnet, which has been extracted from the published source code:Firstly, Mirai searches for telnet and then using the credentials we mentioned above to brute force the access to the IoT device such as a DVR, router, camera or the internet-connected hardware. At least two servers are required by the Mirai botnet but the author of the code states that two VPS accounts worked just as fine.

Now a Reddit user is claiming that some of these hacked accounts are distributing malware.The user on Reddit who goes by the alias Hayaddict can be seen alerting about the hacked Steam accounts being used to SPAM malicious URLs. Steam chat is the primary platform used for the distribution of this new malware. The chat messages contain a link to a video available at this address: videomeo.pw. As soon as the recipient of this message visits this page, another message window pops up requesting the visitor to download a Flash Player update to watch the video.Lawrence Abrams from Bleeping Computers writes that if the unsuspecting user downloads this update and installs it, nothing will happen and the video still won\u2019t be displayed because the installer is actually a malware. This Trojan immediately executes zaga.ps1, which is a PowerShell script that downloads a 7-zip archive, a CMD script and 7-zip extractor from the zahr.pw server.After downloading these files, the PowerShell script launches the CMD file first. This file extracts the sharchivedmngr to the %AppData%\\lappclimtfldr folder. Furthermore, when the user logs in, it configures the Windows to execute the mcrtvclient.exe automatically, which is a copy of the NetSupport Manager Remote Control Software. Upon launching, the NetSupport gateway connects with it at leyv.pw:11678 allowing the attacker to create a direct link with the infected computer remotely. The malware stays disabled until it receives commands from the C&C server.To check if your computer is infected with the Steam Trojan, you can inspect the %AppData% folder for the presence of folders that we have mentioned above, states Abrams.But, even if your computer is not infected with this virus, we urge that you never pay any attention to suspicious links and refrain from visiting links that offer videos or any kind of illicit content.

Previously the ransomware used to lock the screen using a hardcoded passcode but experts were able to perform reverse engineering to provide the victim with the passcode so that they could unlock their devices. However, in the new version the attackers have made it impossible to reverse engineer the passcode since the ransomware uses pseudorandom passcodes. Due to this, the victims aren\u2019t able to unlock their devices and are forced to pay the ransom.Attackers have also equipped this new version with a custom lockscreen that is joined with the device\u2019s lockscreen. This creates another problem for the victim. It must be noted that such Trojans are now being directly created on mobile devices prior to being distributed to unsuspecting users.But what is Pseudorandom passcode?When a device has been infected by this malware, it creates a custom System Error message window, which is pasted atop every visible user interface on the infected device.

Communications purporting to be from popular social websites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators are commonly used to lure unsuspecting victims. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware.Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one.Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to deceive users and exploits the poor usability of current web security technologies. Attempts to deal with the growing number of reported phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures. Many websites have now created secondary tools for applications, like maps for games, but they should be clearly marked as to who wrote them, and users should not use the same passwords anywhere on the internet.Phishing is a continual threat, and the risk is even larger in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Hackers could create a clone of a website and tell you to enter personal information, which is then emailed to them. Hackers commonly take advantage of these sites to attack people using them at their workplace, homes, or in public in order to take personal and security information that can affect the user or company (if in a workplace environment). Phishing takes advantage of the trust that the user may have since the user may not be able to tell that the site being visited, or program being used, is not real; therefore, when this occurs, the hacker has the chance to gain the personal information of the targeted user, such as passwords, usernames, security codes, and credit card numbers, among other things.Solution: \u27a2 Train people\u27a2 Use Anti-phishing software\u27a2 Browsers alerting users to fraudulent websites (like firefox and chrome)Eliminating phishing email:Specialized spam filters can reduce the number of phishing emails that reach their addressees\u2019 inboxes, or provide post-delivery remediation, analyzing and removing spear phishing attacks upon delivery through email provider-level integration.

The Komplex dropper component is saved to the system as \u2018/tmp/content\u2019.\u201dThe malware installs another executable file on the machine and this file is launched whenever the OS X system starts. There are numerous anti-analysis and sandbox checks involved in the functioning of Komplex, including a GET request which it sends to Google to check the Internet connection. Until a response is received from the HTTP requests sent to Google, the payload sleeps, which suggests that the malware can only communicate with its command and control servers through an internet connection.It is also reported that the PDF files are in Russian language and claims to contain future projects related information of the Russian Space program between 2016 and 2025 but still it cannot be confirmed which nation state is sponsoring this new campaign.Related: Dark Net Researcher Says Russian Hackers Attacking Big Companies in the USOlson identified another aspect associated with Komplex malware:\u201cDuring our analysis, we determined that Komplex was used in a previous attack campaign targeting individuals running OS X that exploited a vulnerability in the MacKeeper antivirus application to deliver Komplex as a payload.\u201dWhat we can conclude is that Komplex\u2019s complexity has proved that Sofacy has greatly improved its ability to perform multi-platform attacks over time.SourcePalo Alto Networks ", "authur": "Owais Sultan", "title": "OS X devices targeted by APT28 group with new Trojan called Komplex", "date": "September 27, 2016"}, {"topics": ["ProofPoint"], "body": "Ransomware has become a multi-billion dollar industry and every week we come face-to-face with one type of ransomware scam or another.

Yes, the IT security researchers at Morphus Labs have discovered a ransomware malware that\u2019s not only locking up victims\u2019 files but also encrypting their hard drives.Mamba ransomware is attacking computer around the globe; it is a Windows-based ransomware that was discovered to be infecting computers in Brazil, India and the United States.Renato Marinho, a researcher at Morphus Labs, states that phishing emails are the main cause behind such a massive distribution of Mamba. When a user gets trapped or hooked through phish email, Mamba takes over and infects the entire system then overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the computer.But what makes Mamba the nastiest of all ransomware is that unlike other Regular ransomware, which encrypts files and folders on your PC, Mamba encrypts the entire hard drive.\u201cMamba encrypts the whole partitions of the disk. It uses disk-level cryptography and not a traditional strategy of other ransomware that encrypts individual files,\u201d states Marinho.So when Mamba has encrypted the whole disk\u2019s partitions, you cannot even think about booting into the Windows again otherwise be ready to receive a password prompt. Needless to mention, you will have to pay a ransom in Bitcoin in order to get the password, decrypt the hard drive and use your computer again. The asked ransom is rough $600 or 1 Bitcoin. The ransom note is immediately presented to the victim upon rebooting the computer and it also contains the email address where the victim is supposed to ask for the key.\u201cYou are Hacked !

Previously, Petya ransomware was considered the nastiest as it also caused disk level damage by encrypting the machine\u2019s Master File Table. On the other hand, Mamba uses open source disk encryption tool dubbed as DiskCryptor for compromising the drive.We highly recommend visiting Morphus Labs\u2019 post on LinkedIn that covers other technical features of Mamba ransomware.Did you enjoy reading this article?

The stolen data includes names, emails, phone numbers, dates of birth, passwords and security questions with corresponding answers.\u201cThe account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (the vast majority with bcrypt) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers,\u201d Yahoo said in a statement.Yahoo is asking users to change security questions and password and keep an eye on any unusual or suspicious activity on their account. The ongoing investigation suggests that stolen information did not include unprotected passwords, payment card data or bank account information. Financial data was not stored in the affected parts of the system.Earlier today, Yahoo said it would address the issue of a data breach that took place a couple of years ago and the impression was that the company would be acknowledging the 2012 breach. It was revealed on 1st August 2016 that data from 200 million Yahoo users was being sold on the darknet. However, it now turns out the breach was massive. In fact, it looks to be one of the largest data breaches the world has ever seen. The hacker Peace_of_Mind is currently selling 200 million Yahoo accounts on the dark web and we may soon see that 500 million accounts also comes up for sale. Peace_of_mind is the same person who previously sold legitimate data from high-profile databases such as those of LinkedIn, MySpace, Fling,and VK.com.Must Read: Revealed: 65 million Pre-Yahoo Acquisition Tumblr Accounts Were HackedThe confirmation of the breach came at the wrong time. On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications Inc agreed to purchase Yahoo!\u2019s operating business for $4.83 billion. At this moment in time, Yahoo is working with law enforcement authorities and are urging users to consider using Yahoo Account Key, a simple authentication tool that eliminates the need to use a password altogether.This is a bad news for both Yahoo and Verizon, one can only hope the damage will not be as much as expected.Tony Gauda, CEO of Palo Alto-based security company ThinAir said the stolen data is not only damaging for Yahoo but also for the users as cyber criminals can now conduct large scale spear phishing and Cyber espionage campaigns.He said:\u201cThe breach at Yahoo couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for the company. According to their estimates, the attack affected at least 500 million users, which isn\u2019t great news when you\u2019re being assessed for acquisition. But the damage won\u2019t just affect Yahoo\u2019s eventual sale price. Attackers made away with 500 million telephone numbers, emails, birthdates and even security questions and answers. In terms of data, this is enough ammunition to conduct highly targeted spear phishing campaigns for years to come. Consumers are naturally wary of unsolicited calls, but when the caller knows your date of birth, and possibly the name of your first pet, the success of this form of scam increases dramatically. All in all, this breach underscores just how valuable data is. Whether it\u2019s a telephone number, an email address or credit card information, organizations need to do a better job of deploying security solutions that can assure data remains secure regardless of whether it has been exfiltrated from the network.\u201dAccording to Vishal Gupta, CEO of Seclore, a Mumbai-based security software company, Yahoo\u2019s data breach is devastating and especially when US presidential elections are just two months away.He said:\u201cThe fact that the Yahoo breach is being tied to state-sponsored actors is extremely alarming. With the potential to be the largest breach in history (at 500 million users were affected), the fallout from this attack could be devastating. For example, this nation now has access to 500 million phone numbers. With talk of Russian attempts to influence the election, it isn\u2019t difficult to imagine how access to the contact information and personal details, of that many potential votes, could be used maliciously. Imagine getting a call from a presidential campaign, except the information being shared by the caller isn\u2019t factual, and is actually intended to sway you towards a different candidate. We haven\u2019t seen this sort of activity yet, but it\u2019s within the realm of possibility. Unless organizations take stricter security measures and apply data-centric security solutions, hackers will always come up with inventive ways to leverage sensitive information for malicious purposes.\u201dVia: Yahoo Source: Tumblr Did you enjoy reading this article?

While this activity is no different than any company\u2019s attempts to create buyer personas that represent real consumers, government agencies often rely on more limited resources than organizations in the private sector. As a result, government organizations frequently face security risks \u2013 recently, a Philippines-based data breach affected more than 200,000 email addresses, 1 million passport numbers and 15 million fingerprint records belonging to voters.Must Read: Researcher Finds 191 Million US Voter Registration Records OnlineAwareness is a key factor in understanding \u2013 and guarding against \u2013 security risks, whether you\u2019re a government agency worker, a campaign volunteer or a voter. Below are three things every participant should know about data security in the coming election season:The data collected by political staffers isn\u2019t always sensitive \u2013 until you add personal information.As experts poll constituents to gather their opinions on political candidates and trends, the focus is usually on qualitative questions about timely issues. Campaigns then aggregate this data to connect certain preferences with voting habits \u2013 so they can discover, for example, if a voter\u2019s amount of children or annual salary correlates with her stance on a political matter. However, campaigns and political organizations also collect supporters\u2019 contact information, financial data for donations and even social security numbers in their work with the public. When that sensitive information is further informed by qualitative data, it paints a comprehensive picture of individual voters and compounds the security risk at hand.Data doesn\u2019t disappear when election season ends. Unless political organizations are forced to delete outdated information, they simply continue to collect data as new election seasons come and go. The third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) and open source aggregation solutions that help amass databases of voters\u2019 information and preferences can also retain access to that data. As a result, voter security can unknowingly exist at the mercy of the data security solutions and techniques that campaign staffers are using.Security belongs in voters\u2019 (and campaign managers\u2019) hands.Of course, voters can refuse to share certain information with campaigns, whether they decline to engage with political social media accounts, restrict the privacy settings on their web browsers or enact any other number of security measures. When dealing with sensitive data, it\u2019s always a good practice to go with one\u2019s gut \u2013 if a voter doesn\u2019t feel like she should share certain details with an organization or campaign, she should follow her instinct and avoid it. Voters can also write to their representatives to inquire about how personal information is being used, and if it\u2019s guaranteed to be destroyed in a timely and secure fashion.It\u2019s also critical that government agencies hold up their end of this agreement and follow those safe data management and disposal practices. By auditing their stored data and fully taking stock of its risks, they can ensure sensitive data is at a minimal risk of exposure. After all, campaign seasons are already fraught with political missteps and perceived gaffes. If a political organization overlooks the exposure of voters\u2019 private data, it risks losing trust and support from valuable constituents \u2013 for good.

The FBI\u2019s claim was that there was no possible way for the agency to unlock the attacker\u2019s iPhone and thus, it needed Apple\u2019s cooperation. The FBI also claimed that it was impossible to crack the data using NAND mirroring and thus, the agency needed Apple to cooperate. In the end, with the help of an Israeli company and a massive price of 1.3 million, the agency was able to unlock the iPhone. A researcher has now proven that it was easily possible to hack an iPhone 5c device with mirroring technique simply by using $100 hardware.Sergei Skorobogatov, a security researcher at Cambridge University, claims that it is possible to get through the iPhone 5c\u2019s PIN code security measure via NAND mirroring. In other words, he has proven that the FBI\u2019s claims were based on a false premise.The researcher proved it by removing the NAND memory chip from the circuit board of an iPhone 5c and rewrote the data repeatedly to track the number of times incorrect PIN codes have been entered on the phone\u2019s lock-screen. It is commonly known fact that the iPhone locks itself after ten incorrect PIN code attempts but Skorobogatov showed that with a cheap hardware device, any hacker can keep on entering the four digit PINs for as long as 24 hours.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});In a research paper published by Skorobogatov [PDF], the researcher explained that this is for the first time that anyone has publicly demonstrated the \u201creal hardware mirroring process for iPhone 5c.\u201d He further noted that \u201cAny attacker with sufficient technical skills could repeat the experiments.\u201dThis paper is a short summary of a real world mirroring attack on the Apple iPhone 5c passcode retry counter under iOS 9. This was achieved by desoldering the NAND Flash chip of a sample phone in order to physically access its connection to the SoC and partially reverse engineering its proprietary bus protocol. The process does not require any expensive and sophisticated equipment. All needed parts are low cost and were obtained from local electronics distributors. By using the described and successful hardware mirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry attempts. This is the first public demonstration of the working prototype and the real hardware mirroring process for iPhone 5c. Although the process can be improved, it is still a successful proof-ofconcept project. Knowledge of the possibility of mirroring will definitely help in designing systems with better protection. Also some reliability issues related to the NAND memory allocation in iPhone 5c are revealed. Some future research directions are outlined in this paper and several possible countermeasures are suggested. We show that claims that iPhone 5c NAND mirroring was infeasible were ill-advised.According to Skorobogatov, this technique can be automated and streamlined through a USB keyboard to enter PIN codes from a pre-programmed script.

It was established in 1968 for the purpose of routing calls as quickly as possible to the nearest emergency responder.On paper and in theory, this system appears foolproof and secure. However, a group of researchers from Ben-Gurion University, Israel, identified that it was possible to hack this system and disable it within an entire state for a prolonged time span through a simple Telephone Denial of Service or TDoS attack.According to the research group\u2019s findings, if bogus 911 calls are made through infected mobile phones to clog call center queues, this forces authentic callers to wait. The team believes that only 6,000 infected smartphones can do the trick in any given state while if there are 200,000 infected mobile phones then it would be possible to compromise 911 services in the entire USA. This doesn\u2019t seem like a unachievable task for malicious threat actors or cyber-criminals.must readUSNavy Facing 110,000 Cyber Attacks Every HourThe 911 system is considered to be critically important infrastructure by the federal government along with power grid, dams and water treatment plants. Mobile phones play a key role in the above-mentioned trick and it is a fact that among the 240 million calls made to 911\u2019s 7,000 call centers annually, about 70% come from mobile phones.The team also identified that the tactics could be used for days with techniques that will prevent authorities from stopping the fake calls. This would make the situation even worse as legitimate callers would find it difficult to get their calls answered. The team stated that:\u201cUnder these circumstances, an attacker can cause 33 percent of the nation\u2019s legitimate callers to give up in reaching 911.\u201dThe research findings were documented by the team in a paper, which has been passed on to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and also made public yesterday.must readSnoopSnitch\u2014 An App That Detects Govt\u2019s Stingray Mobile Trackers  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});DHS sent a copy of the research paper [PDF] to Trey Forgety, the National Emergency Number Association\u2019s director of government affairs, who stated that:\u201cWe believe the researchers have accurately characterized the problem\u201d pertaining to the 911 system, \u201cwe actually believe that the vulnerability is, in fact, worse than [the researchers] have calculated.\u201dAccording to Ben-Gurion University\u2019s Cyber Security Center\u2019s R&D head and Morphisec Endpoint Security\u2019s chief scientist, Mordechai Guri, the reason is that call centers and routers within any particular geographic location operate at a particular capacity. If the volume of the calls gets increased even by a small margin, it is possible to disrupt the whole system.It must be noted that the research has been conducted by Guri in collaboration with the center\u2019s head Prof. Yuval Elovici and Yisroel Mirsky.The 911 system has an extremely limited call capacity; in some cases, only 3 to 5 circuits are available to process incoming 911 calls for a certain 911 call center.According to Forgety, any hacker can overwhelm three to five circuits and \u201cI can do it with a pocketful of cellphones.\u201dTo disrupt the 911 system, a hacker needs to create a botnet of phones by infecting mobile phones with the same malware that lets an attacker control the devices. To infect a device, the attacker has to send the malware as an email attachment to text message. The attacker may also embed the malicious code in any application that the users of a mobile phone would feel interested in downloading and installing on their phones.Afterward, the hacker can send commands to the infected mobile phones via the internet or through secret text messages asking the device to repeatedly call 911. Since the firmware is responsible for initiating the calls and not the operating system, therefore, the calls can occur silently in the background and the owner might never notice. The call record will not even appear in the phone\u2019s log.But a 911 system carrier can stop such an attack by blacklisting phones that repeatedly call 911. This can be done using the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, which is stored in the SIM card of the phone or via the unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, which is assigned to every mobile device while it is under production.

This won\u2019t let a single router become a major point of disruption when such an attack is launched.Moreover, authorities can ask carriers to not process calls that aren\u2019t linked with a service plan.The FBI, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and other federal and state agencies have issued public warnings citing increases levels of TDoS attacks agains public and private organizations, click here to go through all.ViaTWPSourceBGUResearch Paper (Pdf)Arvix", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "US Emergency Phone System \u2018911\u2019 Can Be Hacked Through TDoS Attack", "date": "September 10, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Apple", "Computers", "hacking", "Infosec", "IoT", "Privacy", "security", "USB", "Windows"], "body": "If your PC is locked it does not mean that your credentials and data are safe.

However, Rob Fuller has proved that it is not as safe as we might think.Works, verified with LAN Turtle and Windows 10.

It only takes seconds to do so. They can easily crack the hash later and apply it directly in conducting network attacks.To prove his theory, Fuller used a $155 USB Armory, which is a flash-drive-sized computer device, and masqueraded it as a USB-to-Ethernet LAN adapter so that it transforms into a primary network interface. However, Fuller states that other cheaper devices like Hak5 LAN Turtle, which costs just $50 could perform the same task.The act is not as difficult at all because the OS automatically identifies and installs any new USB device including the Ethernet cards despite being in a locked state. Moreover, wired or fast Ethernet cards are configured automatically as default gateways.So let\u2019s assume if someone plugs in a USB-to-Gigabit-Ethernet adapter into any locked laptop running Windows OS, then the adapter will be installed and the laptop will mark it as the preferred network interface.Using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the OS configures the network setting whenever a new network card is installed, which means that cyber-criminals can use a rogue PC at the other side of the Ethernet cable that will pose as a DHCP server. Once this is successfully achieved, the attacker will control the Domain Name System (DNS) responses and will also configure a fake internet proxy using the Web Proxy Autodiscovery or WAPD protocol. This also hints to the fact that the attacker could get into a very privileged man-in-the-middle position to tamper or intercept the incoming network traffic on that computer. The reason is that locked computers keep generating network traffic, which makes it easy for attackers to extract account names and hashed passwords. The entire feat could be performed in no more than 13 seconds, states Fuller.Fuller recommends users of PCs and Laptops to never leave their workstations \u201clogged in, especially overnight, unattended,\u201d even if the screen is locked.Must Read: 8 Technologies That Can Hack Into Your Offline Computer and Phone#SecurityTip Don't leave your workstation logged in, especially overnight, unattended, even if you lock the screen.. ;)\u2014 Rob Fuller (@mubix) September 7, 2016Watch how it\u2019s done below:  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Must Read: Watch out for this USB Device Charger, it could be Keystroke Logger: FBIWe highly recommend going through Fuller\u2019s post here for more technical details about this findings.Featured Image Via: Flickr / Trammell Hudson", "authur": "Agan Uzunovic", "title": "A USB device can steal login credentials even if the PC is locked", "date": "September 9, 2016"}, {"topics": ["123RF"], "body": "The IT security researchers at MalwareMustDie have discovered a malware that is capable of infecting Linux-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and web servers to launch DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.Dubbed Linux/Luabot by researchers; the malware is coded in version 5.3.0 of Lua programming language and comes with capabilities such as infecting a system and issuing botnet commands.According to MalwareMustDie\u2019s official blog post, at the moment there are countless ELF malware that are surfacing on the internet.

But things have changed since then people use smartphone and tablets in their everyday activities. Smartphones now are more advanced and capable machines similar to computers, which can be used for banking transactions, online shopping, internet surfing, and many other tasks.The more people use their device for multiple tasks, the more synced they get with it. Your personal information, credit cards details, and passwords all get linked to your device which makes it more susceptible to hacks. Like the rest, Android is no exception. In the recent news at CBS-News, a security research firm found an android hack which they called \u2013 mother of all android vulnerabilities \u2013 a flaw that can allow hackers to hack your Android device with just a multimedia text.

You can use few easy steps to strengthen your device security.People tend to save passwords in their browser and apps to avoid re-entering their details, thinking who would access their phones except them? but hackers can. You should avoid saving passwords, especially in banking websites or apps.Android has a screen-lock feature on its every device. It provides a layer of security to your device. There are several types of screen lock which you can choose from including the password, pattern, face detection, and pin. Set up a strong password or pattern lock which makes it hard to access.App lock adds an extra layer of security to your device, which can prevent users from accessing your important apps, or in case if your device gets stolen or lost.You can use AppLock from Google Play Store for this purpose. It can lock apps which you don\u2019t want other people to access. Try setting up a strong password, and make sure you don\u2019t leave smudges on the device screen for someone to figure it out.Android works on the concept of sandbox. Each app requires a list of permissions before execution. Always read a permission before allowing it access e.g. an alarm app wouldn\u2019t ask you for mic access. This step is important because not all apps on Google play store are safe. Google does remove malicious apps from its store but there are millions of apps on the market. Before installing any app, do review the comments of people. It gives you insight on how the app really is.The flaw that exploited 950 million Android devices across the world and dubbed as \u201cStagefright.\u201d It used android\u2019s media playback tool which helps you download images and videos that people sends.

We first heard rumors aboutthis list two weeks ago and immediately began our investigation. We then emailed all users we believed were affected and completed a password reset for anyone who hadn\u2019t updated their password since mid-2012. This reset ensures that even if these passwords are cracked, they can\u2019t be used to access Dropbox accounts.If you signed up for Dropbox before mid-2012 and reused your password elsewhere, you should change it on those services.

Many try their hand at this to gain complete access to someone\u2019s Facebook profile. One California-based hacker tried his method, and subsequently discovered a method that exploits Facebook\u2019s password reset mechanism to hack into anyone\u2019s Facebook profile.Read: Some social engineering skills and Facebook will gift your account to hackersGurkirat Singh has revealed that he discovered a way to gain access to anyone\u2019s Facebook profile using a flaw in the social networking site\u2019s password reset mechanism. He said that the only way for anyone to reset their Facebook password is to use a randomly generated 6-digit code which Facebook provides them with once they request a password reset.The algorithm behind it produces a truly random number. But the fact that it is a 6-digit code means that there are a possible 106 = 1,000,000 combinations. These remain the same until they are used. Gurkirat exploited this fact.According to him, Facebook needs to store duplicate codes for multiple users if more than 1,000,000 users request a password reset. This means that more than two people have the same passcode. To use this for his purpose, Gurkirat Singh devised a way to send in 2 million password change requests to FacebookHe mentions that doing so is not simple, for it requires a way to change your IP to avoid being blocked by the company, as well as access to 2 million Facebook IDs. Since Facebook IDs are 15-digit long, Singh used 1,00,000,000,000,000 and made queries to Facebook Graph API to see which IDs were valid. This can only be done through authorized apps, and once a match is found, you can enter the ID in the URL like www.facebook.com/[ID]. The URL then automatically changes the ID to the username. This data was compiled into a JSON by Singh.To handle the problem of IP changing, Gurkirat Singh simply used a proxy server that listened to HTTP Requests and then assigned a random IP address to each request. He used a multithreaded script to simulate user behaviour when a passcode is required. The script requests a passcode to every user in the JSON file created earlier. Then the scripts were run to make the requests. It looked like this:After doing so, the 6-digit passcode needs to be matched using the Brute force technique. Singh added ID to the key \u2018u\u2019 and the successfully matched passcode to the key \u2018n\u2019 in the URL as www.beta.facebook.com/recover/password?u=\u2026&n=\u2026 Doing so returned a match.Doesn't get any simpler! #Hacking #Facebook https://t.co/2vi14s1Qtp\u2014 Gurkirat Singh (@GurkiratSpeca) August 25, 2016  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Read: Hacking Facebook Account by Simply Knowing Account Phone NumberOnce this was done, Singh added this matched passcode to the URL and was redirected to the password reset page.

On the other hand, Apple Inc. happens to be an extremely well-organized and alert organization when it comes to securing their devices.According to Citizen Lab and Lookout Security, Apple\u2019s iOS 9 has become the target of a spree of attacks by government-sponsored attackers involving a very advanced malware. Attackers tried to infect the iOS software with a sophisticated spyware to target dissidents and activists. The malware has been dubbed a Pegasus.The University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs\u2019 project Citizen Lab is a facility where researchers explore how power is exercised in the digital world to ensure global security. Citizen Lab in collaboration with Lookout Security created a report documenting the entire exploitation feat that was channeled towards iOS 9 devices. According to their analysis, the Stealth Falcon group is behind the attack because this is the group that has been involved in the targeting of internal and external critics of the UAE government. However, Citizen Lab could not identify any active malware that was launched by Stealth Falcon.

The messages were forwarded to the Citizen Lab, the firm then collaborated with Lookout Security to observe the malware and this is how the three zero-day vulnerabilities were identified on iOS 9.Read: Apple Deletes App That Informed Users If Their iPhone is HackedIt was also observed that the exploiters used these vulnerabilities to exploit iOS 9 devices and triggered a sequence of exploits that involved execution of binary then downloading and installation of the spyware payload. This disabled the automatic updates system fin iOS devices and also removed jailbreaks.Apple was quick to respond and immediately released an update to its iOS 9 system. The update has been released for the iOS 9.3.5 and it will patch the various zero-day vulnerabilities that have been deployed supposedly by governments. Citizen Lab and Lookout Security informed the iPhone maker about the spyware and the company quickly released the patch, within ten days to be precise.The research team at Citizen Lab identified the malware when it was sent to a human rights activist based in the Middle East. Apparently, there were three zero-day vulnerabilities about which the independent research firm notified Apple.It is being suggested that all iOS 9 devices be updated immediately with the new patch because the spyware is quite sophisticated and advanced. If successfully launched, the software hijacks an iOS device so that the attacker could monitor and control it remotely. Then the device\u2019s camera, microphone and audio calls would be intercepted, and this would be possible for conversations made by applications that are secured with end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp. Moreover, hijackers can easily steal images, monitor movements of the device owners and retrieve files.In an interview, Bill Marczak from Citizen Lab stated that \u201cWhat we have seen from looking at these exploits is that it seems that they have been in the wild a bit longer than the 9.3.3/9.3.4 timeframe.\u201dAs per the representative from Apple the company was identified about this vulnerability and it was immediately fixed with the iOS 9.3.5 patch. The company rep further stated that:\u201cWe advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.\u201dAs per Lookout\u2019s VP of Security Research and Response Mike Murray:\u201cThe \u2026 vulnerability chain is the first that anyone\u2019s seen of a one-click remote jailbreak of an Apple device. It\u2019s the smoking gun active mobile threat that we\u2019ve always known existed but didn\u2019t yet have proof of. This demonstrates that highly resourced actors see the mobile platform as a fertile target for gathering information about targets and regularly exploit the mobile environment for this purpose.\u201dIt must be noted that zero-day exploits are relatively common on iOS devices because governments can easily exploit any prevailing flaws in the iOS system. Such flaws, if identified by an attacker, can easily be sold to governments for quite an enormous amount, approx. $500,000 to $1 million.This would probably be the very first time when such a major attack has been identified and countered at such a quick pace. According to Marczak, Citizen Lab has been trying to track down the perpetrators of this attack from quite some time and then the breakthrough occurred when an activist sent them phishing links, which matched the domain that the research firm was following already.

It is indeed a trusted mode of identity verification for some. But University of North Carolina\u2019s team of researchers at the Usenix security conference held in Austin recently revealed that the facial recognition technology isn\u2019t quite perfect in this sense as it is widely believed and it is also exploitable.When probed further, the research team revealed that it is the Facebook profile pictures that are to be blamed for this exploitation. At the conference, the team also showcased the technique with which attackers can compromise systems that use facial recognition as their main verification method. They created three-dimensional facial models and successfully used them to deceive 4 out of 4 facial recognition systems. These models were basically created by using photos that were available publicly. The pictures were displayed via mobile virtual technology in order to trick facial recognition technology.Related: Researchers Develop Glasses To Protect You from Facial RecognitionThe aim of this research was to identify probably flaws in a technology that is deemed totally safe and reliable. The team of researchers also roped in 20 volunteers from various resources such as picture web indexes and informal communities including LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google+. Some of the participants were the members of the research team too.The media had a lot to say about the research presented at #sec16! Check out the coverage here: https://t.co/o8S4ozlIur\u2014 USENIX Security (@USENIXSecurity) August 19, 2016Once they had collected the images, they collected 3D models of the images and tweaked them in a way that the picture\u2019s facial animation and eyes were adjusted so that it seems like the person is directly looking at the camera. At least 3 and at most 27 photographs were received from every volunteer for tweaking purposes.Then the researchers tried to mold their virtual reality faces on 5 different verification frameworks including KeyLemon, Mobius, TrueKey, BioID, and 1D. The frameworks were easily available on a number of customer programming platforms like iTunes Store and Google Play Store. Four out of the five frameworks were easily tricked by the team with a success rate of 85 %. It must be noted that in case your own biometric information gets compromised or if it is available publicly, then it can be exploited easily. Especially, the photographs that are available all across the web are extremely vulnerable. For instance, Facebook has a wealth of facial biometric data.According to Wired, True Price, a UNC\u2019s computer vision\u2019s study author states that:\u201cWe could leverage online pictures of the [participants], which I think is kind of terrifying. You can\u2019t always control your online presence or your online image.\u201dRelated: FBI builds mammoth facial recognition database raising huge privacy concernsNot just that facial recognition is being used at tech firms, a number of consumer products such as smartphones and laptops are also using this technology for user verification. This is why the situation is so alarming. The hackers can use two-dimensional pictures, photos, and even 3D face replicas to compromise a system.But there are also methods with which the attacks can be prevented and the system can be improved. Such as scanning faces for human infrared signals.According to Michigan State University\u2019s biometrics researcher Anil Jain, face biometrics are quite easy to spoof in comparison to numerous other biometric modalities like irises and fingerprints. However, \u201c3-D face models may visually look similar to the person\u2019s face that is being spoofed, they may not be of sufficiently high quality to get authenticated by a state of the art face matcher,\u201d says Jain.The only solution is to embed hardware and sensors and adopt preventive measures by moving beyond mobile cameras and webcams.Related: Facebook Algorithm Recognize You in Images Even if You\u2019re Not Looking\u201cSome vendors\u2014most notably Microsoft with its Windows Hello software\u2014already have commercial solutions that leverage alternative hardware. However, there is always a cost-benefit to adding hardware, and hardware vendors will need to decide whether there is enough demand from and benefit for consumers to add specialized components like IR cameras or structured light projectors,\u201d says Price.Did you enjoy reading this article?

We can switch the lights and fans on and off without even leaving our chair. Smart sockets offer an opportunity to literally relax and become a couch potato. You can easily connect a variety of your electrical devices with smart sockets and operate them with a touch of your fingers. Such as thermostats, coffee makers, garage doors, smart TVs, security cameras and medical devices can be run through smart sockets.However, so much as it sounds great, however, an issue identified by Bitdefender IoT research team is enough to make you wary of these new-age smart sockets. According to the researchers, users are risking their physical security as well as their privacy by using smart sockets because the sockets are vulnerable to dangerous firmware upgrades that can be controlled remotely by hackers and this would expose users to all sorts of online and physical security risks.The analysis was obtained while conducting a research on the probable security concerns that are associated with the Internet of Things technology and the findings are startling.The smart socket\u2019s electrical switch is vulnerable to hacking. The electrical switch has to be plugged into a wall socket so that users could schedule connected electronic devices and switch them on or off from their smartphones.The function of smart sockets involves downloading of the corresponding mobile app via Apple Store or Google Play Store. As of now, over 10K Android users have already downloaded the app. Once downloaded, the user is required to select the option of installing a new plug and click on the home Wi-Fi network from the list of available networks. Then, the app would create a connection between the hotspot and its server. When the user enters the ID and password of his/her home network, the app will transmit it to its connecting device\u2019s hotspot and get itself registered to the server through UDP messaging. The information transmitted to the server includes the model, device name and MAC address of the home network along with the firmware version, local IP address, and the port information.Must Read: Hackers can hack Internet Connected Sex Toys and Record VideosNeedless to say that the information that the smart socket app transmits is quite valuable to attackers and this is why they are looking to intercept and obtain this bit of information. According to Bitdefender research team (Pdf), the hotspot contains a very weak username and password which is why the user is not alerted by the app regarding the associated risks with not changing the default credentials.Users are basically required to change the default credentials of the hotspot by clicking on \u201cEdit\u201d option that is found near the smart plug name on the main screen. If this is not done, your device would become vulnerable.Another thing noticed by the research team is that while configuring the app, the Wi-Fi network credentials are transferred in clear text across the network. Furthermore, the device-to-application communication that travels via the manufacturer\u2019s server is not encrypted but only encoded. It is a well- known fact that encoded communication can be reversed pretty easily through a publicly available scheme whereas the encryption mode keeps the data confidential. The final finding was that the device must be configured to transfer email notifications to the user whenever it switches from one state to the other.The abovementioned information hints on the fact that the smart sockets are vulnerable to two kinds of cyber attacks. Firstly, if the MAC address of the device is obtained by the hacker and the default password is weak then it is easy to gain remote control of the device. Then the attacker can re-schedule the device and/or gain all the information including user ID, email ID, and their passwords. This would, however, occur if the email notification feature is activated. Then the attacker can compromise the email account if two-factor authentication isn\u2019t enabled.Since the device hashes its credentials via the MD5 algorithm by the md5sum command, the method is vulnerable to command injection because the password isn\u2019t sanitized. So, when a hacker exploits this weakness, the old password gets overwritten and the embedded Telnet service can be opened. If this is achieved, the attacker can send commands to either start, stop or schedule the device and also to submit rogue commands such as running dangerous firmware or using the device to attack other computers within the local network.According to Chief Security Researcher of Bitdefender, Alexandru Balan, this type of  attack lets a hacker leverage the vulnerability worldwide.\u201cUp until now most IoT vulnerabilities could be exploited only in the proximity of the smart home they were serving, however, this flaw allows hackers to control devices over the Internet and bypass the limitations of the network address translation. This is a serious vulnerability, we could see botnets made up of these power outlets,\u201d says Balan.What we can recommend our users is to remain vigilant and perform all the security requirements while installing IoT devices. Users must always keep their passwords strong and immediately change the default login credentials.Previous cases when IoT devices were found vulnerable:1 Smart CarsA smart socket is not the only device posing a danger to users\u2019 security and privacy; in fact, Internet-connected cars can be hacked and DDoSed using smartphones.2 Security CamerasAnother research exposed the troubling state of IoT devices such as thousands of security and surveillance cameras in the US and millions worldwide vulnerable to cyber attacks such as DDoSing.3 Smart TVJust a couple of months ago researcher had exposed a shocking incident in which cyber criminals hacked Android based Smart TV being hacked for ransomware and alerting users about not visiting malicious sites on their Smart TV.4.

What we need to tell you is that this vulnerability can be used to target Android systems as well. What is particularly alarming is the fact that this flaw makes over 1.4 billion Android devices vulnerable to exploitation.According to Lookout, a grave exploit that is found in the TCP of Linux systems is equally effective on roughly 80% of all Android devices. Attackers can easily get unencrypted data traffic and also spy upon victims by degrading encrypted traffic.Android users have every reason to feel concerned because it is also possible that attackers launch a man-in-the-middle attack apart from spying on them. This would lead to compromising of their entire network because attackers would look for intercepting the traffic.What actually happens is that attacker can spy on people remotely and users who utilize unencrypted traffic or have disabled encrypted connections would be the likely targets. When the attacker gets information about a source and destination IP address, it will become possible to launch a man-in-the-middle attack. It has also been revealed that those android systems that run the Linux Kernel 3.6, which is like Android 4.4 KitKat, are most vulnerable currently. Needless to mention, this system accounts for around 79.9% of the entire Android fraternity. Analysts have assigned medium severity to this new threat by labeling it as CVE-2016-5696. We have already seen the patch for Linux Kernel but the preview of Android Nougat doesn\u2019t hint upon incorporation of a patched kernel. This means, those running an enterprise mobility program would make quite a few numbers of Android devices vulnerable to spying feats from attackers.To patch this flaw, it is important to update the Linux kernel used for Android. Until the patch is released for Android, what you can do to help yourself is to use encrypted communication platforms. Ensure that the websites and platforms that you browse are using HTTPS with TLS.

This report informs you about the latest of such attempts from scammers that make use of the popular game. In this new campaign, hackers are distributing a Pok\u00e9mon Go themed ransomware that is capable of encrypting all the data on the phone, data exfiltration and also creating backdoor Window accounts.The latest campaign was discovered by a security researcher Michael Gillespie and it was analyzed by Bleeping Computer team. Their analysis revealed that the new ransomware is although underdeveloped as of now but hackers are working on it and preparing for its widespread distribution campaign.How this ransomware is spreading?It can be distributed through PokemonGo.exe, which is an MS Windows based executable. The file displays a Pikachu icon as well. As soon as this file is installed, the process of encryption starts. Afterward, a registry key is added to hide the new Windows admin account, which has been aptly titled \u201cHack3r.\u201dMoreover, this key also copies itself to the root directories of all the fixed drives as well as creates an autorun entry to start so that if the users reboot, the ransomware will not be detected or deleted. That\u2019s not all; the registry key also gets added to removable drives and also creates an autorun file over there too to ensure whenever a portable device is inserted, the executable launches automatically.Experts believe that this particular ransomware shares similarities with last year\u2019s Hidden Tear project because it also was capable of backdoor encryption. The reason why experts are not so sure about its full development is that the ransomware\u2019s encryption system utilizes \u201c123vivalalgerie\u201d, which is a static encryption key. Furthermore, it attempts to create link with a C&C server, which is identified to be located at this IP address: 10.25.0.169#HiddenTear #Ransomware masked as @PokemonGoApp, sad Pikachu included.

This report is about another such malicious malware that has been designed to exploit defenseless Redis servers.According to the Russia-based antivirus software retailer Dr. Web the malware, which has been named Linux.Lady is designed with Google\u2019s Go programming language while the malware particularly targets those Redis servers that have been placed online without any passwords by system admins.Dr. Web states that:\u201cThis malware possesses the ability to collect information about an infected computer and transfer it to the C&C server, download and launch a crypto-currency mining utility, and attack other computers on the network to install its own copy on them.\u201dThe main purpose of this malware is to convert computers that use Linux into crypto-currency generators. It basically performs three key functions;* It gains information about an infected computer and sends it to the C&C server (command and control)* It downloads and launches a crypto-currency mining program after receiving a configuration file from the C&C server* Searches for other computers on the network to install another copy of the cryptocurrency miner program and looks for Monero, a type of cryptocurrencyThe configuration file is integral to the functioning of this malware because without it the malware cannot launch the crypto-currency mining program. Once this is done, it identifies the external IP address of the infected machine as well through the configuration file because the file contains information about special websites that locate the IP addresses.After performing these three tasks, the Linux.Downloader.196 script is downloaded on the machine in order to further download the key payload and then Linux.Lady sends out the system\u2019s data to the C&C server.Particularly, this malware affects the misconfigured Redis database servers that haven\u2019t been secured with a password. Reportedly, there are roughly 30,000 such servers operating online at the moment.Andra Zaharia, the security researcher from Heimdal Security Financial told HackRead that malware comes in many shapes and sizes, but its objective is always the same: to make as much money as possible for the attacker.\u201dCreating a Trojan to mine for cryptocurrency is a bold task, especially since it will heavily use the resources of the system it affects, so stealthiness may have to be compromised,\u201d she said.\u201dGiven the attack vectors use in this context, the importance of traffic filtering becomes evident once again. Blocking communication to C&C servers can greatly reduce the chances that an infection successfully takes over the system. Since the Trojan\u2019s architecture is all publicly posted on GitHub, cyber security researchers will most likely find a way to combat this threat before it spreads any further,\u201d added Zaharia.

Secondly, the hacker can alter the display, thereby displaying whatever the hacker wants to display.Cui warned that such a hack could affect billions of people around the globe given that most monitors have processors that are rather vulnerable to intrusions. Cui says that \u201cif you have a monitor, the high chances are that you are already hacked.\u201dBut there is a catch. Images load slowly if the malware is to be used to alter the display.

Like every other house in California, Bret-Mounet also installed a solar array on his home but he was immensely concerned about the level of security that it provided to his family. So, he decided to check it. To his surprise, there were certain vulnerabilities in the system, with which he could easily spy on the home and even hack the power supply of a thousand homes at least. This was possible due to the open Wi-Fi access point that was linked with the MMU (Management Unit) of the solar array.Read: 7 Unexpected Hacks of 2015, Thanks To DefCon and Black HatThe fact that the device utilizes an open Wi-Fi access point is quite disturbing because if someone can get the login password of web account from where the solar panels could be monitored then it becomes an easy job to spy on homes.But this was just the beginning!In October last year, he discovered some rather serious issues. He identified that his Tigo was being served via an unencrypted HTTP connection, which was secured with an extremely easy-to-guess username and password namely \u201cadmin\u201d and \u201csupport.\u201d To him, it was kind of a default login and he could easily manipulate the solar arrays of other residents with the same login information.But he didn\u2019t attempt to damage his solar array but instead searched on Shodan for other vulnerable arrays on the internet and was successful in finding other Tigo systems. He then prepared to act like a malicious attacker and using the login credentials he looked for other weaknesses of the system and gained root-level access to the controller of his solar panel. This meant that he could do just about anything to his panels.Then he identified that all Tigo devices have the same VPN connection.\u201cIf I\u2019d gone through that tunnel I would have reached any of them. I could have shut down a small-to-medium electricity generation facility in the aggregate, but my personal belief is that I could have used those as Trojan horses to attack targets that happened to have that type of solar panel,\u201d Bret-Mounet told Forbes.Read: 8 Technologies That Can Hack Into Your Offline Computer and PhoneFred Bret-Mounet presenting his findings in Def Con@fbret crushing it @DEFCON right now.

This system comes as a standard in some newer Samsung phones and works by means of translating credit card data into tokens.However, a security researcher has highlighted a flaw in this mechanism, and if that is exploited then it can allow the hacker to carry out fraudulent transactions on a different phone.Must Read: Samsung Galaxy Phones Prone to Hacking via USB Cable even if LockedThe issue has been highlighted by Salvador Mendoza, who said that the sequence generated by the tokenization process can be predicted as it is quite limited. He explained that after the app has generated the first token for a specific card, future tokens for the same card are easier to predict because they are not as secure. If the tokens are then stolen, they can be used in any other device to carry out fake transactions. This is the newest form of credit card skimming.Mendoza said that he had tested this finding by sending his friend, who was in Mexico, the token for his card. He said that despite the service not being available in Mexico his friend could carry out transactions from his card without any problem.The central task in this fiasco is stealing the tokens. Mendoza has also demonstrated how that can be done. He built a contraption that fit on his arm and could steal magnetic secure transmission wirelessly whenever he would pick up somebody\u2019s phone.This contraption would then email the token to his inbox, which he can later compile on another phone. In Mendoza\u2019s case, he loaded the token on an open-source magnetic stripe spoofer called MagSpoof and was able to carry out transactions.Mendoza has warned that all kinds of cards from all banks can be exploited in this manner with the exception of gift cards. This is because Samsung replaces the signal with a barcode scanning in case of gift cards. As for Samsung, they have not made any comment on whether they will be looking into solving this issue.They did issue a statement, though, saying that Samsung Pay has some of the most advanced technology in use currently, and if the company finds a potential vulnerability, it would do all it can to resolve it.Must Read: Be careful of what you say in front our Smart TV, warns SamsungIf you use Samsung Pay you should watch the video shown in this slide. pic.twitter.com/Jrfkrzuzq3\u2014 Al Sutton (@alsutton) August 5, 2016Watch the demo below (Spanish language)Must Read: Samsung Smart Refrigerator Hacked, Left Gmail Login Credentials Vulnerable", "authur": "Ali Raza", "title": "Samsung Pay Vulnerability allows Hackers to make Fraudulent Transactions", "date": "August 6, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Pexels"], "body": "Banner Health, a non-profit healthcare organization suffered a massive data breach on 17th June 2016 in which records of 3.7 million patients and staff were stolen.The organization noticed suspicious activities on their computers leading to two cyber attacks (between 7th may and June 23rd) from unknown hackers who stole patients and payment records including health insurance information, payment card data, doctors\u2019 data and details about customers who used organization\u2019s cafeteria.AZ Central reports that the organization plans to send letters to its 3.7 million affected victims in order to inform them about the large-scale data breach.

Fine, President & CEO of Banner Health Banner said in a statement that \u201cthe organization is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of information of our patients, employees, plan members and beneficiaries, customers at our food and beverage outlets, as well as our providers.\u201dThere has been a sudden increase in healthcare-related data breaches exposing the vulnerable cyberinfrastructure in the United States.\u201cAny business, organization or institution that keeps social security numbers, payment data, medical data and other personal information online is a potential goldmine for the cybercriminal because they can get a massive amount of valuable information in a very short period of time. Hospitals, medical practices, schools and even governments are at particular risk due to the high likelihood of handling private data that criminals would find attractive,\u201d said Paul Jespersen, vice president of Enterprise Business Development at Comodo, a global cybersecurity innovator. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, it is imperative for any organization to work with advanced cybersecurity solutions developers who work daily to stay a step ahead of the criminal by researching advanced persistent threat patterns and innovating back-end security technologies that protect endpoints and networks and keep IT environments safe.\u201dHistory of Healthcare insurance data breaches in the United States:The year 2015 was devastating for the healthcare industry where hospitals and medical insurance firms suffered back to back cyber attacks starting from MIE, the Indiana-based medical software firm exposing 4 Million user data (click here for more details), Excellus BlueCross BlueShield breach exposing 10 million customers (click here for more details), CareFirst Blue Cross and Blue Shield breach impacting 1.1 million customers (click here for more details) and hacking of Hollywood healthcare facility computers where cyber criminals demanded 9000 BTC ransom (click here for more details).In 2016 alone there have been some large-scale medical and healthcare-related data breaches in which cyber criminals have stolen a trove of data from several facilities across the United States and sold them on the Dark Net. It was just a couple of days ago when HackRead exclusively reported on a massive data breach suffered by Central Ohio Urology Group in which Ukrainian hackers stole and leaked 223GB of highly confidential and personal data of patients, doctors, and employees.John Christly, CISO, Netsurion, a provider of remotely managed security services for multi-location businesses criticized the poor security measures implemented by healthcare industry on their computer networks.\u201cIt\u2019s important for healthcare-related companies of all sizes and types to understand that their computer systems cannot be left unsecured, or these types of attacks will continue to happen.Hackers desire access to all parts of a healthcare enterprise, including the payment card areas of the food and beverage networks, the electronic medical record systems, and most every other part of the internal network including email and database systems. The more data that can be taken before anyone notices, the better for the hackers, who can then use the data they have taken for profit or for additional attacks on that same customer\u2013 or other services where users may be using the same passwords.These types of cyber attacks are all too common these days, where hackers break into a business network and remain undetected for days, if not weeks, and sometimes months before they are stopped. In that time, they can steal massive amounts of data from various systems they find on the network, as well as use weak user passwords that are found to escalate their permissions and do further damage\u2026 or they  may even go as far as leaving backdoors in place to allow for continued access, even after the initial hack is stopped.Once a large enterprise network has been breached in this manner, it is very important to do everything possible to eradicate any last effects of the hack. This includes forcing all users to change their passwords, and may even involve rebuilding servers and databases that were affected to ensure that no lasting effects are left behind that could allow future hacks to occur again.After the clean-up is completed, I would recommend that this type of company seek out vendors that can help them design a more segregated and secure internal network, protected by enterprise-class firewalls that are managed externally to the organization. It would be ideal to have file integrity monitoring tools, security information event management (SIEM), and integrated threat intelligence data coupled with the advanced firewall and segregated network design to help prevent, detect and respond to any issues that may happen in the future. These advanced toolsets should ideally be outsourced to a managed security firm that specializes in this type of service, which includes having expert threat researchers that are constantly looking for a new activity that could point to a hacker trying to steal data from your systems.\u201dIf you are interested in going through the public statement and security notice published by Banner Health click here.Top, Featured Image ViaPexels ", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Phoenix-based Banner Health Suffers Data Breach Affecting 3.7M", "date": "August 6, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Android", "app", "Google", "Hacking Cyber Crime", "Malware", "Prisma", "Privacy", "Scam", "TROJAN"], "body": "Prisma app for Android users was launched about a week ago, since then it has become one of the most used photo editing apps but with fame comes haters (just like when hackers added (Fake Pok\u00e9mon Go app on Android store containing RAT) and Prisma has caught the attentions of cyber criminals as IT security researchers at ESET have identified not one but several fake Prisma apps infecting users with different but dangerous trojan.The security team at Google Play store have since removed those apps but the fact is that 1.5 million users have already downloaded those infected apps.ESET also noted that most of the fake apps had no photo editing function rather they infected users\u2019 device with adware and malware.

The security of browsing the internet without a worry on all devices connected to a router has made it a popular pick among people looking to secure their home routers. However, with their new system for detecting malicious internet resources, SafeDNS will now surely be ranked right up with the top names in the market.Traditional systems to detect malicious internet resources rely on static lists that are fed to a database the systems rely on. While the safety industry has seen a shift from static lists to dynamic lists, SafeDNS has come up with a new system that can detect malicious internet resources with a precision of 98%. This model uses many diverse methods to detect malicious internet resources and keep SafeDNS users safe from them. The high precision of the new system means that almost all malicious resources will be identified and blocked before they can cause trouble. All the newly detected resources are added to the constantly evolving database that is maintained by SafeDNS. Since the implementation of this new system, SafeDNS database of malware has seen a rise of 66%.Must Read: How to secure your cyber infrastructure from threats like ransomware?The efficiency of this new system developed by SafeDNS is born out of analysing and processing the attributes associated with malicious resources that are found on the company\u2019s filtering service. They have found out certain patterns and attributes related to these malicious resources that help make the dynamic classifier so efficient. For example, it has been noted that malicious resources are usually requested by fixed groups of people in a limited time. Legitimate resources, on the other hand, are requested by occasional users rather than a fixed group.In an exclusive conversation with SafeDNS representatives, HackRead was told that: \u201cThe SafeDNS system of malware detection is actually just a part of a company\u2019s large all-encompassing project which will soon be announced in a separate statement.\u201dThe following techniques are used in the system:The system groups users according to the servers they request within each pre-determined time frame. The servers are blacklisted or whitelisted, depending on the frequency of their request. The data from subsequent time frames is matched to find if a resource is malicious. If the same group requests it, then there is a greater likelihood of the resource being malicious. Finding the similarity of the groups, therefore, is an important aspect in the working of this system, and SafeDNS has realised that the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient proves to be the most appropriate one.The 98% accuracy of this new system by SafeDNS has been made possible by adding the internet resources ranking method to the mix. \u2018Maliciousness\u2019 and \u2018legitimacy\u2019 ranks are computed on a continuous and mutually exclusive basis. The computation is done by analysing the shares of users who request particular resources in the pre-determined time frames.Must Read: Are You Ready for Firewall Protection for Your Car?The new system created by SafeDNS is definitely their most prominent hallmark. Dmitry Vostretsov, CEO of SafeDNS, reckons that the ingenuity and accuracy of this new system have taken SafeDNS on a much higher level than before, taking it at par with the big names in the industry. The company\u2019s ability to detect, as well as filter out, botnets and malware have improved significantly. SafeDNS has come a long way since being founded in 2010.

The latest discovery by security gurus at Intel security (previously McAfee, Inc) is a clear proof of that.Security experts at Intel noticed two new campaigns on July 22nd and July 27th respectively. These campaigns were smishing campaigns, which means these were SMS based and so tricky that they immediately managed to con a huge number of Apple users, approx. 7,500. According to experts, their security products identified that the campaigns were purely Smishing because of a suspicious SMS message being circulated via a US-based cell phone number.Thus, it becomes obvious that malicious links are being distributed via SMS. As soon as the users click on these links they are redirected to specially designed phishing pages or already hacked websites. These pages were created to steal authentic Apple login IDs and credentials of the users. The Smish messages have an email like format as there are email-specific fields in the message such as MSG and FRM. However, the malicious links have been found hiding behind short URLs like Bit.ly.Must Read: Chinese Bank Customers Targeted with SMS Phishing Campaign Recipients of these tricky text messages were informed that they needed to verify their Login details as soon as possible otherwise their account will be locked by Apple. Also, just like it happens in any malicious message/email, users were asked not to ignore the and do not regard it as spam. The message also contained a link that was supposedly leading them to the page where Apple needed them to verify their login credentials.Must Read:It has been identified that US-based users were the primary targets of these two campaigns that are running parallel to each other currently. Around 1,765 and 5,784 users have already clicked on the malicious link provided in the SMS messages from the two campaigns. This is the first time when researchers have found large-scale smishing attacks on Apple users. In the past, Android users were found under attack in which a phishing text message was infecting Android devices and replacing existing banking apps with a malware. In another research RuMMS malware was infecting Android devices through smishing.Must Read: Watch How An iPhone was Hacked with a Simple ToyApple or Android users, it doesn\u2019t matter as cyber criminals see you as a target for your bank account not for the smartphone or OS you choose.

Zdziarski also revealed that if an attacker has physical access to your phone the stored data can be accessed. Zdziarski\u2019s findings were discovered after he examining the disk images from an iPhone with the new version of WhatsApp. He noticed that the app keeps a forensic trace of the chat logs, even if you have deleted them. This creates a \u2018treasure trove\u2019 for those who are mining for data. However, in order to get the required data, one needs physical access to the device. He also mentioned that the data could also be recovered from remote backups.When you delete any data or chat, the app marks the said information as deleted. However, this data area is not overwritten by new data or chats, which can be recovered by forensic and recovery software. Zdziarski mentions that a new SQLite library is being used to code the new app, which does not delete the data permanently.Why is this a big deal?For many it may not be an issue however for some it can do a lot of harm as law enforcement agencies can get a warrant and ask Apple to hand over the deleted WhatsApp chat logs.Anyone with physical access to your phone could create a backup with it unless you have enabled fingerprint or passcode to access the device.

Rothken, who also happens to be the defense lawyer of Kim Dotcom, believes that Vaulin and his accused colleagues from Megaupload (now mega.nz) have a very strong case against the United States Government.For your information, last week Vaulin was arrested by the US law enforcement officials and KAT was shut down soon after, which definitely shocked every user of the popular website. Vaulin is currently in Warsaw prison but Rothken is certain that very soon he will be out.\u201cWe are working with local Polish counsel to try to get Artem out of the Warsaw jail so he can assist with his defense,\u201d says Rothken.Why was Vaulin arrested in the first place?The reason is that the US government filed a criminal complaint against Ukrainian-born Vaulin, charging him with criminal copyright infringement as well as money laundering. These charges have also been lodged against Kim Dotcom and Megaupload. It must be noted that the case of Megaupload is pending for quite some time now, about a decade. Remember, his arrest was made possible with out of the way help from Apple, Facebook and CoinBase who provided US authorities with IP address, login details and purchase details.In December 2015, a New Zealand District Court judge ordered the extradition of Dotcom and previous colleagues of Megaupload, which was promptly appealed by the involved parties. This resulted in a series of hearings that will be taking place in the coming weeks.We aren\u2019t much surprised that Vaulin has chosen to retain the same lawyer considering that the charges are similar. Rothken has already confirmed that he will be working with the local counsel to fight the case of Vaulin.Rothken seems to be the perfect option for Vaulin and the rest because he is well-known for his familiarity with criminal copyright infringement charges and knows a lot about the functioning of torrent sites. In fact, Rothken has already represented isoHunt in a similar case. Rothken is pretty sure that he will be getting the charges dismissed for Vaulin and co.According to Rothken, the complaint from the US government has no merit and the issue at hand is actually of civil liability and not of copyright infringement. He stated that \u201cTorrent sites and trackers are devoid of any content files. If any infringement occurs, it happens offsite and leaves Kickasstorrents behind. This type of copyright theory is known as secondary copyright infringement and there is no United States criminal statute for secondary copyright infringement \u2013 that type of theory is at most a civil liability issue,\u201d as reported by Torrent Freak.KAT continues to stay offline as of now but the KAT community is alive and kicking.

That\u2019s not all, the portal also educated users on how to protect their system and files within, advantages of backing up their data, the importance of safe web browsing, and dangers of downloading data from untrusted sites and emails.\u201cThe general advice is not to pay the ransom. By sending your money to cybercriminals you\u2019ll only confirm that ransomware works, and there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll get the encryption key you need in return.\u201dThe portal also allows users to scan their files to detect ransomware in their computers. In case the system is infected; the tool goes on with decrypting the files with a database containing 160,000 verified decryption keys, if matched the encrypted files will be decrypted however if the tool doesn\u2019t find a matching key the user will be out of luck but there is no harm in scanning files as it\u2019s for free anyway.We got in touch with Andra Zaharia of Heimdal Security, a known researcher and writer on ransomware-related issues who acknowledge \u2018No More Ransom\u2019 as a positive initiative to tackle cyber crime.

Unlike the Ashley Madison\u2019s case, Pornhub users are safe.Pornhub, with the intention of keeping its site secure, launched a competition for hackers and security analysts to find vulnerabilities in the site. Two hackers exposed vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit remotely to access users data. Pornhub rewarded the hackers $20,000 for revealing the weaknesses.PHP vulnerability exposed the users\u2019 data. The vulnerability assured the hackers code execution permission. In June, PHP patched the bug. The flaw connects to a use-after-free memory bug that is a result of PHP\u2019s garbage collection algorithm interaction with other PHP objects. The vulnerability thus allowed unauthenticated tracking of users activities in Pornhub.The most dangerous aspect of the bug is the fact that it allowed code execution on the site\u2019s servers. Hackers could erase all data on the site and download whatever data they needed, explained Ruslan Habalov, a computer science student in Germany. The student, studying at RWTH-Aachen University, was among the group that discovered the security flaw.Pornhub is not a site to take security flaws for granted given it has over 60 million visitors a day. If a hacker exploited the flaw, the results would be disastrous due to the volume of subscribers of the site.According to Evonide, Pornhub awarded the security researchers a $20,000 bounty and the grouped received another $2,000 prize from the Internet Bug Bounty Committee. They received the awards through HackerOne bug bounty program. The researcher reported the bug on May 30, a few weeks after Pornhub launched the bug competition.\u201cThe bug connected two seemingly disparate aspects of PHP to create vulnerability,\u201d Habalov explained. According to the computer science student, the site was transmitting data via PHP\u2019s unserialize function and PHP\u2019s garbage collection algorithm. The use-after-free PHP bug and the unserialize function PHP bug presence made code execution on Pornhub servers possible. Each of the bugs earned the two researchers $1,000 from the Internet Bug Bounty Committee.Pornhub was quick to respond to the flaw security report.

The country of 25 million people is still technically fighting the civil war that started more than 60 years ago. The regime has been imposed with heavy sanctions, and they do not provide an economy that allows most citizens to obtain the basic necessities to live. Reports say that electricity is sparse, and only lasts a few hours a day. The effect of this is obvious in NASA\u2019s pictures of the country at night, where North Korea appears as the only dark land mass in the region. Even the few privileged citizens who can afford consistent electricity and a computer, are forbidden from accessing the Internet. Only tourists and citizens with permission can access the internet, everyone else needs to use the \u201cKwangmyong\u201d Intranet, which is completely controlled and monitored by the state.According to Jean H. Lee, the Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang, citizens are only allowed to have \u201caccess to the state media, information sources that are vetted by the government, and picked and pulled from the Internet and posted to their intranet site.\u201d So, it seems unlikely that North Korea, a country that can barely feed its own people, could be a threat to the most technologically advanced countries in the world. However as the U.S. Office of the National Counterintelligence has asserted, \u201cdevelopment of the nation, rather than empowerment of the individual, appears to be driving DPRK [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea] efforts to develop domestic IT infrastructure and industry.\u201dIt is estimated that North Korea spends one-third of its total revenues on its military, and around 10% to 20% that is spent on the IT divisions. What is Bureau 121One of the most important divisions of the DPRK\u2019s militarized IT infrastructure is called Unit 121, an elite group of highly trained hackers, who are solely focused on cyber espionage and cyber crime. This unit is made up of the best and brightest minds, who have been handpicked from a very early age by the military to be trained in cyber warfare. These select units are rewarded with some of the most privileged lives in the country. Professor Kim Heung-Kwang taught computer science in DPRK for 20 years before defecting in 2004, says, \u201cit is a great honor for them. It is a white-collar job there and people have fantasies about it.\u201d They are the only citizens that are allowed to access the Internet or leave the country.Since they are cut off from the rest of the world, it is impossible to know just how big these divisions are growing, but South Korea claims that Unit 121 is now world\u2019s third largest cyber unit (right behind the US and Russia). South Korea has taken the threat very seriously and is in the process of training 5,000 people to their own cyber army to defend against the attacks from Unit 121. How North Korea started in Cyber WarfareThe first known cyber-attacks originating from North Korea started in the early 2000\u2019s. At first, they wiped disks, spread malware attacks, and performed DDoS attacks, but quickly, they are learning how to breach more significant networks. In 2013, the DPRK targeted South Korean media and financial institutions and knocked out 50,000 computers and servers in South Korea for several days at five banks and television broadcasters.In 2014, they were able to target hydroelectric plants and nuclear power plants with a Stuxnet-style attack\u2014an attack that can bring down power grids and other critical control systems and infrastructures. Professor Kim Heung-Kwang claims that these types of attacks could be catastrophic, \u201cAlthough the nuclear plant was not compromised by the attack, if the computer system controlling the nuclear reactor was compromised, the consequences could be unimaginably severe and cause extensive casualties.\u201d What Really Happened with Sony?Perhaps their most famous cyber-attack from North Korea was when they targeted Sony Pictures, before the release of \u201cThe Interview,\u201d a film about two reporters (Seth Rogen and James Franco) who travel to North Korea to assassinate Kim-Jong Un.The premise angered Korean officials so much, and they immediately condemned the film as, \u201cthe most undisguised terrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the DPRK of their mental mainstay and bring down its social system.\u201d In retaliation, a team called the Guardians of Peace (GOP) breached the systems of Sony Pictures and stole large amounts of sensitive documents and information, which they posted online. Then, they made threats to the theaters that planned to show the film, warning, \u201cwe will clearly show it to you at the very time and places \u2018The Interview\u2019 be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to\u201d and \u201cRemember the 11th of September 2001.\u201dUnder pressure, Sony decided not to release the film for several months. There was a lot of doubt that North Korea was behind the attacks. Most likely, people thought that North Korea was not capable of such advanced infiltration. But, the evidence is fairly undeniable. Director of the FBI, James Comey quickly cleared those doubts up when he said, \u201cWe could see that the IP addresses they used \u2026 were IPs that were exclusively used by the North Koreans. It was a mistake by them. It was a very clear indication of who was doing this. They would shut it off very quickly once they realized the mistake, but not before we saw them and knew where it was coming from.\u201dSince those IP addresses are only used in North Korea, and the citizens are not allowed to use them, it is obvious that the attacks were state-sponsored. President Obama immediately accused North Korea of the attacks, saying, \u201cI\u2019m, for the first time, authorizing targeted sanctions against individuals or entities whose actions in cyberspace result in significant threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States.\u201d This was unprecedented in US history, as no president had ever explicitly accused another country of mounting a cyberattack against the United States.  However, it further substantiates the idea that North Korea was behind the attacks, as the Snowden leaks revealed that the US had been implanting \u201cbeacons\u201d in several countries, which could pinpoint where an attack was coming from. How North Korea is Attacking NowEarlier this year, North Korean hackers attempted to steal nearly $1 billion dollars from the Bangladesh central bank. The hackers were thwarted from stealing it all by a few suspicious bankers in New York. However, they did manage to abscond with $81 Million dollars. The bank was protected by the cyber security firm Swift network, which protects more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions, and handles as much $5 trillion daily. The cyber security company was previously thought to be secure from attacks, but as Eric Chien, the director of security response at Symantec said of North Korean hackers, \u201cThey\u2019re showing skills that we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201dThen, only a month ago, South Korean police reported that more than 140,000 computers from South Korean firms and government agencies, were hacked by North Korea. They also discovered malicious code was planted for a massive cyber-attack in the future.This hack was started back in 2014, and they were only detected after they tried to steal defense-related material. North Korea was successful in obtaining more than 42,000 documents, 40,000 of which were defense-related. This included some blueprints for F-15 fighter jets.What Will Future Attacks Look Like?North Korea needs to be considered one of the greatest threats to our way of cyber life in the modern world. On the flip side, because of its isolation, the hermit kingdom is so isolated from everything, that it is virtually hack-proof, thereby confounding anybody bent on retaliation.Now, cyber operations have become an extension of their international strategy. As Kim Jong-Un allegedly said, \u201cCyber warfare, along with nuclear weapons and missiles, is an \u2018all-purpose sword that guarantees our military\u2019s capability to strike relentlessly.\u201d", "authur": "Clyde Stanhope", "title": "How Bad is the North Korean Cyber Threat?", "date": "July 20, 2016"}, {"topics": ["anonymous", "Brazil", "DDOS", "Encryption", "Facebook", "internet", "Police", "Privacy", "security", "WhatsApp"], "body": "The online hacktivist Anonymous Brazil said on Tuesday (19th) that in a collective cyber attack the group has shut down the official website of the Court of Rio de Janeiro in response to its decision to block the messaging app service WhatsApp in Brazil.Anonymous Brazil confirmed the attacks on their Facebook page stating that the site remained offline until 14:40 Brazil time.The action of hackers occurred after the Court of Rio ruled to block WhatsApp because the application does not share information about criminal investigations. The decision was made by judge Daniela Barbosa de South of the 2nd Criminal Court of Duque de Caxias County, according to Folha.\u201cThe court order was not met, despite repeated three times, thus the adoption of coercive measures determined by this judgment,\u201d says Souza in the decision that activated the immediate block on WhatsApp.WhatsApp, on the other hand, does not share users\u2019 conversation with law enforcement agencies in Brazil and argues that it no longer stores users\u2019 conversations. In April 2016, it implemented \u201cend-to-end\u201dencryption (in which only people in the conversation can read messages). With that said, it is impossible to disclose the data.HISTORYThis is not the first attempt by authorities blocked WhatsApp in the country. In February, a judge in Teresina (PI) ordered to ban the messaging service. The reason behind the ban was WhatsApp\u2019s refusal to provide information to the police about an investigation.In May this year, a decision of the Court of Sergipe determined that WhatsApp will stay off the air for 72 hours. The process culminated in the decision by the judge Marcel Montalban, in March, to arrest Diego Dzodan, vice president of Facebook in Brazil, the company that owns the app, for Latin America. The judge wanted the company to transfer information on an interstate drug gang for an investigation by the Federal Police, which the company refuses to do.Telecom companies like Tim Hi, Vivo, Claro, and Nextel- decided to abide by the court decision. Non-compliance would be subject to a daily fine of R $ 500 thousand.The president of Anatel, John Rao, WhatsApp blockade was \u201ca disproportionate decision because it punishes all users.\u201d For him, \u201cWhatsApp must comply with the court orders within the technical conditions it has. But of course, blocking is not the solution.\u201dWhatsApp works with computers registry and this makes the lock work quite complicated for the telcos, which can be punished if they fail to implement fully the lock.In December last year, WhatsApp had been blocked in Brazil for 48 hours due to a criminal investigation. At the time, the telcos were surprised to have received the court order although the decision did not last 48 hours.In February, a similar case occurred in Piau\u00ed, when a judge also ruled a WhatsApp lock in Brazil. The goal was to force the company that owns the application to work with state police investigations related to cases of pedophilia.At the time of publishing this article, the targeted site was back online while WhatsApp service was also restored in the country.", "authur": "Ryan De Souza", "title": "Anonymous DDoS Rio Court Website for Blocking WhatsApp in Brazil", "date": "July 20, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Protection1"], "body": "The recent Lizard Squad hack which resulted in a lot of CCTV cameras targeted and hijacked by a DDOS attack has highlighted the need for better security cameras. A study conducted by Protection1 shows how many security agencies do not take things seriously, Protection1 report.The Lizard Squad hack is not the first instance of security cameras being overridden and used to spy on people. The widespread hack has brought to light once again just how many security cameras are under operation without any sort of protection, making them sitting ducks for any hacker with moderate skills. The CCTV cameras in the US that were attacked by the Lizard Squad hack were used in a wide range of areas from home security and traffic cams to cameras in banks and restaurants.The ease of carrying out this attack prompted security company Protection1 to investigate the matter. The rising levels of sophistication of hacking tools and the incompetence of security personnel to keep in touch with hackers have made hunting much simpler for hackers. In a bid to understand just how serious the situation is, Protection1 analyzed 6,000 unsecured or open cameras all over the United States of America to find out which companies do not take your security seriously. They pulled data from the cameras using insecam.org and mapped and analyzed the locations to generate results.\u201cThe risk inherent to unsecured cameras has widespread implications, from the average home, to corporately operated facilities. This vulnerability can convert a valuable security tool into a liability \u2013 so raising public awareness around this issue was really important to our company.\u201d Brandon Fleming, Marketing Manager at Protection 1 told Hackread.Map shows which state have more unprotected cams The report highlights which states have the highest number of unprotected security cameras per 100,000 residents. Heavily populated cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, and New York, were revealed to be under serious threat of being attacked in a fashion similar to the Lizard Squad hack. Despite many of these cities having areas where high-profile activities like international trade or technological innovation take place, the level of security of the cameras is a joke. So lax is the security that most of them do not even have any sort of password protection, which means that they are literally up for exploitation by malicious users.Talking about the states with the highest number of unprotected cameras, North Dakota tops the list, with 7.8 unprotected cameras for every 100,000 residents. District of British Columbia is second with 5.8. But the most troublesome finding of Protection1\u2019s study was the alarming state of security cameras in Washington DC. Despite the huge number of important activities taking place in the capital of the United States of America, there are many unprotected and unsecured security cameras in operation in the city.Outdoor parks and parking lots seem to have the highest number of unprotected cameras in use, while residential households are not too far behind. The fact that 15% of American households have security cameras that do not even have password protection means that their own security cameras can be easily used to spy on them. Their own security system can be used against them. As for businesses with the highest number of unprotected security cameras, industrial buildings, and retail or clothing stores are the top two, with 38.19% and 35.23% of the businesses running unprotected cameras respectively.If you want to protect yourself, it is always good to have password protection for your security cameras. Use strong passwords which are difficult to crack so that you remain protected. The need for not using out-of-the-box settings cannot be stressed upon enough. But despite securing your home cameras, there is no guarantee that the grocery or retail store you frequent will take similar steps.

Countries who are not under threat are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine.

Sometimes, crooks use it to run scams but this time, researchers have exposed a sophisticated malware campaign targeting innocent Skype users in which the main aim is to steal their private data.

The scam campaign heavily makes use of the popular communication and video calling application Skype. Reportedly, cybercriminals are utilizing the malicious Qarallax RAT or QRAT and Skype is being used as a tool for distributing this malware. These criminals act as US officials offering to help people looking to get visas for the US.Vila stated that this software is around 6 months old. The team discovered it while it was available for renting on the internet\u2019s underworld marketplace the Dark Web. The asking price for renting out this malicious software for five days was only $22 while there was an option of leasing it for a whole year for just $900.How does the malware works?What happens is that when a Skype user searches for finding out more information about application requirements of US visa, various links start popping up apart from the authentic platform to contact UStraveldocs-Switzerland. These other links also appear genuine but in reality, these are merely distributors of malware because users can confuse them as ustraveldocs-Switzerland and the \u2018i\u2019 present in the middle leads to the fake Skype account. The malicious code containing file is actually a Java application, which runs on operating systems through the Java Runtime Environment.When the malware gets downloaded on the targeted computer, it can easily store keystrokes, clicks and mouse movements along with taking control of the webcam.In fact, researchers at F-Secure also identified a copy of another open source malware application called LaZagne to be stored on the same server on which QRAT was stored.

The weakness can be exploited with security bugs and this can lead to criminals breaking into the vehicle\u2019s system, playing with the vehicle\u2019s settings, get its battery drained and steal it all together.The manufacturer, Mitsubishi, suggests that users mush turn off Wi-Fi in order to check the system\u2019s issues. As of now over 100,000 Outlander cars have been sold.The threat was identified by Munro of Pentest Partners when he was going to pick up his kids from school and observed an unusual Wi-Fi access point appearing on his smartphone\u2019s list of available networks. He immediately got the hint that the Mitsubishi Outlander, which belong to his friend, is having issues as his friend showed him the car and the associated app as well as how to use the app to control various features of the vehicle. While speaking with the BBC, Munro stated that he was just playing with it and \u201csoon realised it was vulnerable so I stopped.\u201dLater, Munro himself bought an Outlander and started examining the internal metrics of the car and how the vehicle communicates with other networks. Usually, car owners having vehicles that support web-based service which support applications for connecting to the network lock them remotely when not controlling them. To do this, commands are required to be sent to the car pass via the server\u2019s prior to being addressed to the car through the mobile network. So, if the same command is replayed, it was possible to turn off the vehicle\u2019s alarm.But this isn\u2019t the case with Mitsubishi cars as it lets apps talk to cars through an onboard Wi-Fi network but there are some underlying loopholes that make the network vulnerable. According to Munro, there is a distinct format for the access point\u2019s name of the vehicle, which leads to the location of various Hybrid models of Mitsubishi because these are logged on websites which capture the names of their access points.Munro stated in his blog post that \u201csome were spotted while driving and others when parked at their owner\u2019s house. A thief or hacker can therefore easily locate a car that is of interest to them.\u201dAfter identifying the flaws, Munro in collaboration with his Pen Test Partners\u2019 security firm colleagues conducted a further investigation involving the use of popular techniques, which let them interpose between the owner and the car and observe the ensuing data flow. This access was then used to replay commands sent to an Outlander, which allowed them to enable lights flash and drain the battery\u2019s charging by modifying the settings.The revelations were \u201cshocking\u201d for the team as it was identified that the car\u2019s alarm could also be turned off using this replay attack.Watch the demo belowHistory of car hacks: 1 > Mitsubishi is not the only company feeling the burn from security flaws.

Then boom \u2013 you can spy on a target\u2019s location, calls and texts.\u201dThe people behind Ability\u2019s creation are specialists in the off-air interception of satellite and cellular communications and this is why this new system surpasses all other currently available espionage technologies.This new system is extremely effective as it can capture all sorts of mobile phone traffic including GSM, LTE and MTS without needing to be in close proximity of the device or the approval of the mobile service provider.But how does this system perform such exceptional feats?It actually exploits a flaw present in the Signaling System No. 7 or SS7, which is the international telecom standard that illustrates how information is exchanged across digital networks from public switched telephone networks (PSTN) for cell phones. The \u201cSignaling Points\u201d of SS7 and the nodes that utilize out-of-band signaling to facilitate services like call forwarding.A yet unknown third party is responsible for licensing this vulnerability for Ability and providing access or information about the SS7 flaw. Thus, intercepting any mobile phone for law enforcement is easily possible by simply tapping into the targeted phone.But, this latest installment in encouraging fool-proof espionage campaigns for conducting criminal investigations has again ignited debate on the breach of user privacy through the use of such software.

Another example is the Mackeeper website which didn\u2019t implement basic security settings on the database. The past and current data breaches are all related to MongoDB servers.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The data was actually discovered by Hacked-DB\u2018s cyber security analysts Yogev Mizrahi and Oren Yaakobi who told HackRead that there are 110 IP addresses that were breached and to every IP there is a dedicated folder with the DB data, proof and general information. The data varies from server to server but reveals a lot of sensitive info such as username, password, full name, phone, address, 627,296 email addresses and more.\u201cOur system is designed to capture, parse and alert interesting data posted by hackers on the clear web and the darknet.

The successor of the LAMP Stack, an already infamous vulnerable platform, many thought this new one is more secure, yet it\u2019s almost the exact same as its predecessor. MySQL typically replaced by NoSQL and the main database configuration managed by MongoDB.This project will focus solely on this poorly configured MongoDB. I\u2019d like to mention exactly how easy it is to  infiltrate within these types of networks but also how chilled sysadmins tend to be with their security measures. Or should I say, lack thereof?In a lot of instances, the owners don\u2019t bother checking for open ports on their newly configured servers, not only that but they also don\u2019t concern themselves with establishing a proper authentication process. (Just a simple username/password). Typical open ports: 22, 53, 80, 81, 110, 137, 143 443, 465, 993, 995, 3000, 8080, 27017, 3306, 6379, 8888, 28017, 64738, 25565.This can basically lead to anyone infiltrating the network and managing their internal data without any interference. You don\u2019t even have to elevate your privileges, you just connect and have total access. You can create  new databases, delete existing ones, alter data, and so much more.I am leaking more than 36 million accounts/records of internal data from these types of networks to raise awareness about what happens when you decide not to even add a username/password as root or check for open ports, let alone encrypt the data. Each server folder has within it a plaintext file with the general info of the target, a screenshot  from within my MongoDB client with me having access and of course the leaked data in the raw text. There are a few million accounts with passwords and the rest is private person data or other types.This should serve as a cruel reminder of what happens when you don\u2019t use proper security hygiene. And don\u2019t worry if you thought this is the only vulnerability out there, guess again. The old ones remain as well.This is not the first time when TeamGhostShell has come up with such a massive hack.

Previously we informed our readers that the European Union (EU) is working on a continent-wide applicable policy relating to the use of ID cards for using social media accounts. Later, Breitbart London also confirmed the news. Now, we are the first ones to tell you that it is official as the news is out.According to the European Commission website, EU wants to implement a policy urging users to only use the state-issued National ID cards to log into their social media accounts, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and believe it or not, even Uber.The EU\u2019s Digital Single Market vice president and ex-communist Andrus Ansip from Estonia is the one behind this unreasonable idea of using national identity cards for logging into social media platforms and other online services.Estonia is a former communist state and probably the only Baltic country that has a highly developed National ID card system in the whole world. On its state website it is described that the National ID card is \u201cmuch more than simply a legal picture ID, the mandatory national card serves as the digital access card for all of Estonia\u2019s secure e-services.\u201dThe information was made public through a leaked document (Pdf) titled \u2018Online Platforms and the Digital Single Market\u2019 that belonged to the EU and was prepared on 25th May. In the documents, it was identified that the commission will soon be asking citizens to use their national ID cards for account logins. This rule will be applied all across the Europe.It must be noted that the information has now been uploaded on the official website of the European Commissions as well after it was leaked. The website also gave the reason behind this policy, which is that:\u201cIn particular, online platforms need to accept credentials issued or recognized by national public authorities, such as electronic ID cards, citizens cards, bank cards or mobile IDs\u2026 for every consumer to have a multitude of username and password combinations is not only inconvenient but becomes a security risk.\u201dThe new policy regulations, as per the European Commission website, will come into effect under the eIDAS Regulation. It will be implemented in the 28 Member States of the EU and will replace the eSignature Directive formulated about 15 years back. In fact, it is being touted as a policy aimed at modernizing the trust services\u2019 legal framework.Under the new policy, the EU will encourage the use of national E-ID cards for accessing e-services but it won\u2019t make it mandatory.However, the policy is receiving immense criticism from members of European Parliament and other political and related sectors. Diane James, European Parliament member and spokesman of Home Affairs for the UK Independence Party states that this policy is more like an \u201cintrusive and seemingly authoritarian EU interference in social media and the internet,\u201d which in James\u2019 opinion isn\u2019t new.", "authur": "Ryan De Souza", "title": "Privacy concern over EU\u2019s plan to introduce ID cards for social media", "date": "June 4, 2016"}, {"topics": ["BBC"], "body": "Around fifty cybercriminals have been arrested by Russian authorities on charges of stealing 1.7billion roubles.

The attacks were seen after an individual who was asking to be from a non-existent organization contacted one of the reporters who compiled the report.

After a user clicks on the URL, it surveys the operating system on the computer and then takes the user to a benign website. After further investigations, it seemed the URL had been sent 402 times, and 73 percent of the time it was directed towards UAE issues. However after further study of the URLs that were sent to the various people, only the one sent to Rori Donaghy actually contained a definitive spyware.The spyware sent to Donaghy showed that there had been a network of 67 active commands and controls which were contained in the spyware. This shows that there might be a broader and wider use of the malware that was contained in Donaghy\u2019s email than is known out there.

The algorithm used in hashing the passwords was not revealed however by the company when they disclosed the breach.Since the announcement by Tumblr of the data breach, the information seems to be circulating around on the underground Internet market. A hacker is known as Peace, who is also known for the LinkedIn hack, said he had the data pertaining to the Tumblr breach and was selling it on the dark market of the Internet.

The project is very big, and the group has had to meet and talk to other people so that they could get ideas and information on how to further the project in the right direction.The team that was at the hack fest says that they started the event by designing a so called, distributed random number generation which would be on the Tor network. This kind of a number is one that is used in systems where multiple computers can work together and generate the single random number. It does this in ways that can not be predicted beforehand. This kind of systems can then be used to help with the next generation onion services and help them with injecting unpredictability and also elevating the security system.As we know, this kind of distributed random generation number is the first of its kind on the Internet.

The company\u2019s head of Advanced Technology and Projects group Daniel Kaufman identified that this new technology will be firstly tested with various \u201clarge\u201d financial institutions. The testing will most likely begin from June. Kaufman was the head of the group which is responsible for creating Trust API on the basis of another project that has been codenamed Project Abacus.Must Read: Fingerprints are History \u2014 Brain Scans will be the Next-Gen PasswordsProject Abacus was developed last year to eliminate the use of passwords using a superior and better method that combined various weak indicators into a strong piece of evidence that makes use of your personality. These pieces of evidence might include biometric indicators, which, no prizes for guessing, include our face shape, voice, movements and the way we swipe or type on the screen. The software will run in the background of your phone, which will help it in tracking your movements and matching them with its indicators so as to determine who is using the phone.Google has, thus, built Trust API much on the lines of this particular project and this year, the company has clarified that the service will be accessible to third parties as well, which will allow organizations to verify someone\u2019s identity using biometrics. As of now, financial institutions like banks will be using it for the purpose of verifying customers that use Android apps to log in but by the end of 2016, this technology will be open for all.We do know that individually biometric system is not as reliable and cannot offer fool-proof security on web-based services. Such as, facial recognition technology is already a part of a majority of Android devices but in comparison to this, the fingerprint scanner is more secure. However, Google\u2019s Trust API tends to combine them both, which will result in making biometric system 10 times secure, just like a fingerprint.The software won\u2019t give a binary answer as is the case while we enter passwords the system will provide a score that will inform the user how confident the device is about the authenticity of the owner. Institutions that require higher score will program the API in such a way that it will ask for additional data that may be another biometric verification or an ole-style password.The API seems to be similar to the program being developed by the London-based Nok Bok Labs.

The future lies in methods of authentication without passwords, which consumers clearly favor, both in terms of convenience and enhanced security.\u201dLack further added that:\u201cBiometric authentication is a powerful enabler, allowing businesses smart enough to deploy it to significantly increase rates of registration, gaining data and insight about their customers, while also increasing customer security.

The new malware strain which was discovered by the Kaspersky researchers uses new methods to avoid detection.When installed, the malware goes to work and checks whether the file system is FAT32 or NTFS. If the file system is FAT32 then the malware will put a malicious executable file in the C:\\Windows\\System32 directory. If the file system is NTFS then the malware will write in the NTFS data stream, therefore, corresponding to the Microsoft Extension for all Financial Services (XFS) service.This method that the Skimer malware uses makes the use of forensics for analysis a very difficult thing, the Kaspersky researchers said.The new malware changes the legitimate XFS executable SpiService.exe which is usually found on the ATM, therefore, making it\u2019s own components available which is named netmgr.dll. These actions allow the Skimer malware to communicate with the PIN pad and the card reader.Skimer lies dormant until activated by the insertion of a card. The card has to have Track 2 data on it.

But not so fast, hold your guns and listen to these following reasons to not upgrade.1> If you are still using obscure peripherals \u2013 Windows 10 has been out for a year already now. Most of the peripheral part makers on the market have already released devices which can go along with the software. But to make sure just check if all your peripherals on your computer are Windows-10 friendly before you download the new Windows. Keyboards, mice, speakers and graphic cards might be affected.2> Privacy \u2013 If you are concerned about the privacy of your system, then you should put a hold on the upgrade. Windows 10 has had its privacy concerns share over the last months. The software is by default set to send reports back to Microsoft. It can also show ads on your Start Menu and many more things. Most of these things can be blocked, but not all. The software gathers more data than all that were before it. A price for Cortana maybe.3> Do not upgrade if your system does not meet the requirements \u2013 System requirements for the new Windows version are not that excessive. But it might just happen that for some reason your computer might not meet the requirements. If you have low hard disk space, then you might have something of a problem. 20GB of space is needed to install the 64-bit version of Windows 10 and a 1Ghz or faster processor equipped with a 2 GB RAM. For the 32 bit version of the Windows 10 system, free space of more than and including 16 GB is needed with 1GB RAM. A DirectX 9-capable video card is also needed.4> Your love for Windows Media Center \u2013 The change to Windows 10 comes at a price. All the apps and interface that you are used to in the previous versions will go. The photo viewer is not there anymore rather replaced with Photos app. The media center is also gone in the new version. For some this might be a problem and for others, there is no harm.5> OneDrive \u2013 The way Windows 8 and Windows 10 arrange the OneDrive files is different. If you are used to the previous versions, you might have some problems readjusting to the options in Windows 10. The software gives you an option to view in File Explorer or not. After that, you won\u2019t ever see your files in File Explorer again.6> Refusal to be forced \u2013 Windows updates have always been something people look forward to. They bring with them security updates and patches which are good. But upgrading every time a fix is out is also wrong. Older versions of Windows gave you free will to update when you want. Windows 10 automatically does this for you. Disabling this measures is a hassle.7> If it\u2019s not broken don\u2019t fix it \u2013 This is true for all the lovers of previous versions. Do not be forced to update to the new Windows 10 just because they are going to remove free updates soon. Do what feels good to you.8> Not many Universal apps \u2013 The chaos about all the new Windows apps that would be present in Windows 10 is a lie. The Windows App Store is still a wasteland full of crappy apps.EndNoteThe final decision to upgrade to the system or not is entirely yours, but before you make any decision, it is best to know all the information about what you are getting into.

This means, instead of phish attacks, we must now fear our data being stolen by malicious actors and then having to pay a hefty sum of cash or digital currency to get the unlocking key so that we become able to access the information.Isn\u2019t it ironic that we need to pay for retrieving the data that was stored by us and belonged to us as well in the first place? Because this is how crypto-ransomware works. It basically conducts the attack by tricking users into accessing compromised websites or opening files that contain malware and as soon as the computer gets infected the contents of their computer get encrypted and locked. The user cannot access anything on his or her computer unless the hacker sends the unlocking code/key, which is done after paying the asked ransom.It is true that popular email service providers such as Yahoo and Gmail are always trying to filter out phish scams especially those involving ransomware but still some scammers manage to evade their implemented security measures. However, Gizmodo reports that an email was received by the staffers at the House of Representatives regarding the increasing rate of ransomware on Yahoo Mail and Gmail. The contents of this particular email are as follows:Email content:In the past 48 hours, the House Information Security Office has seen an increase of attacks on the House Network using third party, web-based mail applications such as YahooMail, Gmail, etc. The attacks are focused on putting \u201cransomware\u201d on users\u2019 computers. When a user clicks on the link in the attack e-mail, the malware encrypts all files on that computer, including shared files, making them unusable until a \u201cransom\u201d is paid. The recent attacks have focused on using .js files attached as zip files to e-mail that appear to come from known senders. The primary focus appears to be through YahooMail at this time.The House Information Security Office is taking a number of steps to address this specific attack. As part of that effort, we will be blocking access to YahooMail on the House Network until further notice. We are making every effort to put other mitigating protections in place so that we can restore full access as soon as possible.Please do your part to help us address this recent attack and protect the House Network going forward by following proper cyber practices at all times.
