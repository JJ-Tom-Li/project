Since at last July 2017, these two malwares have been used in previous campaigns attributed to APT34, which FireEye says \"loosely aligns\" with reports of a group commonly referred to in cybersecurity circles as OilRig.\n\nTo launch the campaign, the attackers sent a spear phishing email with a malicious Rich Text Format file attachment to its intended victim, whom FireEye does not name. This file is specifically crafted to exploit CVE-2017-11882, which was previously discovered in the Microsoft Equation Editor component of Microsoft Office and subsequently patched on Nov 14.\n\nAccording to FireEye, the exploit \"corrupts the memory on the stack and then proceeds to push the malicious data to the stack.\" At that point, the malware overwrites the function address with a instruction that calls for a certain function that creates a child process, which in turn downloads a malicious script from a domain.\n\nThis script contains a PowerShell command for downloading a dropper, which sneaks the final payloads, as well as several other key components, into the directory C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Microsoft\\java\\.\n\nOne of the two last-stage payloads, the backdoor POWRUNER is capable of communicating host data to its command-and-control server, including information about the logged-in user, hostname, network configuration data, active connections, process information, local and domain admin accounts, an enumerations of user directories, FireEye reports. Additionally, the malware can\u00a0capture and store a screenshot of a victim's system.\n\n\"Recent activity by APT34 demonstrates that they are capable group with potential access to their own development resources,\" FireEye states in its blog. \"During the past few months, APT34 has been able to quickly incorporate exploits for at at least two publicly vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882)\u00a0to target organizations in the Middle East. We assess that APT34's efforts to continuously update their malware, including the incorporation of DGA for C2, demonstrate the group's commitment to pursing strategies to deter detection.\"\n\nIn a separate blog post on Friday, Palo Alto Networks addressed a recent bevy of CVE-2017-11882 exploits found in the wild. The company's\u00a0Unit 42 researchers\u00a0note that since Nov. 20, Palo Alto has identified \"thousands of attempted attacks which exploit this vulnerability....\" One recent attack targeting European organizations involved an email with an attached fake invoice document, which when opened executed an infection chain sequence resulting in the a final payload of the information-stealing trojan FormBook.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft issues emergency fix for Malware Protection Engine flaw", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/microsoft-issues-emergency-fix-for-malware-protection-engine-flaw/article/713051/", "title": "Microsoft issues emergency fix for Malware Protection Engine flaw", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "December 08, 2017", "body": "A remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MPE) that could lead to memory corruption and if exploited allow attackers to seize control of the system after executing arbitrary code in the LocalSystem account, has been patched, according to an advisory issued by Microsoft.\n\nThe vulnerability impacts numerous Microsoft security offerings, including multiple versions of Microsoft Exchange, Forefront End Point Protector and Defender. Once in control of a system, an attacker would be able to install programs as well as change or delete data or create accounts that have full user rights.\n\n\u201cTo exploit this vulnerability, a specially crafted file must be scanned by an affected version of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine,\u201d the advisory warned, noting there are multiple ways to put a \u201cspecially crafted file into a location\u201d that the engine scans, including using a website, email or IM message to deliver the file. \u201cIn addition, an attacker could take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content, to upload a specially crafted file to a shared location that is scanned by the Malware Protection Engine running on the hosting server.\u201d\n\nIf real-time protection is turned on in the affected antimalware, the MPE automatically scans files, including specially crafted files, which gives attackers a way to exploit the vulnerability.

(Certificate pinning is when developers choose to only accept certificates signed by a single pinned CA root certificate.)\n\nResearchers Chris Stone, Tom Chothia, and Flavio Garcia observed this very scenario in a series of apps that collectively have been installed millions of times, including those issued by Bank of America and HSBC, as well as the popular TunnelBear VPN. Altogether, the nine affected apps were: Bank of America Health, TunnelBear VPN, Meezan Bank, and Smile Bank for Android, and HSBC, HSBC Business, HSBC Identity, HSBCnet, and HSBC Private for iOS. All of the companies involved repaired the flaw prior to the publishing of the paper.\n\nThe researchers uncovered the vulnerability after analyzing 400 security-sensitive Android and iPhone apps using a new semi-automated tool they developed called Spinner, which is designed to identify, on a large scale, instances of improper hostname verification in apps that perform certificate pinning.\n\nPrior to this tool, testing for this scenario \u201cwould typically require the tester to own a high security certificate from the same issuer (and often same intermediate CA) as the one used by the app,\u201d the report explains. But Spinner does not require purchasing any certificates. \u201cBy redirecting traffic to websites which use the relevant certificates and then analyzing the (encrypted) network traffic, we are able to determine whether the hostname check is correctly done, even in the presence of certificate pinning,\u201d the report explains.\n\nFifteen other applications that do not practice certificate pinning were also flagged by Spinner, either for failing to perform a hostname check or for issuing a self-signed certificate. These apps, also now patched were: Emirates NBD, Kotak Bank, Al Rajhi Bank, Santander UK (biocatch), and CommBank Property for iOS, and American Bank of Sydney Ulster Bank NI, Ulster Bank RI, BofAML Research Library First Financial Bank, ACU Mobile, Bitcoin.co.id, Britline, Opal Transfer, and Aman Bank for Android.\n\nIn response to the study, Bank of America claims that some of the information in the report was dated.\u00a0\u201cThe vulnerability identified was resolved in Bank of America's Health app nearly two years ago in January 2016. The app is no longer available as of June 2017. At no time was customer information impacted,\u201d said a company spokesperson via email.\n\nIn their paper, the researchers explain that their process constitutes \u201ca black-box method to detect apps... that, when using TLS, pin to a root or intermediate certificate but do not check the hostname of the host they connect to. Instead of trying to get certificates from all possible certificate authorities, which we argue is infeasible, we build a tool that makes use of the Censys Internet scanning search engine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the certificate for a target domain, the tool queries for certificate chains for alternate hosts that only differ in the leaf certificate,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThe tool then redirects the traffic from the app under test to a website which has a certificate signed by the same CA certificate, but of course a different hostname (Common Name). If the connection fails during the establishment phase, then we know the app detected the wrong hostname. Whereas, if the connection is established and encrypted application data is transferred by the client before the connection fails, then we know the app has accepted the hostname and is vulnerable.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ios/topic/47255/", "topic_name": "iOS"}]}, {"news_name": "MailSploit bugs let spoofed emails bypass DMARC, spam detectors", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mailsploit-bugs-let-spoofed-emails-bypass-dmarc-spam-detectors/article/712043/", "title": "MailSploit bugs let spoofed emails bypass DMARC, spam detectors", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "December 05, 2017", "body": "A collection of vulnerabilities dubbed Mailsploit, found by German security researcher Sabri Haddouche in 30 types of email client applications \u2013 from Apple Mail to Mozilla Thunderbird \u2013 lets hackers bypass anti-spoofing mechanisms, including DMARC.\n\nMailsplot lets attackers \u201cdisplay an arbitrary sender email address to the email recipient,\u201d wrote Haddouche, who used potus@whitehouse.gov in a demo posted to reddit. Since all email headers must contain only ASCII characters, \u201cthe trick resides in using RFC-1342 (from 1992!), a recommendation that provides a way to encode non-ASCII chars inside email headers in such a way that it won't confuse the MTAs [Mail Transfer Agents] processing the email,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, most email clients and web interfaces don't properly sanitize the string after decoding, which leads to this email spoofing attack.\u201d\n\nBecause iOS is vulnerable to null-byte injection and macOS is vulnerable to \u201cemail(name)\u201d injection, Haddouche said, referring to a demo, the domain part of an original email can be hidden or removed, then replaced, by employing \u201ca combinations of control characters such as new lines or null-byte.\u201d\n\nThe exploits take advantage of the how the email sender name is displayed to bypass DMARC. \u201cThe server still validates properly the DKIM signature of the original domain and not the spoofed one,\u201d the researcher wrote. \u201cWhile MTAs not only don't detect and block these spoofed email addresses, they will happily relay those emails as long as the original email seems trustworthy enough (the attacker can therefore ironically profit from setting up DMARC on that email address).\u201d\n\nAs a result, Haddouche said, the spoofed emails are \u201cvirtually unstoppable.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhishing attacks are one of the most effective ways for bad actors to infiltrate and infect organizations,\u201d\u00a0said Bob Noel, director of strategic relationships and marketing at Plixer.\u00a0MailSploit\u00a0is the latest example of how users can be tricked into opening emails with malicious payloads and links. End users must be trained to no longer implicitly trust emails they receive from either known or unknown senders. Given the continued high rate of phishing success, IT departments should implement Network Traffic Analytics platforms to monitor all network traffic and have access to forensic data when users fall victim to phishing attacks. This visibility enables organizations to understand what happened, return to normal, and protect themselves against the spread of malware like ransomware.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect example of how phishing campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted,\u201d said Eyal Benishti, CEO and founder of IRONSCALES. \u201cAs is the case here, fraudsters are frequently adopting spoofing and impersonation techniques in a quick, easy, and incredibly successful way to lure their potential victims into a false sense of security. As a result, it is becoming virtually impossible for end users to identify these phishing emails as they land in inboxes across the workforce.\u201d\n\nBenishiti recommended that users detect and deflect phishing messages by:\n\n1. \u201cChecking for \u2018spoofing' through sender policy framework (SPF) records, display name,\u00a0email address and\u00a0domain similarity.\n\n2.\u00a0 Augmenting the representation\u00a0of senders inside the email client by learning true sender indicators and score sender reputation through visual cues and metadata associated with every email.\n\n3.\u00a0 Integrating automatic smart real-time email scanning into multi anti-virus, and sandbox solutions so forensics can be performed on any suspicious emails either detected, or reported.\n\n4.\u00a0 Allowing quick\u00a0reporting via an augmented email experience, thus helping the user make better decisions.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Updates address vulnerabilities in Apache Struts versions 2.5 to 2.5.14", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/updates-address-vulnerabilities-in-apache-struts-versions-25-to-2514/article/712037/", "title": "Updates address vulnerabilities in Apache Struts versions 2.5 to 2.5.14", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "December 05, 2017", "body": "A pair of security updates released by the Apache Software Foundation patch vulnerabilities in Apache Struts versions 2.5 to 2.5.14 that would let a remote attacker take control of a system, according to a US-CERT alert.\n\nThe Apache Security Bulletin\u00a0S2-054\u00a0resolves a outdated JSON-lib library in the REST Plugin, which would let miscreants execute denial of service (DoS) attacks \u201cusing malicious request with specially crafted JSON payload.\u201d\n\nThe organization advised administrators to upgrade to Apache Struts 2.5.14.1 or use the Jackson handler rather than the default JSON-lib handler.\n\nApache Security Bulletin S2-055\u00a0patches a Jackson Deserializer in the Jackson JSON library.

\n\n\u201cFailing to follow responsible disclosure guidelines puts everyone at greater risk,\u201d said Erlin. \u201cPublic disclosure like this, especially with a major vulnerability, ensures the widest possible distribution of the information among malicious attackers, and instills a sense of urgency to attack before a patch is available.\u201d\n\nErlin said \u201corganizations should step up monitoring of their Mac systems for root login activity as a mitigating control while they apply the recommended workaround.\u201d\n\nCraig Young, a Tripwire computer security researcher, noted that Apple has had a number of security issues. \u201cRecent years have not been good for anyone relying on OS X for security.\u00a0 Already in 2017, researchers revealed flaws allowing an attacker to extract passwords from the keychain (CVE-2017-7150), from APFS encrypted volumes (CVE-2017-7149), and from WiFi captive portals (CVE-2017-7143),\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cIn 2016, researchers also demonstrated the ability to discover FileVault 2 encryption passwords through a crafted Thunderbolt device (CVE-2016-7585) as well as some other password mishandling bugs (CVE-2016-4670 and CVE-2016-1851, for example).\u00a0 The OS X kernel's security model was also effectively broken last year when Google Project Zero researcher, Ian Beer, described a new class of OS X bug allowing dozens of vectors for privilege escalation.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe company should \u201cseriously re-evaluate how they perform quality assurance testing as there is really no excuse for releasing macOS with some of these blatant security failings,\u201d said Young. \u201cLooking at the history of macOS releases tells a pretty interesting story about the kind of quality coming out of Cupertino recently.\u201d\n\nFor the last couple of years after Apple has released a major update for their operating system in September, the company \u201chas had to follow-up the major release with a quick succession of fixes for issues detected after launch,\u201d said Young.\u00a0\u201cIn fact, this is the third year in a row where it looks like Apple will have three versions of their OS released before the end of the year.\u00a0 Some of these were because of buggy behavior, while others were due to gaping security holes like revealing the actual password in a password hint field.\u201d\n\n",

study of 90 cryptocurrency mobile applications available on Google Play found that 90 percent of them contain security vulnerabilities or privacy risks.\n\nWeb security company High-Tech Bridge conducted the research, using dynamic, static, and interactive testing to search mobile apps for weaknesses, including the top ten mobile flaws listed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).\n\n\u201cWe took the most popular cryptocurrency mobile applications from Google Play from the \u2018Finance' category and tested them for security flaws and design weaknesses that can endanger the user, his or her data stored on the device or send/received via the network, or the mobile device itself,\u201d High-Tech Bridge reported in a Nov. 29 blog post.\n\nThe company divided the apps into three groups of 30: the most popular apps with a maximum of 100,000 installations, the top apps with up to 500,000 installations, and the top apps with more than 500,000 installations.\n\nWhen combined together, 84.6 percent of the apps were determined to contain at least two high-risk vulnerabilities, while 84.3 percent were found with a minimum of three medium-risk bugs.\n\nNearly half of the apps, 47 percent, were deemed vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, while 48 percent were found to contain hardcoded sensitive data such as passwords or API keys. And 46.6 percent were said to feature functionality that can endanger user privacy.\n\nMoreover, researchers observed that 80.3 of the apps lacked any kind of hardening or protection on their back-end APIs or web services, while 19.3 percent have back-ends that can be exploited with the POODLE vulnerability.\n\nMany of the apps have encryption weaknesses as well: 61 percent send data without any encryption over HTTP, while 37 percent were found to have insufficient encryption altogether.\n\nFinally, 100% of the applications don't have any reliable protection against reverse-engineering, the study reveals.\n\nThe three vulnerabilities from the OWASP that were found most frequently across all 90 cryptocurrency apps were improper platform usage, insecure data storage, and insufficient cryptography.\n\n\u201cFor many years, cybersecurity companies and independent experts were notifying mobile app developers about the risks of \u2018agile' development that usually imply no framework to assure secure design, secure coding and hardening techniques or application security testing,\u201d said Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of High-Tech Bridge. \u201cHowever, this is just the tip of the iceberg. A mobile app usually contains much less exploitable vulnerabilities than its backend. Weakness in a mobile application may lead to breach of the mobile device or its data, while a vulnerable API on the backend may allow attackers to steal the integrity of users' data.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Flaw in macOS High Sierra allows easy access", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/flaw-in-macos-high-sierra-allows-easy-access/article/710164/", "title": "Flaw in macOS High Sierra allows easy access", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 28, 2017", "body": "A root access flaw in Apple's macOS High Sierra\u00a010.13.1\u00a0\u00a0makes it possible for anyone to log into the system by typing \u201croot\u201d into the name field.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra,\u201d tweeted security researcher Lemi Orhan Ergin, who first discovered the flaw. \u201cAnyone can login as \u2018root' with empty password after clicking on login button several times.\u201d\n\nErgin noted in another tweet that \u201cYou can access it via System Preferences>Users & Groups>Click the lock to make changes.

That code would then be executed in the user's web browser, redirecting the victim to a second link that would open the evil coupon.\n\nUsing this technique, malicious actors would be able to bypass AliExpress's protections against cross-site scripting, explains Check Point in both a blog post and corresponding report authored by researchers\u00a0Dikla Barda, Roman Zaikin and Oded Vanunu,\u00a0head of product vulnerability research.\n\nA fake AliExpress coupon would have a strong chance of fooling a victim because the retailer \u2013\u00a0a subsidiary of Alibaba \u2013\u00a0commonly uses coupons to entice shoppers, even asking recipients to enter their credit card details for easier online payment and checkout. In the fake version, however, the customer's details would be sent directly back to the attacker's server.\n\nDuring their investigation, Check Point researchers learned that they could manipulate a parameter found within an AliExpress subdomain in order to execute JavaScript code from that subdomain. But the payload would not run, because AliExpress' protections against cross-site scripting attacks prevented the researchers from sending the payload directly to a victim.\n\nHowever, \"AliExpress uses only a simple method to thwart these kind of attacks... The method involved checking the referer header of the request and if the referer was not set or was incorrect then the request would be denied by the server,\" Check Point explains in its blog post, noting that a\u00a0referer \"is an HTTP header that identifies the URL of the webpage where the request was requested from.\"\n\nTo get around this, the researchers knew they needed to send their malicious link from an approved, trusted AliExpress URL instead. \"In order to achieve that, we looked for links in AliExpress that redirected to a second link in AliExpress, a link that we could replace with our own malicious link,\" the blog post explains.\n\nResearchers found such a link, and shortened its URL so it wouldn't look suspicious.

increasing calls for improved transparency of the tools government uses to determine the security flaws that it can use in its cyber efforts and which to disclose, the White House Wednesday made public the vulnerability equity policy (VEP) process created by the Obama administration but mostly shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\u201cOur national capacity to find and hold criminals and other rogue actors accountable relies on cyber capabilities enabled by exploiting vulnerabilities in the digital infrastructure they use,\u201d White House Cyber Czar Rob Joyce wrote in a blog post. \u201cThose exploits produce intelligence for attribution, evidence of a crimes, enable defensive investigations, and posture us to respond to our adversaries with cyber capabilities.\u201d\n\nBut government faces a challenge \u201cto find and sustain the capability to hold malicious cyber actors at risk without increasing the likelihood that known vulnerabilities will be exploited to harm legitimate, law-abiding users of cyberspace,\u201d he said, noting that the interagency VEP process for \u201cnewly discovered cybervulnerabilities that are not yet in the public domain\u201d was developed \u201cin recognition of these competing considerations.\u201d\n\nThe process is intended to improve transparency, represent the interests of a multitude of stakeholders, establish accountability both of the process and its operators, and encourage the \u201cinformed and vigorous dialogue\u201d critical to government's function, Joyce said.\n\nThe VEP, according to a charter released by the White House, \u201cbalances whether to disseminate vulnerability information to the vendor/supplier in the expectation that it will be patched, or to temporarily restrict the knowledge of the vulnerability to the [U.S. government], and potentially other partners, so that it can be used for national security and law enforcement purposes, such as intelligence collection, military operations, and/or counterintelligence.\u201d\n\nThat determination, though, is only one part of the VEP. \u201cOther options that can be considered include disseminating mitigation information to certain entities without disclosing the particular vulnerability, limiting use of the vulnerability by the [U.S. government] in some way, informing U.S. and allied government entities of the vulnerability at a classified level, and using indirect means to inform the vendor of the vulnerability,\u201d according to the charter, which defines the method for \u201cevaluating competing considerations\u201d so that a decision can be made. \u201cAll of these determinations must be informed by the understanding of risks of dissemination, the potential benefits of government use of the vulnerabilities, and the risks and benefits of all options in between.\u201d \n\nThe charter establishes an Equities Review Board (ERB) for interagency deliberation and VEP determinations that includes representatives from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Treasury Department, State Department, Justice Department (including the FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Secret Service, Energy Department, Defense Department of Defense (including the National Security Agency), U.S. Cyber Command, Commerce Department and CIA.\n\nThe NSA will serve as the VEP's executive secretariat.\n\n\u201cVulnerability management requires sophisticated engagement to ensure protection of our people, the safeguarding of critical infrastructure, and the defense of important commercial and national security interests,\u201d Joyce wrote, adding that the charter offers a \u201crepeatable and defensible\u201d method for balancing those interests. \u201cBy making it public, we hope to demonstrate to the American people that the Federal Government is carefully weighing the risks and benefits as we carry out this important mission.\u201d\n\n",

"author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 14, 2017", "body": "Microsoft's November Patch Tuesday rollout included patches 53 flaws, 20 rated critical, spread across a variety of products, including Edge, Internet Explorer, Windows and Office.\n\nWhile no zero days were found this month the monthly security update does include four publicly known, but not exploited, vulnerabilities. These are CVE-2017-11848, CVE-2017-11827,CVE-2017-11883,CVE-2017-8700, said Gill Langston, Qualys' director of product management. Despite the public nature of these issues Langston suggested focusing on several found in Edge and IE.\n\n\u201cFrom a prioritization standpoint, focus on the fixes for CVE-2017-11836, CVE-2017-11837, CVE-2017-11838, CVE-2017-11839, CVE-2017-11871, and CVE-2017-11873, which all address the Scripting Engine in Edge and Internet Explorer, especially on laptops, and other workstation-type systems where the logged in user may have administrative privileges. Microsoft lists exploitation as More Likely for these vulnerabilities, especially if a user is tricked into viewing a malicious site or opening an attachment,\u201d he told SC Meida.\n\nDustin Childs, of The Zero Day Initiative, believes Microsoft Advisory ADV170020 that was part of the company's Defense in Depth Update series may have something to do with the revelation last week that the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol is being targeted. The cybergang APT28 has been spotted using this method leading Microsoft issued a warning on DDE attacks on Nov. 9.\n\nThe advisory notes that attacks can take place via email and corrupt Word, Excel, Publisher and Outlook documents. An attack is conducted through email when an attacker sends the intended victim a specially crafted file with a name designed to entice the victim to open it. Unlike other attacks that use Word docs, with DDE the victims do not have to manually enable macros for the payload to download. Instead, infection happens automatically.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft hasn't provided a wealth of information about this update other than saying it provides a defense-in-depth issue. I say \u201cissue\u201d here because they didn't assign a CVE to the bug. Microsoft claims attackers may be abusing the feature, but it's not a vulnerability per se. Hopefully, the update provided by this advisory restricts the abuse of this \u201cfeature\u201d in some manner,\u201d Childs said.\n\nLangston also noted that while none of the Windows issues carried a critical rating, he did suggest focusing on CVE-2017-11830 and CVE-2017-11847, as they address a Security Feature Bypass, and a Privilege Elevation respectively.\n\nChris Goettl, product manager at Ivanti, recommends giving CVE-2017-11827 and CVE-2017-11848 and extra hard look as these effect IE and Edge.\n\n\u201cCVE-2017-11827 affects both IE and Edge.\u00a0 This vulnerability could be used in a phishing email or an exploiting website to convince a user to open a malicious attachment or content.\u00a0 Once exploited the attacker would gain equal rights to the current user.\u00a0 If the user is a full administrator the attacker would gain control of the affected system.\u00a0 The second vulnerability (CVE-2017-11848) is an information disclosure vulnerability in Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker to track the navigation of the user leaving a maliciously crafted page,\u201d he said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Adobe Patch Tuesday: 62 vulnerabilities for Reader/Acrobat, 5 critical for Flash Player", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/adobe-patch-tuesday-62-vulnerabilities-for-readeracrobat-5-critical-for-flash-player/article/707388/", "title": "Adobe Patch Tuesday: 62 vulnerabilities for Reader/Acrobat, 5 critical for Flash Player", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 14, 2017", "body": "Adobe's November Patch Tuesday made up for October when nothing was issued, with an offering that included 83 patches, including fixes for five critical-rated issues in Flash Player.

To the naked eye, the end result doesn't look that convincing, with only the eyes, nose and mouth area exposed, while the remainder of the mask is specially processed in a manner that looks as if it's been cast in plaster or wrapped in white bandages. But it's reportedly enough to trick Face ID, which Apple programmed to\u00a0construct a mathematical representation of a device owner's visage by combining a depth map of his or her face with a 2D infrared image.\n\nCurrently, such an exploit would be too time-consuming, expensive and impractical to use on any kind of massive scale. But in an FAQ web page describing its methodology, Bkav warns that a highly targeted attack could plausibly be levied against an important world leader or corporate leader whose iPhone fell into the wrong hands.\n\nAt the iPhone X's launch event, Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller said that company researchers successfully trained its Face ID neural network to distinguish between real and fake facial images by using masks created by Hollywood make-up artists. But according to the Bkav researchers, the flaw in this strategy is that the masks' designers didn't truly understand how the technology works.\n\n\u201cIt is quite hard to make the \u2018correct' mask without certain knowledge of security. We were able to trick Apple's AI...because we understood how their AI worked and how to bypass it,\u201d the Bkav FAQ page states. \u201cTake the nose of our mask for example: its creation is not complicated at all. We had an artist make it by silicone first. Then, when we found that the nose did not perfectly meet our demand, we fixed it on our own. Then the hack worked.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Bkav researchers reported that designing a mask that fools Face ID was easier than they imagined, as the recognition mechanism is \u201cnot as strict as you think,\u201d with only half a face needed to create a masks that defeats the security measures. \u201cApple has done this not so well,\u201d claims Bkav, suggesting that Apple's rush to market may have resulted in a security feature that was inferior to its predecessor, Touch ID, which required only a fingerprint to unlock a phone.\n\nLast month, Apple disputed claims that it ordered manufacturers to lower the accuracy of its\u00a0face recognition\u00a0to make the iPhone X easier to produce.\n\nSome experts have downplayed the seriousness of Bkav's findings, considering the effort that needs to be put into their method of attack. \u201cDetailed dimensions would have to be taken to create the mask, and the security firm alluded to the fact that they had to use a special material on the mask too,\" said Paul Norris, senior systems engineer, EMEA, at Tripwire, adding, \u201cWhat they didn't disclose was how many attempts and what level of effort it took to get the mask to work flawlessly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0compromise\u00a0Face ID authentication, the attacker would have\u00a0to\u00a0have a detailed map of the face of the user [and] create a mask that would map the exact details of the victim's face,\u201d Norris continued. Furthermore, the attacker would have to avoid scenarios in which the iPhone X does not accept Face ID and requires an Apple passcode to unlock itself \u2013 including after a phone is restarted, after\u00a0five unsuccessful attempts\u00a0at matching a face, and if the device hasn't been unlocked for 48 hours.\n\nAnd of course, any attack of this sort would have to be uniquely tailored to each target. \u201cIt's important\u00a0to\u00a0note that the attacks being talked about are individual \u2018bespoke attacks' that must be built and executed against each victim separately,\u201d said Terry Ray, CTO of\u00a0Imperva. \u201cThis is\u00a0in\u00a0addition\u00a0to\u00a0stealing the individual's phone and getting access\u00a0to\u00a0it before the owner can remotely wipe the device. Is your data so valuable that someone would go\u00a0to\u00a0this effort?\u201d\n\nStill, Ray acknowledged that over time, cybercriminals will only get better at finding ways to defeat the iPhone's X's biometric defenses. Fortunately, anyone who is concerned about this can simply disable the Face ID feature and rely solely on passcodes, he added.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apple/topic/47233/", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Defense Department's vulnerability disclosure program racks up 2,837 security flaws", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/defense-departments-vulnerability-disclosure-program-racks-up-2837-security-flaws/article/707036/", "title": "Defense Department's vulnerability disclosure program racks up 2,837 security flaws", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 13, 2017", "body": "The Defense Department's vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) has yielded 2,837 security flaws in the nearly one year since its inception.\n\nWhile a bounty or cash incentives are not awarded for vulnerabilities reported through the VDP, that has not stopped hackers eager to do their part to help protect the DoD's assets, HackerOne, which runs the program, said in a blog post.

Instead, infection happens automatically. \n\nMicrosoft offered several suggestions for stopping these attacks. For Word documents, the company says to not open suspicious email attachments or to manually create and set registry entries for Microsoft Office. The latter task should only be handled by someone familiar with the system because if Registry Editor is used incorrectly the operating system may have to be reinstalled.\n\nAn attack through Publisher would likely take place using a Word document, so the Word mitigation will solve this problem as well.\n\nExcel documents require DDE to open, but this can be disabled by going to Set File->Options->Trust Center->Trust Center Settings\u2026->External Content->Security settings for Workbook Links = Disable automatic update of Workbook Links, Microsoft said.\n\nHowever, disabling this feature could prevent Excel spreadsheets from updating dynamically if disabled in the registry, Microsoft noted.\n\nOutlook can also be adjusted through the Registry Editor, but this will disable automatic updates for the DDE field OLE links. These updates will have to be completed manually.\n\nDDE is a protocol used for interprocess communications, such as the transferring of data between applications.

Cards that are not updated can still be used as identification documents, however.\n\nLast month, the Baltic nation issued a public notice about the vulnerability, dubbed ROCA (Return of Coppersmith's Attack), which researchers from\u00a0Centre for Research on Cryptography and Security discovered\u00a0in various cryptographic chips manufactured by Infineon Technologies AG. The researchers described the vulnerability, officially designated CVE-2017-15361,\u00a0as an algorithmic RSA generation flaw that \"makes factorization of commonly used key lengths, including 1024 and 2048 bits, practically possible.\"\n\nIn other words,\u00a0even without physical access to an ID card and its corresponding PIN code, attackers can decrypt the card's security protections and ultimately steal its owner's identity simply by knowing the public key.\n\nAn Oct. 16, 2017 government\u00a0notice\u00a0assured the public that it would take expensive computing power to fully exploit such a vulnerability, and that there was no evidence any such attack was attempted in the wild. However, new research has found that cracking ID cards' keys is quicker and easier than initially thought.\n\nThe original researchers stated that on a single core of a common recent CPU,\u00a0their exploit would on average be expected to compute the private part of a 1024-bit RSA key in fewer than 45 days and a 2048-bit key in fewer than 50 years.

Talos privately reported the flaws between July and September of 2017.\n\n\"We've been working very closely with the Talos team on their findings and worked quickly to issue firmware updates,\" said Circle with Disney developer Circle Media, in a statement.\u00a0Indeed, Talos praised Circle Media for its responsiveness and its decision to push out security updates to customers rather than relying on Circle with Disney users to update the product on their own.\n\nA Circle Media spokesperson also told SC Media via email that in order for the discovered vulnerabilities to be exploited, an attacker \"would already have to be on the user's home network\" -- an important distinction that did not appear in the Talos blog post. However, in a separate email interview, Talos threat researcher Bill Largent told SC Media that two of the vulnerabilities actually would not have required home network access to exploit.\n\nThe first of these two remotely exploitable vulnerabilities is CVE-2017-12085, a token routing vulnerability within the Circle with Disney cloud infrastructure. \"This vulnerability is really interesting because a malicious threat actor could basically leverage the Circle cloud infrastructure to attack other customer devices,\" said Largent. \"We've seen a proliferation of supply chain attacks and exploitation of trust relationships over the course of this year.\"\u00a0\n\nThe other is CVE-2017-12096, a WiFi security downgrade vulnerability. \"...If someone stood up a rogue\u00a0WiFi\u00a0router with the spoofed SSID, they could get the Circle device connected directly to the rogue\u00a0WiFi\u00a0router,\" Largent explained.\n\nAmong the most serious bugs, each with a CVSS score of 9.9, are a trio of OS command injection vulnerabilities that could have been exploited with malicious HTTP requests containing specially crafted network packets. These bugs were found, respectively, within Circle of Disney's notifications functionality (CVE-2017-2917), API Management configuration restore functionality (CVE-2017-2890), and API Management configuration back-up functionality (CVE-2017-2866).\n\nOther highly critical bugs were described by Talos as a \"firmware update signature check bypass vulnerability\" (CVE-2017-2898),\u00a0and a \"configuration restore photos file overwrite vulnerability\" (CVE-2017-2916).\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Apple addresses KRACK exploits in iOS and macOS updates", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apple-update-macos-and-ios-updates/article/704701/", "title": "Apple addresses KRACK exploits in iOS and macOS updates", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "November 01, 2017", "body": "Apple has finally addressed the KRACK vulnerabilities in its latest macOS High Sierra, Sierra, El Capitan, iOS 11.1, tvOS and watchOS . \n\nDiscovered last month, KRACK\u00a0(Key Reinstallation AttaCKs) is series of related\u00a0vulnerabilities that affect every device using\u00a0WPA2\u00a0encryption\u00a0could allow nearby attackers to intercept and steal data transmitted across a Wi-Fi network. \n\nThe latest iOS update includes patches for 13 bugs in Webkit, and other fixes in the kernel, iMessages, Siri, UIKit, StreamingZip, and CoreText.

Ordinarily, external users, including Google partners and members of the public, can only access a small component of the website. However, the three vulnerabilities Birsan uncovered can be exploited to give external users heightened privileges and deeper access.\n\nThe most serious of the three vulnerabilities consists of multiple errors in a POST request that users can submit If they no longer want to receive CC'd emails about a specific product issue. While researching this process, Birsan determined that the Buganizer did not explicitly heck to see if the person sending the request actually had access to the alerts in the first place. And secondly, the system would reply in the\u00a0HTTP response body with full details surrounding the issue in question.\n\nConsequently, Birsan realized he could repeat this process, incrementing through various Issue ID numbers, in order to learn about all sorts of Google products and their flaws.\n\n\"Yes, I could see details about vulnerability reports, along with everything else hosted on the Buganizer,\" Birsan explains in his report. \"Even worse, I could exfiltrate data about multiple tickets in a single request, so monitoring all the internal activity in real time probably wouldn't have triggered any rate limiters.\"\n\nIn an interview via Twitter with SC Media, Birsan speculated what\u00a0damage could have been inflicted had a malicious attacker, instead of a white-hat researcher, discovered this vulnerability:\u00a0\n\n\"Realistically speaking, exploiting this bug gives you access to every vulnerability report anyone sends to Google until they catch on to the fact that you're spying on them. That could be anywhere between a few hours and a few months,\" said Birsan, using a quote he previously supplied to another media outlet.\n\nBirsan said that had an exploit gone unnoticed for an extended period, it could have allows attackers to learn of \"vulnerabilities you could use to steal information from other people's Google accounts,\" \"vulnerabilities you could use to take over other Google accounts,\" and \"very rarely, vulnerabilities you could use to gain access to Google's internal network.\"\n\n\u201cBug\u00a0trackers used within prominent tech companies can be a hugely lucrative target for attackers looking to improve their zero-day capabilities,\" said\u00a0Craig Young, computer security researcher for Tripwire's Vulnerability and Exposures Research Team (VERT), in emailed comments. \"Access to a private\u00a0bug\u00a0tracker gives the attackers lead time toward crafting an exploit as well as for finding related bugs before the public security community has a chance to do so. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cA clever attacker might also take advantage of unauthorized\u00a0bug\u00a0tracker access to delay patch releases by manipulating data in the tracker,\" Young added.\n\nA second vulnerability also was found in the Issue Tracker's \"starring\" function, which allows users to request email notifications for issues they're interested in following. Birsan learned that this particular capability did not properly apply access control rules to external users who were not authorized to review these vulnerabilities.\n\nTesting this flaw, Birsan requested notifications for a few thousand issue ID Numbers, and soon found his inbox flooded with internal threads discussing various vulnerabilities. (However, the content of the particular threads that Birsan reviewed turned out not to be especially sensitive, as they related language translation issues.)\n\nFinally, Birsan also found another vulnerability in the Buganizer that allowed him to create a Google employee account, despite being an external user. In his report, Birsan said that this account did not grant his access to the Google corporate login page, but it did give him various \"extra benefits,\" including the ability to order a ride through Google's Guide transportation service.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "RIG EK used to spread Matrix ransomware via malvertising", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/matrix-ransomware-distributed-via-rig-ek-in-malvertising/article/703874/", "title": "RIG EK used to spread Matrix ransomware via malvertising ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "October 30, 2017", "body": "Matrix ransomware is now being distributed via the RIG exploit kit on various sites displaying malvertising.\n\nMalwarebytes security researcher J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura\u00a0discovered the malware which was first released in late 2016, the researcher tweeted. \n\nThe ransomware had all but disappeared from the threat landscape but appears to have resurfaced.

Exploits using a zero day run the risk of the vulnerability being found and patched thus rendering their malignant target inert.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerability/topic/50221/", "topic_name": "Vulnerability"}]}, {"news_name": "APT28 joins BlackOasis in exploiting latest Adobe Flash vulnerability", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt28-joins-blackoasis-in-exploiting-latest-adobe-flash-vulnerability/article/701817/", "title": "APT28 joins BlackOasis in exploiting latest Adobe Flash vulnerability", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 20, 2017", "body": "APT28 is also being named as one of the cyber gangs attempting to take advantage of Adobe Flash vulnerability CVE-2017-11292.\n\nProofpoint believes APT28, which has ties to the Russian government, is in the mix based on emails sent to various government foreign ministries and business in the aerospace field in Europe and the United States.

Both of these flaws can be remotely exploited by unauthenticated attackers who have HTTP-based network access, in order to compromise the Hospitality Reporting and Analytics component of Oracle's Hospitality Applications. The first,\u00a0CVE-2017-10402, can result in a takeover of the solution, while the second, CVE-2017-10405, allows malicious actors to access critical data or trigger a denial-of-service condition, ERPScan reports.\n\nThree more hospitality application vulnerabilities were given CVSS scores of either 9.9 or 9.8.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2013-1903, found in Oracle's Siebel customer relationship management solution, also earned a CVSS score of 10.0.

affecting all Wi-Fi devices using the WPA2 protocol security pros once again have their hands full to update patches for the ROCA vulnerability which could allow an attacker to circumvent RSA encryption.\n\nThe vulnerability (CVE-2017-15361) infects vulnerable keys found in about 760,000 products from major vendors including Microsoft, Google, HP, Lenovo, and Fujitsu who have already released software updates and guidelines for a mitigation and is caused by cryptographic chips produced by Infineon Technologies AG, according to an advisory detailing the attack.\n\nROCA stands for Return of Coppersmith's Attack and was developed by Researchers at the Centre for Research on Cryptography and Security using an old technique to exploit a vulnerability in NIST FIPS 140-2 and CC EAL 5+ certified devices and has been present since at least 2012.\n\nThe exploit allows an attacker to carry out a practical factorization attack to compute the private part of an RSA key for commonly used key lengths for $76 to decrypt 1024 bits in a matter of hours and about $40,000 for the 2048-bit version in a matter of days.\n\n\n\n\u201cA remote attacker can compute an RSA private key from the value of a public key,\u201d researchers said in the advisory. \u201cThe private key can be misused for impersonation of a legitimate owner, decryption of sensitive messages, forgery of signatures (such as for software releases) and other related attacks.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the vulnerability varies depending on the venders' implementation of the encryption however a large number of Google Chromebook and Windows devices created by Fujitsu, HP and Lenovo are amongst those affected.\u00a0The vulnerability also impacted Estonia ID cards which were recently shown to be vulnerable to a proof of concept attack. \u00a0\n\n\"The authors have made it clear that this flaw is embedded into the hardware and firmware of many devices widely used across the globe,\u201d Synopsys Security Consultant Jesse Victors said. \u201cThis makes it difficult to completely patch, but there are some mitigating controls.\u201d\u00a0\n\nVictors added that RSA turned 40 years old this year and we still seem to struggle with using and implementing it correctly however RSA is one of our best public key encryption schemes, so it isn't going away any time soon.\n\nThe revelation is similar to the problem Sony's PlayStation software download system suffered in 2010, and exactly what happened to the Taiwan National ID registry in 2013, Thales e-Security Chief Technology Officer Jon Geater said.\n\n\u201cWhile the effects of this latest flaw are concerning, it's interesting to note that this is far from the first time it's happened,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerating high quality signing keys from high quality entropy and key generation processes is absolutely fundamental, especially in large scale systems where lots of public keys are available to sample.\u201d\n\nGeater added that\u00a0crypto is harder

Kaspersky Lab has reported the vulnerability to Adobe, which has issued an advisory.\n\nThe researchers believe that the group behind the attack was also responsible for CVE-2017-8759, another zero day, reported in September. \n\nFinSpy (FinFisher) is a commercial malware, typically sold to nation states and law enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance on local targets and has attracted the attention of civil liberties groups after being deployed by some repressive regimes. However, BlackOasis is using it against various targets globally, suggesting it is being deployed for global intelligence operations.\n\nFinSpy uses multiple anti-analysis techniques to make forensic analysis more difficult. After installation it can exfiltrate data to its command and control servers in Switzerland, Bulgaria and the Netherlands.\n\nKaspersky Lab's assessment says that BlackOasis's interests include many involved in Middle Eastern politics, opposition bloggers and activists, as well as regional news correspondents. It says it also appears to have an interest in verticals of particular relevance to the region \u2013 which would suggest oil and gas. And in 2016, researchers report a heavy interest in Angola, with lure documents indicating targets with suspected ties to oil, money laundering and other activities. There is also an interest in international activists and think tanks.\n\nBlackOasis targests have been based in Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Libya, Jordan, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Netherlands, Bahrain, United Kingdom and Angola.\n\nKaspersky Lab tends not to provide nation-state attribution to malware that it finds, however, Angola is a source of non-Arab oil for Israel, and an interest in the Middle East also points to Israel as one likely location for BlackOasis though various Arab countries also use FinSpy. Given that Israel is the source of stories about Kaspersky Lab products being used by Russian hackers to access NSA data \u2013 leading to a US government ban on their use, some observers may view the timing of this release as more than coincidental.\n\nAnton Ivanov, the lead malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab commented in a press release: \u201cThe attack using the recently discovered zero-day exploit is the third time this year we have seen FinSpy distribution through exploits to zero-day vulnerabilities. Previously, actors deploying this malware abused critical issues in Microsoft Word and Adobe products.

In an online security bulletin, Adobe describes the bug \u2013\u00a0officially designated CVE-2017-11292 \u2013 as a \"critical type confusion vulnerability that could lead to code execution.\"\n\nThe bulletin also acknowledges the existence of an active exploit that is \"being used in limited targeted attacks against users running Windows.\" Even so, the patch applies to all major operating systems \u2013\u00a0Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Chrome \u2013\u00a0and includes fixes for the Desktop Runtime, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 versions of Flash Player.\n\nDiscovered on Oct. 10 by\u00a0Anton Ivanov, lead malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, the exploit was initially found contained within an ActiveX object that was in turn embedded in a malicious Microsoft Office document, which was likely delivered via a phishing email. According to a Kaspersky blog post,\u00a0the exploit is the work of BlackOasis, an APT group known to gather intelligence on activists,\u00a0United Nations figures,\u00a0regional news correspondents, and think tanks \u2013\u00a0particularly those affiliated with the Middle East. The group also appears fixated on the African nation of Angola.\n\n\"The exploit is a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the 'com.adobe.tvsdk.mediacore.BufferControlParameters' class,\" the blog post explains. \"If the exploit is successful, it will gain arbitrary read/write operations within memory, thus allowing it to execute a second stage shellcode.\"\n\nThe exploit's final payload is mo.exe, an new and improved version of FinSpy, which is typically sold to governments as a surveillance tool. \"This newer variant has made it especially difficult for researchers to analyze the malware due to many added anti-analysis techniques,\" Kaspersky states.\n\nKaspersky also found that mo.exe shares the same command-and-control servers with another FinSpy payload that was delivered via a different zero-day exploit attack reported by FireEye in September 2017. This previous exploit was delivered via\u00a0Microsoft Office RTF documents that\u00a0took advantage of CVE-2016-8759, a a SOAP-based parser code injection vulnerability within the Microsoft .NET framework.\n\nInterestingly, on Oct. 13, a\u00a0Malwarebytes\u00a0blog post reported on an email-based malware campaign that leveraged Microsoft Office Word and RTF documents and a CVE-2016-8759 exploit in order to infect recipients with the Orcus Rat Remote Administrative Tool.\n\nKaspersky says that it first discovered BlackOasis in 2016, but the APT has leveraged at least five zero-day exploits in attacks since as far back as June 2015. Kaspersky has been keeping tabs on the group since its discovery, tying the APT to a \"couple dozen\" observed attacks.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/zero-day/topic/49474/", "topic_name": "Zero Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Serious KRACK exploit affects all Wi-Fi devices using WPA2 protocol", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/krack-exploit-allows-interception-of-data-using-wpa2-protocol/article/700365/", "title": "Serious KRACK exploit affects all Wi-Fi devices using WPA2 protocol", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "October 16, 2017", "body": "A newly discovered series of related vulnerabilities\u00a0dubbed KRACKs (Key Reinstallation AttaCKs) that affect every device using WPA2 encryption\u00a0could allow nearby attackers to intercept and steal data transmitted across a Wi-Fi network\u00a0\n\nMathy Vanhoef, a security researcher at a Belgian university, uncovered KRACKs, which consists of 10 separate vulnerabilities, including a reinstallation of the pairwise encryption key (PTK-TK) in the 4-way handshake, reinstallation of the group key (GTK) in the 4-way handshake, and a reinstallation of the integrity group key (IGTK) in the 4-way handshake.\n\n\u201cNote that\u00a0if your device supports Wi-Fi, it is most likely affected,\u201d Vanhoef said on a\u00a0site\u00a0detailing the attacks. \u201cDuring our initial research, we discovered ourselves that Android, Linux, Apple, Windows, OpenBSD, MediaTek, Linksys, and others, are all affected by some variant of the attacks.\u201d\n\nWhile all devices using WPA2,\u00a0the protocol that secures all modern protected Wi-Fi networks, are affected, some devices were described as being \u201ctrivial\u201d to exploit with the attack being \u201cespecially catastrophic\u201d against wpa_supplicant version 2.4 and above, a Wi-Fi client commonly used on Linux and Android 6.0 and above.\u00a0\n\nThe vulnerability affects the Wi-Fi standard itself not individual products or implementations so any correct implementation of WPA2 is likely affected, Vanhoef wrote.\n\nThe attack hasn't been exploited in the wild yet, researchers warn it's only a matter of time before it is exploited. Mike Buckbee, Security Engineer at Varonis, said it's important to keep in mind the attack depends on physical proximity since an attacker would need to be within Wi-Fi range in order to compromise a client. \n\n\u201cAn attacker would also need a somewhat specialized networking device and (at this point) be able to code up the exploit manually as no software has been released for this attack,\u201d\u00a0Buckbee said. \u201cAdditional encryption happening at different layers of the communications stack can help make this exploit less of an issue. \n\nHe went on to say this is one more reason site owners should be forcing SSL/TLS on their domains and that VPN's are now inexpensive, easily configured, and able to make the KRACK vulnerabilities less of an issues.\n\n\u201cWe've seen previous brute force attacks that work against WPA2, but they take time and certain conditions to be successful,\u201d\u00a0Rod Soto, director of cyber security research at\u00a0JASK said. \u201cSince this vulnerability appears to be at the protocol level, it will not only make it easier for attackers to compromise WPA2, but also allow them to execute further attacks from some time to come.\u201d\n\n\u00a0This isn't the first time a popular Wi-Fi protocol was found to be flawed.\n\n\"In\u00a02001 the Wi-Fi security\u00a0protocol\u00a0WEP was cracked and it was soon deemed unsafe to use\u00a0in\u00a0order to keep your data and indeed networks safe from prying eyes,\u201d ESET Security Specialist Mark James said. \u201cHere we are\u00a016 years later\u00a0and it appears the seemingly trusted\u00a0protocol\u00a0WPA2\u00a0is going the same way.\u201d\n\nJames said some of the biggest challenges to addressing these vulnerabilities is getting routers patched, getting the average user to check and apply any firmware updates, and dealing with older routers that may not even have a patch available.\n\n\u201cThe average household would acquire an auto-configured router, install it and forget about it, until possibly they change their internet provider,\u201d James said. \u201cHere, they may go through the same procedure; too many people never check or implement router updates as it's something often too complicated for the home user to be involved\u00a0in.\u201d\n\nSome researchers said the vulnerability is a call for enterprises to go the extra mile in protecting users. \n\n\"There's no stopping users from connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots, so it's up to the enterprise to layer on protection mechanisms,\u201d Bitglass Chief Executive Officer Rich Campagna said. \u201cThis vulnerability speaks to the importance of ensuring that all connections from endpoints leverage strong encryption, such as the latest versions of Transport Layer Security\u201d\n\nCampagna added that Intermediary proxies can ensure that regardless of what the application supports, all connections from end-user devices leverage strong encryption. Some researchers argue protocols should be redesigned. \n\n\"In cryptographic protocols, a nonce (Number used ONCE) should never be repeated, but often design flaws are introduced, when the protocol is implemented in software, that allow this to happen,\u201d VASCO Data Security Innovation Security Architect Dr. Steven Murdoch. \u201cOne response is to just blame the designer and fix the software, but the same problem will likely come up again in a different place.\u201d\n\nMurdoch said it's concerning that nonce-reuse has even more serious consequences in the next generation of WiFi encryption (GCMP) compared to the existing one and would allow data to be tampered with or eavesdropped. He added that this vulnerability will most likely continue to cause problems for years due to the difficulty in updating routers and the fact that some manufactures wont issue updates for older technologies. \n\n\u201cAffected manufacturers were notified of the vulnerability in August to give them an opportunity to fix the flaw before the public disclosure today,\u201d Murdoch said. \u201cUnfortunately, manufacturers often do not fix vulnerabilities in older products, particularly those that aren't being actively promoted\u201d\n\nScott Petry, CEO and Founder of Authentic8 said users should understand the vulnerabilities aren't only exploitable on public Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\u201cThis exploit isn't restricted to sketchy free wifi,\u201d Petry said \u201cThe attack intercepts traffic for users on proper, approved networks. It's not worth the risk, unless you're using an alternate, non-HTTP protocol for accessing the web.\u201d\n\nResearchers suggest users use VPN service when connected via public WI-Fi to ensure they only connect to web sites over HTTPS, update their devices and routers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNote: This story has been updated to include expert commentary.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/encryption/topic/47214/", "topic_name": "Encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Campaign leverages two malicious docs and RCE vulnerability to spread Orcus Rat", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/campaign-leverages-two-malicious-docs-and-rce-vulnerability-to-spread-orcus-rat/article/700353/", "title": "Campaign leverages two malicious docs and RCE vulnerability to spread Orcus Rat", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "October 16, 2017", "body": "A malicious Microsoft Word document, discovered making the rounds via phishing emails, infects victims with the Orcus Rat Remote Administrative Tool by automatically downloading a secondary RTF doc capable of executing a remote code execution exploit.\n\nThe RAT payload, which is disguised with the file name \"mozilla.exe,\" enables attackers to perform keylogging and remotely access the desktop and webcam,\u00a0according to Malwarebytes' lead malware intelligence analyst Jerome Segura in a blog post.

If exploited it would allow RCE in the context of the current user, which, if that person is the system's admin, would allow the attacker to take control of the affected system.

Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights, Microsoft reported.\n\n\u201cTop priority for patching should go to a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, CVE-2017-11826, which Microsoft has ranked as \u201cImportant\u201d is actively being exploited in the wild,\u201d Jimmy Graham, director of product management at Qualys.\n\nAlso disclosed for the first time was CVE-2017-11777, a XSS vulnerability that exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server.

Patrick Wardle, chief security researcher at Synack and founder of Objective-See, says he reported the bug to Apple in early September, but not in time for it to be addressed by macOS version 10.13, also known as High Sierra.\n\nEssentially a password manager, the Mac keychain stores users' passwords for their computer, servers, apps,\u00a0and various websites and online services.

According to the researchers'\u00a0report, published this week, sensitive data such as PIN codes, passwords, encryption keys and keylogging information can be encoded onto the infrared light emitted by surveillance cameras and subsequently captured and deciphered by the attackers.

The air-gapped systems would already have to be infected with malware, likely delivered via a flash drive, that is capable of both controlling networked cameras' illumination and decoding incoming infrared signals. Additionally, the security cameras need to be in proximity to the attackers, within their line or sight. And finally, in order to connect to the cameras, the attackers likely would need to steal a password, perhaps by exploiting a bug in the camera's software or firmware.\n\n\"Our evaluation of the covert channel shows that data can be covertly exfiltrated from an organization at a rate of 20 bit/sec per surveillance camera to a distance of tens of meters away,\" the report states. \"Data can be covertly infiltrated into an organization at a rate of over 100 bit/sec per surveillance camera from a distance of hundreds of meters to kilometers away.

concept method dubbed Bashware which they claim allows\u00a0any\u00a0known malware to bypass most common security solutions, including next generation anti-viruses, inspection tools, and

million computers\u00a0currently running Windows 10 PC globally, according to a Sept. 11 blog post.\n\nResearchers described the exploit as a cross platform technique that uses the WSL in order to allow running both ELF an EXE malicious payloads in a stealthy manner\u00a0and said the key to the technique is within the design of the Pico process structure. \n\nThe proof of concept could allow an attacker to load the malware using only four steps which include loading the WSL components, enabling developer mode, installing Linux and using Wine\u00a0to translate Windows API calls into POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface).\n\n\u201cAlthough WSL has become a stable feature and many of its issues are now resolved, it seems the industry has still not adapted to the existence of this strange hybrid concept which allows a combination of Linux and Windows systems to run at the same time,\u201d researchers said in the report. \u201cThis may open a door for cyber criminals wishing to run their malicious code undetected, and allow them to use the features provided by WSL to hide from security products that have not yet integrated the proper detection mechanisms.\u201d\n\nCheckpoint researchers said existing security solutions are still not adapted to monitor processes of Linux executables running on Windows OS as the technique leverages the underlying mechanism of WSL but not everyone is convinced the vulnerability is as critical as it's claimed to be. \n\nWhile he agreed the research itself seemed to be accurate, Lastline Director of Sales Engineering Dan Mathews, said the findings appear to be a bit sensationalistic.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cWhile WSL is out of beta, it is disabled and a base Linux OS is not\u00a0installed on any Windows 10 host by default,\u201d Mathews said. \u201cIn order for this threat to be credible, a user would need to follow several very intentional steps to enable WSL and install a Linux guest machine onto an updated Windows 10 host.\u201d\n\nMathews added that administrative privileges are required to install the optional WSL feature so it further reduces the number of those vulnerable to a small fraction of PCs.\n\nFor those who may be at risk, the threat is valid and users should ensure they have adequate zero-day protections in\u00a0place such as behavior-based breach protection technology, Matthews

While the EK's activity declined slightly in the latter part of spring traffic remained steady.\n\nOver the last three months, researchers have seen an increase in the EK's presence in Indian while its activity in Eastern Europe and Russia, a region that typically serves a significant portion of RIG hosts, saw a decrease. \n\nResearchers also noted a significant amount of Magnitude EK activity primarily targeting countries in Southeast Asian using malvertising campaigns. Although Magnitude has been seen in a lower volume in recent years, it is still one of the longest running exploit kits.\n\nThe Terror EK, which researchers described as relatively unsophisticated managed to undergo notable changes over the last two quarters including the introduction of a number of host and version fingerprinting scripts. The EK also began dropping various malware payloads including Tofsee, Andromeda/Gamarue, and Smoke Loader.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe EK also recently started using the CVE-2017-0059 bug, an Internet Explorer exploit affecting versions 9 through 11, and the CVE-2017-0037 bug, an exploit affecting Internet Explorer 10 and 11, and Microsoft Edge.\n\nThe newest EK, Disdain, first appeared in early August 2017 and sharers code with the Terror EK and even used the same URL pattern, but draws the line with its own distinct features.

And two, because of the highly eclectic and fragmented nature of devices relying on Bluetooth, it could take weeks or months for some product manufacturers to apply software patches, while others may never issue secure updates.\n\n\"Bluetooth is complicated. Too complicated,\" states a technical paper published by IoT security company Armis, whose researchers discovered the eight BlueBorne vulnerabilities on products running on Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows. \"Too many specific applications are defined in the stack layer, with endless replication of facilities and features. These over-complications are a direct result of the immense work and over-engineering that was put into creating the Bluetooth specification.\"\n\n\"The complications in the specifications translate into multiple pitfall junctions in the various implementations of the Bluetooth standard,\" adds Armis, which posits that the complex nature of Bluetooth has dissuaded researchers \"from auditing its implementations at the same level of scrutiny that other highly exposed protocols, and outwards-facing interfaces have been treated with.\"\n\nFor that reason, a large number of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth may yet remain, noted Armis, warning that BlueBorne may be just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn a blog post today, Check Point Software Technologies agreed with the premise that the Bluetooth protocol has been \"discarded and ignored by the research community for years,\" noting that bug hunters may have been misled by two common misconceptions.\n\n\"The first misconception is that Bluetooth cannot be intercepted via the air, the second [is] that it always requires some sort of user interaction,\" the Check Point research team states. Armis disabused the security community of these false notions, after announcing that attackers can leverage BlueBorne flaws to intercept Bluetooth devices' communications and infect them over the air, and that a device's Bluetooth feature only needs to be turned on for such exploits to work.\n\nExperts also pointed out the difficulties of patching vulnerable Bluetooth devices, both on the part of the consumer and the original equipment manufacturers who must implement security updates issued by the OS developer.\n\nFrom the consumer's perspective, \"It's not easy for the average person to ensure their laptop is running the latest OS. Add a dozen IoT enabled devices into the mix, and it becomes nearly impossible to ensure every product and system is patch, especially when patches aren't available for many of these item,\" said\u00a0Mike Buckbee, security engineer at\u00a0Varonis Systems,\u00a0a data protection company focused on insider threats and cyberattacks.\n\nAnd from the OEM's perspective, BlueBorne underscores the\u00a0\"fragmented and forgotten manner in which OS updates and patches are distributed to connected devices,\" continued Buckbee, who predicted that many devices will remain unpatched and vulnerable to BlueBorne \"for years to come.\" (Google and Microsoft have already developed patches for Android and Windows devices, respectively, while Apple resolved the issue with the introduction of iOS 10.)\n\nLeigh-Anne Galloway, cyber security resilience officer at\u00a0Positive Technologies, said that patching efforts will depend on the type of device affected.\n\n\n\n\"While patches for smartphones, laptops and other internet-enabled devices are relatively easy to push out, for\u00a0dumber\u00a0gadgets\u00a0the same can't be said,\" stated Galloway. \"There's a huge number of \u2018things' that rely on Bluetooth to perform their function, like speakers, or computer keyboards and mice. And short of turning them off, there isn't a fix and that is going to leave millions vulnerable.\"\n\nLamar Bailey, director of security research and development with advanced threat, security, and compliance solutions provider\u00a0Tripwire, said manufacturers\u00a0will be distributing patches for months, and that the situation could especially tricky for IoT device-makers.\n\nAccording to Bailey, some of these companies \"will not have patches either because they do not know they are vulnerable, will not know how to patch the issue, or will consider the products out of support and just release new versions... Consumers should look at the devices they own and contact the vendors to see if they are vulnerable. The larger well-established vendors should be putting out information in their support section and contacting registered customers.\u201d\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nDespite the magnitude of BlueBorne,\u00a0Mike Weber, VP of labs at\u00a0IT audit and compliance firm\u00a0Coalfire, suggested that the resulting outcry may be somewhat of an overreaction. \"While the research discusses the possibility of worm-style attacks being possible in the wild, there are no currently known instances of this actually occurring and the difficulty level of writing a single worm to impact all devices would be high,\" said Weber.\n\nWeber also noted that BlueBorne \"can only be used against devices within the effective Bluetooth range of the attacker, which is 33 feet on average in mobile phones and headsets, and 328 feet on average in laptops and desktops.\" However, it must be noted that infected devices, in theory, can be compromised to launch more attacks on other devices within their range, creating a chain reaction of additional infections.\n\nBoth Buckbee and Galloway said that the BlueBorne disclosure is a key lesson for manufacturers to start approaching security from within.\n\n\"We've gotten the IoT wake-up call loud and clear and now it's up to manufacturers to heed the warning and bake in security into their products before jumping in feet first with the latest connected devices,\" said Buckbee.\n\n\u201cLong term, the answer is that if any device can connect to another in any way, it needs to have security built in from the outset or hackers are going to take advantage of it,\" concurred Galloway.\n\nAnd consumers must do their part as well by stay up-to-date with patches and using Bluetooth responsibly.\n\n\"Bluetooth should be treated like any open port: if you do not need it, then turn it off,\" said Bailey. \"That may not always be easy with Bluetooth keyboards and mice/trackpads, but in situations where non-employees are within 40 feet of systems, like banks at teller windows, it is best to use wired input devices and not reply on Bluetooth.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/zero-day/topic/49474/", "topic_name": "Zero Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft Patch Tuesday: 21 critical updates listed, one zero day fixed", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/microsoft-patch-tuesday-21-critical-updates-listed-one-zero-day-fixed/article/688259/", "title": "Microsoft Patch Tuesday: 21 critical updates listed, one zero day fixed", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 12, 2017", "body": "Microsoft's September Patch Tuesday security updates includes a fix for a zero-day flaw found in the wild and used to target Russian language speakers along with the details on the BlueBorne vulnerability that potentially impacts five billion Bluetooth devices. \n\nIn total Microsoft patched 82 flaws with 21 being rated critical. There is also included the public disclosure of three additional zero-day vulnerabilities that have not been exploited.\n\nThe zero day flaw was brought to light by FireEye researchers who detected a malicious Microsoft Office RTF document that exploited CVE-2017-8759 that can allow for code injection.

The former \u201cis far more likely, but the second is a very remote possibility\u201d because the earlier flaw is \u201ceasier to exploit and much better known. It also fits the timeline better, since it was released months before Equifax was attacked in July,\u201d\u00a0Williams wrote. To exploit the latter flaw, attackers would have had to have had it before its public release.\n\nHowever, \u201cfor either vulnerability, the process is basically the same. The attacker sends a specific HTTP request containing some special syntax.\u00a0 In one case, an OGNL expression.\u00a0 In the other, a serialized object,\u201d he said in comments emailed to SC Media.\u00a0\u201cThe Equifax Struts application would receive this request, and get tricked into executing operating system commands.\u201d\n\nThe attacker can then \u201cuse these to take over the entire box \u2013 do anything the application can do,\u201d Williams said.\u00a0\u201cSo, they probably stole the database credentials out of the application, ran some queries, and then exfiltrated the data to some server they control on the internet.\u201d\n\nThe Apache Struts Project Management Committee wrote in a blog post that \u201cat this point in time it is not clear which Struts vulnerability would have been utilized, if any,\u201d but also said since the Equifax breach was detected July 5 \u201cthe attackers either used an earlier announced vulnerability on an unpatched Equifax server or exploited a vulnerability not known at this point in time \u2013 a so-called zero-day exploit.\u201d The 9805 vulnerability may indeed be nine years old, but researchers only recently learned of it and addressed it immediately. \u201cWe were notified just recently on how a certain piece of code can be misused, and we fixed this ASAP,\u201d the committee said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Apache Struts said it its \u201cdevelopment team puts enormous efforts in securing and hardening\u201d its software, Equifax drew fire from critics for seemingly falling short on cybersecurity hygiene, particularly in regard to website protection. \u201cWhile details are still emerging, it seems likely that, like too many firms, Equifax was not using the right website security measures to properly protect its network and consumers' data,\u201d said Neill Feather, president of website security firm SiteLock. \u201cWith the compounding number of website vulnerabilities discovered daily, this type of security negligence is simply unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWhile the credit monitoring company has thus far been light on details, Scott Sellers, CEO of Azul Systems, agrees that\u00a0\"it appears that the Equifax breach may have been enabled by non-up-to-date open source Apache Struts software.\" \u00a0\n\n\"Open Source is everywhere in the enterprise and that trend isn't going away. Unless your open source software is supported, you run the risk of running unsupported/out of date/vulnerable software \u2013 and it is your team's responsibility to watch the web for reported bugs, vulnerabilities, and patches,\" says Sellers, noting that companies can no longer \"afford to roll the dice\" when it comes to security or reliability. \"Otherwise, well, you run the risk of becoming the unfolding cautionary tale that is Equifax.\"\n\nJavvad Malik, security advocate, AlienVault, said \u201cCompanies like Equifax should know very well that data is the lifeblood of the organization and its crown jewels\u201d and act accordingly.\u00a0\n\nWhile the breach is hardly the first to hit a credit monitoring service, AlienVault Threat Engineer Chris Doman said \u201cIt would likely have taken hours or even days to download all that information from Equifax's database - all without anyone noticing.\u201d The company, thus far, has been light on the details of the incident, but Doman said \u201cnormally when this happens it's the result of a simple SQL injection vulnerability. It's a shame to see that despite waiting 6 weeks to tell customers, Equifax's website telling customers of the breach is broken.\u201d\n\nThe breach also is a cautionary tale about the vulnerabilities of web applications and known as well as unknown code.\n\n\u201cAs belatedly realized by Equifax, websites are vulnerable to not only known code--web application tools in this instance--but also unknown code,\u201d said Chris Olson, CEO of The Media Trust. \u201cThis breach is yet another example of a large-scale security incident that could have been detected much earlier through continuous monitoring of all code executing on a website.\u201d\n\nCalling the credit monitoring company's breach \u201ca very colorful, albeit very sad, example how a vulnerability in a web application can lead to disastrous consequences for an entire company, its customer base and far beyond,\u201d High-Tech Bridge CEO and Founder Ilia Kolochenko said that almost any critical data today \u201cis handled and processed by web applications, but cybersecurity teams still seriously underestimate the risks related to application security.\u201d \n\nEquifax, Patterson says, \u201cneeds to quickly scrutinize historical network traffic analytics to identify and proactively notify every single person whose data was compromised.\u201d\n\nWhat's at risk\n\nOther recent, high-profiled breaches may have been larger, but given the nature of Equifax's business and the type of data it's charged with protecting, this incident could prove more damaging. \u201cWhile the scale of the Equifax breach doesn't reach the heights of some previous breaches, such as Yahoo, it is by far the most invasive when you look at all the sensitive personal data accessed,\u201d says Alex Smith, director of security products at Intermedia. \u201cImpacting 143 million consumers touches well over 50 percent of Americans that rely on bank loans and credit scoring.\u201d \n\nCalling the scale of the breach \u201chuge,\u201d Ryan Wilk, vice president of customer success for NuData Security, said it \u201cis likely to have a significant impact in the cybercrime world,\u201d acting \u201cas a pipeline\u201d for future criminal activity.\n\n\u201cWhen retailers get hit by a breach like this, it's a single credit card that might get stolen, when Equifax it could be everything about the affected parties, and presumably linked to other things,\u201d said Forrester Principal Analyst Jeff Pollard, who called on Equifax to provide more information \u201cother than your information was or possibly was accessed.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat's even more concerning about this longer term is that Equifax is a major data aggregator, broker, and analytics firm. Given that we don't know the extent of the information breached, it's likely this reaches further into data that Equifax transforms as part of its marketing and analytic services,\u201d said Pollard. \u201cWhat kind of data did Equifax have, what did they do with it, and what is now in the\u00a0adversaries\u00a0hands? How much do they know about us is based on these analytics services?\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe breach is also one \u201cin a long line of examples demonstrating how organizations can be exposed to cyber risk via weak security controls from a third party in their digital ecosystem,\u201d said Tony Urbanovich, chief operating officer, CyberGRX. \u201cWhether it's to conduct employment and income verifications or to determine the credit worthiness of the people and businesses they interact with, organizations across the\u00a0country\u00a0trust the big three credit bureaus and expect\u00a0them to have\u00a0strong security controls in place protecting the data they rely on to run their businesses\u00a0and protect their own personal information. The Equifax breach shows that the concept\u00a0of\u00a0blind trust is outdated. It's critical for organizations to understand the real-time security postures of all third parties in their digital ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe information pilfered by the hackers has a long shelf life and will likely be used in scams for years to come.\n\n\u201cThis breach will have devastating consequences for many of the people whose data was compromised,\u201d says Plixer CEO Michael Patterson, adding that the cost would be \u201cenormous\u201d for both Equifax and millions of consumers. \u201cCybercriminals have all the data they need for identity theft including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers. The cost of this breach will be enormous for not only for Equifax, but more importantly for the millions of innocent consumers who have been affected.\u201d \n\nFeather expects \u201ca ripple effect as well, given it has exposed nearly every aspect of one's financial history.\u201d Websites, he said, \u201chold the keys to the kingdom for many organizations in terms of access and availability to sensitive customer data, and this is an unfortunate reminder of what can happen when website security is overlooked, as is all too often the case. Many organizations neglect website security, focusing on simpler, more well-known endpoint solutions.\u201d\n\nNoting that \u201cmany businesses and financial institutions rely on the compromised information,\u201d Kolochenko said cybercriminals now \u201chave a great wealth of opportunities to conduct spear phishing, fraud, identity theft, impersonation and social engineering attacks against the victims of the breach.\u201d He cautioned that the industry should brace \u201cfor a skyrocketing number of attacks targeting not only the victims, but their relatives, employers and partners. The breached database will likely be shared among various cyber gangs, exacerbating the damage.\u201d\n\nA breach of this magnitude at a credit monitoring service has deeper implications for future relationships between consumers and the financial industry. Kolochenko called the breach \u201cdisastrous\u2026probably one of the most detrimental breaches of this year, capable of undermining trust in an already quite fragile online financial space.\u201d\n\nAnd Feather noted that \u201cthe American public trusts the three credit bureaus with their most vital information and holds them to the highest security standards,\u201d which explains \u201cwhy this breach at Equifax is not only a breach of data, but it's also a breach of trust that will take a very long time to repair.\u201d\n\nThe incident could also \u201chave wide-reaching implications for how Americans identify themselves in the future, such as when applying for banking and credit services \u2013 simply knowing a name, date of birth, address and Social Security number shouldn't ever be enough,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThis breach could finally be the security wakeup call the US needs to widely adopt digital identity tokens, and potentially a digital national identity scheme similar to other countries such as Belgium.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhat to do, what to do\n\nIf a company like Equifax, which handles extremely sensitive information, has \u201cevery incentive to keep the most sensitive kind of information secure, and whose CEO, Richard F. Smith, said has \u201cmade significant investments in data security\u201d can \u201cstill experience a breach,\u201d said Josh Mayfield, platform specialist, Immediate Insight at FireMon, said \u201cit stands to reason that our playbook needs a revision,\u201d said Mayfield.\u00a0\u201cThe security playbook consists of a few guidelines and directives, and most organizations have been following this playbook for many years.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis kind of incident, said Wilk, \u201camplifies the voices calling out for a more secure method of accessing accounts,\u201d noting that \u201ccombining two-factor authentication with a passive biometric solution would render these kind of breaches a thing of the past.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMost companies, Kolochenko said, \u201cdon't even have an up-to-date application inventory,\u201d which makes it impossible for them to identify their assets. \u201cWithout knowing your assets, you won't be able to protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cMany global companies still rely on obsolete automated solutions and tools for their application security, while cybercriminals are already using machine-learning in their attacks when targeting and profiling the victims for example.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOrganizations can reestablish consumer trust to improving control of \u201cthe executing code that renders content on their digital properties. The first step is to identify all partners involved in website operations, a process that will yield valuable insight into enterprise-specific ecosystems,\u201d said Olson, who maintained that a highly dynamic digital environment calls for a continuous security approach. \u201cFrom there, enterprises must clearly communicate their policies for executing on their site and enforce those policies. Partners that violate the policies should be blocked from the website. It's that simple.\"\n\nRocky regulatory and legal terrain\n\nWhile the fallout of the breach is still settling and questions about just how it occurred are mounting, one thing is certain \u2013 Equifax needs to provide answers and remedies quickly or face the wrath of regulators and legislators.\n\nBy all accounts, the company's response to the breach has been found lacking \u2013 from the long stretch between discovery and disclosure, during which time three executives sold off around $1.8 million of stock, to its seeming attempts to pitch its monitoring products and its poorly worded disclaimer that seemed to force consumers to give up their right to sue the company so they could see if their data had been affected in the breach. \n\n\u201cLast but not least, such a delayed public disclosure of the breach is quite dubious,\u201d said Kolochenko. \u201cProbably the disclosure was reasonably postponed in the interests of investigation, but it still could endanger the victims. Most important now is to make sure that we do not underestimate the scale of the breach, and have properly identified every victim and the integrity of data that was stolen.\u201d\n\nCritics noted that Equifax's slow disclosure could put it afoul of state data breach laws \u2013 and in the future international regulations like Europe's General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), which demand quicker notification, sometimes as little as 72 hours, after a breach discovery.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether an organization or country is part of the EU and or needs to comply with GDPR, taking this long to report a breach is arguably morally incorrect and unacceptable in today's world. Whilst not the largest breach of all time (Yahoo), 143 million US consumers are now left worrying whether their personal identifiable information is in the wrong hands. In addition it has been reported that both Canadian and U.K. data may have been included,\u201d said Simon Townsend, chief technologist \u2013 EMEA at Ivanti. \u201cThe reason it took 40 days to report is unknown but it will no doubt come down to a common challenge that many organizations face when IT teams and the business are not aligned or are not in sync when it comes to technology, processes and workflows.\u201d\n\nEU GDPR, he said \u201cis trying to help organizations realize the importance of data protection come May 2018, and whilst there are many technologies which can help solve tactical points across the many articles contained in the GDPR, the real message here is around changing both technology, people and processes to create a more unified approach\u201d to cybersecurity. Fines for not complying with GDPR will be quite steep so U.S. companies will need to step up their game.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of Equifax data and the magnitude of the breach make this a watershed moment in breach detection and response. Many difficult questions will be asked and become the crux of numerus legal actions that will likely stem from this event,\u201d said Mark Sangster, vice president and industry security strategist at eSentire. \u201cThe most obvious, is why it took so long to disclose the breach. The risk to consumers begins to drop exponentially as soon as the breach becomes public, and affected companies and consumers can take defensive measures to protect their financial identity and funds.\u201d\n\nSangster noted that the Atlanta-based Equifax \u201cis bound by the state breach notification laws of Georgia, which require a firm to report a breach, stating, \u2018The notice shall be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.' In some circumstances, notification is to be made\u00a0within 24 hours. Did Equifax meet this requirement and do everything in its power to protect those affected by the breach?\u201d\n\nThose are questions that have piqued the interest of Congress, as well. \u201cIt's outrageous that\u00a0@Equifax\u00a0-- a company whose one job is to collect consumer information -- failed to safeguard data for 143M Americans,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Mass., tweeted.\n\nBy Friday, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., was calling on his colleagues in the House Judiciary Committee to investigate. \u201cIn light of recent events, I request the Committee call upon representatives from the \u201cBig Three\u201d credit reporting agencies \u2013 Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax \u2013 to testify not only on the breach that occurred in May 2017, but also to identify how each company is taking proactive, defensive steps to prevent such breaches in the future,\u201d Lieu wrote in a letter to the committee. \u201cCongress has a strong role to play in preventing such attacks on our financial and IT infrastructure, and must hold those entrusted with our most sensitive data to account.\u201d\n\nBy Monday, it seems that Congress would assume that role. The House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that it will hold a hearing on the breach as did the House Financial Services Committee.\n\n\u201cIt's outrageous that\u00a0@Equifax\u00a0-- a company whose one job is to collect consumer information -- failed to safeguard data for 143M Americans,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Mass., tweeted Friday.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee said it will hold a hearing on the breach as did the House Financial Services Committee.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breaches/topic/47250/", "topic_name": "Data Breaches"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Samsung announces bug bounty for devices and services", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/samsung-announces-200k-bug-bounty/article/688078/", "title": "Samsung announces bug bounty for devices and services", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "September 12, 2017", "body": "Samsung is joining the ranks of Apple and other competitors and looking to boost the security of their platforms with the launch of its own bug bounty program offering up to $200,000 for qualifying vulnerability reports.\n\nThe severity of each will be classified as Critical, High, Moderate, and Low depending on the security risk and payouts will start at $200 for low level finds, Samsung said on the bug bounty launch page. \u00a0\n\nAwards will be paid to researchers who submit qualifying vulnerabilities affecting the Galaxy S series, the Galaxy Note series, and other Samsung mobile devices in their latest Android version and firmware as well as for bugs in Samsung Mobile services or applications signed by Samsung Mobile.\n\n\u201cWe take security and privacy issues very seriously; and as an appreciation for helping Samsung Mobile improve the security of our products and minimizing risk to our end-consumers, we are offering a rewards program for eligible security vulnerability reports,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to your continued interests and participations in our Samsung Mobile Security Rewards Program.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Billions of Bluetooth devices vulnerable to takeovers, MITM attacks; no user action required", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/billions-of-bluetooth-devices-vulnerable-to-takeovers-mitm-attacks-no-user-action-required/article/688037/", "title": "Billions of Bluetooth devices vulnerable to takeovers, MITM attacks; no user action required", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "September 12, 2017", "body": "Billions of Bluetooth devices, including those running on Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows, contain major vulnerabilities that can allow malicious actors to remotely execute code, take over devices, and perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, researchers have reported.\n\nWhat's more, attackers do not need to trick users into performing an action in order to compromise or infect them, nor does a target device's Bluetooth have to paired with an attacking device or even be in Discovery Mode. The device simply has to have its Bluetooth feature turned on, which for most products is the default setting.\n\nEven worse, compromised devices can then be further leveraged to attack additional nearby systems over the air, including any segregated or air-gapped devices that happen to be\u00a0Bluetooth-enabled. \"Basically, it's an airborne delivery method or attack vector that could be very easily abused,\" said Nadis Izrael, CTO and co-founder of Armis, in an interview with SC Media.\n\nDubbed BlueBorne, the collection of vulnerabilities \u2013\u00a0eight in total, three of which are critical \u2013 was discovered by researchers from Internet of Things security company Armis. The flaws potentially impact at least 5.3 billion Bluetooth-enabled devices, including computers, smartphones, and IoT devices such as watches, smart TVs, and some automobile systems.\n\n\u201cThese silent attacks are invisible to traditional security controls and procedures. Companies don't monitor these types of device-to-device connections in their environment, so they can't see these attacks or stop them,\u201d said Yevgeny Dibrov, CEO of Armis, in a company\u00a0press release. \u201cThe research illustrates the types of threats facing us in this new connected age.\u201d\n\nBecause phones compromised via BlueBorne bugs can quickly infect nearby devices over the air, attacks can quickly spread like wildfire, creating potentially unprecedented scenarios. Michael Parker,\u00a0VP of marketing at Armis, used the\u00a0WannaCry\u00a0ransomware attack as an example. \"You had WannaCry. Now imagine WannaCry 'Blue,'\" said Parker to SC Media. \"It is ransomware that is spread through Bluetooth...It can spread from device to device, unnoticed by current security measures, locking down smartphones, desktops, laptops, and it can't be stopped by traditional methods.\" Or, the attacker could stay under radar, perhaps delivering botnet malware that \"just lays and waits to be activated\" at just the right moment.\n\nBetween April and August 2017, Armis researchers contacted Apple, Google, Linux, and Microsoft Corporation to disclose the various BlueBorne vulnerabilities. In response, Google has developed a patch for Android 6 and 7 devices, and has notified its manufacturing partners of the update.\n\nMicrosoft announced today that it released a security update back in July that addressed BlueBorne vulnerabilities in devices running on all supported Windows versions. (Windows Phones were not impacted by the flaws.) \"...Customers who have Windows Update enabled and applied the security updates, are protected automatically,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told SC Media via email. \"We updated to protect customers as soon as possible, but as a responsible industry partner, we withheld disclosure until other vendors could develop and release updates.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe Linux kernel security team has confirmed that it will release a patch as well, but there is confirmation on when this will happen.\n\nAnd Apple is well ahead of the game, as the specific BlueBorne vulnerability that Armis researchers discovered in iOS was actually fixed with the distribution of version 10 of the mobile operating system. However, any\u00a0devices running on iOS versions 9.3.5 and earlier, as well as AppleTV devices using version 7.2.2 or lower, remain vulnerable.\n\nArmis lists the eight vulnerabilities as follows:\n\nThe Android\u00a0information leak bug is located\u00a0in the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) server, which enables a device to identify other Bluetooth services in its vicinity. According to an Armis blog post published today, the flaw \"enables the attacker to send a set of crafted requests to the server, causing it to disclose memory bits in response.\" This data can then be leveraged to defeat a device's security measures, exploit RCE vulnerabilities, take over the device, and break Bluetooth encryption in order to eavesdrop on communications.\n\nThe two Android RCE flaws\u00a0reside, respectively, in the Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP) service (which enables tethering) and the\u00a0Personal Area Networking (PAN) profile, which exists within BNEP. In both cases, attackers can exploit these errors to create a memory corruption that allows them to run code on the device.\n\nThe Android Bluetooth Pineapple vulnerability also exists within the PAN profile, and allows attackers to intercept traffic between Bluetooth devices as well as impersonate a legitimate Bluetooth device with which a victim is attempting to communicate. This is possible, the Armis blog post explains, because the vulnerability allows bad actors \"to create a malicious network interface on the victim's device, re-configure IP routing and force the device to transmit all communication through the malicious network interface.\"\u00a0\n\nA second, similar vulnerability in\u00a0the Bluetooth stack, referred to as the\u00a0Bluetooth Pineapple in Windows,\u00a0affects both Android and Windows devices.\u00a0The Pineapple flaws are named so when exploited, the impacted devices essentially behave like a Wi-Fi Pineapple\u00a0wireless penetration testing tool that's conducting a man-in-the-middle attack. But unlike a WiFi-based MITM scenario, this attack does not require any special equipment or a connection request from the targeted device to pull off.\n\nThe first of two BlueBorne vulnerabilities found in Linux devices consists of an information leak vulnerability \u2013 similar to the Android data leak bug\u00a0\u2013 in the user space process of the Bluetooth stack. \"When the process receives a response which is too long, it stores the excess part without proper validation. This can be used by an attacker to anticipate the process' activity and expose sensitive data it withholds,\" the Armis blog post explains.\n\nThe second Linux flaw is a stack overflow within the BlueZ\u00a0kernel\u00a0that causes a memory corruption that attackers can exploit to gain full control of the affected device.\n\nFinally, the Apple vulnerability that was patched with iOS 10 was an RCE bug in the Low Energy Audio Protocol (LEAP), a new protocol for streaming audio to certain peripheral devices. The flaw allows attackers to gain control of a drive via a memory corruption that's triggered by a crafted audio command.\n\nArmis researchers Ben Seri and Gregory Vishnepolsky are specifically credited with discovering the BlueBorne bugs. A technical paper from Armis further explaining the bugs is available here.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ios/topic/47255/", "topic_name": "iOS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/zero-day/topic/49474/", "topic_name": "Zero Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Most Android phones susceptible to the Toast overlay vulnerability", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/most-android-phones-susceptible-to-the-toast-overlay-vulnerability/article/687949/", "title": "Most Android phones susceptible to the Toast overlay vulnerability", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 11, 2017", "body": "A critical vulnerability in all Android devices running any version of the OS except 8.0 that if left unpatched can let hackers steal credentials, lock the device or install unwanted applications has been disclosed.\n\nPaloAlto's Unit 42 reported the vulnerability allows for an overlay, specifically the Toast overlay, window attack to take place because the older Android versions simply do not have the checks in place that would prevent a malicious overlay window from taking over the device. The issue was brought Google's attention by Palo Alto on May 30, 2017 and the fix was included with the September 5 Android Security Bulletin. However, the patch must be deployed by users.\n\nThe starting point for this attack has the malicious actor spoofing the device owner into enabling the Android Accessibility Service and granting them device administrator privilege by changing what the victim sees on the display. This is usually accomplished through a clickjacker overlay attack. \n\nThe Toast overlay is a powerful and useful tool for the perpetrators as it has several built in abilities that can be co-opted. \n\n\u201cThe Toast overlay is typically used to display a quick message over all other apps. For example, a message indicating that an e-mail has been saved as draft when a user navigates away without sending an e-mail. It naturally inherits all configuration options as for other windows types. However, our research has found using the Toast window as an overlay window allows an app to write over the interface of another App without requesting the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW privilege this typically requires,\u201d Unit 42 said.\n\nAndroid versions 7.0 and earlier are vulnerable due to a missing permissions and operation check. Normally an overlay requires both, but with TYPE_TOAST neither check is in place and the request is just granted. \n\nTwo layers of protection are included in version 7.1, but these can be defeated. The layers include a timeout and only allowing a single layer to be used at a time. However, the single-layer protection is defeated with a LooperThread to continuously show a Toast window, this also confuses the timeout feature because with layers continuously appearing it cannot tell if it has been clicked.\n\nAndroid 8.0, the newest, is fully protected.\n\nOnce the attacker as administrative rights it can install an app allowing that person to lock the device screen, reset the PIN, wipe the data and prevent the user from uninstalling the app.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Severe flaws in voting software threaten integrity of German elections, hacking collective reports", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/severe-flaws-in-voting-software-threaten-integrity-of-german-elections-hacking-collective-reports/article/687625/", "title": "Severe flaws in voting software threaten integrity of German elections, hacking collective reports", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "September 08, 2017", "body": "A European hacker association on Thursday warned that software being used to tabulate and transmit vote totals in Germany's upcoming parliamentary elections contains major vulnerabilities that could threaten the integrity of the outcome and undermine voter confidence.\n\nThe Germany-based Chaos Computer Club is claiming in an organizational blog post\u00a0and technical report that the software, PC-Wahl version 10, is susceptible to various external attacks, including those that could secretly modify vote totals before they are reported to electoral officials.

The hackers also accessed credit card information of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and dispute documents that included personal identifying information for about 182,000 consumers.\n\nEquifax learned of the data breach on July 29, which it said was the result of exploitation of a U.S. website app, and brought in an outside security firm to do the forensics.\u00a0\n\n\"It should be noted, also, that this breach did not happen by the more popular social engineering style attacks such as a phishing email compromising an employee's system or a malicious insider leaking the data, but rather, this was due to an application vulnerability in one of their websites,\" said\u00a0Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at AsTech. \"This is something we in the security community continue to see rising, as organizations are getting better and better at defending servers, workstations and laptops, the cyber criminals simply move on to the next easiest target, which is most commonly the organization's web applications.\"\u00a0\n\nWenzler said regardless of industry, it's no longer good enough to just defend internal systems. \"More and more, a comprehensive security strategy is absolutely necessary that covers education, technical security controls for servers and other assets, network security and stronger software development practices that create secure applications during development and not tacked on after the fact. Hackers will find the easiest path to steal data, and organizations must be more diligent about making security part of every aspect of their technology infrastructure and development efforts.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmassive, and unfortunate\u201d breach \u201conce again amplifies the need for better application security testing and assurance on a continuous basis,\u201d said CYBRIC CTO Mike Kail. \u201cThe status quo isn't working as these types of exploits are becoming all too common.\"\u00a0\n\nEquifax acknowledged that the incident was a disappoint to a company charged with handling and protecting information.\n\n\"This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes,\" Equifax Chairman and CEO\u00a0Richard F. Smith said. \"We pride ourselves on\u00a0being a leader in managing and protecting data, and we are conducting a thorough review of our overall security operations.\u00a0 We also are focused on consumer protection and have developed a comprehensive portfolio of services to support all U.S. consumers, regardless of whether they were impacted by this incident.\"\n\nThe credit information company has created a dedicated website to assist consumers in determining if theirs is among the information affected. They can sign up for ID theft protection and credit monitoring services at the site. Equifax is also mailing out notices to consumers whose credit card numbers or dispute documents containing PII were affected by the breach.\n\nWhile U.S. consumers seemed to be in the crosshairs in this incident, the company's probe also uncovered unauthorized access to \u201climited personal information\u201d for some residents in the U.K. and Canada.\n\nMatt Schultz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com\u00a0advised consumers to be diligent \u201cand not just in the short term,\u201d noting that \u201cbad guys can be very patient, so it's important to keep an eye out long after this story fades from the headlines.\"\n\n\u201cWe think nothing of checking Facebook or Instagram 10 times a day, but many think it is too much to ask to check your bank statements once a week,\u201d said Schultz. \u201cIt's not. It's easy to do, doesn't take long and can help you spot problems before they get out of control.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Researcher: Flaw in Windows kernel hinders identification of potentially dangerous files", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/researcher-flaw-in-windows-kernel-hinders-identification-of-potentially-dangerous-files/article/687291/", "title": "Researcher: Flaw in Windows kernel hinders identification of potentially dangerous files", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "September 07, 2017", "body": "A researcher is warning that a programming error in the Microsoft Windows kernel might inhibit security software vendors and kernel developers from properly identifying modules loaded during runtime, including potentially malicious files. However, Microsoft does not view the issue as a security threat.\n\nAccording to Omri Misgav, security researcher at enSilo, the bug affects all Windows operating systems from Windows 2000 to Windows 10. Specifically, the flaw pertains to a security mechanism called PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine, which provides notifications when PE image files are loaded in runtime to virtual memory space.\n\nWhen such a notification is triggered, the Windows kernel is supposed to provide the parameter FullImageName to help identify the PE image. However, writes Misgav in an Aug. 5\u00a0blog post, \"we noticed that while we do get the full path of the process executable file and constant values for system DLLs... for the rest of the dynamically loaded user-mode PEs the paths provided are missing the volume name.\"\n\nAdditionally, \"What's more alarming is that not only does that path come without the volume name, sometimes the path is completely malformed, and could point to a different or non-existing file.\"\n\nA Bleeping Computer article addressing the bug notes that certain security software programs use PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine to detect malicious activity, yet the bug potentially allows attackers to fool this mechanism, causing it to overlook malware files.\n\nAsked for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson offered the following statement: \u201cOur engineers reviewed the information and determined this does not pose a security threat and we do not plan to address it with a security update.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Google releases Stable Channel Update for Chrome", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/the-update-included-22-security-patches-including-six-high-rated-bugs/article/687134/", "title": "Google releases Stable Channel Update for Chrome", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "September 07, 2017", "body": "Google released a Stable Channel Update for Chrome desktop which included 22 security patches including six high rated bugs.\n\nThe high rated vulnerabilities included a use after free bug in PDFium, memory lifecycle issue in PDFium, Heap buffer overflow in WebGL, heap buffer overflow in Skia, and two separate type confusion bugs in V8, according to a Sept. 5, press release.
