Last Friday, Paris went under seven attacks at different places where there was a rush of people leading to 129 dead and more than 415 injured.French authorities are showing some interest in the world\u2019s most popular gaming console Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 and think that it has been used as a communication medium between the ISIS members to plan this annihilation.Authorities carried out many raids in areas close to Brussels to hunt down the people responsible for the barbarian act and succeeded in killing eight terrorists whereas a large number of their accomplices are still missing.Jan Jambon, the Belgian Federal Minister for Home Affairs bluntly said that the PlayStation 4 was used by the ISIS members to communicate with each other for planning these killings due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to monitor the conversation made on it. He also said, \u201cPlayStation 4 is even more difficult to keep track of than \u2018Whatsapp\u2019.\u201dOn the launch of all the new generation consoles, there was a question about its privacy especially about its peripheral devices Microsoft\u2019s Kinect and PlayStation\u2019s own camera which could possibly be used to keep an eye on the user.The non-peripheral based communication on these consoles like PlayStation4 which is considered low-tech & somehow hypothetical, offer a medium to efficiently communicate with each other than any other satellite/encrypted emails, calls or text messages.Edward Snowden, in 2013 leaked some documents which exposed that CIA and NSA did try and succeed to spy in online games. These agencies embedded themselves in games like \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d to intrude the player\u2019s conversation.However, it is still uncertain if the ISIS terrorists really did use PS4 to converse and actually used it to plan the whole massacre. The online gamers and users of PlayStation4 might actually know that ordinary voice chat in any online game could have functioned sufficient enough to plan an attack like this as it is difficult for the agencies to monitor IP-based conversation as compared to a simple cellular network.In 2010, the FBI wanted access to all internet communication channels including game chats but the Federal Communication Commission did not allow them to access peer to peer communications, however, the agency on its own built system of monitoring gaming chats to chase criminals.Usually all of the gaming consoles available in the market whether it is PlayStation or Xbox, they all come with a built-in function of Voice and Text chat for gaming purpose and it seems quite hard to eliminate such a \u201cGame useful\u201d communication method. The online gamers do also know many methods of communicating with each other without even saying a word like in a shooting game, the terrorists could have written their message on a wall using their guns, \u201cSounds creepy\u201d but that is how it is.The point is to see how deep have the NSA and CIA gone into spying into the games because if they did not think about this non-verbal communication earlier then they seriously need to consider their security flaws and have to have an eye on every gaming console\u2019s every game being played over the internet which is nearly impossible.Forbes reports that It has not been confirmed, that a console was found as a result of specific Belgian terror raids.

On the other hand, KillerRat has been designed specifically with one aspect in mind, that is, to take over Windows PCs.AlienVault, a cyber security vendor, identified this new spyware and conducted an in-depth analysis of the threat and confirmed that KillerRat shares codebase of njRAT.AlienVault is of the opinion that KillerRat has amazing spying capabilities and allows attackers to interact with the local filesystem, local processes and local registry of the victim along with executing shell commands on the targeted PC.Moreover, Vault observed that KillerRat can steal passwords from the victim\u2019s browser, enable keylogging function, activate webcam and record real-time feed on the victim\u2019s PC, initiate a remote desktop session and use the victim\u2019s PC as a proxy device for their network traffic.KillerRat can also launch DDoS attacks and open a webpage in the user\u2019s browser along with running custom scripts and infecting the PC with numerous other malware.That is not all; KillerRat is also capable of transmitting the collected data to a command and control server.As per AlienVault\u2019s analysis, this new spyware has only been detected only by one antivirus firm out of 35.Another notable aspect is that the creator of KillerRat did not keep his identity hidden and, in fact, has left his real name and link to his personal Facebook page in the About section of KillerRat.When we followed that link, we landed on the Facebook profile page of Ahmed Ibrahim.From Ibrahim\u2019s timeline on Facebook, we acquired the information that KillerRat V4.0.1 was released on Oct 30 whereas its previous versions were also released the same month, v3.1.6 on Oct 23 and v2.9.6 on Oct 18.Also revealed was the fact that apart from KillerRat, Ibrahim is working on another tool called Wedges Worm.At HackRead, our security writers have been reporting on the dangers of Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which sits behind your OS, records and send the sessions to the attacker.One report that shock the readers was about the Canadian couple who had their laptop camera hacked with the help of RAT and recorded each and everything they did in their room.However, KillerRat is not the only RAT making it to the news this month.

In 2014 alone 6000 cars have been stolen in London with this type of hacking.What makes these hacks so simple is the availability of the hacking devices.

Basically, car security locks work on the authentication of the unique key provided for the car and it\u2019s very easy for the hackers to produce a carbon copy of that key.In spite of wireless locking system being so vulnerable to hacking, lack of reported hacks show such incidents are a rare occurrence.However, one question still remains; how does the hacker really hack the cars? What\u2019s the process?

He stated that this new and improved system is designed to prevent hackers and attackers from taking control or disabling the programmable logic controllers \u2013 a shipboard system that is operated using computers and is responsible to communicate with the physical components of the ship.For instance, the components that RHIMES is expected to protect include anchoring, electric power, damage control and firefighting, steering and engine, electric power, climate control, hydraulics. In a nutshell, this anti-hacking system will protect all physical parts of the ship from hackers.In a traditional computer security system, protection to the computer and the stored data is only provided against the viruses and malware that are previously detected. So whenever a new threat is developed by a hacker, first the security providers must detect it, update their databases and then release a new update in order to protect the users from the threat. Though, during the whole process, users remain vulnerable to the security threat.Craven explained that instead of relying on the traditional security systems that keeps users vulnerable to security threats for certain time period, the US Navy is working on RHIMES which depend on an advanced cyber protection techniques in order to introduce diversity and stop the entire class of security threat in a single attempt.  Craven said:\u201cVulnerabilities exist wherever computing intersects with the physical world, such as in factories, cars and aircraft, and these vulnerabilities could potentially benefit from the same techniques for cyber resilience.\u201dCraven further explained that the operating system being used these days are based on the same core programming and there is no diversity, which is why if one system gets infected then all the linked computer system would be infected too.But with RHIMES, the developers have introduced diversity in the programming that uses different implementation for each controller system of the ship\u2019s hardware.

These kits also feature a tiny camera and are specially designed to capture card data as well as PIN code being typed in by the cardholder.These kits are so small in size that it becomes next to impossible for the average person to detect if the scamming kit has been installed on the ATM or not.Regardless of the method being used by hacker to steal your card data, it has been observed by the security researchers that hackers usually targets easy to access ATMs because they find it easy to install scamming kits onto the machine without getting caught.So it is best to avoid using any ATM located in uninhabited areas or areas where there is less activity because those are the easiest targets for hackers.Increasing The Security Of ATM CardThe never-ending fight between banks and hackers has resulted in the development of some progressive fraud prevention system that is intelligent enough to know who you are and what you buy using your credit or debit card.This new system is specifically designed to observe your purchase patterns and then alerts the system if any abnormal transaction has been detected. This fraud prevention system would work because it has been observed that hackers, after stealing the card data, first check the security system by performing low-cost transactions before conducting transactions with hefty amounts.But still, most of the card issued by banks is based on the old magnetic-stripe system instead of issuing the EMV chip-based cards, which is the reason why there has been an increase in the fraudulent transactions and ATM card data theft using methods like scamming.Those cards that are equipped with a tiny chip are more secure than the cards that rely only on magnetic stripes for the storage of account information. Even though the data stored in the magnetic stripes are identical to that of chip but it contains an added layer of security that is known as Integrated-Circuit Card Verification Value (iCVV), which can also be referred to as EMV Tokenisation.must readStandard Chartered Bank hacked \u2014 Hackers stole money Via ATMsSo it is better to opt for a card equipped with the chip as well as magnetic-stripe for an increased security of the transactions being carried out from your card.In conclusion, it can be said that apart from physically infecting the Automated Teller Machine, hackers can systematically modify the machine since every machine uses some sort of operating system to operate. Hackers would be able to find vulnerabilities within those systems and then exploit it by installing malware to steal user data from the cards.", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "September 20, 2015"}, {"topics": ["anonymous", "Antisec", "Cyber Attack", "Defacement", "hacking", "HACKTIVISM", "security", "Vietnam"], "title": "Anonymous Hacks Vietnam Govt websites Against Human Rights Abuse", "body": "The online hacktivists affiliated to Anonymous, AntiSec and HagashTeam conducted a cyber attack on Vietnamese government websites against online censorship and human rights violations in the country.The hacktivist groups left a deface page along with a message on 8 Vietnamese government websites against the imprisonment of thousands of political prisoners.

Once destructed, the chip becomes completely unusable hence preventing data theft and providing a revolutionary device for ultimate data security.The chip is developed by DARPA as part of their vanishing programmable resources project. These chips can be used for the storage of data that requires high-level of security such as encryption keys.The chip is designed on a glass, which we all know can be shattered, that has the capability to shatter into a million teeny-weeny pieces. The researchers used Corning Gorilla Glass and transformed it into a tempered glass to make sure that the reconstruction of shattered pieces becomes next to impossible.The Gorilla Glass produced by Corning is a tough glass that is being widely used in the smartphone displays to protect screens from shattering or scratching from rough usage.

The researchers found that Cisco 1841, 2811, and 3825 are the three known affected routers. These routers are widely used by businesses and organizations to provide networked services.However, it is believed that other Cisco routers using similar IOS image and core functionality could also be vulnerable to the firmware backdoor attacks.The attack method being used by the hackers to infect and install the malicious firmware in the router is not exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, rather, researchers found out that the login credentials of the affected routers were revealed by the attackers or set to default.Furthermore, the router is being used as a hub in the network that controls all the connected devices and computers, so this makes it an ultimate target for the attackers to further infect the network.The router implant, SYNful Knock, comprises of an amended Cisco IOS software platform that allows the hacker to remotely load various functional modules directly from the anonymity of the Internet. The infected firmware also lets the attacker access router unrestricted through a secret backdoor password.The functional modules that are loaded by the hacker can be enabled through the HTTP protocol, which has not been secured nor used a precisely developed TCP packets sent to the routers interface. These TCP packets use a modified sequence and consistent acknowledgment numbers.The modules loaded into the router can self-manifest themselves as a self-governing executable code within the router\u2019s IOS image that offer a very similar functionality as the backdoor password. These backdoor passwords allow hackers to gain access to the router through the Telnet and console.You can see in the illustration embedded below about how attackers can gain access over to the Cisco routers.Another serious security concern this firmware attack possess is that it exists within a modified Cisco IOS image file.

Users also tend to develop their own workarounds to handle \u2018password overload,\u2019 often reusing the same password on multiple websites or they write their passwords on a piece of paper.\u201cUsers are generally told to remember passwords, and to not share them, re-use them, or write them down.

Whereas ordinarily such a request would go straight to a command and control server \u2014 and thus be traceable \u2014 Ouroboros instead sends the request to an unwitting decoy server, which has been selected because the hackers have identified it as a satellite communications user.The request from Ouroboros is then automatically routed via a commercial satellite and beamed to earth towards the location of the decoy.Once the decoy server receives the request for instructions, it discards it, because the request is meaningless to it.But the satellite will have beamed the request over a large geographical area. A hidden receiver anywhere in the area, planted by Ouroboros\u2019 operators, can then pick up the unencrypted request. The receiver then issues a reply to Ouroboros, disguised as a communication returning from the decoy.Any defender looking to trace communications from Ouroboros back to its controllers will thus lose their trace from the point at which the data becomes a signal beamed from a satellite, effectively breaking any direct digital link.Ouroboros\u2019 handlers appear to favour satellite operators in the Middle East and Africa, Kaspersky\u2019s report said. Depending on the size of the receiving dish they have in place, the area counter-intelligence investigators would have to search for the Ouroboros receivers could be tens of thousands of square kilometres.\u201cThe receivers do not necessarily cost much themselves but finding a physical location for these indicates that there is some kind of extensive logistical support network,\u201d Mr Tanase said. Such operations point to a state intelligence service, he added.Western security officials have previously told the Financial Times they believe Ouroboros to be a Russian operation \u2014 a fact supported by the group\u2019s targets and clues in the coding of the malware itself.Satellite operators are meanwhile powerless to prevent the hackers from routing requests through their networks \u2014 at least for the next few years. The only other way to do so, experts note, would be for them to encrypt all of their downstream communications \u2014 a process that would require the launch of entirely new satellite arrays.sourceFT", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "date": "September 11, 2015"}, {"topics": ["WE"], "title": "Pentagon Hacked Again, Credit Card Data Stolen", "body": "In August, we reported how Pentagon had its unclassified emailing server hacked allegedly by Russian hackers with a sophisticated phishing attack.Now, reportedly the computer systems of Pentagon\u2019s food court were infiltrated by hackers and resultantly the bank details of an unspecified number of employees got leaked.must readHomeland Security Credit Cards Used to Buy Starbucks Coffee worth $30,000The official spokesman of Defense Department, Lt.

And since the vulnerability exists within plugins too, so the total number of potential users could be much greater.Over 24 exploited websites, in Denmark alone were detected by the security experts that are delivering the payload through malicious script injection.The security researchers have concluded that most of the antivirus applications are not advance enough yet to detect and stop these ransomware attacks. They said, specifically Teslacrypt ransomware attack was only detected by 10 out of 56 antivirus programs during the tests.Zaharia also emphasized that the Internet users should opt for secure and up-to-date web browsers, and should use supplementary security tools like antivirus software to further protect their computer system as well as their data from the ever-increasing ransomware threats.Suggest ideas, report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.com ", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Zscaler"], "title": "Android Ransomware Hidden Behind Fake Pornography App", "body": "Android is one of the most vulnerable OS in the world \u2014 If you are an Android user you need to be careful with downloading apps.Several malicious mobile apps have been surfaced on the Internet, which is a ransomware variant that takes advantage of offering pornography as a bait for targeted victims into downloading and installing these apps on their mobile phones, and these malicious ransomware apps are targeted towards Android user base.must readHackers Develop Android Malware Every 17 SecondsAccording to the research conducted by security experts over at US-based security firm Zscaler, once the malicious app has been installed onto the victim\u2019s mobile, it covertly takes pictures of the victim using the front-facing camera and then completely locks the device by displaying a message demanding ransom of over $500.It has been observed that cyber crimes based on ransomware malware is becoming a profitable zone for cybercriminals and hackers.

This stealer malware is specifically designed with ample strength that it is quite easy to steal data from targeted victim and have the capability to control the computer, reveals a security report published by IBM.must readTime To Cover Webcams: Wannabe Hackers Invading Your Privacy Using RATIt is relatively common for the security researchers to find information stealing malware, remote access tools (RATs), ransomware, and Trojans. But most of these researchers tend to ignore the information stealers because they seem to be less harmful which is why it affects a large number of organizations.Limor Kessem, the Cybersecurity Evangelist of IBM, describes this new info stealer as:\u201cCoreBot, a new information stealer discovered and analyzed by IBM Security X-Force researchers, who indicate this is one malware piece to watch out for. CoreBot appears to be quite modular, which means that its structure and internal makeup were programmed in a way that allows for the easy adding of new data theft and endpoint control mechanisms.\u201dThe security expert wrote that the discovery of CoreBot materialized when the researchers were reviewing the malware activity on the Trusteer-protected enterprise. Further studies discovered that the developer named the compiled file as \u201ccore\u201d while at the moment antivirus detection systems are distinguishing this malware as Eldorado or Dynamer!ac.\u201cCoreBot may appear artless at first glance, without real-time theft capabilities, it is more interesting on the inside,\u201d Kessem said.These info stealing botnets usually collect software keys, email credentials and anything else that is saved on the drive and seems interesting to the attackers. Moreover, it also has the capability to download and execute other harmful malware. Once stolen, all of these data are sold to the cyber criminals.Kessem reveals that CoreBot gain access to the computers via droppers. \u201cOnce the dropper is executed, it launches a svc host process in order to write the malware file to disk and then launch it. The dropper then exits,\u201d she said.Now, here comes the most interesting part of the CoreBot:\u201cCoreBot\u2019s most interesting facility is its plugin system, enabling it to be modular and easily supplemented with new theft capabilities. CoreBot downloads plugins from its command-and-control (C&C) server right after setting its persistence mechanism on the endpoint. It then loads the plugins using the plugininit export function in the plugin\u2019s DLL.\u201dCoreBot\u2019s most essential feature is scanning and stealing saved passwords and linked credentials that are stored within the browsers. Furthermore, the info stealer can also search the whole computer for credentials stored within the mail clients, FTP clients, cryptocurrency wallets, web mail accounts and other desktop-based applications.But what this malware cannot do is the real-time interception of data from the browsers.DGA is a feature that is specifically designed by attackers to provide malware botnets a capability to communicate with their command and control server.CoreBot makes use of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), which is not used by most of the info stealers so this feature is something unique. But security researchers found out that DGA is not yet activated in the malware.\u201cWith the DGA, the domain name is supposed to only be known in advance to the malware\u2019s operator, thus preventing security researchers from being able to take down the site or for other criminals to hijack the botnet. In CoreBot\u2019s case, the DGA parameters appear to generate different domains for geographical zones of the botnet and for groups of bots defined by the botmaster \u2014 a rather interesting concept for malware that is merely a generic stealer.\u201dResearch found out that once the malware finds any computer that is infected, it automatically begins to communicate with two domains, vincenzo-sorelli[.]com and arijoputane[.]com. And according to the WHOIS details of these domains, both are registered by a Russian-based hacker and have same identifications.Once CoreBot has infected the computer system, it can download, install and execute other malware from the Internet using tools like Microsoft task automation functionality, configuration management framework, and Windows PowerShell.

The team concluded that the real results were better than virtual simulations as letting the robot decide gave better baby bots in respective next rounds.Iida says that they are using the science of robotics to understand the emergence of intelligence \u2013 one of the biggest biological mysteries. The robots have been specifically designed to achieve tasks of repetitive nature instead of customization. The study shows that robots are very well capable of creativity and innovation.

All of these technological advancements and smarter devices are supposed to make our life easier, but now it seems like these revolutionary devices are making us more vulnerable to cyber attacks.must readSamsung\u2019s Smart TV may be Spying on YOU!As it turns out, recently at the DEFCON Black Hat security conference, a group of security researchers demonstrated an attack where they exploited a vulnerability found in Samsung smart refrigerator.The vulnerable refrigerator is a Samsung\u2019s new smart fridge, RF28HMELBSR, a 36-inch wide and 28 cubic feet 4-door refrigerator that comes pre-equipped with an 8-inch Wi-Fi-enabled LCD as well as the counter-height FlexZone drawer.All those features sound fascinating but think again. Why would you need a Wi-Fi enabled smart fridge? To post a check-in status on Facebook informing your friends what food products you are storing in your refrigerator? Or maybe to browse the Internet and check your emails while searching for food? Well, we can discuss that in the comments section below, anyway, let\u2019s get back to the topic.That Wi-Fi enabled LCD equipped in the refrigerator we are talking about might be helpful for some, but it is actually hackable and puts your Gmail login credentials at risk of being exploited, security researchers behind Pen Test Partners revealed in their blog post earlier this month.The security analysts spend hours to find a vulnerability within the app installed in the refrigerator and the mobile app (PlayStore link) developed by Samsung to wirelessly control the refrigerator, and found out that they were able to conduct man-in-the-middle attack to gain access to the Gmail login credentials, if they have an access to the Wi-Fi connectivity.Even though the software in the fridge does provide SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to establish an encrypted link but in reality, it completely failed to validate SSL certificates. This means that anyone with some knowledge about hacking could pretend to be Google and gain access to the victim\u2019s login credentials.\u201cWhilst the fridge implements SSL, it FAILS to validate SSL certificates, thereby enabling man-in-the-middle attacks against most connections. This includes those made to Google\u2019s servers to download Gmail calendar information for the on-screen display.\u201dApart from that, security researchers even attempted to find vulnerabilities within the refrigerator\u2019s firmware as well as the pre-installed Google Calendar app but failed to find any due to lack of access.Nevertheless, they added that man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack alone is enough to exploit user\u2019s Gmail login credentials and gain access to the account.Samsung, after knowing about the vulnerabilities in their product, told TheRegister in a statement that:   (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});\u201cAt Samsung, we understand that our success depends on consumers\u2019 trust in us, and the products and services that we provide.

The researchers have been actively monitoring the TOR exit nodes to identify the types of attacks being originated from the network.From the beginning of January 2015 until May 2015, near to almost 200,000 malicious events have been originated from the usage of TOR network in the United States alone, the report reveals.The most common types of attacks that have been increasingly infecting the TOR network, according to the X-Force researchers, are SQL injection (SQLi), vulnerability scanning and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.The research papers have also outlined the ways through which attackers can negatively use your corporate network to distribute malware and how you can protect your network to safeguard yourself from any legal charges.For example, connection to the TOR circuit can be easily executed through USB flash drive containing Linux-based operating system The Amnesic Incognito Live System (also known as TAILS) and does not require attacker to install anything onto the targeted corporate computer system, leaving no evidence on the affected network or system. This will allow your network to act as a privately subscribed and encrypted proxy.We believe that any corporations would not like to see a TOR node running on their network, considering it could cause severe concerns for the safety of their network. The security researchers said in the report:\u201cRunning a TOR relay is a donation of bandwidth and an open door to several forms of liability.

The breach occurred by the end of May or the early part of June 2015.At the moment there is no solid evidence of Chinese involvement in the UVa breach, but keeping in mind that the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is based in Langley, Virginia may have attracted the hackers to find some valuable information on military and security professionals or their families.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.comviaRoanoke", "authur": "Pushpa Mishra", "date": "August 20, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Net-Security"], "title": "Flaw in Remote Keyless System left Cars Vulnerable to Theft", "body": "The latest trend of vehicle hacking started by the DefCon and BlackHat security conferences has ignited a battle between the car manufacturers and hackers.Back in 2012, a research was conducted by three European researchers about the Megamos Crypto transponder, which is being used widely by hundreds of vehicle manufacturers around the world including Audi, Ferrari, Honda, Porsche, Volkswagen and many others.must readResearchers Show How To Hack Corvette with A Test MessageThe study conducted by the researchers revealed that the hackers could easily exploit the vulnerabilities found within the Megamos Crypto to start the vehicle without any key, and the vulnerability could be exploited within 60 minutes!This means the device designed to prevent the vehicle from being stolen can easily be disabled, resulting in a keyless theft.Of course this is a major security flaw found in hundreds of vehicles, but the academic research papers in which all of these vulnerabilities were exposed by the researchers was suppressed by the major car manufacturers for over two years because the researchers lost a case in the high court against Volkswagen resulting in a ban of publication of these papers.But after almost three years of negotiations between the researchers and the vehicle manufacturers, Volkswagen agreed to unban the publication of the research papers after the acceptance of a proposal that requires removal of one sentence from the papers.Actually, the researchers were interested in presenting their findings at the USENIX Security Symposium \u201913. But now those papers were presented at the USENIX Security Symposium \u201915 held at Washington, D.C. last week.The team, Flavio D. Garcia, Roel Verdult and Bari\u015f Ege of the U.K. based university said that there were a number of security vulnerabilities in the Megamos Crypto, which is manufactured by the Swiss-based firm.Operation of the said device is very simple, it just prevents the engine from starting if the transponder (i.e. an RFID chip) implanted in the car key does not exist.But according to the researchers, it is still possible to bypass that verification by listening to the signals being communicated between the key and the transponder, allowing the carjacker to initiate a close-range wireless communication attack hence starting the car.This is the reason why the giant vehicle manufacturers halted the publication of these papers as it could allow the carjackers with the appropriate tools to exploit the vulnerability and steal the vehicle. On the other hand, researchers were keen to get it published because their key aim was to improve the vehicle security system and get the vulnerability fixed by exposing it publicly.The researchers said in the research papers that, \u201cOur attacks require close range wireless communication with both the immobiliser unit and the transponder. It is not hard to imagine real-life situations like valet parking or car rental where an adversary has access to both for a period of time. It is also possible to foresee a setup with two perpetrators, one interacting with the car and one wirelessly pickpocketing the car key from the victim\u2019s pocket.\u201dSo the researchers actually somehow managed to reverse-engineer the security mechanisms featured inside the Megamos Crypto transponder, which includes the authentication protocol as well as ciphering the security code.Using the similar method, the team of researchers attempted to exploit the security system of about ten vehicles including Audi A4, Audi TT, Citroen Jumper, Fiat Punto, Fiat Ducato, Honda Jazz, Skoda Fabia, Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Scirocco, Volkswagen Passat, and Volvo S40. They were able to recover the 96-bit RFID secret key.Nicko Van Someren of Good Technology said:\u201cThis is a great example of what happens when you take an interface that was designed for local access and connect it to the wider Internet. Increasingly, in the rush to connect \u2018Things\u2019 for the Internet of Things, we find devices that were designed with the expectation of physical access control being connected to the Internet, the Cloud and beyond.

The loophole allows hackers to infect any targeted smartphone user, intercepting their voice calls and text messages, and will be able to track their locations as well.Recently demonstrated in the Australian TV programme 60 minutes, episode titled bugged, tracked, hacked, that aired on August 16th, the investigators presented an extraordinary report about how hackers were able to intercept and record the telephonic conversations as well as the locations of Australian senator, even when the hacker was located thousands of miles away in Germany.Investigations and reports revealed that eavesdropping is possible because of a security bug within the design of signalling system number 7.For those of you who don\u2019t know, Signalling System Number 7 (SS7) is telephony signalling protocols that was developed in 1975 and used to set up Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) based telephonic calls. This protocol supports local number portability, mobile phone roaming, Short Messaging Service (SMS), prepaid billing and other relevant services. And under international agreements, every telecommunication service provider must have to provide details of subscribers using SS7 on another service provider\u2019s request.Exploiting a vulnerability in this protocol and mobile phone roaming functionality, any hacker or intelligence agency can listen or record mobile phone conversation of any user by forwarding all voice calls to a web-based recording device. And then they can intentionally reroute those calls back to the projected recipient, initiating a well-known untraceable attack called man-in-the-middle.Nick Xenophon, Australian senator, told 60 Minutes in the programme:\u201cThe implications of it are enormous and what we find is shocking is that the security services, the intelligence services, they know about this vulnerability.\u201dLuca Melette, a guy behind SR Labs and a German-based hacker, while explaining about the hack said:\u201cThis is quite shocking for me also that Signalling System Number 7 (SS7) is not secure.\u201dSS7 request from the service provider instantly discloses personal details of the mobile phone user including the IMEI, name, account type as well as the contact details. And surprisingly, the requested information includes details about the cellular tower with which the mobile phone is currently connected, discovering the user\u2019s current location.So apart from recording the conversations, hackers can also keep track of the targeted mobile phone user\u2019s location and movement using application like Google Maps.What is more thought provoking is that from past few years, third party SMS messaging service providers and Voice-Over-Internet Protocol (VOIP) providers have been granted permissions to access SS7 query data, increasing the flaw in the signalling system protocol.Billions of Mobile Phone Users Vulnerable to HackThe demonstration also revealed that because of the security flaw in the system, SMS verification methods are also vulnerable as hackers can easily gain access to the victim\u2019s messages even before it reaches the customer. The similar method could be used to hack into victim\u2019s online email account.\u201cVerification by SMS message is useless against a determined hacker with access to the SS7 portal because they can intercept and use the SMS code before it gets to the bank customer.\u201dBut there\u2019s something worth noticeable in this demonstration. The German-based hackers had a legal access to the SS7 protocol service to carry out the hacking procedure. But in most of the cases, hackers won\u2019t have any access to the SS7 query details, making this vulnerability less exploitable.After hackers demonstrated the SS7 vulnerability to the senator, he became heated and ordered a full public enquiry for SS7, and said:\u201cThis is actually quite shocking because it affects everyone.

To exploit the vulnerability, the hacker must have to be on the local area network.Back in 2001, the serious design flaw was discovered in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. To fix this, a security patch was released by Microsoft that didn\u2019t properly fixed the flaw but at least restricted the attacks to the local network level.But last week, two of the researchers Hormazd Billiamoria and Jonathan Brossard demonstrated in their Black Hat USA 2015 sessions that how attacker could still remotely exploit the same SMB vulnerability using the Internet, seizing the control and stealing the user credentials of the targeted computer system.SMB is actually a Windows-based file-sharing protocol and the found vulnerability has affected all built-in Internet Explorer web browser that comes pre-installed in every version of Windows including the latest OS release, Windows 10. And this vulnerability has affected Windows Edge and becomes the first exploit for the newly released operating system that can be exploited remotely.Exploiting the SMB protocol depends solely on the design flaw left unpatched within the protocol, it is responsible to save Windows user IDs and can forward it for the authentication of login attempt by another user.Unbelievably, this is how network setup is done in business situations, and all the networked computer systems are linked with an automated system that is connected to all hosts and is in authority to perform various management tasks. The same automated system is also responsible for taking care of the antivirus software, updates, logging events, and other automated tasks.So to exploit SMB protocol vulnerability, attacker waits for these automated computer systems to power on and begin to connecting with all the available hosts within the network. This is the point at which the server starts grabbing the login credentials of the users, and the moment users begin to login to their accounts, the attacker loads a code in Internet Explorer, exploiting the SMB protocol vulnerability.Security researchers Billiamoria and Brossard showed in the Black Hat session that how they were able to modify the traditional attack to exploit SMB protocol vulnerability, allowing them to capture the login credential of the user.The user ID is recorded in a plain text format and the user password is recorded in a hashed format, and it takes few days of work to crack the password because Microsoft is still using out-of-date NTLM algorithm to hash passwords, researchers said.The vulnerability can be remotely exploited because Internet Explorer is pre-configured to allow automatic login into the Intranet zone, making the complete attacking task automated and happens without buzzing a single alarm on the network.These attacks depend solely on the victim who is accessing the automated computer system\u2019s response session. The attack can be initiated through email phishing, via remote desktop sessions or by force opening a malicious website. Once exploited, that session is then taken over by the attacker and once the response it correctly encrypted then the access will be granted.The SMB protocol vulnerability cannot be exploited if the packet signing is enabled on the host computer, the researcher said. He also added that if the targeted computer system has no firewall enabled on the system to disallow outbound SMB traffic and access to the Internet Explorer then this makes the victim more vulnerable to these attacks.14 years old security flaw still partially fixedThey also noted that users using Google Chrome web browsers would remain on the safe side because the browser is configured to ask for permission before granting access to SMB server, but still there are some Chrome plugins that grant connection to SMB protocol, leaving this browser vulnerable to attacks too.The users and network managers should make sure that the firewall is properly integrated into the Windows, ensuring that the user\u2019s credentials remain safe. You can protect yourself by blocking SMB port numbers 137, 138, 139 and 445 on the firewall to deny any outbound traffic to the Internet. But local connections should be allowed otherwise it would break local file sharing.Apart from that, some host-level protection layers should be installed to further protect the identities of users.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.comviaSoftpediasourceBlackHat", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "August 12, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Salt Agency"], "title": "Facebook API Security Flaw Left 1.44 Billion Users\u2019 Identities at Risk", "body": "A security flaw in the Facebook API allows hackers to decrypt and scan IDs, which left 1.44 billion Facebook users identities at risk of being stolen, web security expert has claimed.Hackers can use a security exploit in Facebook to \u201cdecrypt and sniff out\u201d IDs of Facebook users by using one of the vulnerable Facebook API.

The system has received a series of unexplainable attacks right from the beginning of 2015.According to their research, hackers fell prey to their experiment and soon underground groups and text snippets on Pastebin started popping up as hackers started providing information to one another.GasPots are the fake gas tanks created by TrendLabs team. The name has been inspired from HoneyPots. These acted as the servers configured for mimicking as a genuine gas tank. These also contained a Python script that recorded all of its activities.GasPots were designed particularly for transmitting fake gas tank data as well as observing for any kind of commands from someone trying to feed the system via Internet-accessible terminal.Several countries including Russia, USA, Germany, United Arab Emirates and Great Britain have deployed GasPots already.After analyzing the collected data in the logs, the team concluded that the most predominant activity was related to the standard GET commands, which were used to inquire about the gas tanks typically used by automatic scanners.Some of the commands were entered in the gas tank honeypots such as ones inquiring about tank\u2019s details and those that attempted to change its name.The names of some gas tanks were eventually changed, but the most surprising discovery was that at one point, a 2Gbps DDoS attack was also recorded at GasPots located in Washington. The source, reveals preliminary evidence, was the Syrian Electronic Army/SEA.Research team also claimed that they \u201chave not seen the SEA use this technique in previous attacks, [and this] could have been performed by another group or person who wants to put the blame on the SEA.\u201dAccording to the logs, a majority of the attacks originated from countries like Iran, China, Russia, Syria, USA, Canada, Romania and Mexico but most of them utilized secured VPN links and thus, their actual location remained dubious.Around 44% of the recorded attacks were directed towards gas tanks in the US, 17% to Jordan and 11% was recorded in Great Britain, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.com", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Black Hat", "DefCon", "hacking", "internet", "security", "Vulnerability"], "title": "7 Unexpected Hacks of 2015, Thanks To DefCon and Black Hat", "body": "This year, at DefCon 23 and Black Hat USA 2015 security conferences, hackers are going to discuss how vulnerable and severely flawed our day-to-day things really are.Here at HackRead.com, we have brought you 7 much awaited hacking discussions that are related to the technologies towards which most of the individuals are looking forward to including vehicle, smartphones, weapons, computers, and skateboards.So let\u2019s look at what are those concerns and vulnerabilities that hackers have found after the implementation of Internet and modern technologies into these gadgets and hardware.In this Black Hat USA 2015 session, two security researchers namely Charles Miller and Chris Valasek will give a presentation about their discoveries related to the security vulnerability they found in the onboard infotainment system of all the vehicles manufactured by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, leaving more than 470,000 vehicles vulnerable to these similar hacking attempts.Using this vulnerability, both of these hackers managed to remotely take control over the vehicle, which allowed them to manipulate the vehicle\u2019s brakes, acceleration, entertainment system and what not.Head over to this link to know more about how hackers remotely took control of a Jeep while it was on the highway.Did you ever think that your smartphone running Android mobile operating system could be hacked with just a single text message?Well, that is possible now as a Zimperium\u2019s Mobile Security Expert Joshua Drake found a security bug within the Android Media Playback Tool codes. This bug allowed him to remotely execute malicious code in the targeted Android smartphone just by sending a simple text message embedded with a malicious code.This security bug codenamed Stagefright, is believed to be one of the most devastating hacks in the history of mobile software, which left whopping 950 million Android-based smartphones vulnerable to the security threat.Head over to this link to know how Drake managed to find Android Stagefright exploit.You don\u2019t believe that heading, right? At first, we neither. Until this married couple Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger, surprisingly both are researchers too, managed to hack two self-aiming sniper rifles, gaining access over the self-aiming functionality. It took them almost a year to discover and exploit the vulnerability in the rifle.Actually, these self-aiming rifles are powered by a Linux-based system, allowing any novice shooter to make perfect shots, even if the target is 1000 yards away. You must be wondering that what makes this rifle vulnerable to remote hacking, right? The rifle manufacturer implemented a Wi-Fi accessibility within the gun, making it vulnerable to hacking.So security researchers found a vulnerability in the software of Wi-Fi functionality that allowed them to remotely alter the shooting calculations made by rifle, making it miss the target.Head over to this link to learn more about what else these researchers did after remotely hacking the Linux-powered sniper rifle.Do you own any GM vehicle that is equipped with the OnStar system? Beware because a security researcher Samy Kamkar has found a vulnerability within the OnStar\u2019s mobile app named RemoteLink, which allowed him to remotely locate, unlock, start, honk the horn, and turn on the headlights of a vehicle. He can perform all those tasks that your RemoteLink app is capable of, remotely!Kamkar also developed a $100 gadget that allowed him to remotely connect to any OnStar equipped GM vehicle. He codenamed it OwnStar.Head over to this link to see him controlling a Chevy Volt after hacking OnStar\u2019s RemoteLink app.Do you know your MAC computer can be permanently hacked? Recently, a team of researchers found a number of vulnerabilities within the core firmware of the MACs. And using this vulnerability they made a worm that can permanently infect any MAC based computer system.This exploit is so risky that once your MAC is infected then the only possibility to fix it is by re-flashing the infected chip.Security researchers Trammell Hudson and Xeno Kovah codenamed this firmware vulnerability as \u2018Thunderstrike 2\u2019. They have planned to demonstrate this exploit at Black Hat USA 2015.To know more about what Thunderstrike 2 is capable of and how it can permanently hack MAC computer then head over to this link.Two security researchers Rico Healey and Mike Ryan accidentally found a vulnerability in the on-board system of the Bluetooth controlled electronic skateboards, which allowed them to remotely hack the skateboard, taking complete control over it.The researchers have planned to demonstrate the several security vulnerabilities at DefCon 23 security conference.

He codenamed this innovative hack as \u2018Funtenna\u2019.must read8 Technologies That Can Hack Into Your Offline Computer and PhoneThis inventive hack can transform any device or hardware, let\u2019s say printer or scanner, connected to the Internet \u2013 part of the Internet of Things (IoT) \u2013 into a radio frequency transmitter capable of transmitting data out of a computer network, by using unnoticeable sound waves, over to an AM radio receiver located short distance away.Ang Cui, a PhD student of Intrusion Detection Systems Laboratory at Columbia University, describes this hack as:\u201cSoftware payload that intentionally causes its host hardware to act as an improvised RF transmitter using existing hardware, which are typically not designed for electromagnetic emanation.\u201dFundamentally, Funtenna works by transforming an infected device or hardware into a transmitter. Then those transmitted RF signals are received by a software controlled radio receiver.Comprehensively, Funtenna is a method that allows a spy to infect a device or hardware by infecting it with a malware. Those devices could be anything, from a printer to an office phone. Once infected, the internal components and wires of the device can be transformed into a transmitter to transmit radiofrequency.Then the hacker can force the infected device to produce radio frequencies that can be used to transmit or leak data from the computer or hardware. These produced RF signals can then be received by an AM radio antenna that is further connected to a software controlled radio receiver.The software controlled radio receiver can be any device specifically programmed to send and receive various radio frequencies while being completely dependent upon the software instead of hardware.For demo purpose, Cui infected a wireless printer with the malicious code to make it act as a transmitter. But this same technique could be used with other devices including laptop or computer system. Now the researcher can force the hacked device to produce ultrasounds and radio signals that can be modified to silently transmit data out of the printer to the nearby receiver located outside the office block.Cui, while explaining his hacking method, said:\u201c[It is a] much more attractive way to go about [transmitting the data] because instead of having a physical implant and the need to illuminate the thing with a radar gun with direct line of sight, you can send software into machine, transmit data out, and if you want to erase your presence you just delete the software.\u201dTo get into the local network of any data centre or office, Funtenna can be used to infect network-connected printer located inside the office building, which then further be used to communicate with other devices like computer or laptop to capture and leak valuable data. Then that data would be transferred back to the infected printer and transmitted to the radio receiver via radio frequency.Similarly, spies or hackers can eavesdrop onto the office communication system by compromising the office phone and collecting the microphone data.The Black Hat page of this researcher describes this hack as:\u201cFuntenna is an advancement of current state-of-the-art covert wireless exfiltration technologies. Specifically, Funtenna offers comparable exfiltration capabilities to RF-based retro-reflectors, but can be realized without the need for physical implantation and illumination.\u201dIf you have any knowledge about the sending and receiving of radio-frequency signals then do watch the demo video to learn about the working of Funtenna.Ang Cui has planned to present and brief about his invention of Funtenna at the Black Hat Hacking Conference that is scheduled for Friday, August 7th in Las Vegas.Report corrections to admin@hackread.comviaVicesourceBlackHat", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "August 7, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Wired"], "title": "Electronic Skateboards Are Easy To Hack", "body": "As we are approaching the much-awaited hacking conferences DefCon and Black Hat, security researchers and engineers are revealing their studies and exploits to spread awareness about the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of all those things that have either a wireless connection or the Internet connectivity.This time, two security researchers, Richo Healey and Mike Ryan, got hold of few Bluetooth controlled electronic skateboards in an attempt to search for possible vulnerabilities in the onboard system.must readComputer Controlled Sniper Rifle Cab Be HackedAn itch to find a vulnerability in the electric skateboards arises when one of the researchers was riding his skateboard toward an intersection and the skateboard stopped abruptly, tossing him onto the street. Because he is a security engineer, he believed it happened due to the possible interference with his skateboard from other Bluetooth enabled devices at the intersection.Rico Healey is a Security Engineer at the payment solution firm Stripe, and Mike Ryan is a member of Red Team at eBay. Both of these researches acquired three Bluetooth enabled electric skateboards to begin their research and hacking experiment.While explaining the core reason behind their research, Rico Healey said:\u201cIt\u2019s easy to point to this and say, oh it\u2019s just a skateboard, but for people who are buying these boards and commuting on them every day \u2026 there is risk obviously associated with that\u2026. We explicitly did this research in order to make the devices safer.\u201dThey spent quite a time on research that resulted in the discovery of an exploit which provided them a complete control over the skateboard\u2019s digital onboard system, they codenamed this exploit as \u201cFacePlant.\u201dThe three skateboards used by researchers includes E-Go electric skateboard manufactured by the China-based company Yuneec; Boosted Dual Plus skateboard manufactured by the US-based company Boosted and 1300S Sports skateboard manufactured by the Australian-based establishment Revo.The vulnerability lies within the unencrypted communication link between the skateboard and the remote control. The research found out that there is at least one serious vulnerability in each of the skateboard\u2019s system, but the method of attack differs between each skateboard.At this time, researchers have successfully managed to prepare a working hack for the Booster Dual Plus skateboard. While the second hack that is targeted towards E-Go skateboards is under development and is codenamed \u201cRoad Rash.\u201dThe skateboards manufactured by Boosted uses an onboard app that controls two 1 kilo-watt electronic motors which can be controlled using a Bluetooth-enabled handheld remote. The motors continue to operate when a button is pressed and stops when a button is released.Since the Bluetooth communication link is unencrypted, any hacker sitting proximate the skateboard can easily hack into the skateboard system, forcing the system to connect to his laptop.For the hacker\u2019s Bluetooth connection to establish connectivity with the skateboard, it takes mere two to ten seconds. When the connection is formed, the hacker would have only 10 milliseconds to take control of the skateboard and send a malware, because after that, the remote control and skateboard automatically re-establishes the connection.\u201cThe remote becomes essentially a useless brick that can\u2019t re-engage with the board until the attacker disconnects.\u201d To make this process faster and reliable, researchers suggested that hacker could make use of a script that automates the exploiting process.But once the Bluetooth connection is established, the hacker would be able to stop the skateboard and can even send a malicious exploit, causing the motors to switch its revolving direction, or disengage the braking system.Here\u2019s how Kim Zetter of Wired explains the condition faced by rider once the skateboard is hacked:A rider who is paying attention would notice the board slowing slightly as it goes into neutral\u2014the wheels spinning in place briefly\u2014before the reverse command kicks in and pitches the driver forward while the board takes off in the opposite direction. But most riders will be caught off guard. \u201cUsually you don\u2019t face plant, because the board slows down enough. But if you\u2019re not expecting it, and you\u2019re going fast enough, it could go pretty bad,\u201d says Ryan.Both researchers have planned to demonstrate several security vulnerabilities that helped them in Hacking Electric Skateboards: Vehicle Research for Mortals, the event is scheduled for Saturday at the Def Con hacker conference in Las Vegas.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.comviaWiredsourceDefcon", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Africa", "breach", "Dubai", "dubizzle", "Hacks", "security", "UAE"], "title": "Middle East\u2019s Largest Classified Website Dubizzle Suffers Security Breach", "body": "Dubizzle, the popular Middle Eastern online classifieds for bargain hunters, sellers and job seekers has had  its UAE servers compromised \u2013 albeit on a small scale.

This kit has been dominating the malware attacks being carried out since past ten months and the kit has seen a significant increase in the growth of its market share. The said kit is capable of handling various malware activities including ransomware, backdoor Trojans, rootkits and many others.Just like most of the malware attacks, exploit kits are used by hackers in this attack in an attempt to redirect the targeted user to a website infected with malware.

It is also believed that Apple computers are difficult to hack because they have a higher level of protection as compared to the Windows operating systems.But a recent study performed by a team of researchers proved it all wrong. They found a number of vulnerabilities using which they have created a worm that can infect Mac systems permanently. Furthermore, they also designed a worm that can multiply itself from one Mac to another without any networking.Before their official presentation at Black Hat event, researchers demonstrated the working of a worm developed by them to show that both, Windows and Mac computers have identical vulnerabilities, which are easy to exploit if the hacker determines it.The firmware worm has been created by two security researchers Trammell Hudson, a Security Engineer at Two Sigma Investments and the person who first discovered the Thunderstrike vulnerability, and Xeno Kovah, owner of Firmware Security Consultancy firm LegbaCore.For those of you who are not aware of \u201cThunderstrike,\u201d it was discovered earlier this year with only a conceptual attacking that requires the attacker to have physical access to the target computer. On the other hand, Thunderstrike 2 is an actual worm that can target Mac based computers using the same vulnerabilities exploited by Thunderstrike 1, but can be deployed remotely.Thunderstrike 2 has the capability to infect Mac computers at the firmware level, making it next to impossible to remove, leaving the user with the only possibility i.e. re-flash the infected chip.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to detect, it\u2019s really hard to get rid of, and it\u2019s really hard to protect against something that\u2019s running inside the firmware.\u201d \u2013 Trammell HudsonXeno Kovah, one of the researchers who created the firmware worm said,\u201c[The worm is] really hard to detect, it\u2019s really hard to get rid of, and it\u2019s really hard to protect against something that\u2019s running inside the firmware. For most users that\u2019s really a throw-your-machine-away kind of situation. Most people and organizations don\u2019t have the wherewithal to physically open up their machine and electrically reprogram the chip.\u201dThe vulnerability is found in the core firmware of the computer system that is usually referred to as UEFI, EFI or BIOS. Firmware is the software that boot up a computer and operating system. It is easy to infect because most of the hardware manufacturers do not encrypt or officially sign the firmware. Furthermore, manufacturers do not include any security layer to authenticate if the firmware installed is genuine or not.According to the researchers, firmware is the best place to hide malware because it operates at a higher level where no security product can detect it, resulting in a malware to remain undetectable.Even if the user decides to completely wipe off the operating system and then reinstall it would have zero effect on the infected firmware because it remains untouched while maintaining a tireless hold onto the system.Both of these researchers, in an attempt to find vulnerabilities, inspected a chain of firmware developed by various computer manufacturers including Samsung, Dell and HP. Even though all the hardware manufacturers have implemented a protection to certain degree, making it difficult to modify the firmware, but researchers were able to find vulnerabilities that allowed them to bypass the protection and flash the BIOS with malicious firmware.MAC is secure, they saidTo further empower their research and to inspect if Apple really provides a higher level of protection against this malware, researchers searched for the same vulnerabilities in the Apple computer\u2019s firmware and they found the same vulnerabilities in Mac based computers\u2019 firmware too.Every hardware manufacturer uses the same firmware code that is why the found vulnerabilities are applicable to many Macs and Windows based computers.Xeno Kovah said,\u201cIt turns out almost all of the attacks we found on PCs are also applicable to Macs. Most of these firmwares are built from the same reference implementations, so when someone finds a bug in one that affects Lenovo laptops, there\u2019s a really good chance it\u2019s going to affect the Dells and HPs. What we also found is that there is really a high likelihood that the vulnerability will also affect Macbooks. Because Apple is using a similar EFI firmware.\u201dResearchers have planned to talk about their research while further demonstrating the vulnerabilities found in the Macs firmware that are also affecting Windows-based systems. Furthermore, they will highlight the consequences of the exploits and what the vulnerability is capable of.Both researchers, Xeno Kovah and Tramell Hudson, will discuss Thunderstrike 2: Sith Strike at the Black Hat Security Conference that is scheduled for August 6th in Las Vegas.

It is specifically aimed towards helping other users around the world so that they can receive all Windows 10 updates as swiftly as possible. But this has become troublesome for most of the users.Microsoft has pre-enabled WUDO feature on both versions of Windows 10 i.e. Home and Pro. While on Windows 10 Education and Enterprise, this feature is enabled for local networks only.For those of you who don\u2019t know, the basic working of this feature is identical to Torrent. Your computer will be unknowingly used as a part of a peer-to-peer network to further distribute update files to other users around the world, hence consuming your upload bandwidth. It does seem like a good feature but for those users who are on limited or capped Internet connection, this would be their worst nightmare!Luckily, Microsoft have provided a way so that concerned users can opt out of this feature. But they should never have pre-enabled it, at least without seeking permission from a user! Furthermore, to our surprise, the opt-out menu is buried deep inside the settings menu.Follow the below mentioned step-by-step guide to disable Windows Update Delivery Optimization (WUDO) feature:Step # 1: Open \u2018Settings\u2019 menu by pressing shortcut keys \u2018Ctrl\u2019 + \u2018L\u2019.Step # 2: Go to the \u2018Windows Update settings\u2019 section.Step # 3: Click on \u2018Advanced options\u2019 button.Step # 4: In the Advanced options menu, select the option \u2018Choose how updates are delivered\u2019.Step # 5: There you will find an on/off toggle, turn it to \u2018off\u2019 to disable WUDO on your computer.Congratulation! Now you can save your valuable Internet connection.Conversely, Microsoft has clarified that the WUDO feature only uses a \u201climited portion\u201d of idle upload bandwidth and that it does not affect the Internet connection speeds.

This newly discovered vulnerability can make the phone crash constantly and stop responding to user commands.The difference between this new vulnerability and the Stagefright bug is that the latter\u2019s scope is quite wide as it affects nearly 95% of all Android devices having version 2.2 to 5.1. Contrary to this, the new bug affects only those phones that run on Android version 4.3 and above.

By loading and accessing a URL that hosts a malformed media file.Trend Micro team of researchers demonstrated one of these methods by using a malformed MKV file that the Android media service tried to index automatically.The root of the issue resides in the way this service reads data from Matroska media centre that the .mkv extension uses.According to the team at Trend Micro, \u201cThe vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when the media server service parses an MKV file.

The malware and Trojans being provided by the hackers will allow anyone to take control of the targeted electronic device, eventually attacking the victim. The report calls them \u201cratters.\u201dThe report also reveals that hackers are uploading malware programs and applications on the websites that receives a lot of teenage users. Young Internet users are the easiest target of the hackers because their risk threshold is on the higher side and they are more prone to click on unacquainted websites and weblinks.This is the reason why researchers have seen sudden increase in the webcam videos of people who clicked unconsciously on a malware link and eventually opening their computer to the vulnerabilities and anonymous criminals who are determined to blackmail, mock and/or spy onto the victim\u2019s personal life and data stored on their computer.Remote Access Trojans are specifically targeted towards the most vulnerable audience i.e. young people, who usually feel embarrassed or frightened to share about the threats with their parents.Surprisingly, there is not much being done to combat these disturbing privacy invasions. But the organization believes that the individuals and corporations can take certain steps to fix this ever increasing problem.must readCanadian Woman Hacker Arrested for spying on people through webcamsThe report reveals some unbelievable facts about the malware. We have included it here:Remote Access Trojan, widely known as RAT, is one of the six kinds of Trojan. It is the most popular and the simplest computer hacking tool available.RATs are basically a malicious code that can be concealed within the photographs, documents, videos, and music too, as these are the easiest and simplest ways to trick the targeted audience into downloading the malware onto the computer.The malicious software or application, in front of your screen, is just a simple code. But once it gets an access into your computer, that simple piece of code will allow the hacker to perform all those tasks on your computer which you can perform, and that too without your consent.All your content and data including your documents, pictures, videos and any other personal information will be at the hacker\u2019s fingertips.Additionally, the hacker can use your computer system to victimize you, either by turning on the webcam to spy on you or by sending malicious emails to your contacts, and what\u2019s more risky is that the hacker can even launch a massive RAT attack using your computer to harm others.\u201cThat computer is a window into your digital world. But what you may not realize is that computer is a window into your private life. The camera on your computer, when hacked, can become a tool to spy on you in your own home. And it\u2019s easy.\u201dAdam Benson, Deputy Executive Director of the Digital Citizens Alliance said,\u201cRatters are disturbingly comfortable with spreading misery and fear. It\u2019s like a game for them. We saw them chat about it on Hack Forums and then share videos showing off how they scare young people, spy on people in private moments and steal pictures from victims\u2019 accounts.\u201dThe Digital Citizen Alliance worked with California-based teen named Cassidy Wolf, a former Miss Teen USA and the victim of a ratter\u2019s sextortion attempt, said that these cyber attackers and hackers should be treated just as harshly as those committing violent sex crimes in the offline world.The security researchers worked with her because it is the best-known and one of the most high-profile story happened in 2013 about how RAT attacks can literally put one\u2019s hopes and dreams at risk.Her computer was compromised, the webcam was hacked, and all the data, personal social media accounts as well as some other information was also compromised. And she didn\u2019t even knew that her every action was being monitored and observed for several months!One night, Miss Wolf received an anonymous email telling her \u201cto do what I say or else I will post\u201d the lots of pictures and videos.According to the report:The hacker would go onto threaten Cassidy, saying he wanted her to make a sexually explicit video. If she didn\u2019t comply, he said he would transform her \u201cdream of being a model . . . into [Cassidy being] a pornstar.\u201dWolf said:\u201cA crime is a crime, whether it happens in the digital space or the physical world. These ratters don\u2019t see the pain they cause. I went through three months of extortion and threats. There were times I thought it might go on for the rest of my life. The victims we see on ratter\u2019s videos are real people. We need to inform people of this danger and get support from tech companies that can help stop the spread of RATs. RAT victims shouldn\u2019t be reduced to click-bait.\u201dHemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor against online crimes at the US DOJ and a Chief Executive Officer of the cyber security company SSP Blue, said about these RAT attacks:\u201cWe used to worry about protecting women and teen girls from the dangers of sexual predators in the physical world. Now we also need to protect them from digital rapists. Online rapists inflict pain and suffering repeatedly on innocent victims. We\u2019ve got to prosecute these criminals and do everything we can to take away their platforms.\u201dIt has become really easy for anyone to find thousands and thousands of RAT related videos which include tutorials about the usage of RAT and how hackers can use various tools to infect the targeted computer with RAT malware.On the YouTube, you will be able to find:To defend these acts and to help people in requesting the removal of non-consensual videos from the YouTube platform, an online mechanism by Google. The user can use the reporting form to flag and remove the content of the slaved computer systems. But originally this reporting system was launched to address revenge porn videos being uploaded on YouTube.But in order to report these privacy invasions, the victimized people must need to know about it first. Despite of the fact that there are thousands of videos on YouTube \u2013 most of which can easily be found by searching for a simple term \u201crat victims\u201d, but the victims are not even aware that their computers are slaved and their secret videos are being released publicly.RAT is dangerous, be it in a prison or in your computerOne of the YouTube spokespeople told in an email statement that every minute there are about 400 hours of videos are uploaded which makes it next to impossible to watch and verify the content. But he also said, \u201c[the website] has clear policies that outline what content is acceptable to post, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users.\u201dHe also added any user is free to flag a video for a review by the team, and if the matter is serious then YouTube policies allow them to remove those videos.As a precautionary measure, Mr. Benson recommends every computer user to \u201ctape\u201d their webcam. At least that is exactly what he does when he is not using the webcam. \u201cI have tape on both my work computer and home computer,\u201d he said. He also advised that people should keep their computer\u2019s antivirus software and operating system up to date, and refrain from clicking on the web links leading to ambiguous destinations.RATs are so powerful malware tool that it can affect the victim in less visual but equally disturbing ways because it grants hackers a complete access to the computer, and the computer cannot be safeguarded just by the installing antimalware and antivirus applications.Even the professionals who are aware of the malware and the risks involved, cannot completely protect themselves from such harmful malware.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.comsourceGractions", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "August 1, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Black Hat", "Cars", "GM", "hacking", "security", "Vehicles", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Hacker Shows How to Locate, Unlock, Start GM Cars with a Hacked Mobile App", "body": "As the dates for the Black Hat and Def Con Hacking Conference are approaching closer and closer, we are hearing more and more about the vulnerabilities and security flaws in the things we are highly dependent in our day-to-day life.Last week we reported about how two hackers while sitting on their comfy sofas, managed to hack the on-board entertainment system of Jeep Cherokee, remotely controlling the vehicle and disable its brakes too.must readHacker in US hacks consumer drones for personal use [Video added]Now today we have brought you another vehicle-related security flaw. And this time, on the hacker\u2019s target list is the GM vehicles!A privacy and security researcher and a computer hacker who goes by the name Samy Kamkar has built a gadget for about $100 that according to the hacker himself, enabled him to hack into any GM vehicle equipped with the OnStar system. He gave his gadget a name too, he called it OwnStar.This small and high-tech gadget let the hacker to remotely locate, unlock and start the vehicle, basically allowing him to perform all those tasks that exactly what the OnStar system does!This small but highly vulnerable $100 security hack is coming from the same guy who previously used a toy to hack and open garage doors within a matter of seconds.This section will be helpful for those of you who don\u2019t know about OnStar and RemoteLink.GM offers their customers with a couple of high-tech features so that the customers can keep track of their vehicle\u2019s status, remotely. And even perform some basic operations without physically touching their vehicle.OnStar is a subscription based in-car service provided by GM to enhance the security of the vehicle, provide the customer with hands-free calling option, perform remote diagnostics of the vehicle and even offer turn-by-turn navigation system.And on the other hand, RemoteLink which is a part of OnStar, is actually a mobile app that connects the vehicle\u2019s OnStar system with the smartphone which results in an amplified range to perform all those tasks wirelessly. But the app offers some other functions too like remote unlocking and remotely starting the vehicle. Apart from that, the user can even sound the horn and turn on/off the headlights.The working of OwnStar is really simple. The gadget acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot which interrupts all the commands sent by the driver\u2019s OnStar RemoteLink mobile application, once these commands are intercepted, an unauthorized user will be allowed to remotely locate, unlock and even start the vehicle.But, in order to make this hack practical, a hacker must have to place the OwnStar gadget somewhere inside the OnStar equipped vehicle and then wait for the vehicle user to open the OnStar app. Since Kamkar\u2019s gadget intercepts the Wi-Fi commands which is why its proximity matters.Once the vehicle user operates the OnStar app, his smartphone will automatically get linked with the hotspot network provided by OwnStar, ultimately allowing the hacker to gain access to all the vehicle owner\u2019s information including personal details as well as the basic controls of the vehicle.GM was real quick in responding to the vulnerability. Unlike others, he responded within a few hours after the news was published. He said that the company was aware of the vulnerability and the patch has already been released which was meant to secure the back-end of the RemoteLink app. This way the vehicle owners won\u2019t have to update their smartphones.\u201cWe did consider the option of an app update, but focused primarily on a path that would allow us to make changes on the back-end that would allow the fix to be immediate, without the need for customer action.\u201dBut to our surprise, Kamkar responded that the RemoteLink patch released by GM has still not resolved the bug and the service is still vulnerable. He also added that he is currently working with the GM team to fix this security bug.OwnStar update: GM told WIRED that OnStar bug was fixed, however it's not actually resolved yet. I spoke with GM & they're working on it now\u2014 Samy Kamkar (@samykamkar) July 30, 2015Later, GM said that an update to their RemoteLink app will be required which will eventually fix the vulnerability. According to the statement:\u201cGM takes matters that affect our customers\u2019 safety and security very seriously. GM product cybersecurity representatives have reviewed the potential vulnerability recently identified. In working with the researcher, we moved quickly to secure our back-office system and reduce risk. However, further action is necessary on the RemoteLink app itself. We take all cyber matters seriously and an enhanced RemoteLink app will also be made available in app stores soon to fully mitigate the risk.\u201dOnStar also responded via Twitter that an enhanced version of RemoteLink app will be released \u201csoon\u201d.@CNET We take all cyber matters very seriously. An enhanced RemoteLink app will be made available soon to fully mitigate the risk.\u2014 OnStar  (@OnStar) July 30, 2015Kamkar told TechInsider that the car manufacturers are new into the field of Internet and they are not investing much into the security sector which is the reason why they are facing such issues.\u201cBefore the attack surface was much smaller. The only people who could communicate with your car typically had to have physical access, like someone who was inside your car. This is new territory for car manufacturers, I believe. So I think that is why they are not investing as much as they should in security.\u201dSince GM and the security researcher is working as a team to release a fix for this second major vehicle based hack, those consumers who are really concerned about their vehicle\u2019s safety can always disable the features provided by OnStar until patches are released by the company.Apart from that, sadly, there is nothing much you can do about it.Kamkar also published a video which demonstrates the working of OwnStar, but he has planned to reveal more about his findings in the upcoming DefCon Conference scheduled next week.Stay tuned for more on these vulnerabilities!Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.com", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "July 31, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Wired"], "title": "Computer Controlled Sniper Rifle Hacked, 1000 Rifles Left Vulnerable", "body": "Recently we reported that some security researchers managed to hack into the Jeep\u2019s onboard entertainment system to remotely take over the vehicle\u2019s control, eventually crashed it.Now researchers have managed to hack and gain access to the self-aiming sniper rifle\u2019s computer system.must readAnother target for Hackers: A small device that can hack a car! (Video Added)We know that sniper rifle itself is non-vulnerable and can never be hacked but adding a computer and providing it an access to the Internet connection will make nearly anything vulnerable to hacking.The sniper rifle is manufactured by Tracking Point having a model number TP750. It is a 750 series precision-guided sniper firearms powered by Linux-based computers which make use of the advanced technologies to help the shooter to lock onto their target while enabling them to shoot targets that are considered beyond human capability, even if the target is at extreme distances.\u201cA Precision-Guided Firearm incorporates the same tracking and fire-control capabilities found in advanced fighter jets\u201dThe cutting-edge technologies being used by this sniper rifle to ensure precision includes TriggerLink, which connects the tracking optic with a guided trigger; Tag-and-Shoot feature allows you to mark an exact target impact point; and then comes the tracking system that guides the trigger.With this self-aiming sniper rifle, shooting your target with precision has become so easy that any average shooter can go out and make 1000 yards shots.Using this high-tech firearm, all the shooter have to do is press the tag button to mark the target, align the scope to the mark and then hold the trigger, leaving the rest onto the built-in computer based automated precision-guided \u2018fire control\u2019 system of the sniper rifle.The scope allows the shooter to key in the variables like temperature, wind as well as the weight of the ammunition being used.The fire control system used in this rifle is basically a computer that guides the release of the shot by virtually eliminating all the human errors that are caused by mistiming, misaiming and most importantly the jitter generated by the central nervous system.Now that fire control system, connected to the Internet, built into the sniper rifle calls for the vulnerability. And according to my speculations, the vulnerability lies within the software that controls the weapon\u2019s TriggerLink system.As discussed above, this firearm uses the TriggerLink technology along with the guided trigger which ensures that the round is released at the accurate moment. So even if the trigger is pressed, the round will not be released until the shooter perfectly aligns the barrel with the tagged point.According to the security researchers, Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger, they have managed to hack a couple of TrackingPoint self-aiming sniper rifles.If what Andy Greenberg of WIRED said turned out to be true, the vulnerabilities found out by the security researchers will allow the hacker to alter the calculations made by scope, making the rifle mysteriously miss the target. The hacker can also permanently disable the rifle\u2019s computer system and even inhibit the weapon from firing any shot at all.The researchers, Sandvik and Auger also found out that there is a series of vulnerabilities in the weapon\u2019s software which could be used to take control over its self-aiming functionality.\u201cThe researchers were able to dial in their changes to the scope\u2019s targeting system so precisely that they could cause a bullet to hit a bullseye of the hacker\u2019s choosing rather than the one chosen by the shooter.\u201d The very first vulnerability is an access to the Wi-Fi connection, a rifle\u2019s feature allowing the shooter to stream a live video directly from the scope to a computer or tablet located within its range. If the Wi-Fi is enabled then anyone within the range would be allowed to connect. And if any hacker is able to connect to the weapon, he will then be able to change the variables like temperature, wind and weight of the ammunition.While playing with the hacked rifle\u2019s software, both researchers found out that hacker can alter the weight to whatever number they want. For instance, lowering the ammunition weight (even entering negative values) will shoot the ammo to the right side whereas increasing the ammunition weight will force the weapon to shoot the ammo to the left-hand side.The guys over at WIRED got in touch with John McHale, the founder of TrackingPoint, who said that he appreciates the researcher\u2019s efforts and also invites them to work with the company to help them patch the software vulnerabilities and also develop a better software for their future products.He also added that once these vulnerabilities are patched, the company will send the updated version of the software via mail to their customers.\u201cThe shooter\u2019s got to pull the rifle\u2019s trigger, and the shooter is responsible for making sure it\u2019s pointed in a safe direction. It\u2019s my responsibility to make sure my scope is pointed where my gun is pointing,\u201d McHale said while further arguing. \u201cThe fundamentals of shooting don\u2019t change even if the gun is hacked.\u201dSince the TrackingPoint has only sold around a thousand rifles while the hacking attempt can be made if both, the hacker and rifle is in a close range, making it doubtful that anyone will be victimized by this vulnerability attack.Runa Sandvik, one of the security researcher and a former developer of Tor anonymity software said:\u201cThere are so many things with the Internet attached to them: cars, fridges, coffee machines, and now guns. There\u2019s a message here for TrackingPoint and other companies\u2026when you put technology on items that haven\u2019t had it before, you run into security challenges you haven\u2019t thought about before.\u201dLet\u2019s see what these two security researchers have planned to reveal about this Tracking Point\u2019s sniper rifle at the Black Hat conference which is scheduled for August 12th.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.comsourceWiredFeatured Image viaCnet", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "July 30, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Android", "Google", "security", "SMS", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Android Stagefright Bug Is Critical, Let Hackers Snoop into Your Phone Silently", "body": "Are you an Android phone user? Please pay attention as now it only takes one text message to hack an Android phone. Yes, you read that right!A newly revealed glitch in the Android operating system is believed to be one of the most devastating hacks in the history of mobile software.

And you know what\u2019s worst? It requires zero interaction from the targeted device. All the hacker need to have is just your mobile phone number.For those of you who don\u2019t know, Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems globally and that\u2019s the reason why almost eighty percent of the smartphones are based on it. And this recently discovered bug possibly impacts over 95 percent of the Android-based smartphones, an estimate of 950 million devices, leaving them vulnerable to the security threat.The hacker can take control of an Android phone to steal data and spy on a user and all it takes it for the hacker is to send you one text message with a video attachment embedded with a malicious code. You don\u2019t even need to open a text message or play the video to be infected.This vulnerability is being referred to as Stagefright which is named after the Android software that reads media files.Actually the problem lies in how Android reads the video embedded in a text message. There is some messaging app on Android, like Google Hangouts, which may read the video files even before you open it and thereby affect you before you even receive a notification for a new text message.Joshua Drake, a security researcher at Zimperium, said:\u201cThis happens even before the sound that you\u2019ve received a message has even occurred [\u2026] that\u2019s what makes it so dangerous. [It] could be absolutely silent. You may not even see anything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of testing on an Ice Cream Sandwich Galaxy Nexus\u2026 where the default MMS is the messaging app, Messenger. That one does not trigger automatically but if you look at the MMS, it triggers, you don\u2019t have to try to play the media or anything, you just have to look at it.\u201dOnce a text message has been successfully received, the hacker can copy and/or delete data from the phone, and can even gain access to your phone\u2019s microphone and camera to spy on you. In a nutshell, once your device is infected, the hacker will get a complete control over your device with an access to everything.\u201cIt\u2019s really up to their imagination what they do once they get in,\u201d \u2013 Joshua DrakeThe researcher said that, in total, there are seven serious vulnerabilities. But he has also confirmed that these vulnerabilities have not been exploited yet.There were about 7 known vulnerabilities within the Android software\u2019s piece of code known as Stagefright. And upon reporting, each one of them was recognized by Google and they assigned it with the following CVEs, which is a unique number used by Google to record and identify vulnerabilities:Considering the severity of the issue, the security team over at Google responded positively and promptly and the patches were released within a couple of days, but, unfortunately, the manufacturers are slow in releasing patches to their devices.\u201cZimperium not only reported the vulnerability to the Google teams, but also submitted patches. Considering severity of the problem, Google acted promptly and applied the patches to internal code branches within 48 hours, but unfortunately that\u2019s only the beginning of what will be a very lengthy process of update deployment.\u201dAnd now, since these CVEs and details about the vulnerability has been made public, the security researchers, as well as the malicious hackers, will be having enough information to exploit the vulnerabilities.Joshua Drake, a researcher who discovered these critical bugs, said that before making this news publicly available, all of the seven bugs were reported to Google and the fixes were scheduled in no time.The first batch was reported in April of this year. And within a day, he received a confirmation message from Google that the bugs are recognized and would be patched in the future software release.Then Drake reported the second set of vulnerabilities to Google at the beginning of May and like previously, Google responded within a couple of days to confirm that the patches for reported bugs have been scheduled.FORBES got in touch with a spokesperson at Google, who while thanking Drake for his efforts said:\u201cMost Android devices, including all newer devices, have multiple technologies that are designed to make exploitation more difficult. Android devices also include an application sandbox designed to protect user data and other applications on the device.\u201dDrake, the author of Android Hacker\u2019s Handbook, told FORBES that even though all the bugs were reported to Google and the patches were released to the partners but most of the partner manufacturers have not released the fixes for the devices.\u201cAll devices should be assumed to be vulnerable,\u201d \u2013 Joshua DrakeDrake also told that there are numerous mobile phone manufacturers who have a partnership with Google, but no one knows how much time they are going to take to release updates. According to his estimates, out of 95 percent (950 million devices), as few as 20 percent will get fixed and the \u201coptimistically\u201d the percentage could go up to 50 percent.One SMS and your Android device will be hackedBut still, even if 50 percent of the devices receive bug fixes from the manufacturers, there would be about 45 percent i.e. more than 400 million of the devices left vulnerable.The researcher has also found out that only Android phones running version 2.1 and below will remain invulnerable.Drake did get confirmation from a kind manufacturer, Silent Circle, who is a creator of the privacy-focused smartphone called \u201cBlack phone\u201d, released the patched version for their phones \u201cweeks ago\u201d.Thanks @jduck for the kind words & reporting serious Android bugs.

This occurred just as I reached a long overpass, with no shoulder to offer an escape. The experiment had ceased to be fun.\u201d\u201cMiller and Valasek\u2019s full arsenal includes functions that at lower speeds fully kill the engine, abruptly engage the brakes, or disable them altogether. The most disturbing maneuver came when they cut the Jeep\u2019s brakes, leaving me frantically pumping the pedal as the 2-ton SUV slid uncontrollably into a ditch.\u201dAccording to the security researchers, the vulnerability is found in every other vehicle. Because this is the 21st century and every vehicle manufacturer is trying their best to transform a simple vehicle into a smart vehicle by providing it an access to the Internet.The feature is added to the vehicle using a console known as Uconnect. It is basically an Internet-connected computer which is being installed on thousands of newly manufactured vehicles, SUVs and even of trucks.This device controls the entertainment as well as the navigation system of the vehicle, even allows the user to initiate phone calls. Apart from that, it even offers a Wi-Fi hotspot.The security researchers have decided not to disclose a vulnerability found in the Uconnect system until their Black Hat Security Conference talk which is scheduled for August.So what actually happens is the security researchers make use of Sprint\u2019s cellular network to search for devices after which they were able to gain access to the Jeep\u2019s console. Actually the console remains connected to the Sprint\u2019s Internet to provide improved GPS guidance and vehicle\u2019s entertainment system uses.All the hacker actually require is the IP address of the device located inside the vehicle. Once he is able to find that out, he can gain access to the vehicle\u2019s control system from anywhere in the country. Miller says, \u201cFrom an attacker\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a super nice vulnerability.\u201dAccording to the Greenberg:\u201cFrom that entry point, Miller and Valasek\u2019s attack pivots to an adjacent chip in the car\u2019s head unit\u2014the hardware for its entertainment system\u2014silently rewriting the chip\u2019s firmware to plant their code. That rewritten firmware is capable of sending commands through the car\u2019s internal computer network, known as a CAN bus, to its physical components like the engine and wheels.\u201dThe researchers also said that they are still working on the more advanced firmware using which they would be able to steer the targeted vehicle. This vulnerability also allowed the researchers to make it work as a surveillance system. Once enabled, they will be able to measure the speed of targeted vehicle as well as the GPS coordinates.US Senators are lucky enough because the hackers behind this were actually the security researchers. A couple of US Senators, Edward Markey, and Richard Blumenthal, are concerned about the safety of vehicles as well as the drivers so they want increased security and protection for the vehicle\u2019s onboard vehicle. They said that vulnerabilities like these can put the drivers in a life-threatening condition.Senator Markey said in the statement:\u201cDrivers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between being connected and being protected [\u2026] We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers and American families from data trackers. This legislation will set minimum standards and transparency rules to protect the data, security and privacy of drivers in the modern age of increasingly connected vehicles. I look forward to working with Senator Blumenthal to ensure auto safety and security in the 21st century.\u201dBoth Senators passed a law known as \u201cSPY Car Act\u201d which will allow the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to ensure the safety and security of the data of vehicle as well as the driver behind the wheel.The digital copy of the Spy Car Act is available here (PDF version).sourceWired", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "July 22, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Heimdal"], "title": "Windows XP Anti-Malware Support Terminated \u2013 180 Million Users Left Vulnerable", "body": "Millions of Windows XP users are now left vulnerable to malware attacks as Microsoft has decided to terminate support and security updates for Microsoft Security Essentials package for Windows XP.For those of you who don\u2019t know, Microsoft announced more than a year ago, on the 8th of April 2014 that the support for Windows XP\u2019s security update has been officially ended, this means all those users who are running Windows XP on their systems are vulnerable because the potential security weaknesses are not being patched.must readWindows Users Data on Display as Microsoft Drops it\u2019s \u201cDo Not Track\u201d PolicyOn the other hand, Microsoft Security Essentials, a free antivirus solution by Microsoft, continued to receive constant security and antimalware signature updates because of the peer pressure from the corporate companies and users who were still planning to upgrade their systems to an advanced and secure operating system.But then again, on July 14th 2015, the company decided to officially end the support for their antivirus and antimalware software i.e. Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) as well as the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT).

But now it seems like this device is not going to be revealed, and the whole project has been cancelled due to some mysterious conditions.The gadget named ProxyHam was a hardware proxy, based on Raspberry Pi computer, consist of two separate devices with a capability to broadcast data at a frequency of 900MHz.

This is the reason why hacking has now become a norm.The privately funded organizations, as well as the government agencies, are using various cyber spy technologies and tools so that they can discover the maximum eavesdropping possibilities while acquiring all the possible spying intelligence.Getting hold of the hidden secretive data can be a challenging task for spying agencies because computer experts have specifically designed some computers in such a way that they remain offline and get no access to the internet.This technique of protecting sophisticated data is known as air-gapping. In this technique, the computer systems are isolated from the Internet access, and not even connected or linked with other systems on the network.This is an important step taken by the authorities as the digital data stored in these computers are highly secretive and must have to be protected from illicit access. That\u2019s exactly how banking systems, classified military networks, payment networks, and the critical control system for large industries are protected!But the recent exploration performed by the popular security corporation reveals that your computer and mobile phones can still get hacked even if they aren\u2019t connected to the internet. So here are some of the ways through which your computer and mobile phone can be hacked \u2013 even if they are not connected to the online world!Every operation device that requires power once plugged into a power line will release electromagnetic radiation, and that radiation can be used to intercept information by various technologies verified by both the U.S. and the USSR (at the time it existed).These radiations can easily be used to remotely record keystrokes. According to the Kaspersky Lab:\u201cKeystrokes can be remotely tracked with high accuracy at the 67-feet (20-meter) distance by using a homemade device that analyzes the radio spectrum and costs around $5,000. It is interesting to note that the attack is equally effective against common cheap USB keyboards, expensive wireless keyboards with a signal encryption, and built-in notebook keyboards. All of the devices work on the same principle and generate electromagnetic noise. The difference is stipulated by the signal power, which depends upon the length of the data transmission wire.\u201dSince we were discussing electromagnetic radiations and electricity, certain researchers prove that it is possible to gather activity of any electronic gadget based on the amount of power it is drawing.Using an equipment known as Load Monitoring System, one can easily monitor the transformations in current and voltage so that they can understand the power consumption activity. Equipment like this is being used by electricity providers to better understand the load and power consumption of specific areas and to find out what exactly is causing all the changes in energy usage.But what research found out is that Japan is using Non-Intrusive Appliances Load Monitoring System (NIALMS) which is working through a Neutral Network (NN), and this system is specifically designed for residential consumers so that they can find out what device is being used by the consumer.In the same way, some medical researchers have created a computer program to detect network vulnerabilities in their computer networking systems. This monitoring program analyses the power consumption to detect if there\u2019s any malware has been injected into the network.Your smartphone\u2019s accelerometer, a sensor used to track the tilting motion of your smartphone, can be used as a keylogger to record keystrokes of any computer, according to the research performed by Patrick Traynor, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Georgia Tech.\u201cThe researchers developed a method to accurately translate the vibrations from typing on a keyboard picked up by the device\u2019s accelerometer when placed on a desk near a PC [\u2026] The method is 80 percent accurate with a 58,000-word dictionary. Even that accuracy, though, requires thoroughly modern equipment.\u201dComputer hackers can use methods like these to eavesdrop user\u2019s keystrokes, but the actual threat is pretty low because of the poor accuracy level.Hackers can track the movements of millions of travelers traveling on a subway around the world, according to the researchers of Nanjing University. Hackers can break into the smartphone\u2019s built-in motion detection technology i.e. accelerometer and can detect all the bumps and duration of a trip between stations. \u201cThe ability to track subway riders represents a significant cybersecurity threat to the tens of millions of people who use public transportation every day. There are more than 5.5 million daily New York City subway passengers, and over half of those people are carrying smartphones, thus exposing themselves to tracking.\u201dAccording to the researchers, every subway station in the world possesses a unique fingerprint and every time a train runs between two stations, that specific fingerprint can be recorded by the smartphone\u2019s accelerometer, possibly providing hackers with an access to critical information like which subway station any specific person has traveled to.Voltmeters and a ray of the laser can be used to sniff computer keystrokes, according to the researchers Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco who found this exploit and demonstrated this technique at Black Hat security conference held in Las Vegas.\u201cThe only thing you need for successful attacks are either the electrical grid or a distant line of sight, no expensive piece of equipment is required,\u201d \u2013 Barisani and Bianco while describing their hacks.When you are using your computer keyboard, every key input generates a voltage signal, and those signals can be captured by hackers using a voltmeter. Since the computer keyboards have an unshielded wire so those signals leak into the ground wire of the computer\u2019s main power cable. The voltmeter captures the bit streams and voltage fluctuations generated by keyboards and finds out what keys you are hitting.The second hacking method is a laser. The hacker points a ray of the laser at a shiny object located on your computer table or a shiny part of your laptop, then the hacker aligns the receiver to record the vibrations being caused by each keystroke, which is reflected through the light beam.According to the Network World:\u201cThe equipment to carry out the power-line attack could cost as little as $500, and the laser attack gear costs about $100 if the attacker already owns a laptop with a sound card. Carrying out the attacks took about a week.\u201dKeyboard interception, in most of the cases, isn\u2019t very useful because of the obvious reasons. One can never use keyboard keystrokes to gain access to the data stored within the computer system.However, according to the Kaspersky Lab, some external methods can be used to infect the computer with malware that isn\u2019t even connected to the internet. That is exactly how the famous Stuxnet worm infected the targeted computer which was placed within the uranium enriched infrastructure. Once the computer was infected, the malware worked in a similar way just like some internal spy, leaking confidential data through a certain physical medium.On the other hand, Israeli researchers have developed an eavesdropping software that modulates electromagnetic radio signals released by different computer hardware. These signals are so strong that it can be received by a simple FM receiver of your mobile phone.A computer that stores confidential data are usually placed inside a well-shielded room and are completely isolated from the external networks, these precautionary steps are taken to eliminate any possible data leakage. But hackers can use software like these, despite all the isolation, to access the protected data.The Israeli researcher team from Ben Gurion University has revealed that how hackers can steal data from your computer by only using the heat emissions. They have found a way to eavesdrop on the air-gapped computer using computer\u2019s built-in thermal sensors and heat discharge.This unusual method will allow hackers to secretly spy onto the security keys and passwords stored on the protected computer and then transmit the data to the computer, which is connected to the Internet, located in the close proximity, and is in the control of the hacker.Additionally, the same computer which is connected to the Internet can be used to transfer malicious programs to the air-gapped computer using a thermal method. It is obvious that this means of eavesdropping is very sluggish and cannot be used to transfer a large amount of data, but no doubt, it is effective.Kaspersky Labs, while explaining the working of this hacking method:\u201cThe malware reads classified data and periodically changes the system temperature by adjusting the load level and producing a modulated heat signal. The second computer reads and decodes it and sends the classified data over the Internet.\u201dYour computer stored within a well-isolated chamber does not provide assurance against complete data leakage protection because ultrasound technology can easily allow sensitive data to pass-through.Tristan Lawry, a doctoral candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering, has developed a spy equipment which can transfer data at high rates even through thick, solid steel obstructions. And, what\u2019s more, interesting about this equipment apart from transferring data is that it can also transmit power.This spying kit is a secretive technology, actually being used by the British Intelligence services, but has been reinvented by the graduate of the American-based university.According to the Kaspersky Lab:\u201c[This] spy equipment is represented in two compact units. One unit is inconspicuously placed inside of the classified room, while the other is placed somewhere outside of it. The data transfer rate through steel for ultrasound reaches up to 12 MB/s.", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "July 14, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Search Lab"], "title": "Researchers Found Critical Vulnerability in LG\u2019s Update Center Application", "body": "The LG Update Center Application faces yet another threat of cyber attack as was discovered by SEARCH-LAB Ltd in November 2014. A loophole exists where the center\u2019s SSL certificate lacks verification hence creating a loophole for man-in-the-middle attack on the connection between applications and the LG website (www.lgcpm.com). This gap then exposes LG handset users to fake applications created by these attackers.must readCritical Vulnerability Allows attacker to have full control over LG SmartphonesLG handsets are open for automatic installation of new updates and application in APK form and without authentication prompt. Attackers take advantage and interrupt this connection by installing their own created apps into users\u2019 handsets. These bogus applications and the genuine ones have something in common. Both do not require any permission from victims before installation hence a victim is likely to install the fake applications. The only security feature that may prevent this from taking place is the sign-in requirement by a system.Typically, a good number of smartphones are shipped with their own inbuilt applications whose updates are available on the vendors\u2019 app stores. For LG users, such applications are run from the LG Update Center which doubles up as a detector for any latest versions of LG apps. Most of these applications, however, are not available on Google Play Store.On discovering the weakness in LG\u2019s Update Centre, SEARCH-LAB Ltd informed LG manufacturing company who responded that they were considering a solution that should affect only the new models of the handset with Android L operating system. This, in essence, means that all LG handsets already in the market remain at risk of having bogus application automatically installed on them.Here is some technical explanation according to CVE-2015-4110. LG website (www.lgcpm.com) operates with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) encoded data. In the process of installing new applications, one searches for the \u201cappUrl\u201d field that typically carries a base64 encrypted URL message. Part of this message is the encryption key depending on the certKey field which is symmetric. Due to the absence of integrity protection on the message, an attacker gets an opportunity to hijack the update response and exchange it with an arbitrary appURL which exposes a user to an APK that is not genuine. This explains how an unsuspecting victim can have his handset under the control of an attacker.This can potentially affect the LG Update Center which will detect any new version of an app, the attacker\u2019s version included. This updated version become available for automatic download by LG handsets as this is how they are configured.Because of the decision made by LG manufacturers on existing smartphones, it is advisable to disable \u2018app auto update\u2019 on handsets and manually install new apps or updates only from genuine Wi-Fi networks or from LG Update Center Application Site.SEARCH-LAB Ltd is the same IT security company behind reporting a critical vulnerability in LG smartphones which allowed hackers to take full control of the device.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.comsourceSearch Lab", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "July 13, 2015"}, {"topics": ["WLS"], "title": "One Million Android Users Infected With Facebook Hacking Malware Apps", "body": "Ever wondered about the number of users an Android-based malware app can infect after getting approved and published on the Google Play Store?

That means these malware comprising apps did work as genuine apps but additionally they used to fraud with the users.During installation, the app didn\u2019t request for any suspicious permissions, but after successful installation once the app has been launched by user, a phishing activity is logged i.e. the app pops up a fake Facebook login screen.If the user is novice and didn\u2019t pay close attention to the screen then it is most likely that the user will fell for the trick and enter their Facebook username and password, which would be instantly sent to the hacker\u2019s server.However the total number of possible victims might be one million but the good news is that some of the users were not tricked by the scam because either they saw user reviews on Play Store or they were experienced.\u201cDespite the fact that the number of potential victims may have been up to one million, thankfully many were able to avoid being tricked by this scam as the negative user comments helped prevent them from entering their Facebook username and password,\u201d \u2013 Robert Lipovsky, Senior Malware Researcher at ESET.Both of these malware apps was developed by the same developer and the good news is that both were removed by Google from their Play Store last week. In addition to that, if a user tries to install these infected apps through another source, Google will show a warning message that suggests them not to install the app.At the time of removal, the Cowboy Adventure was at version 1.3 which was released on April 16th. Since then the malware app was being served to the users, compromising their Facebook credentials.Whereas, on the other hand, Jump Chess was available on Play Store since April 14th and was downloaded on about 5000 devices. So this app wasn\u2019t able to infect large audience as compared to Cowboy Adventure.Google said that they are working on improving their security mechanisms for Android users which will lower the risk of infection by these malware apps.Lipovsky also recommended a couple of safety steps for Android users i.e. the user should download the app from official sources like Google\u2019s official Play Store. Before downloading, users should also make sure to read reviews posted by other users.We will also recommend you to make use of two-factor authentication services that are being provided by most of the online websites.

In addition to the hidden downloading of apps, the malware app also displays pop-up advertisements to the user.\u201cThis malware was not only built with the purpose of displaying ads, it was also designed with more evil intentions,\u201d Desai said.When installing the malicious app, it requested lots of more permissions as compared to the original app, some were normal but other were troublesome which included the permission to access the Internet, mount and unmount file system, send SMS messages, disable keyguard, get user account information, download without notification, and initiate outgoing calls.After installation of the malicious app, the researcher found out that the malicious app \u201cdemanded administrative access,\u201d which indicates that the objective of developer is \u201cto obtain full control access of the victim\u2019s device.\u201dBut once the permission is granted by the victim, the malware app will provide exactly the same functionality of the original BatteryBot Pro app but continues to execute malicious activity in the background.Apart from the execution of malicious activity the app also tried to download various advertisement libraries which carry a click fraud campaign, the security researcher found out.\u201cSome of these URLs were hard coded in the app and some were sent by the remote server.\u201d \u2013 Shivang Desai, Zscaler Security Researcher.The malware app also tried to pull some personal information from the device, including cell phone operator, availability of SIM card, IMEI number, language, cell phone model, location and available device memory.Then depending on the collected parameters, the malware app begins to receive the list of advertisements to be displayed on the device along with the URL from where the ads will be fetched.Apart from the execution of click fraud and ad fraud activities, the app is explicitly designed so that it once installed can never be uninstalled again, at least by the novice user. The app run with administrative rights so that the user cannot remove it.According to the researcher who tried to uninstall this malicious app,\u201cWhile in some of the scenarios we were able to manually delete the app, the malware authors have taken care of ensure persistence.

Recently, their leaked source code was used by ad fraud Torjan to hijack outdated computers, this malware made use of the vulnerable exploits found in Adobe Flash plugin. But this wouldn\u2019t have happened if Hacking Team had kept their source code hidden and used a secure network to keep the hackers from stealing it.However, the vulnerabilities found in Flash and other web-browser based plugins has already been patched by Adobe, while the security researchers at Microsoft are working to release a fix for their exploitable kernel driver.So now, the Hacking Team is warning that their leaked Remote Control System (RCS) surveillance software i.e. \u201cDa Vinci\u201d can be used by anyone having the required \u201ctechnical ability\u201d to operate this software.The statement released by HackingTeam\u2019s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Eric Rabe states that, \u201cIt is now apparent that a major threat exists because of the posting by cyber criminals of HackingTeam proprietary software on the Internet the night of July 6.\u201d He further added, \u201cHackingTeam\u2019s investigation has determined that sufficient code was released to permit anyone to deploy the software against any target of their choice.\u201dFurthermore, Hacking Team who are well-known for providing spyware tools to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as well as various government agencies throughout the world, said in the announcement that it has become an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d situation because now they no longer have the ability to \u201ccontrol who uses the technology\u201d.\u201cBefore the attack, HackingTeam could control who had access to the technology which was sold exclusively to governments and government agencies.

On the other hand, today you are going to get another reminder from the people you least expect i.e. hackers. Yes, you heard that right!must readHackers Develop Android Malware Every 17 SecondsThe latest version of virus known as the \u201cKovter\u201d which is an ad fraud Trojan, infects the computer through Web-based security exploits like outdated web browsers and plugins, and then closes the inbound access after themselves by updating Flash Player to the latest version. Isn\u2019t this surprising?!So if you are running an outdated version of plugins including the Flash Player, Microsoft Silverlight, Java and Adobe Reader, then you could be the next target of this Trojan. Actually this virus takes advantage of vulnerabilities that have already been patched by the developers.Once the malware has been downloaded and installed, it will take-over to your system and use it to make thousands of fake clicks on online advertisements. Apart from that, Kovter also updates your web browser\u2019s Flash plugin to the most recent version, says ThreatPost.The moves by this ad fraud Trojan is very much similar to a housebreaker climbing into the house through an opening, and then closing that opening to keep other housebreakers out.For those of you who don\u2019t know, in most of the cases, after infecting the computer, ad fraud malware makes use of various strategies like patching the system to block other threats and hackers from attacking while having a full control over the system. But this time, updating Flash to the latest version is not their only strategy, actually they are more interested in serving users with the most appropriate ads while making sure that all the advertisements are displayed correctly.It\u2019s time to get rid of Adobe Flash all the wayWe all are aware of the fact that Flash Player is required to play most of the video advertisements on web browsers, and in case you have out-of-date version of Flash then your browser won\u2019t be able to run the Flash-based contents. The browsers are specifically designed by developers to act like that, and to protect users from exploits that could target older version of Flash Player, but this also cuts down the profits of ad fraud networks who solely relies on fraudulent ad clicks and views to generate revenue. This is the reason behind Kovter updating Flash plugin to an up-to-date version.But, on the other hand, ad fraud networks gives a hard time to website owners and advertisers because both of them loses money when bots are used to generate views and clicks on the advertisements.According to Sentrant:\u201cMany advertising exchanges will either not serve, or decrease the bid price of flash ads (video) to hosts who are detected using a very old version of Flash. In-fact we have seen the same Flash update behaviour on almost every other ad-fraud malware families that we have analysed.\u201dKovter was also used by hackers as a police ransomware infecting 44,000 devices in 2014. In Jan 2015, GameZone and Huffington Post were also hit by the same malvertising attack using Kovter.To keep your computer system secure from these malware and virus attacks, we will suggest you to update your Flash Player as well as other plugins to the latest version.Report typos and corrections to admin@hackread.com", "authur": "Farzan Hussain", "date": "July 9, 2015"}, {"topics": ["MasterCard"], "title": "MasterCard Plans to Use Selfies to Authenticate Online Transactions", "body": "Protecting customers from fake online transactions has always been a challenging task for the company\u2019s security division, which has forced a popular credit card company to adopt some innovative ways to verify online purchases and to cut down fraud.MasterCard, one of the most popular financial company, while experimenting with the biometric technology, has developed a new mobile app that will ask you to take your own picture during the checkout process to approve online purchases, which seems to make the whole buying process a lot easier than remembering a passcode.According to Ajay Bhalla, President of MasterCard\u2019s Enterprise Security and Innovative Solutions:\u201cThe new generation, which is into selfies \u2026 I think they\u2019ll find it cool. They\u2019ll embrace it,\u201dAt the moment, the company is experimenting with a security feature called \u201cSecureCode\u201d, which requires the user to enter a password to complete the online purchase. This step was taken to stop credit card credentials stealers from using your card on the Internet. And according to MasterCard, this feature has been used in 3 billion transactions last year.But the passwords can get caught, stolen or even forgotten. So MasterCard has planned to begin testing their new experimental app, featuring fingerprint and facial recognition technology, from the start of this fall to decide whether the new system is practical or not. But the experiment will be limited to 500 customers, and once it passes all the bends and curves, MasterCard will launch it publicly.We have previously seen that biometric technology has already been adopted by numerous mobile manufacturing companies, but the struggle to invent a transparent and foolproof system haven\u2019t been matched by the result\u2019s effectiveness ratio.Most of the mobile phones running Android mobile operating system do have a functionality to unlock device using facial recognition feature, while Apple has implemented TouchID feature on their new iPhone devices which allow users to unlock their phone using their fingerprints.Nevertheless, both of these state-of-the-art features proved to be ineffective under various practical situations which require the user to attempt several times. In addition to that, Apple\u2019s fingerprint recognition technology has also been hacked numerous times which proves that it is possible to reproduce the fingerprints, either by using high-resolution pictures of fingerprint or by gathering them from glossy surface.According to the report published on CNN Money, MasterCard has partnered with all the smartphone manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft, and BlackBerry. Apart from this, the company is still concluding deals with two key banks, so at the moment they don\u2019t know whose customers will be able to get their hands onto this new feature.The user is required to download the MasterCard mobile app to use this new feature. The app is supposed to \u201cpop-up\u201d whenever a payment needs to be made, and will ask for the option of authorization i.e. either via facial recognition or fingerprint.If you select fingerprint option then all you have to do is to touch. Else, if you select facial recognition option then the app will ask you to stare at the mobile phone\u2019s camera, blink once, and then the transaction will get verified.The developers has added a \u201cblink once\u201d feature to protect the customer and prevent robbers from fooling the system by holding up a picture of a person.Mr. Bhalla said in a report that the company never get a picture of the user\u2019s fingerprint or face. Every fingerprint scans will be converted into a code that remains on the user\u2019s mobile device. Whereas the data of facial recognition scans will be converted into binary and transmitted to MasterCard servers, over the Internet using a secure connection.Bhalla assured that the company won\u2019t be able to reconstruct the client\u2019s face, and the information will remain secure on the company\u2019s servers. However, this act do make some cybersecurity specialists uncomfortable because no one wants their personal data to be transmitted.According to Robert M. Lee, co-founder of Dragos Security:\u201cI understand why they\u2019d want that data, but no, I do not like it, [\u2026] From a privacy aspect it\u2019s awful \u2014 but from a business perspective, I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d accept that risk.\u201dApart from all that, Bhalla further added that MasterCard is also experimenting with voice recognition technology, so the users will be able to approve an online transaction by simply speaking to their smartphone.MasterCard is not the only company to come up with such ideas.

One of the players won bets while the other cashed out automatically.However, the team couldn\u2019t detect any wrongdoing.After almost a month a delayed cashout occurred and the winning player made a new account from which the largest bets in the history of Primedice were made. Hufflepuff, the bettor, was betting more than $8,000 in bitcoin per second for hours.However, once again the team couldn\u2019t identify wrongdoing and kept on paying Hufflepuff his winnings.Eventually, they identified that some accounts were sharing same server seed as the game displays the player an encrypted randomly generated value before the bet, which is called the server seed. This seed is to be shown to the client seed by the player and the system combines the two random values in order to evaluate win or loss.Since Primedice sends out decrypted seed, therefore, it was apparent that manipulation cannot happen. Nevertheless, Hufflepuff identified a way to make the server give out a decrypted server seed, which at the same time was an active seed. This is how he was able to corroborate the results of his bets.Primedice\u2019s house edge is just 1% that\u2019s why it became difficult to pinpoint that some member has figured out its system. The gaming site\u2019s team although noticed that \u201cHufflepuff\u201d was winning big time, but they couldn\u2019t understand how and why.Since bitcoin transactions remain anonymous and irreversible, therefore, Primedice is facing a tough challenge in tracking \u201cHufflepuff\u201d and in forcing him to return the funds.sourcecryptocoinsnews", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "July 5, 2015"}, {"topics": ["HeimdalSecurity"], "title": "New Spam Campaign Spreading Dridex Banking Malware", "body": "The latest spam campaign is equipped with the Dridex banking malware and targeting company accountants through deceptive emails.According to Heimdal Security, this spam email is an unauthentic scanned document, which actually is a macros-enabled.doc.The email attempts to pass as a genuine one under the subject title \u201cScanned from a Xerox Multifunction Printer.\u201d The email also informs the receiver that the document has been scanned and directly sent to the recipient from the printer.When or if the email is opened, the document instantly retrieves Dridex from numerous compromised web pages.This attack although isn\u2019t very different from any such spam campaign but it is much more \u201crefined and stealthy\u201d in its mechanism of hacking, says the CEO of Heimdal Security Morten Kjaersgaard.Kjaersgaard says that \u201cAs users we need to constantly remind ourselves that hackers are getting better at what they do.

SCMagazine explains that the reason behind this growing trend is simple: \u201cAndroid applications continue to offer the lowest barrier to entry among all mobile device platforms currently available.\u201dThis is definitely not surprising because the Android approach makes it relatively easier for cybercriminals to design and inject malware into applications.This increment in malware targeting Android is a fruit of our increasing reliance on tablets and smartphones.

Fifty per cent of US consumers use a smartphone or tablet for their banking transactions, and 78 percent of Internet users make purchases online.

Mohammed Djenane, the security specialist at ESET Middle East, states: \u201cThere are several tracking devices out there in the market and not all them are designed with proper security measures in places. Even some of the most trusted devices report the data to a command-and-control server, something like a back door that is vulnerable to attacks.

This confidence is likely to have shattered by today\u2019s news that up to 600 million users may be vulnerable to a cracking attack, primarily thanks to the widely successful keyboard app, SwiftKey. Reported by NewsSource, the news was broke that the app has the potential to be compromised, despite initial preventive measures already being put into place.must readPersonal information of 500million Android users at riskThe exploit in question was a rather obvious one; the keyboard pre-installed on Samsung devices would search for language pack updates over unencrypted lines, resulting in the potential for spoof proxy servers able to send malicious security updated to said devices. Furthermore, validating data could also be sent in addition to the false language packs, the end result being that this data would remain on the device.The worst case scenario would result in giving away system user level privileges, allowing a malicious cyber-attacker access to contact data, bank credentials or even messages. This is a clear violation of privacy, leaving android users understandably upset that their user rights are being undermined.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen reports of a security issue related to the Samsung keyboard. We can confirm that the SwiftKey Keyboard apps available via Google Play or the Apple App Store are not affected by this vulnerability. We take reports of this manner very seriously and are currently investigating further.\u201d All is not lost however. If you are reading this thinking that your data may be under threat, It is important to mention that the independent app SwiftKey is not affected, but instead the built-in Samsung IME is the vulnerable piece of software, which was partly developed by the keyboard app giants. If you have SwiftKey on your Samsung device, feel free to continue to update it. The app was not included in the article released by NewsSource. Additionally, the stock Samsung keyboard that was highlighted as being a security threat was demonstrated using significantly older firmware, and with the added point that the keyboard isn\u2019t simple to update, the flaw identified is not a simple one to exploit correctly.An attack would also be rather involved \u2013 essentially, a malicious party would have to have already deeply compromised the security of the network of a user and use DNS hijacking or a similar man-in-the-middle exploit to redirect the phone to a fake language pack update that could then potentially inject the device with malicious code. Taking these complicated factors into consideration, there is the additional hurdle that the device can only truly be exploited when the app initiates the download of a new language pack.

However, this approach makes the domains (that are used to transfer commands to the compromised and infected machines) relatively easier to identify through threat analysis techniques.Another technique for improving the resiliency of Vawtrak Malware involves a DGA or domain generation algorithm. DGA creates a set of domain names that the malware uses to receive commands.Only a small ratio of these domains is registered by cyber criminals on the web because Vawtrak checks every name until the required response is achieved.Fortinet\u2019s Raul Alvarez explains the way this piece of malware works. According to Alvarez, Vawtrak\u2019s code involves multiple DWOTD values, which match different domain titles.In his blog post, Alvarez stated:\u201cEach DWORD value is a seed used to generate the domain name. These seeds are stored as fixed values within the malware code, thereby producing the same pseudo-randomized domain names. To generate the corresponding domain name, Vawtrak uses the seed to generate the pseudo-randomized characters of the domain name.\u201dHowever, researchers can easily find the generated strings by breaking the algorithm and therefore, this is not a fallible technique.The newer versions of the threat depend upon Tor2Web. It is a proxy that creates a direct link to a Tor server without using additional tools.Strings that get created by the DGA are for Tor locations and a function has been implemented by the author that transfers then across the Tor2Web proxy service.It is although possible to trace the user who tries to connect to this proxy service however, the connections made afterwards aren\u2019t traceable. It happens so because Tor\u2019s traffic is encrypted and it uses various machines to route it. These machines don\u2019t keep any data of traffic including its origin and destination. Therefore, users are able to access a server with complete anonymity.Vawtrak Malware involves multiple protection mechanisms for instance, disabling antiviruses, which is why it manages to evade detection and analysis. Once a machine is compromised it can pilfer personal data and record user activity or actions such as screenshots, keystrokes and videos.The operator of Vawtrak can remotely access the system via a VNC channel. The operator can easily modify web sessions by injecting fake content for collecting passwords of online bank accounts, as well as all the other codes, require for accessing those accounts.", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "June 11, 2015"}, {"topics": ["wtsp"], "title": "Teacher Suspended for using jammer in class to stop students\u2019 cell phones", "body": "Summary: Five days suspension without pay awaited the Hudson teacher who took a class experiment a bit too far and used jammer to prevent students from using their mobiles.

Even the method of accessing the account is very simple and compatible with all platforms, as explained in a YouTube video.A hacker firstly tries to setup WhatsApp on the target device/phone using the phone number of the victim. From WhatsApp, the hacker makes a call to that phone number on the victim\u2019s phone and sends that person a PIN that has to be entered in order to authenticate the account. If the hacker manages to access the target phone, he will be able to answer the phone and use the same code to perform certain actions. Since no phone unlocking method is involved in answering the call therefore, no password or PIN can limit the actions of the hacker.The attack worsens on iPhone especially when Siri is also enabled. If a user has configured Siri in a way to work from the lock screen and/or has set up his contact details in Siri\u2019s settings, then this can potentially make their phone vulnerable as everyone can access without any PIN.

And there\u2019s a rather straight-forward method in which operations typically take place in the underground, one that involves sellers, buyers, and sometimes forum moderators and administrators who help make sure the transactions are \u2018legit.\u2019 But the underground economy is riddled with fraudsters whose only interests are to rip off other fraudsters.They say \u201cthere\u2019s no honor among thieves,\u201d and, at least in the underground, that couldn\u2019t be truer. After all, the underground is designed to enable the trading of illegal goods while sellers remain anonymous. This anonymity enables sellers to stay protected, but also increases their threat of being ripped off ten-fold. After all, if you can disconnect, change your nickname, and come back minutes later with a fresh identity, you can rip people off forever.These individuals who rip people off, aptly named \u201crippers,\u201d are basically scammers targeting scammers, and they\u2019re the most hated members of the underground community. Rippers pose as legitimate vendors offering goods such as compromised online banking accounts or credit cards, or various services \u2018real\u2019 fraudsters look for. The moment they get paid for these goods or services, they disappear. Rippers would rip off fraudsters for nickels and dimes, while some can successfully rip thousands of dollars off fraudsters. In fact, there are so many rippers in the underground economy that a lot of the underground trading \u2018etiquette\u2019 is specifically designed to thwart any rip off attempt.In the \u201cold days,\u201d if a vendor wanted to sell something such as stolen credit card credentials in the underground, they needed to first get verified by forum administrators. To do this, they\u2019d send a free sample to the administrators and wait to be reviewed. Just like a food critic, vendors\u2019 products and level of service would be scrutinized; only with a passing review were they were given a \u2018Verified Vendor\u2019 status, a type of \u201cstamp of approval\u201d from the board certifying that the vendor was \u201clegit\u201d (and that he or she wasn\u2019t a ripper). \u201cA \u2018Verified Vendor\u2019 status meant a huge increase in business, as they were considered trustworthy. Of course, some verified vendors proved to be turncoats and misused this trust, ripping off buyers when the opportunity was ripe.\u201d In order to sell goods, the new verified vendor would then start a thread in a section of a forum where only vendors can create threads, and would receive feedback from customers.While higher-tier underground forums may still work this way, many of the English-language underground boards, ravaged by a string of arrests by Western law enforcement agencies, are now much less sophisticated. Becoming a Verified Vendor is still an option, and a way to increase one\u2019s credibility in the underground. But most vendors don\u2019t bother getting verified and instead post in the free-for-all areas of a forum.It should be noted that these free-for-all areas have always existed. After all, not all fraudsters have enough goods to sell that they can afford giving administrators free samples. And, naturally, these free-for-all areas come with a higher risk of being ripped off. To alleviate this situation at least somewhat, a new solution arose: The escrow. An escrow service acts as a mediator between two parties making a financial transaction and is meant to ensure no one loses their funds due to a scam.The escrow in the underground economy is usually offered by the forum administrator or another long-standing and trustworthy member of the community. Since most of what fraudsters trade is data (compromised credentials), their goods are easily transferable. An escrow receives from the items being sold from the vendor in order to make sure the vendor is not trying to rip off buyers. The escrow also receives money from the buyer (since rippers posing as buyers and asking for \u201csamples\u201d in the attempt to get free stuff is also a thing), and once the escrow has confirmed that both parties have held their end, the vendor gets the money, the buyer gets the items and the escrow retains a fee. The underlying rule is simple: if one party requests an escrow.Rippers will continue to exist as long as the underground exists, and as long as there will continue to be anonymous trading of illegal goods. If fraudsters see themselves not as cybercriminals but rather as businessmen, being a ripper is simply a niche, and there\u2019s enough skin in the game to make it worthwhile.Uri Brison is CEO of LogDog.

Initially, it was discovered that the access was gained to more than 100,000 accounts through the Get Transcript application.After the IRS unveiled details it became evident that the user data was not obtained because of a direct hack of government systems, instead it was fault of weak authentication used by the IRS to protect access to taxpayer data.The hackers were able to access taxpayer records using lifted personal identifying information, apparently hacked from online financial fraud marketplaces. The Get Transcript application that is a feature of the IRS\u2019 site that permits taxpayers to download tax return and tax payment transaction data, was deceptively targeted by financial fraudsters between February and mid-May.The service was immediately shut down last week as the IRS investigated the activity, which may have a connection to the fraudulent filing of tax returns and transfer of tax refunds. Nearly 200,000 accounts; were targeted and half failed because of improper information inputs during the IRS\u2019 authentication process.The Get Transcript Online feature of IRS.gov allows taxpayers to get: tax account transactions, line-by-line tax return information, or wage and income reported to us for a specific tax year. In order to retrieve a transcript online, all that\u2019s required is a Social Security number and an active e-mail address. Once the e-mail address was authenticated the system would configure a number of questions about personal, financial, and tax information\u2014including date of birth, tax filing status, and address\u2014before the transcript could be downloaded.This type of \u201cknowledge-based authentication\u201d, is highly exposed to fraud. It\u2019s based on unchanged information and is available to anyone willing to pay for it out of stolen financial information marketplaces. The transcripts that were falsely downloaded were able to be accessed apparently due to leaked Social Security numbers and other personal data from any one of the many recent data breaches, comprising those at health insurers Anthem and CareFirst. In fact, security reporter Brian Krebs reported on the risks inherent in the IRS\u2019 transcript request system way back in March, he cautioned taxpayers to sign up for accounts on IRS.gov only just to prevent fake account creation.Krebs investigated a specific case relating a man who had tried to file taxes online, he figured that someone had filed using his personal information right in front of him. The attacker then misused the victim\u2019s information to get a refund direct deposit. When he tried to get a transcript of the fraudulent return using the \u2018Get Transcript\u2019 function on IRS.gov, it dawned upon him that someone else had already registered through the IRS\u2019s site using his Social Security number and an unknown e-mail address, Krebs added. The fake return had been filed through the IRS\u2019s own free tax filing site.In this case highlighted by Krebs, the made-up return receipt was sent to the bank account of a college student who was totally unaware of the fraud. The IRS issued a statement saying that, today\u2019s data breach did not dodge any of the IRS\u2019 core security systems, and the main computer system that handles tax filing submission is deemed secure. However, that information hardly consolidates 100,000 taxpayers whose data is now in clutches of the financial fraud marketplace. Same is the case with other approximately 100,000 individuals whose SSNs were manipulated to access their tax records. The IRS stated further that they will be sending a letter to all of the approximately 200,000 taxpayers whose accounts had tried unauthorized entries, alerting them that third parties had access to taxpayer Social Security numbers and additional personal financial information from a non-IRS source before they attempted to access the IRS transcript application.People whose records were accessed will be offered free credit monitoring to safeguard any misuse of their information through other financial avenues. Furthermore, the affected taxpayers\u2019 records will be observed for fraud for the current and 2016 tax reporting periods. The IRS is making all necessary efforts to ensure the safety of their core processing system to flag for potential identity theft to protect taxpayers going forward, as of now as well as 2016.", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "date": "May 28, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Amazon News"], "title": "John McAfee supports his pal who found security flaw, hacked an aircraft", "body": "Summary: An official statement issued by an FBI agent reveals that InfoSec researcher Chris Roberts has confessed to hacking into the controls of a flying aircraft triggering it to climb \u2014 John McAfee (founder of McAfee anti-virus software) is supporting Roberts on this issue.Earlier we reported how vulnerable In-Flight systems can be taken over by hackers.

Between February 13 and March 5, 2015, the agents interviewed the researcher multiple times to get his take on the susceptibilities in the IFE systems on Boeing and Airbus aircrafts.Conferring to the\u202faffidavit\u202f(published by Canadian news outlet\u202fAPTN) presented by special agent Mark Hurley demanded a search warrant request for the recently seized electronics, Roberts confessed to exploiting the exposed malfunctions during flight.The document states that, between 2011 and 2014, the researcher tested approximately 15 to 20 times and the breaking point was the video monitor installed in the passenger seatbacks (Seat Electronic Box).After hacking into the IFE network via a laptop hooked with a Cat6 ethernet cable, Roberts then accessed into other systems on the aircraft.While on-board the flight, he was able to overwrite the code on the plane\u2019s Thrust Management Computer and issue a \u201cclimb\u201d command. This caused the aircraft to change direction and move sideways.detThe account\u2019s context is not completely clear from the affidavit, however, the information was derived from a much larger pool in order to attain search warrant for the devices. Hurley later revealed that hence the affidavit was only to secure a search warrant so he did not include all the well known facts regarding the investigation.
