The vulnerability works in such a way that it allows attackers to bypass password protection and TouchID with a certain sequence of actions.In his blog post, Leonardo stated that in Signal\u2019s version 2.23  and below, an attacker can follow below mention steps to access the main application window without authentication. Though, it requires the attacker to have a physical access to the targeted device.1. Open the app 2. Press the cancel button 3. Click the Home button 4. Open the app again.A CVE (CVE-2018-9840) has also been assigned this vulnerability. \u201cThe Open Whisper Signal app before 2.23.2 for iOS allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the screen locker feature via certain rapid sequences of actions that include app opening, clicking on cancel, and using the home button.\u201dMore: Snowden Explains Why Telegram Messenger App is Unsafe\u201cI am all for human rights and Edward Snowden is my inspiration due to his bravery and value, even when he faced hard consequences for his actions,\u201d Leonardo told me on phone. \u201cTo me, he is a really special person and I consider him like a brother.\u201dFor those who are not aware, the password-protected access to Signal app was introduced by the company on April 3rd, 2018. \u201cI started the application testing and code analyzing at the same time. Leonardo said. \u201cThe day after the release, I found a method to bypass the Signal Screen Locker for iOS.\u201d\u201cI verified that the error was reproducible and, having checked it on several devices, I had a look at the source code and found the bug that held this security problem. When the screen was unlocked Signal app recorded date and time of the event, but even if you didn\u2019t unlock it \u2013 returning to the home page by clicking delete / cancel as an example \u2013 this value was updated, restoring the unlock time-out and allowing unauthorized access,\u201d explained Leonardo.Leonardo reported the vulnerability to Signal whose security team was quick to issue a patch however, the fix was partial since the version 2.23.1.1 was still vulnerable to screen locker bypass, with a slightly different click sequence including following steps:1. Open the app 2. Click cancel button 3. Click home button 4. Double click on the home button 5. Close the app 6. Open the App 7. Click cancel button 8. Click once the home button 9. Open the app 10. You can see Signal main screen without having been asked for the Password or TouchIDThe good news is that Leonardo has reported the second issue to Signal and at the time of publishing this article, the issue was fixed in Signal app\u2019s version 2.23.2.Signal has also acknowledged Leonardo\u2019s work by stating on its iOS download page\u2019s description under the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section that \u201cThis release fixes a bug that made it possible to bypass the new Screen Lock feature. Thanks to Leonardo Porpora for reporting this issue.\u201dRemember, Signal app on Android and iOS have millions of users worldwide who depend on the app\u2019s security and privacy features. For a 17-year-old to find a vulnerability and report it to the company shows the InfoSec industry will welcome highly talented and honest people in the near future.If you are using Signal app on iOS make sure it is updated to the latest version and do not leave your phone unattended in public places.More: Best Encrypted Email Services for 2018", "title": "17-year-old finds screen lock bypass vulnerability in Signal app for iOS"}, {"date": "April 11, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "Malware", "Privacy", "Ransomware", "security", "Technology", "Windows"], "body": "Usually, a ransomware attack is all about locking victims files for ransom.

However, for the first time, a university has used this strategy to create awareness among students regarding phishing attacks.Reportedly, thousands of students were targeted with phishing attacks by the university itself in order to alert them and motivate them in identifying real threats. The trend was initiated by Ohio State University in January this year in which nearly 18% of the recipients of scammed emails clicked on them.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Another phishing campaign was instigated by the University of Alabama at Birmingham where over 7,000 employees (approx. a quarter of the total recipients) fell prey to phishing scams in March 2018.According to ABC News, a 19-year old Ohio State sophomore Ezequiel Herrera was caught off guard not once but twice through fake emails, which left him frustrated in the end.\u201cI was sort of like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m really, really bad,\u2019\u201d said Herrera adding that he has now become a lot more alert while clicking on emails from unknown senders.These phishing emails were designed as financial aid programs, vacation packages, password resetting requests and similar other attention-grabbing titles. Recipients were required to take immediate action. When the recipient clicked on the provided links, they were redirected to a page where information about good cyber security habits was uploaded. It also explained how to identify and report real threats.Through phishing simulation, states Ohio State\u2019s chief information security officer Helen Patton, the objective to be achieved is to ensure that people understand the role they can play in security management.\u201cA lot of what makes an organization secure is what happens between an individual and their keyboard or their phone,\u201d said Patton while referring to the phishing simulation as a sort of digital vaccination that can protect individuals within an extensive campus community against cyber attacks.In fact, Ohio State has been using the phishing simulation strategy since 2016 and officials have noted that responses have gradually improved. However, still, there is plenty of room for improvement. Such as, when a message was sent explaining the problem with a printer at the second-floor, people still clicked on the email despite knowing that there wasn\u2019t a second floor at the facility.Kevin Watson, a security expert, and CEO at Netsurion prepared a checklist of dos and don\u2019ts to help make sure users do not fall for phishing scams and consumers credit card information does not become a sweet dessert for some hacker.Hackers snoop public Wi-Fi connections and even create their own fake hotspots.

Private individuals and big businesses alike should constantly be looking at the latest trends and emerging threats in an increasingly connected age. 2017 saw a large number of high-profile cyber attacks, with businesses like Uber and Equifax proving that no matter your resources, everyone is equally susceptible to weak spots in their digital security. For that reason, it vital that your business is doing all that it can to beat the cyber criminals and protect your company and those that it employs and provides for. Here are the two biggest security threats that you need to be aware of in 2018, and the best ways to tackle them:Ransomware in the CloudOne of the most popular forms of criminal activity continues to be centered around ransomware. Ransomware allows criminals to deny official users access to their own data, and will usually result in a payment in order to regain access. It has been a major issue and is made even more so by the fact that so many businesses are making use of cloud-based services for their data-storage. Cloud technology allows businesses to keep large quantities of information without the need to invest in costly physical servers of their own, so it\u2019s vital that you protect your cloud access as much as possible. This will come down to staff training on basic security, such as password or passphrase generation and the need for personal devices to remain as secure as business devices.You can also follow this infographic on how to remove ransomware.Data Breach & Human ErrorNo matter how technologically advanced the cyber criminals become, the biggest issue is still your employees. From clicking on a corrupted link in an email to using the same passwords across every platform of your company, your staff members are the number one cause of data breaches. If you struggle to maintain an awareness of common security issues, then it may be time to make use of a security partner when it comes to your IT strategies. Turn to expert support available for instance Torix to help with cyber security, and you will free up your staff and yourself, enabling you to prioritize your workload in more profitable directions. A data breach can cost you a lot more than your profits and may end up damaging your business reputation beyond repair. Make sure that you are doing all that you can to prevent costly incidents, and you can move into the future feeling much more secure.Managing your security doesn\u2019t need to become the most time-consuming element of your daily business management. With a little awareness and a recognition of the latest threats, it is possible to delegate and guide your IT strategies in order to offer the best security for your business, staff, customers, and suppliers. Failing to keep your systems updated, or not taking the time to keep up with the current criminal trends, is the first step to becoming a victim to the cyber criminals.Image credit: Depositphotos", "title": "Two Latest Cyber Security Threats & How To Protect Against Them"}, {"date": "April 7, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["ATM", "ATMJackpot", "Banking", "credit card", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "hacking", "Malware", "Scam", "security"], "body": "A new ATM malware has been identified by security researchers at Netskope Threat Research Labs. It has been dubbed as ATMJackpot (named after the technique called ATM jackpotting). Initial investigation revealed that the malware originated from Hong Kong while the time stamp binary is identified to be 28th March 2018.Apparently, the malware is in its developmental phase yet because, in comparison to other, previously discovered malware, ATMJackpot has limited features. Such as its graphical UI is quite basic and only displays the hostname and information about the service providers (e.g. PIN pad, card reader and cash dispenser service providers).According to Netskope\u2019s blog post, it is yet unclear how ATMJackpot is deployed or used (physically or remotely) but its purpose is quite clear, which is to steal money from ATMs (automated teller machines).ATM jackpotting is also called logical attack; it refers to using malware for controlling cash dispensing from an ATM. Usually, malware is delivered to an ATM remotely or through a USB port after compromising the operator network of the ATM.Netskope didn\u2019t reveal whether ATMJackpot\u2019s deployment was the result of manual installation through USB on ATMs or was it downloaded from an infected network. If the former was the case then it wouldn\u2019t have been difficult for the crooks because installing malware on an ATM physically isn\u2019t difficult at all.Jackpotting is designed to avoid physical break-in into the machine and can be inserted into the ATM through the USB port. Cybercriminals are quite familiar with the version of Windows used in a majority of ATMs so physically compromising the vault is not an issue for them at all.The malware starts its malicious operation by registering the \u201cWin\u201d windows class name with a malware activity process and then populates the options available on the system to connect with the XFS manager. A common API is provided by the XFS subsystem to manipulate the machine. A session is then initiated by the malware for registering with the service provider so as to track events.It also initiates a session with the card reader, PIN pad, and cash dispenser service providers. After tracking events, the malware issues commands and reads data from the PIN pad to dispense cash and eject cards. The malware download has been detected by Netskope as Gen: Variant.Razy.255528.ATM jackpotting is becoming a serious and concerning issue for security experts. The issue was first noticed in Europe in 2014; soon after it spread to Asian regions. Europol warned in 2017 that attacks on ATMs involving jackpotting technique were on a rise, significantly increasing the scale and scope of the attacks against ATMs.In January 2018, the US witnessed the first ever jackpotting attack against ATMs. A security alert was issued by the Secret Service and a worldwide operation against the members of the notorious Carbanak group, believed to be involved in attacks on ATMs and stealing over $1.24m, was launched.The suspected leader of Carbanak group was arrested from Spain in March 2018. However, the latest attack is a clear proof that either the group is still pretty much active or there is another group that is targeting ATMs with such frequency.\ufeff", "title": "ATMJackpot Malware Stealing Cash From ATMs"}, {"date": "April 6, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Android", "app", "hacking", "Infosec", "Intel", "internet", "Keyboard", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "body": "As is the norm with security researchers, when bugs are discovered in any software especially the critical ones, software vendor issues an apology and releases a security update after fixing the flaw. People update the software and carry on with using it.But, one of the apps from Intel has such severe flaws that the company decided to discontinue the app for good instead of developing patches. Intel\u2019s Remote Keyboard app for Android came under the hammer after security researchers identified three different exploits of critical nature.In a security alert from Intel, it is stated that the app contains three critical flaws that let hackers hijack the connection (if on the same network) and plague affected Android devices with malicious code and keystrokes. The app was used in combination with Intel NUC (next unit of computing) mini-PCs and the small-sized Intel Compute Stick devices. Through the app, users were able to wirelessly control the small-form devices via Wi-Fi Direct protocol using their smartphones.When researchers notified Intel about the flaws, the company issued a statement announcing the discontinuation of the app:\u201cIntel has issued a Product Discontinuation notice for Intel Remote Keyboard and recommends that users of the Intel Remote Keyboard uninstall it at their earliest convenience.\u201dHence, there is no doubt about the fact that Intel won\u2019t be fixing the issues so, users are left with no other choice but to delete the app immediately.The app has been removed from Apple App Store and Google Play Store as well. On Google Play Store it had over 500,000 downloads. But in comparison to other apps, this figure is quite average. Is this the reason why Intel decided to give up on this app totally.. we may never know! But, according to an Intel representative, the app was already scheduled for discontinuation and the decision was taken before the discovery of flaws.The identified flaws are as follows:1. CVE-2018-3641: This flaw lets a network attacker inject the machine with keystrokes by appearing as a local user.2. CVE-2018-3645: It lets a local attacker hijack another remote keyboard session by injecting keystrokes.3. CVE-2018-3638: The flaw allows an authorized local attacker become a privileged user and execute arbitrary code.The flaws would lead to providing escalation of privilege to an attacker at both local and remote level. On the CVE risk scale, out of ten, the flaws have been rated as 9.0, 8.0 and 7.2 respectively. All versions of Remote Keyboard app are affected by the flaws, which mean the bug is deeply embedded in the app\u2019s code.It is although true that Compute Stick and NUC users were more than happy with the app and would be facing some issues now that it has been discontinued.

The infamous OceanLotus group is well known for targeting maritime construction firms, research institutes, media and human rights organizations.Detected as OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D by Trend Micro researchers, the malware aims at Mac devices that have Perl programming language installed on the system and is being delivered through phishing emails attached with a Microsoft Word document.More: New macOS malware hijacks DNS settings and takes screenshotsAfter analyzing the document, researchers noted that its content invites users to register themselves for an event organized by HDMC, a Vietnamese organization that advertises national independence and democracy.The document contains malicious macros. The email recommends victims to enable macros to read the email and once that\u2019s done the obfuscated macros extract a .XML file from the Word document which is actually an executable file and works as the dropper of the backdoor, which is the final payload.Moreover, all strings within the dropper including the backdoor are encrypted using a hardcoded RSA256 key. The dropper checks whether it is running as a root or not and based on that it selects where it needs to be installed.\u201cWhen the dropper installs the backdoor, it sets its attributes to \u201chidden\u201d and sets file date and time to random values,\u201d researchers noted. \u201cThe dropper will delete itself at the end of the process.\u201dThe backdoor depends on two functions including runHandle and infoClient. The runHandle function is responsible for the backdoor capabilities whereas infoClient collects platform information and sends it to the command and control (C&C) server.\u201cMalicious attacks targeting Mac devices are not as common as its counterparts, but the discovery of this new macOS backdoor that is presumably distributed via phishing email calls for every user to adopt best practices for phishing attacks regardless of operating system,\u201d concluded Trend Micro.Although it is unclear how many victims this new malware has found or if it has spread outside Vietnam; macOS users should remain vigilant and refrain from clicking links or downloading files from unknown emails.

These live chat widgets are responsible for leaking personal details of company employees of probably hundreds of popular websites. The sites managed by Google, Bank of America, Sprint, PayPal, Verizon, Bell, Spring, Kaspersky Lab, Disney, Tesla, Sony, Orange, TorGuard VPN, and Bitdefender are among those identified to be vulnerable.All the identified live chat software, researchers claim, get affected in the same manner. Since live chat sessions involve the exchange of sensitive and important data between the agent and the user, therefore, it is an issue of great concern.Leaked data includes employee\u2019s name, email address and ID, supervisor and managers\u2019 names and IDs, the location of the employee, center name and indication of the other software used by the employee. This data is leaked by examining the requests made during a live chat session.The leak happens after an attacker manages to engage in a live chat session with a support staff employee. However, not every company\u2019s employee data is leaked while the details acquired by attacker also vary from company to company. It mainly relies upon the way every business sets up its support widgets.

As a result, hundreds of e-commerce websites running via Magento have already been compromised by hackers to steal credit card numbers and install cryptocurrency miners.Magento has two versions one of which is open source while the other is a curated enterprise version. As is the norm with successful open source products, the enterprise version offers access to support and is exclusively maintained by Magento.Websites run on Magento platform are compromised via brute-forcing. Hackers use common and already known credentials to compromise the website. According to Flashpoint\u2019s findings, nearly 1,000 admin panels from Magento have been compromised so far. A majority of compromised Magento panels belong to firms in the education and healthcare sector while maximum targets were identified in the US and Europe.Flashpoint researchers wrote that attacks that are launched using brute-force method are successful only when administrators fail to change the credentials after installing the platform. Hackers can easily create automated scripts using known credentials for facilitating panel access. After gaining control of the site\u2019s CMS admin panel, attackers can add any script of their choice. It must be noted that hackers are also targeting other e-commerce processing CMS (content management systems) like Powerfront and OpenCarts too.More: BlackBerry\u2019s Magento based mobile site hacked to mine MoneroFlashpoint identified that hackers inject malicious code into the core file to get access to payment data processing pages and post requests to the server containing sensitive data. When the compromised website is visited, the visitors get subjected to malware attacks. The site asks the visitor to update Adobe Flash Player software and when the user clicks on the provided link, malware is launched from servers. These infected servers are hosted on sites like GitHub.Different malware is involved in this campaign; the first downloaded piece is the AZORult data-stealing software, which downloads other malware as well as the cryptominer. Data is then intercepted and transmitted to the hacker. A similar method is used to install cryptominer. Attackers are looking to mine Rarog cryptocurrency in this particular campaign. It is also identified that the exploitation of Magento admin panels has continued on entry-level and at higher levels on Deep & Dark Web forums since 2016.An interesting aspect is that attackers are updating the malicious files on a daily basis to evade detection. This daily updating makes it difficult for security software firms to detect the threat because frequent signature changes cannot be caught immediately.Furthermore, GitHub is also helping attackers in avoiding detection as they can download and store new code easily. When an organization uploads the White List of safe sides, GitHub is bound to make an appearance. This allows malware downloads to evade blocking. Perhaps this is why attackers prefer to host their malicious codes on GitHub.Flashpoint has collaborated with law enforcement to inform victims of the breaches but it is suspected that the scope of the attack is pretty vast while researchers have managed to detect just a fraction of total compromised websites. Most of these sites got hacked by exploiting standard security loopholes.Therefore, researchers have advised Magento admins to immediately revise CMS account credentials to mitigate brute-force attack threat. It is very important to replace old, weak passwords with new stronger ones as well as to enforce 2FA authentication. Also, Magento employees should be provided with secure password managers while users should be barred from recycling old and used passwords.More: Hackers are using YouTube Ads to Mine Monero CryptocurrencyWhen asked whether Magento will be releasing a security update to prevent or thwart brute-force attacks, the company didn\u2019t immediately respond and we are yet to receive an official word from them.Magento has now addressed the issue and released a statement according to which \u201cUp to 1,000 open-source accounts were affected by brute force attacks, a form of fraud where cybercriminals take advantage of weak passwords to steal information and distribute malware. This is not a new threat, as there have been previously reported variants that have impacted other vendor systems,\u201d the statement said.\u201cAll accounts identified were on Magento Open Source (formerly Community Edition), and we have communicated to users how to take immediate action and employ preventive measures.

The social network, unfortunately, is in the news for all the wrong reasons. As you may know that the social media giant shared a massive trove of user data to the British political and data mining firm Cambridge Analytica. To make things worse, several Android users found out that Facebook has been collecting their call and SMS logs. Perhaps, this is the reason why WhatsApp co-founder urged Facebook users to permanently delete their accounts while Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla has already deleted mighty big pages of both companies from Facebook.This is why #DeleteFacebook hashtag is gaining momentum on Twitter since users believe that deleting Facebook for good is the only probable solution. That\u2019s because manually deleting all the posts to create a clean slate for spies and surveyors would be a very time-consuming task.However, this isn\u2019t a practical solution, to be honest; we simply cannot do without Facebooking. We need it to keep in touch with family and friends and remain an active part of the society in general. But is it all worth it if we have to give up our personal information for the sake of socializing? Of course, it is not!But, now there is a way to delete most of your Facebook data in one go, which solves the issue to a great extent. This is made possible by a Chrome extension dubbed as Social Book Post Manager (SBPM). SBPM basically lets you delete Facebook content in bulk without tiring yourself by deleting every single post on your own.Through this Chrome extension, you can not only delete Facebook posts in bulk but also unlike them via an automated process. Before deleting the data, you need to create a backup of the data, which will include your photos, videos, posts, messages and chat conversations on Facebook. The information uploaded in the About section of your profile will also be included in the backup.For creating the backup you need to access Settings>General Account Settings. You will see a link with this title: \u201cDownload a copy of your Facebook data.\u201d After clicking on this option your data backup will be created and emailed to you on the email address registered with Facebook. After creating the backup you can install the SBPM extension and delete the data.To delete your posts, you are required to firstly download the extension from Chrome Web Store and install it. Then you will be instantly taken to Activity Log page. Once there, you will see a list of your Activity data stored on Facebook, which includes your profile information, posts created and liked, comments and friends added. You will have to click on the data you want to delete by selecting Filter and selecting the year, month and deletion speed.For instance, if you want to delete posts only then click on Posts filter, which will display all the posts you have created during the selected year and month. Click on SBPM icon to get the list of filters to delete posts on Facebook. The purpose of these filters is to determine which data is to be removed. Prescan on Page option is also there to help you review all the posts prior to deleting them.If you are satisfied with the selected posts, click on Confirmation button after which all the posts will be deleted. If you don\u2019t want to delete certain posts just refresh the page to reset the Activity Log to its previous state.It is recommended that you select one year and one month since the script cannot catch everything so you might be required to remove content manually. Select 16x speed first and then 4x and 1x respectively.Also, note that there have been reports that using Prescan option on highly populated activity logs causes issues. So, if you just want to delete all your Facebook posts then uncheck the Prescan on Page option.

The list of targeted apps is available below:According to researchers\u2019 blog post, the malware can effectively hide its configuration file and some of its modules to evade detection. In their report, which was published on Monday, researchers noted that this malware is not as sophisticated as those discovered previously and has limited capabilities.Its main task is to collect sensitive user data from instant messaging apps and IM clients. Once the malware successfully infects an app, it modifies the \u201c/system/etc/install-recovery.sh\u201d file. After this, it enables the file to be executed every time the infected app is opened.More: Facebook collected Android users\u2019 call and SMS logs with \u201ctheir permission\u201dThe Trojan uses anti-emulator and debugger detection methods for evading dynamic analysis and hiding the strings.

In some modules such as \u201csx\u201d, \u201csy\u201d, \u201ccoso\u201d, \u201cdmnso\u201d, the malware uses the first byte of the module to XOR for data decryption. For instance, the original \u201ccoso\u201d module in the Assets folder is converted into an ELF module after decryption. The information about malware\u2019s C&C server and other properties is stored in the configuration file. This file is accessed by the malware whenever it has to communicate with the attacker. The stolen data is transferred to a remote server.It boasts of a very simple and straightforward design with a one-directional attack approach. However, the evasion techniques that it adopts are pretty advanced, which makes it difficult for anti-virus software to detect it.Given the singular objective of this Android Trojan, which is to steal data, it becomes apparent that the controllers of malware need to collect sensitive data exchanged during private conversations. This may include images and videos too as such data can be used for extortion.The malware\u2019s distribution method is yet unknown to the researchers. According to Trustlook Labs, the malware was discovered in Cloud Module, a Chinese app, while the package that contained the malware was identified to be com.android.boxa.It is also possible that third-party app stores are responsible for spreading the infectious app. Therefore, it is advised that Android users should avoid downloading third-party apps, scan the device regularly with an anti-malware and keep its operating system updated.More: Android malware HenBox hits Xiaomi devices & minority group in China", "title": "New Android Malware Stealing Data from Popular Messenger Apps"}, {"date": "April 2, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Banking", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "Football", "Fraud", "hacking", "internet", "Italy", "Phishing", "Scam", "security", "Sports"], "body": "An Italian football club Lazio has been scammed as the club sent out an outstanding transfer bill of \u20ac2 million ($2,460,840) to a fraudster\u2019s bank account.

However, according to an independent Swedish security researcher Ulf Frisk, the patch has made security matters even more complicated especially regarding the memory vulnerabilities connected with Intel\u2019s CPU bug Meltdown.Frisk wrote a detailed blog post where he claimed that the January patch from Microsoft \u201cstopped Meltdown but opened up a vulnerability way worse \u2026 It allowed any process to read the complete memory contents at gigabytes per second, oh \u2013 it was possible to write to arbitrary memory as well.\u201dFrisk has created a PoC (proof-of-concept) exploit to demonstrate that the security update is not as reliable as it is touted to be. Meltdown and Spectre have collectively managed to affect almost all modern day computer chips and have turned out to be nightmarish for chip developers. Frisk states that the patches from Microsoft to address Meltdown chip flaw has created much serious vulnerability in Windows 7 OS. This flaw, which has been labeled as Total Meltdown, lets attackers read kernel memory and write their own memory quickly.More: 139 Malware Samples Identified that Exploit Meltdown & Spectre FlawsMoreover, Frisk explains that Microsoft-issued patches can allow attackers access every single user-level computing process that is running on the device. Meltdown can read kernel memory at a rate of 120 kb/s but Total Meltdown lets malicious programs to completely read system memory at a much faster rate (approx. at speeds of gigabytes/s). To worsen the matter, it provides the hacker(s) full write privilege, which was not the case with original Meltdown vulnerability as it was read-only.Frisk believes that the primary cause behind the creation of Total Meltdown is programming oversight in handling memory mirroring mechanism, which gets assigned to virtual memory address when a program runs. Basically, the PML4 page table permission bit was mistakenly set to User while it should be set to Supervisor. Resultantly, memory gets automatically mapped to each and every process that runs at user-level privilege instead of remaining accessible by the kernel only.Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 both share the same Windows kernel version; PML4 is always mapped in virtual memory at 0xFFFFF6FB7DBED000 but this data\u2019s location gets randomized to Windows 10. As the address gets disclosed, it becomes quite easy for attackers to exploit this oversight without using any specific programming trick.Frisk further added that when the read/write access is acquired by the page tables, it may get slightly easy to access full physical memory. It may not be the case if additional protection is ensured with Extended Page Tables for Virtualization.\u201cAll one have to do is to write their own Page Table Entries (PTEs) into the page tables to access arbitrary physical memory,\u201d wrote Frisk in his blog post.Frisk has decided to not link Total Meltdown on any public list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures and wants readers to test it using the exploit kit he has uploaded to GitHub.The vulnerability is found in x86-64 versions Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems whereas the 2018-01 or 2018-02 patches set have this issue. The 2018-03 patch was released to fix these patch sets but only after the oversight was created. Besides, PML is not present in 32-bit versions of MS Windows and hence, these versions remain unaffected while Windows 8 and newer versions are also unaffected as these randomize PML4 location.Frisk states that to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs to gain a foothold in the computing system and when it is achieved, the system can be exploited without using any \u201cfancy exploits.\u201dIt is worth noting that the vulnerability has been identified in 64-bit versions of Windows 7 Services pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 1 (second release). Moreover, the systems that applied the patches issued by Microsoft in January and February are affected and those that used the March patch are safe.More: Microsoft bug bounty program: $250k for reporting Meltdown & Spectre type flawsImage credit: Depositphotos", "title": "Flawed Meltdown patch by Microsoft makes Windows more vulnerable"}, {"date": "March 29, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Boeing", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Ransomware", "Scam", "Technology", "WannaCry"], "body": "The world\u2019s largest aerospace company Boeing has been hit by a malware attack and reportedly it led to the infection of infamous WannaCry ransomware.According to Seattle Times, who broke the news, the impacted department belonged to Boeing\u2019s 777 airliners production plant in North Charleston, S.C. facility.Although Seattle Times is certain that the malware attack caused WannaCry ransomware infection there was no confirmation from Boeing.

According to the findings of Boston-based cyber-security firm Cybereason, one of their newly identified techniques involves using keylogger malware that exploits AutoIT or AutoHotKey (AHK).The malware, dubbed by Cybereason researchers as Fauxpersky, is though not as sophisticated as some of the recently discovered malware but it can efficiently steal passwords from Windows systems. It is spread via infected USB drives. Cybereason researchers Amit Serper and Chris Black wrote in the company\u2019s official blog post published on Wednesday: \u201cThis malware is by no means advanced or even very stealthy. However, this malware is highly efficient at infecting USB drives and exfiltrating data from the keylogger through Google directly to the attacker\u2019s mailbox.\u201dAutoIT or AHk are quite basic tools used to write small programs for performing a variety of GUI and keyboard automation functions on Windows systems. For instance, AHK uses its own scripting language to let users write code to interact with Windows and perform tasks like reading text or sending keystrokes to other applications. It also lets users create a compiled .exe file.More: How a USB could become a security risk for your deviceFauxpersky is capable of impersonating Kaspersky, well-known Russian antivirus software, whereas the keylogger is created by abusing AHK app. The infection is distributed to the system via USB drives and manages to compromise PCs that run Windows by replicating files stored on the device\u2019s listed drives.Moreover, researchers also identified four droppers in the computer\u2019s environment and each one had a dedicated name, which was quite similar to the names of Windows OS files. The names are as follows:\u00b7 Explorers.exe\u00b7 Spoolsvc.exe\u00b7 Svhost.exe\u00b7 Taskhosts.exeThe method used by AHK keylogger is quite straightforward; it spreads through self-propagation technique. After being executed initially, the keylogger starts gathering information about all the listed drives on the computer and begins the replication process. When the core files of the malware start running on the system, whatever the user types on the computer gets stored into a text file bearing the respective window\u2019s name. This way, the attacker gets a better idea of the background context of the text that has been keylogged.This text file\u2019s contents are then exfiltrated from the device via a Google Form. The file then gets deleted from the system while the text file is transferred to the attacker via email. Google was notified of this form by Serper and Black, after which it was taken down in an hour. However, Google did not release any statement explaining who created the form.From the way the malware has been designed, it is evident that the developers did not pay attention to key aspects to make it look authentic such as changing the executable\u2019s icon from that of AHk\u2019s default icon or creating a rather unconvincing splash screen, which is an exact replica of Kaspersky\u2019s screen. However, once the malware is spread onto the system, it remains persistent and gets booted up again after Windows system is restarted. It also creates a shortcut for itself in the startup directory of the Start menu.Currently, it is not clear how many computers have been infected but considering that the malware is distributed through sharing of USB drives, it can be assumed that it hasn\u2019t been spread extensively as yet.If you feel that your computer is also infected, simply access %appdata%\\Roaming\\ and delete the files related to Kaspersky Internet Security 2017\\ directory and the directory itself from the startup directory located in the start menu.More: Watch out for this USB Device Charger, it could be Keystroke Logger: FBIImage credit: Depositphotos", "title": "Fauxpersky Keylogger Malware Stealing Passwords from Windows PCs"}, {"date": "March 29, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Firefox", "internet", "Italy", "LEAKS", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "VPN", "WebRTC"], "body": "Paolo Stagno, an Italian security researcher using the online moniker VoidSec, has revealed a startling new discovery about virtual private networks or VPNs. As per the findings of Stagno, nearly 23% of VPN providers are still leaking IP addresses of users through the VPN flaw dubbed as WebRTC Leak. This means, if you are connected to a VPN, Tor or Socks proxy, it is a possibility that the device\u2019s IP address is being leaked automatically.WebRTC Leak was discovered in 2015. It is believed to be one of the most critical issues that have been identified so far as a user\u2019s real home IP address gets exposed to websites. It is quite unfortunate that such a grave flaw has been ignored by browser makers for so long.WebRTC (RTC = Real-Time Communications) emerged as pretty useful technology but its dark side only got revealed much later. It is a set of APIs used by all main web browsers. However, it believed to be a privacy nightmare now since it can be abused easily. The basic purpose of using WebRTC is to improve the browser\u2019s communicational capabilities, which is important since a variety of communication forms like voice or voice chat are used by websites/services. In all major browsers including Chrome and Firefox, WebRTC is enabled by default and websites or services utilize it without interacting with the user.As far as privacy aspect is concerned, the issue with WebRTC is that browsers can leak the real IP address of the device to any website. Given that permission prompts are not displayed by WebRTC, it is possible that websites access the IP address without the knowledge or consent of the user. There are only a handful of browsers that contain an option of blocking WebRTC IP leaks. For instance, Vivaldi browser provides an option of disabling the broadcasting of real IP address of the device under Settings>Privacy. Firefox users can disable WebRTC completely by accessing about:config through media.peerconnection.enabled and changing the setting to False.It is indeed shocking that 23% of VPN service providers are still falling prey to this flaw but it is also important to note that most of the VPNs tested for this research were Free services. Nearly 16 VPN services were tested and identified to have WebRTC Leak flaw and out of these 16, only 3 to 4 can be labeled as well-known VPN services while the rest were either unknown services or web-browser based proxy add-ons.PureVPN was the most well-known of all the 16 services that were tested. It is worth noting that PureVPN has now fixed the WebRTC flaw after the revelation by VoidSec. Another known service tested for the research was the infamous Hola VPN.The full list of tested VPNs is available here.You can check if a website is benefitting from WebRTC flaw. If you use Chrome or any other Chromium-based browser like Vivaldi or Opera, simply open chrome://webrtc-internals/ in the address bar to view the list of all WebRTC connections. Firefox users should open about:webrtc in browser\u2019s address bar to check the list of WebRTC connections under Sessions Statistics.However, the presence of connections list does not mean that the IP address of the device has been leaked. If you configure your browser to block WebRTC leaks or if the VPN provider\u2019s software blocks WebRTC IP leaks automatically, then your IP address is not exposed.For VPN users, privacy and anonymity is the main requirement, which probably they are not getting and this isn\u2019t the first time that VPNs are identified to be fooling users. A recent study from Best VPN, a VPN comparison platform, revealed that out of 115 most famous VPN services on the web, 26 were found to be deceiving users with false claims. Instead of their claim of not keeping tabs on users or identifying their location or other information, the services were identified to be doing the opposite. The 26 VPNs collected three key log files containing important personal data including IP address, location, connection timestamps and bandwidth data.If the issues in VPNs are not fixed, the market value of these services will be negatively affected for sure. VPN market is an immensely lucrative one as research suggests the worldwide demand for VPN services will reach an all-time high by 2019 with $70 billion in comparison to $45 billion in 2014. It is about time that VPN service providers take notice and make their services completely transparent and reliable.More: More: Facebook Onavo VPN app collects user data even when it\u2019s off", "title": "Popular VPNs Leaking Your Real IP Address Through WebRTC Leak"}, {"date": "March 29, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Android", "APPS", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "Google", "Malware", "Monero", "Play Store", "Scam", "security", "Technology"], "body": "Another day, another Android malware \u2013 This time, the malware not only comes with Monero mining capabilities but its continuous mining process drains the targeted device.The IT security researchers at Trend Micro have discovered a sophisticated Moreno mining malware targeting Android users in the name of fake Google Play update. As of now, its prime targets are users in China and India since third-party apps are popular in both countries.Dubbed HiddenMiner by researchers the malware hides behind a legitimate looking Google Play update app. Once the app is installed it requires users to activate it as a device administrator and displays persistent pop-ups until victims click the Activate button.Upon granting the required permission the malware starts using computer (CPU) power of the targeted device to mine Monero cryptocurrency. According to Trend Micro\u2019s blog post, it has been noted that HiddenMiner continuously mines Monero until the next device boot causing it to overheat and potentially fail.HiddenMiner works similar to Loapi malware that was found a couple of months ago in over 20 third-party Android apps. Loapi also used CPU power of targeted devices to mine Monero cryptocurrency however it also conducted DDoS attacks causing the phone\u2019s battery to the bulge that leads to the destruction of the phone after few days of its installation.As for HiddenMiner, the researchers have noted that on March 26th, 2018 attackers withdrew 26 Monero (XMR) which is around $5219.76. This means HiddenMiner is a profitable malware and actively targeting Android users without their knowledge.Moreover, the reason for HiddenMiner\u2019s successful operation is that the malware is equipped with anti-emulator capabilities, therefore, it bypasses detection and automated analysis. It also uses several techniques to hide itself in devices, such as emptying the app label and using a transparent icon after installation.\u201cIndeed, HiddenMiner is yet another example of how cybercriminals are riding the cryptocurrency mining wave. For users and businesses, this reinforces the importance of practicing mobile security hygiene: download only from official app marketplaces, regularly update the device\u2019s OS (or ask the original equipment manufacturer for their availability), and be more prudent with the permissions you grant to applications,\u201d said Lorin Wu of Trend Micro.", "title": "HiddenMiner Android Monero Mining Malware Cause Device Failure"}, {"date": "March 28, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["app", "Apple", "Bug", "Camera", "internet", "iOS", "iPhone", "Phishing", "QR", "Safari", "security", "Technology"], "body": "Last week it was reported that there were a bunch of malware-infected QR reader apps on Play Store which was downloaded half a million time.

But, in reality, these links take users to Yandex Disk servers, a Russian cloud service offered by Yandex, allowing users to store files on \u201ccloud\u201d servers and share them with others online.Once there, the victim can see several videos containing user comments stating that the file they are about to download is clean and legitimate. However, Dr. Web noticed that all the comments on those videos are fake and posted by cybercriminals using fake profiles.In case the victim is tricked into clicking the link it downloads a self-unpacking RAR archive file containing Trojan.PWS.Stealer.23012. Upon installing the file, it infects Windows computer and steals cookies from web browsers including Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, and others.Furthermore, the malware steals login credentials saved in victim\u2019s web browser and take screenshots of user\u2019s activity on their device.

Contrary to popular belief that law enforcement agencies only recently started using dead person fingerprints for unlocking iPhones, Forbes has reported that this has been going on for years.In its latest report, Forbes confirmed that it is a \u201crelatively common\u201d practice for law enforcement agencies in \u201cNew York and Ohio\u201d to use corpse\u2019s fingerprints to unlock iPhones. The report cites anonymous sources and legal consultant Marina Medvin\u2019s statements to assert that this practice is legal on two grounds.Firstly, deceased people don\u2019t have privacy rights and secondly, individuals who might have sent incriminating information to the deceased cannot claim privacy information over that.According to Bob Moledor, a forensics expert at the FBI, the very first known case in which a dead person\u2019s fingerprints were used by police was in Nov 2016. In that particular case, the police tried to unlock iPhone 5s that belonged to Abdul Razak Ali Artan. Artan went on a stabbing spree using a butcher\u2019s knife after mowing down a group of people inside his car and later got shot by the cops on Ohio State University grounds. But, his \u201clifeless fingerprints\u201d couldn\u2019t unlock the iPhone and the device had to be sent to a forensic lab for unlocking, Moledor told Forbes.\u201cIn the hours between his death and the attempt to unlock, when the feds had to go through legal processes regarding access to the smartphone, the iPhone had gone to sleep and when reopened required a passcode,\u201d Moledor added.An Ohio police homicide detective Robert Cutshall, who was a team member in Artan\u2019s case, stated that the police don\u2019t need a search warrant to search a victim\u2019s phone \u201cunless it\u2019s shared owned.\u201d The technique has been successful in some cases while not much in others due to excessive wastage of time in between. In Artan\u2019s case, seven hours had passed and it became impossible to get the phone out of sleep mode without entering the passcode.Forbes\u2019 report stated that the technique of retrieving data from an iPhone is used primarily in overdose cases where the victim\u2019s phone is believed to have information that directly leads to the dealer. The technique is regarded as completely legitimate despite having certain ethical predicaments to consider. Even the relatives cannot stop cops from using the deceased\u2019s fingerprints or any other body part to access smartphone.Medvin Law firm owner Marina Medvin stated that after being declared dead, a person ceases to have privacy rights on the body. Moreover, when you have shared information with a person, you lose control over the way it will be secured and used. There is no way to assert privacy rights if the phone is searched and the messages are revealed to the law enforcement even if the person is alive.We have to admit though that with ever-evolving smartphone security, one day it will be possible to unlock phones using Face ID and Touch ID would become out-dated. Cloudflare\u2019s research and information security head Marc Rogers told Forbes that since Face ID uses your attention and natural eye movement, therefore, using non-moving eyes of the dead people might not unlock devices.Apple claims that iPhone X\u2019s infrared Face ID tech is much harder to spoof than Touch ID and until today, there hasn\u2019t been any case of cops unlocking someone\u2019s iPhone using Face ID. That\u2019s because the technology requires live gaze from the user to authenticate the owner and unlock the device.However, Rogers pointed out that the technology itself is not much reliable and can easily be fooled using pictures with open eyes. Presumably, cops will soon be able to unlock iPhone X of a deceased person if they cover the body\u2019s closed eyes with a picture showing open eyes.Source: Forbes \u2013 Image credit: Depositphotos", "title": "US Cops Using Dead Suspects\u2019 Fingerprints to Unlock iPhones"}, {"date": "March 27, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Adware", "Android", "Fraud", "Google", "Malware", "Play Store", "Scam", "security", "Technology"], "body": "Another day, another Android malware \u2013 This time the malware spams users with advertisements and web links to generate revenue.The IT security researchers at SophosLabs have discovered a new Android malware in seemingly harmless QR readers apps on Google Play Store.

The vulnerability that is being exploited in this cryptojacking campaign is classified as CVE-2013-2618. The miner is an altered XMRig tool, which is a legitimate, open-source Monero miner.It is basically a flaw that was identified years ago (in April 2013), in Cacti\u2019s Network Weathermap plug-in. This open-source tool is used by network admins to visually evaluate network activity. The malicious new use of the vulnerability was identified by Trend Micro researchers and they claim that this campaign is still active.The key targets of this campaign are publicly accessible x86-64 Linux webservers, while the scope of the attack is not limited to any single destination since webservers across the globe are being targeted. Japan, China, Taiwan and the US are identified as the top targets.According to researchers, this vulnerability is being used by hackers for injecting HTML and JavaScript into the title of the network editor maps. Moreover, the same vulnerability can be utilized for infecting a webserver with malicious PHP code. Patch for this vulnerability has been available for about five years however, even today cybercriminals are able to utilize it for mining cryptocurrency. It is indeed surprising that such an important flaw hasn\u2019t been patched in years despite the availability of the patch.More: Hackers are using YouTube Ads to Mine Monero CryptocurrencyThe exploit is used for initiating a request for viewing the code on the webserver; the vulnerability allows attackers to modify the code to install crypto-miner on the machine. The same procedure is repeated after every three minutes to make sure the server restarts the mining process in case someone shuts down the system.XMRig tool is instructed for performing the actions discreetly so that the attackers evade detection. Hackers even can modify the maximum CPU usage of the mining malware simply by decreasing the percentage of power used to reduce the chances of detection.The wallets being used by the miners have also been identified by the researchers. One of the attackers received 320 Monero (approx. $75,000), claims Trend Micro. It is worth noting that this is just a small proportion of what attackers are actually making through this campaign. Researchers opine that attackers must have mined $3 million in cryptocurrency.To protect your computer from being used as a cryptomining tool, it is a good idea to keep the system patched. Those who run Cacti\u2019s Network Weathermap plug-in must secure their data and keep it away from public servers. In the company\u2019s official blog post, Trend Micro researchers noted:\u201cData from Cacti should be properly kept internal to the environment.

In order to raise awareness, hackers leaked 36 million records of internal data collected from several vulnerable servers.The seriousness of the matter can be understood by the fact that in July of 2015 John Matherly of Shodan, the world\u2019s first search engine for the Internet of Things (IoT devices) revealed that there are over 30,000 unprotected MongoDB databases exposed for public access.However on March 1st, 2018, to determine and measure the depth of attacks against MongoDB, the IT security researchers from German firm Kromtech conducted an experiment in which they purposely left a MongoDB database exposed to the public and kept an eye on the incoming connections.This practice is called as honeypot which is a security mechanism set to detect and counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems.According to Kromtech\u2019s blog post, the honeypot database contained 30GB of fake data. Little did they know, it took only three hours for hackers to identify the database before wiping out its data in just 13 seconds and leaving a ransom note demanding 0.2 Bitcoin.Here it is noteworthy that in January 2017, hackers held several MongoDB databases for ransom and demanded 0.2 Bitcoin in return. It is unclear if the hackers who took over the honeypot database are part of the same group. However, according to Kromtech\u2019s Chief Communication Officer Bob Diachenko, the attack on their database has been traced back to China.The researchers are certain that only an automated script can complete such task within 13 seconds.\u201cThe attacker first connects to our database, then drops the databases to delete them, drops the Journals to erase their tracks, creates a database called Warning with Readme collection and the Solution Record, then drops the Journals again to cover their tracks. This was all completed in just thirteen seconds, leading to the conclusion that this was the work of an automated script,\u201d noted Kromtech researchers.The researchers are advising users to secure their database since exposed MongoDB servers are still at risk.

Perhaps even most employees are unaware of the sort of data they collect from their customers.As data collection and Internet safety are somewhat of a gray area, now that there are new General Data Protection Regulations rolled out in the EU, many businesses are struggling to understand how this new data approach affects their ways of working. What will they need to do to become compliant? How will this benefit their customers? If you are asking this on behalf of your organization, then keep reading.If customer safety is your priority, the first thing you can do is ensure your clientele are fully informed on all aspects of your data collection process. You can do this by hosting full information on your company website, plus use user interface and user experience design to be unambiguous and up-front with how and when data is being collected.When the GDPR launches on May 25th, 2018, customers will have the right to demand access to the data held on them and exercise their \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 (that is, to have all the data currently held on them erased permanently). The more you arm your customers with transparent details on data collection, the safer you\u2019ll enable them to be.In order to effectively comply with the new GDPR \u2014 and keep your customers safe \u2014 it will be your corporate responsibility to understand how the guidelines have changed and why.For instance, in the previous 1998 Data Protection rules, companies could make use of an offshore loophole: processing customer data on a server outside of the EU. Under the GDPR, this practice is illegal. The definition of \u2018personal data\u2019 is also to be updated under the GDPR. Previously, information such as name, email address and phone number were clearly defined as personal data, yet now behavioral and demographic profile and IP addresses will also fall into this category. Therefore, if you are in the habit of collecting this information, you\u2019ll need to inform your customers you are doing so. You can find further information on the changing definitions under GDPR by studying Sage\u2019s guide on the changes to be imposed and how to avoid costly penalties.The new GDPR aims to respect individuals\u2019 rights and increase their confidence in online operations; currently, 60% of Europeans do not trust online businesses.Moving forward, you\u2019ll need to have the technology in place to enable you to respond quickly if clientele exercises their new data rights. As mentioned, they\u2019ll have the right to \u2018be forgotten\u2019 and the right to have revealed to them all the data currently being held in their name.Failure to be able to remove or share this information will be in direct noncompliance with the GDPR. Noncompliance can bring heavy financial penalties and compensation claims, but it will also erode your customers\u2019 trust in your service \u2014 which could create even longer-lasting damage.Customer safety should always be a concern, but in the lead up to the GDPR launch, it should be of utmost importance in your internal innovations. Do not delay in reworking your data collection, storage, and usage.

It is the first time a full suite of tools has been developed and extensively used for conducting fraud.Kaspersky Lab researchers revealed that Prilex malware has remained active since 2014; its original function was to modify malware with exclusive features of infecting point-of-service (POS) terminals and obtaining card data. This means it is possible to modify POS software and let third-parties capture the transmitted data via the bank terminal. That is, when a customer pays for his card at an infected POS terminal, the data will automatically get transferred to the cybercriminals.Now, the Brazil-based Prilex group has developed infrastructure that creates cards clones. It was quite easy for the firm since in Brazil there is the faulty implementation of EMV [PDF] standard and therefore, all the data that goes through the approval process remains unverified. It is also worth noting that these cloned cards are compatible with almost all POS systems in Brazil.Kaspersky Lab researchers identified that Prilex\u2019s infrastructure includes a Java applet and a client application titled Daphne that writes data on smart cards and assesses the amount that can be extracted. Moreover, Prilex also includes databases with card numbers. The information is sold as a package in Brazil.Usually, when the chip is inserted into a POS terminal, four steps are required for chip-and-pin cards to work namely initialization, data authentication, cardholder verification, and transaction. Among these four, only the first and last steps are necessary while the other two can be skipped. When using the cloned cards, which have been created with dedicated Java application, the POS terminal gets the signal that data authentication is not required and the terminal should not look for the cryptographic keys of the card.More: Crooks Stealing Data From ATMs Using Infrared More: Jackpotting attacks hit U.S. ATMs; spit out cash in seconds More: Watch Security Researcher As She Hacks ATM by Drilling a HoleAlthough the EMV standard has an option to enable card validation by checking the PIN cyber-crooks\u2019 app can validate almost any entered PIN.

There is high demand for this information on the black market, and Prilex users sell the data to their underground clients using Daphne.\u201cThe new card, which is connected to the smart card writer, will receive the new information via GPShell scripts in charge of setting up the card\u2019s structure and creating the \u2018golden card\u2019 that works on any POS machine.\u201d\u201cSince [cybercriminals] cannot manipulate all the information of the \u2018chip and PIN\u2019 technical standard, they need to modify the application responsible for validating the transaction,\u201d Kaspersky blog post explained.Image credit: Shutterstock", "title": "Prilex ATM Malware Modified to Clone Chip-and-Pin Payment Cards"}, {"date": "March 17, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Cryptocurrency", "Cryptojacking", "Cryptominer", "Cryptomining", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "Malware", "Monero", "Scam", "Scarlett Johansson", "security"], "body": "Security researchers have identified a new but unusually distributed Monero cryptominer scam campaign involving the face of a popular celebrity.The IT security researchers at Imperva have discovered a campaign in which hackers have compromised PostgreSQL servers to install cryptocurrency mining malware.The malware is hidden in a picture of well-known Hollywood starlet Scarlett Johansson. The crypto-miner aims to mine Monero cryptocoins.PostgreSQL is a commonly used open source database, which researchers deem more sophisticated than MySQL. The malware was discovered in a honeypot, which was part of the StickyDB honeypot project from Imperva.It is worth noting that a honeypot is basically a computer but in this case, it was a database server that is configured deliberately to lure hackers. It is just like bait for hackers as they regard it as an easily exploitable database but it is actually a hatch.Imperva researchers used the database to understand common database attacks, and tools and methods used by hackers as well as to learn how they obtain access and what they do after compromising a database. They were following standard information gathering steps when they identified an unusual incident.Attackers had downloaded an image from a legit file hosting website. The file was a picture of Scarlett Johansson. When probed further, they learned that the file contained a hidden binary payload.Researcher left the database intentionally exposed. Considering that there are nearly 710,000 PostgreSQL servers that can be accessed easily from the internet, this is not a very reliable practice though and can allow attacks to launch brute-force attacksFurthermore, Imperva researchers observed that the attackers have used an advanced or modified Metasploit module to initiate interaction with PostgreSQL so as to execute shell commands on the server.The modifications in the module were made to evade detection by the database audit monitoring/DAM solutions. DAM solutions are responsible for monitoring privileged operations attempts such as Io_export function calls.Researchers noted that once the attacker gains the ability to execute system commands, a certain type of reconnaissance is performed to determine the CPU and GPU of the server for devising the perfect plan to mine cryptocurrency on a particular device. Linux dd command is used to extract, set-up and execute the binary code and all is done via SQL operations.Lastly, a Monero mining program is installed on the device. The hackers\u2019 wallet address shows that 312 Monero coins have been collected so far with an approximate value of $90,000. This means attackers have compromised multiple servers.But why attackers used a celebrity\u2019s picture to embed the malware? Researchers believe that this was done to deceive security products since the technique of appending binary code to authentic image files or documents can mutate the file and it can bypass a majority of anti-virus software.When the picture was scanned at the VirusTotal service, just three anti-virus programs detected the file as malicious.

Although the gravity of damage has been controlled considerably still there is room for mitigation. Perhaps that\u2019s the reason why Microsoft has decided to roll out new bug bounty program which will focus on discovering speculative execution side channel flaws.For your information, Speculative Execution Side Channels refer to hardware vulnerability class that can lay a significant impact on CPU from not anyone but multiple manufacturers.This bug bounty program is a short-term one that will remain open until December 31. Microsoft is offering a staggering $250,000 as reward sum for discovering new categories of attacks specifically speculative execution attacks that are currently undisclosed.\u201cIn recognition of that threat environment change, we are launching a bounty program to encourage research into the new class of vulnerability and the mitigations Microsoft has put in place to help mitigate this class of issues,\u201d stated Microsoft principal security group manager, Phillip Misner.These vulnerabilities came into the limelight earlier in January 2018 and it was also identified that three variants of Spectre and Meltdown are present. These can potentially allow hackers to hijack users\u2019 data. Moreover, processors from a variety of manufacturers including the bigwigs Intel, AMD, and ARM could be impacted by these security flaws. Microsoft has already prepared software and firmware updates to deal with the issue and secure its devices that have these processors installed.Microsoft believes that Meltdown and Spectre are just two of the many security bugs and therefore, simply mitigating these two flaws won\u2019t solve the issue completely and we need to find other bugs.\u201cThis bounty program is intended as a way to foster that research and the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities related to these issues,\u201d revealed Misner in a post.Microsoft is also planning to take its competitors and tech community in confidence and disclose the findings of the bug bounty program to the affected parties. That\u2019s because the reason for initiating the program is not to gain an edge over its competitors but to allow safe and secure Windows experience to users. As Misner noted:\u201cSpeculative execution side channel vulnerabilities require an industry response. To that end, Microsoft will share, under the principles of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, the research disclosed to us under this program so that affected parties can collaborate on solutions to these vulnerabilities. Together with security researchers, we can build a more secure environment for customers.\u201dBug bounty program will be having four tiers. Microsoft is offering $200,000 for tier 2 discoveries, which involve speculative execution mitigation bypasses for Azure while tier 3 involves same vulnerabilities but for Windows. Tier 4 will deal with identification of new exploits for already known vulnerabilities and the award money would be $25,000. Tier 1 deals with serious Hyper-V flaws in Windows 10 and the successful hacker will be receiving $250,000 in reward.It is worth noting that Microsoft\u2019s bug bounty program has been launched at a time when Intel is gearing up to make important CPU changes by redesigning its processors and ensure protection against serious attacks like Spectre. Furthermore, Intel will be introducing next-gen Xeon processors (Cascade Lake) that will be loaded with advanced hardware protection features along with 8th generation Intel Core processors. Firmware updates are expected to provide protection to existing CPUs.Remember, last month researchers identified 139 malware samples exploiting Meltdown & Spectre flaws which means cyber criminals are already gearing up to target unsuspecting users.

Reportedly, the malware dubbed as RottenSys has managed to create a massive army of botnets comprising of 5 million mobile devices from across the globe.The malware is hidden in a System Wi-Fi service application that is already installed-by-default on countless models of smartphones manufactured by prominent companies including Honor, Huawei, GIONEE, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi.According to the blog post, Researchers believe that these firms cannot be held directly responsible for the malware and the devices must have been infected during supply chain phase. Probably the distribution firm or a rogue employee is to be blamed for the installation of malware.It is worth noting that the affected devices were shipped through the same Hangzhou, China-based mobile devices distributor Tian Pai. However, the researchers are not yet sure if this particular firm has any direct involvement in the installation of RottenSys malware.Check Point researchers claim that RottenSys is a highly sophisticated and advanced program that acquires almost all sensitive permissions on an Android mobile phone to perform its malicious acts. Such as it asks for silent download permission (DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION permission), accessibility service permission and user calendar read access privilege. The campaign started in September 2016 and until March 12, 2018, it has infected 4,964,460 devices.The fake Wi-Fi service app manages to evade detection by employing a submissive approach in the beginning and doesn\u2019t instantly start its malicious tasks. Later, the malware dropper component communicates with its C&C server to receive a list of components it needs. The required component is actually the malicious code. The malware is capable of assembling an army of botnets and within only ten days attackers have made profits of approx. $115,000.\u201cRottenSys is an extremely aggressive ad network. In the past 10 days alone, it popped aggressive ads 13,250,756 times, and 548,822 of which were translated into ad clicks,\u201d read the blog post from Check Point.Originally the malware was used to display fraudulent ads on mobile devices\u2019 home screen. Check Point researchers claim that since the onset of 2018, malicious threat actors have been trying to improve the malware code by adding a new module and created brand new malware campaign using the same C&C server. This campaign has remained active from February 2018.\u201cThe attackers plan to leverage Tencent\u2019s Tinker application virtualization framework as a dropper mechanism. The payload which will be distributed can turn the victim device into a slave in a larger botnet,\u201d read the blog post from Check Point.The botnet can perform a variety of tasks such as installing additional apps discreetly, automating the UI. Researchers identified that a part of the botnet\u2019s controlling mechanism is implemented in Lua scripts. The attacker can thus, re-use the existing malware distribution channel without any intervention and gain control of millions of devices.Users can easily uninstall RottenSys dropper if only they are aware of the exact package name that is to be deleted.

Probably you haven\u2019t because not many are familiar with this name but you must be familiar with the brand name Limog\u00e9s Jewelry. Limog\u00e9s Jewelry is actually the jewelry brand of the Chicago, Il, based MBM Company Inc. The company sells jewelry for children men and women including pendants, earrings, necklaces, watches, engagement rings, and wedding rings.MBM Company is an established name in the industry but currently, it is in news for all the wrong reasons. Reportedly, Germany-based security firm Kromtech Security researchers have discovered an unsecured Amazon S3 storage bucket containing an MSSQL database backup file. Kromtech\u2019s security research team believes that MBM Company has been careless in handling customer data.Initially, researchers suspected that the data was the property of Walmart because the storage bucket was named \u2018walmartsql\u2019 but later, after thoroughly analyzing the file, they came to the conclusion that it belonged to MBM Company Inc. They also identified that data from a number of retailers including Walmart was part of the database.Kromtech Security\u2019s head of communications Bob Diachenko revealed that when the discovered file was further assessed, it was learned that it contained private and sensitive data belonging to more than 1.3 million people (1,314,193 to be precise). The data included sensitive personal information like residential addresses, e-mail IDs, IP addresses and zip-codes along with plaintext passwords of such a massive number of people. That\u2019s not all; the file also contains internal mailing lists, item orders, and promo codes. Diachenko referred to this as \u201cgreat negligence\u201d on part of MBM Company Inc.\u201cPasswords were stored in the plain text, which is great negligence [sic], taking into account the problem with many users re-using passwords for multiple accounts, including email accounts,\u201d a statement from Diachenko read.The discovered backup file was titled \u2018MBMWEB_backup_2018_01_13_003008_2864410.bak;\u2019 researchers have confirmed that it was created on January 13, 2018. The database contains information about the company\u2019s customers within the US and Canada and the file contain updated information, which means the data is current. Customer records from the year 2000 are also part of the database whereas most recent records are from early 2018. Experts are of the opinion that this might be the primary database used by MBM Company.Diachenko claims that considering the severity of this incident, it can be termed as a serious issue. Various factors cumulatively hint upon the fact that MBM Company adopted insufficient security practices. Such as, the bucket name was quite \u201ceasy-to-guess\u201d and had a common suffix\u2019 S3 domain name, which anyone could have identified using one of the countless scanning tools available on the internet.Furthermore, the presence of plaintext passwords is also an issue of \u201cgreat concern,\u201d stated Diachenko as mostly users re-use the same passwords for accessing multiple accounts including email.Currently, it is not clear if the database has been accessed by any malicious third-party since researchers did not observe ransom notes. Previously when MongoDB databases were exposed, ransom notes appeared on a regular basis, but this is not the case in this incident. But, solely on this basis, it is difficult to claim that nobody has accessed the database, said Diachenko.Insecure Amazon S3 buckets have already victimized a number of mainstream firms despite that it is fairly easy to properly authenticate the bucket. MBM Company isn\u2019t the first one to have failed to protect customer database but FedEx, Alteryx, City of Chicago and RNC contractor Deep Root all have been affected due to their lackluster security measures.Security experts opine that prior to using this technology, companies must familiarize themselves with the basics of security. That\u2019s because having a storage bucket that is exposed to public access while containing such sensitive personal data as email IDs and passwords after so many incidents involving Amazon S3 buckets is downright negligence. It is also very careless of MBM Company to store private data of customers directly on a storage bucket with passwords in plain text format without encryption.Diachenko recommends that firms must store passwords in encrypted form and force customers to keep complex passwords with at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one symbol, and one numeric digit and password should be up to 12 characters long.Kromtech Security researchers notified Walmart about the publicly available Amazon S3 bucket and the retail giant immediately secured the bucket. As of now, MBM Company hasn\u2019t released any statement.Lately, there have been a number of incidents in which millions of customers had their personal and sensitive data exposed due to public unsecured Amazon S3 buckets.

You can be under government surveillance or malicious organizations, hackers can track your IP address and identify your ISP or on a business level, it can allow attackers to carry distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.According to VPN Mentor\u2019s blog post, in order to find vulnerabilities in HotSpot Shield, PureVPN, and Zenmate VPN Mentor hired three ethical hackers who after testing concluded all three VPN have been leaking IP address of the user, even when a VPN is in use posing a massive privacy threat.Out of three hackers, one has decided to keep their identity hidden while one going by the online handle of File Descriptor while the other Paulos Yibelo. Here it must be noted that the vulnerabilities exist in the Chrome browser plugins for all three VPNs and not in the desktop or smartphone apps.According to the findings, AnchorFree\u2019s HotSpot Shield was filled with three vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability (CVE-2018-7879) allowed remote attackers to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code.The second and third vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-7878 & CVE-2018-7880) leaked IP and DNS addresses which as discussed above poses a privacy threat to users since hackers can track user location and the ISP.HotSpot Shield was quick to respond to VPN Mentor regarding the vulnerabilities and patched all vulnerabilities professionally and timely protecting millions of its users from what could be a serious threat if exploited.\u201cThe fast response of Hotspot Shield is something we think is worth commending. We felt that they worked with our research team in a fast and serious manner and that they care for their users. They took our research as help for improvement rather than criticism,\u201d said the co-founder of vpnMentor Mr. Ariel Hochstadt.It is a good news for Hotspot Shield users as last year the VPN vendor was in the news for violating user privacy by intercepting web traffic, keeping activity logs and redirecting it to third-party websites especially advertising companies.In PureVPN and Zenmate, researchers also found that loopholes similar to Hotspot Shield may leak user sites and IP addresses. However, because they did not receive a response from both manufacturers, they did not specify the loopholes of both, but they appealed for two products. The user pays attention and confirms with the manufacturer.HackRead has also contacted PureVPN and Zenmate. This article will be updated in case the vendors decided to reply.Both PureVPN and Zenmate have replied to our emails. According to PureVPN\u2019s outreach manager Fahad Ali \u201cThe Firefox browser, by default, has an inherent limitation where it makes it almost impossible to identify and differentiate remote and local hosts. Our intention was to allow users the freedom to access all local domains conveniently while using our extension.\u201d\u201cThe tests that were carried out were not on PureVPN\u2019s latest Firefox extension build since it has already been patched. The Firefox store clearly shows that our extension was last updated on March 07, 2018, and this update included the fix for the above-mentioned issue.\u201dZenMate\u2019s CTO J\u00f6rn Stampehl replied to our email and said that the company is aware of the situation.\u201cWe are aware of that situation since Google introduced WebRTC in its Chrome browser and of the fact that there are possible privacy implications of WebRTC as they are generic to every VPN and not only affecting ZenMateusers. \u201c\u201cWe appreciate the work from vpnMentor in pointing out potential problems as the security and privacy of our users are very important to us and we put a lot of effort in to protect that. In fact, we are one of the very few commercial VPN companies operating under very strict German privacy laws and do not track, log or sell the data of our users, as opposed to many other companies in this field,\u201d J\u00f6rn saidTo solve the issue, ZenMate is urging its users on Chrome to install the extension \u2018WebRTC Network Limiter.\u2019 Moreover, the company has also published a support article addressing the issue in depth which can be accessed here.", "title": "HotSpot Shield, PureVPN & ZenMate found leaking users real IP addresses"}, {"date": "March 14, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Android", "China", "Google", "Google Play", "HenBox", "Islam", "Malware", "Muslims", "security", "Spying", "Technology", "Terrorism", "VPN", "Xiaomi"], "body": "The IT security researchers at Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42 have identified an Android malware that has been dubbed as HenBox. The name HenBox has been chosen due to the metadata discovered in a majority of the infected apps including package name and signer information.This malware is distributed with different types of legitimate Android apps such as Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other Android system-related apps. Users believe that they are installing authentic Android apps but in reality, the HenBox malware is being downloaded.Some legitimate apps that contain HenBox are available on Google Play as well but most of them are uploaded to unauthentic, third-party app stores. The malware is suspected to target those with association with terrorist groups.In a blog post published on March 13th, Palo Alto Networks revealed that HenBox\u2019s primary targets are users in China particularly the Uyghurs, which is a minority, Turkic ethnic Muslim group. The malware is discovered to be containing information that is of interest to the Uyghurs. This community is located in the North West China\u2019s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and smartphones are the primary source of internet access in this area, which is why it has a vast population of mobile users.HenBox also targets devices manufactured by the renowned China-based mobile manufacturer Xiaomi and the devices that run on MIUI, a Google Android-based operating system developed by Xiaomi. Moreover, the malware is capable of gathering outgoing phone numbers that contain the prefix \u201c86\u201d. This happens to be the country code for the People\u2019s Republic of China.The malware can also access microphone and camera of a device and attempts to steal private data as well as device information by using device sources of information like social media apps and mainstream chat. It also installs authentic versions of apps to deceive users into believing that they have downloaded legitimate apps. HenBox is also linked to the malicious DroidVPN app while researchers observed that over half of the malware-laden apps contain embedded APK objects, which are not usually part of authentic apps.There is also evidence that HenBox\u2019s infrastructure has already been used in other politically-triggered attacks in South East Asia and in PlugX, 9002, Zupdax and Poison Ivy attacks from 2015. Over 200 samples of HenBox malware have so far been discovered by Unit 42.A majority of the samples were active from mid to late 2017 and only a handful of these samples were observed in 2015 and 2016. In 2018, the number of samples has remained small but there is definitely a consistency in attacks, which hints at the presence of a slowly but gradually gearing up to the campaign. The app has considerably improved in the past three years as it now contains various native libraries and components that help it in achieving its malicious objectives. \u201cMost components are obfuscated in some way, whether it be simple XOR with a single-byte key, or through the use of ZIP or Zlib compression wrapped with RC4 encryption. These components are responsible for a myriad of functions including handling decryption, network communications, gaining super-user privileges, monitoring system logs, loading additional Dalvik code files, tracking the device location and more,\u201d the blog post readsTo prevent infection, researchers suggest that apps must be updated timely and app permissions should be reviewed to check the capabilities of the app. Furthermore, it is important to not download apps from third-party app stores to avoid installation of pirated and infected versions. Users must always stick to trusted sources like Google Play Store for downloading apps.", "title": "Android malware HenBox hits Xiaomi devices & minority group in China"}, {"date": "March 14, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Adwords", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "Fraud", "ICO", "Monero", "Phishing", "Scam", "security", "Technology"], "body": "Google will ban all advertisements promoting cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) from June 2018. This means after the social media giant Facebook, Google is the second technology giant to put a lid on the promotion of anything related to the cryptocurrency business.Google earlier today stated that advertisements and promotions related to cryptocurrency wallets, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency, and trading advice will not be allowed. For instance, by typing Ethereum or Bitcoin on Google, users can see Google Adwords slots advertising regarding buying, selling trading and investing in cryptocurrencies.From June this year, these ads will no longer be available.Other than this, Google also plans to ban promoting Contracts for Difference (CFD), Rolling spot forex, Financial spread betting and Binary options and synonymous products. If advertisers want to offer the aforementioned services they will have to be certified by Google before they can advertise through AdWords. The certification, however, is limited to certain countries.Currently, despite the ban, advertisers on Facebook are tricking the site into promoting cryptocurrencies by using numbers in the promotion such as for Bitcoin the advertisers are using Bitc0in where the digit \u201co\u201d is replaced with \u201cO\u201d (zero). The same goes for Monero and other cryptocurrencies.Google, on the other hand, vows not to be tricked and provide users with smooth ads experience. \u201cImproving the ads experience across the web, whether that\u2019s removing harmful ads or intrusive ads, will continue to be a top priority for us,\u201d said Google\u2019s Director of Sustainable Ads Scott Spencer.While the new policy will work in both positive and negative ways it will definitely put an end to the fast-growing cryptocurrency scams in which scammers bought top ads slots on Google search engine through Google Adwords to offer better cryptocurrency prices but in reality, the advertisements redirected users to phishing sites, stole their login credentials and emptied their online wallets.One of their victims were users and investors at Blockchain.info where hackers stole $50 million in Bitcoin after buying Adwords slot on Google for a fake domain Block-clain.info.According to Wall Street Journal, Google banned over 130 million ads used by hackers and cybercriminals for cryptojacking, a technique used to mine cryptocurrency.Nevertheless, the new development is already impacting the price of Bitcoin which at the time of publishing this article dropped from $9,300 to $8,665.

Now the same group has allegedly stolen information about UK\u2019s military technology by compromising computer of a UK government contractor and launching a malware-based attack.As per the findings of NCC Group, the Chinese linked APT15 (also known as Ke3chang, Vixen Pands, Mirage, Playful Dragon and GREF) hacker group has been eyeing data related to military technology and governmental departments of the UK. In this particular attack, APT15 used new backdoors while the targets were contractors working with different military units and government departments in the UK.The findings were presented by NCC Group\u2019s senior malware researcher Ahmed Zaki at Kaspersky\u2019s Security Analyst Summit (SAS). In an official blog post, NCC Group explained that on May 2-17, the Incident Response Team at NCC Group were called-in by a contractor who provided a wide range of services to the UK government and the team was requested to respond to a then on-going incident.The blog stated that the client informed about becoming a victim of a network compromise that involved \u201cadvanced persistent threat group APT15.\u201d The investigation was stopped in June 2017 on the request of the same client and then it was resumed in August once again when APT15 hackers again accessed victim\u2019s network.\u201cAPT15 managed to regain access a couple of weeks later via the corporate VPN solution with a stolen VPN certificate, which they had extracted from a compromised host,\u201d the blog post read.It seems like this attack is not an individual attempt but actually part of a bigger, wider operation that is aimed at UK government and military contractors. The hacker group is believed to be using two new backdoors along with malware that already has imprints of APT15. Researchers wrote in their blog post:\u201cDuring our analysis of the compromise, we identified new backdoors that now appear to be part of APT15\u2019s toolset. The backdoor BS2005 \u2013 which has traditionally been used by the group \u2013 now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS. The RoyalCli backdoor appears to be an evolution of BS2005 and uses familiar encryption and encoding routines.\u201dRoyalCLI was tracked through a debugging path that was left in the binary and happens to be a successor of BS2005 backdoor that was also used by APT15 in one of its previous malicious campaigns. RoyalCLI and BS2005 use Internet Explorer via the COM interface IWebBrowser2 to communicate with their C&C server.The second backdoor RoyalDNS utilizes DNS to create a link with its C&C server. When the command is executed, the backdoor returned output via the same DNS. The domain and IP address infrastructure analysis showed various domains that quite possibly were used by APT15 and hosted on Google Cloud and/or Linode.\u201cAll of the backdoors identified \u2013 excluding RoyalDNS \u2013 required APT15 to create batch scripts in order to install its persistence mechanism. This was achieved through the use of a simple Windows run key.Additional tools were recovered during the incident, including a network scanning/enumeration tool, the archiving tool WinRAR and a bespoke Microsoft SharePoint enumeration and data dumping tool, known as \u2018spwebmember\u2019.\u201d researchers explained.After the NCC Group discovered the attack, APT15 did not give up on attacking and again accessed the system via the corporate virtual private network by using a stolen certificate extracted from an already compromised host.\u201cThis time, APT15 opted for a DNS based backdoor: RoyalDNS. The persistence mechanism used by RoyalDNS was achieved through a service called \u2018Nwsapagent\u2019,\u201d while the C&C server of this backdoor used the TXT record of the DNS protocol and the server contacted with \u2018andspurs[.]com\u2019 domain, the blog revealed.Researchers were able to cache a number of C2 commands to the disk due to the IE injection technique that HTTP-based backdoors use. The files were recovered and reverse engineered by the researchers using the encoding routine that backdoors use to accurately uncover the commands executed by the attacker.They recovered over 200 commands in total, which were executed by the attackers against compromised hosts. This is how they were able to understand the attackers\u2019 TTPs. Decoded scripts have also been uploaded to NCC Group\u2019s Github page.", "title": "APT15 Hackers Hit UK Govt Contractor to Steal Military Technology Secrets"}, {"date": "March 13, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["AirGap", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Microphone", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "body": "A research team from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev \u2018s cybersecurity research center has discovered a new way of data extraction from air-gapped computers via using passive devices like earbuds, earphones, headphones, and speakers.Now, the same research center has claimed to be able to use computer speakers and headphones to act as microphones and receive data. The devices can be used to send back the signals and make the otherwise safe practice of air-gapping less secure.As per the new technique [PDF], data is extracted in the form of inaudible ultrasonic sound waves and transmission occurs between two computers installed in the same room while data is shared without using microphones.The research team created a custom protocol to carry out data transmission between two computers. One of them would be air-gapped while the other is connected to the internet and used to further relay the data. Through the attack, researchers claim to carry out speaker-to-headphone, headphone-to-headphone, and speaker-to-speaker data exfiltration.Findings of this research were published by ArXiv on Friday in an academic paper titled \u201cMOSQUITO: Covert Ultrasonic Transmissions between Two Air-Gapped Computers using Speaker-to-Speaker Communication.\u201d Researchers explained that their research shows how speakers can secretly be used to carry out data transmission between unconnected computers located within a distance of 9 meters.The reason why they used speakers is that these can be considered microphones working in reverse order; speakers convert electronic signals into acoustic signals whereas microphones convert acoustic signals into electric. The conversion is assisted by a diaphragm in each of these devices, which can be used to reverse the process. This process of reversing the mechanism of a device like a speaker is called jack retasking.A majority of new audio chipsets can be used for jack retasking (like those from Realtek) because these offer an option of altering the audio port function through software. Malware can be used to reconfigure a speaker or headphone so that it acts like a microphone given that the device is unpowered and passive. The paper reads:\u201cThe fact that loudspeakers, headphones, earphones, and earbuds are physically built like microphones, coupled with the fact that an audio port\u2019s role in the PC can be altered programmatically, changing it from output to input, creates a vulnerability which can be abused by attackers.\u201dIn the MOSQUITO attack, the malware researchers used infected an air-gapped computer and could also be used to modulate or transform locally stored documents into audio signals. These signals could easily be relayed to another computer using headphones, earbuds or speakers.The receiving computer would also be infected with malware and will convert connected speakers or headphones using jack retasking technique to make them serve as a microphone. The catch is that most of the PCs now have passive speakers while these have active, powered headphones, earbuds, and speakers.\u201cThe main problem involves headphones, earphones, and earbuds since they are reversible and can become a good pair of microphones (even when they don\u2019t have an integrated mic at all),\u201d stated head of R&D at Ben-Gurion University\u2019s research center and co-author of the paper Mordechai Guri.Researchers could achieve data transmission successfully at the rate of 166 bit/sec using frequencies ranging between 18 to 24 kHz. There was just 1% error rate when data was transmitted to a 1kb binary file within the distance of 3meters. If the distance is increased to up to 9 meters, a 10 bit/sec transmission rate was achieved with the same error rate.Authors also provided various mitigation techniques but admitted that all had their limitations. These techniques included designing speakers and headphones equipped with onboard amplifiers to prevent their use as a microphone.Alternately, an ultrasonic jammer can be used and ultrasonic transmissions can be scanned. The software can be developed for preventing jack retasking and using UEFI/BIOS to fully disable audio hardware. Although there is another more practical solution for disconnecting the headphones or speakers it is not a very feasible method. While Guri believes that monitoring ultrasonic band is a much more practical and reliable solution but when applied, it is bound to raise false alarms.At the moment, the attack method is being further assessed and is only in its experimental stages. But, there is every potential that it could be used in the wild at some point in the future. Remember, Ben-Gurion University is home to some creative hacks that led to data extraction such as the USBee hack, AirHopper, and BitWhisper, etc.Image credit: DepositPhotos", "title": "Hackers can steal data from Air-Gapped PCs with microphones & speakers"}, {"date": "March 12, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "dark web", "Facebook", "hacking", "internet", "Phishing", "Privacy", "security", "Social Media", "twitter", "VPN"], "body": "Your Entire Identity Is Up for Sale at the Dark Web \u2013 Startling Revelations by UK\u2019s top VPN Comparison Service.Cybercriminals have now come up with another way of exploiting unsuspecting users\u2019 identity. Having multiple accounts online is a common practice as we use all sorts of services from carrying out transactions on PayPal to social networking through Facebook and buying groceries from Walmart. But what if all of your accounts could be hacked and sold to fraudsters? Of course, your entire identity on the web will be hijacked. That\u2019s actually what cybercrooks are now planning to do.According to the findings of a team of security experts from the UK-based Virtual Private Network comparison service Top10VPN, fraudsters on Dark Web are now after all your accounts on the web. Reportedly, malicious cybercriminals operating on the Dark Web can buy someone\u2019s entire identity (which cybercrooks refer to as Fullz) for as low as \u00a3820. The startling revelations were made in the first ever Dark Web Market Price Index by Top10VPN.Security experts analyzed tens of thousands of ID lists uploaded between 5-11 February 2018 on three mainstream markets on the Dark Web namely Wall Street Market, Dream, and Point. As per their findings, a person\u2019s bank details can be acquired for around \u00a3168 while PayPal logins can fetch nearly \u00a3280. Passport details can be obtained for just \u00a340 and details of online shopping accounts on platforms like Amazon, Walmart and Tesco are available for \u00a35.All kinds of login credentials are in demand from Match.com login IDs to Airbnb profiles, social media accounts like on Facebook or Twitter, Netflix accounts and even eBay and Deliveroo credentials. Almost every type of account can be hacked and sold on the Dark Web.The reason why these hacked IDs are so in demand is that cybercriminals are able to carry out identity theft by using these credentials as a backdoor for less than a fiver. eBay accounts are lucrative from fraudsters\u2019 perspective because of the broad scope of the fraud that they can conduct at a meager cost of \u00a326.PayPal accounts, however, are amongst the most extensively traded items whereas Twitter and Instagram accounts are least valued items despite that these prove to be a handy backdoor to cybercriminals.Moreover, login IDs on communication services like Skype are available for an extremely low rate of \u00a310 although these are quite useful for cybercrooks as they can send links to phishing websites. Match.com logins fetch around \u00a32.24 only; hackers use them to catfish prospective matches and create relationships for personal monetary gains by manipulating innocent members on the site.According to the head of research at Top10VPN, Simon Migliano: \u201cOur research is a stark reminder of just how easy it is to get hold of personal info on the dark web and the sheer variety of routes that fraudsters can take to get hold of your money. This really underlines the importance of two-factor authentication and more generally the secure use of websites and apps.\u201dIt was not clarified by the researchers whether personal identity information prices are going up or down on the Dark Web but security experts are observing a plunging trend. McAfee\u2019s chief scientist Raj Samani states:\u201cIt seems like the prices are a little lower than when we wrote our paper in 2015. However, there are certainly more services on offer than before. Validity rates are not included so like-for-like comparisons are challenging.\u201dExperts are concerned about the low rates of this sort of vital information as such valuable personal data is so easily and readily available in such low rates that anyone can buy them and carry out a variety of malicious attacks.", "title": "Life is cheap!

Moreover, Citizen Lab, run by the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs, stated that they identified Sandvine PacketLogic devices and Deep Packet Inspection technology installed in T\u00fcrk Telecom and Telecom Egypt networks for injecting browser-based Coinhive Monero cryptomining scripts into web traffic and for ensuring political censorship.The research group noted that not only governments of the identified countries but also agencies and ISPs are benefitting from Sandvine\u2019s technology to intercept and change web traffic. It must be noted that Deep Packet Inspection technology allows ISPs to prioritize, block, inject, degrade and log different types of internet traffic and assess every packet to keep track of online activities of users.Perhaps, this is why internet users in Egypt, Turkey, and Syria were redirected to nation-wide distributed spyware when they attempted to download authentic Windows applications. This was made possible by the deep packet inspection boxes that are installed at telecom networks across Turkey and Egypt. Researchers wrote in their report, published on Friday, that this discovery raises \u201csignificant human rights concerns.\u201dThe Windows applications users in Egypt, Turkey, and Syria tried to download from CBS Interactive\u2019s Download.com included Avast Antivirus, 7-Zip, Opera and CCleaner. They attempted to download these applications from official vendor websites but were diverted to malware-infected versions of the applications via HTTP redirects.Researchers believe that this redirection became possible because despite supporting HTTPS, the official websites for these programs by-default directed users to non-HTTP downloads. The malware is said to be quite similar to FinFisher and StrongPity spyware. Apparently, Download.com does not support HTTPS despite its claims of offering secure downloads.When contacted, CBS Interactive\u2019s CNET did not respond, nor released an official statement.The scheme for which Sandvine boxes have been employed is dubbed as AdHose as it involves the distribution of affiliate ads and/or browser crypto-mining scripts.

The identified vulnerability was revealed by IOActive Labs at Kaspersky Labs\u2019 Security Analyst Summit. The firm also stated that it informed Softbank regarding the flaw in January 2017 however, the robot manufacturer is yet to patch the vulnerability.In a research paper titled \u201cRobots Want Bitcoins Too!\u201d IOActive researchers have demonstrated the way Pepper and NAO robots can be infected with ransomware. The senior security consultant at IOActive, Lucas Apa, said that ransomware attacks have become quite a common attack vector nowadays:\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that ransomware attacks have become a preferred method for cybercriminals to get monetary profit by encrypting victim information and requiring a ransom to get the information back.\u201dWhile speaking with Threatpost, Lucas Aps and Cesar Cerrudo from IOActive Labs stated that the vulnerability is like an open gateway for ransomware attacks that can target sensitive in-transit information that is collected and stored by the robot. This information is stored in HD video feed type format while four directional microphones record the audio. The robots also store payment and transaction-related information of businesses.Both NAO and Pepper robots are quite expensive machines priced around $10,000. These are the two most widely deployed robots that are extensively used for researchers and educational purposes. Nearly 20,000 Pepper robots and 10,000 NAO robots are being used at the moment at over 2,000 organizations across the globe.Currently, A wide range of industries are benefitting from these robots including education, retail, and industrial sector. If these robots become non-operational then businesses will experience losses almost every second. The white paper from IOActive Labs read:\u201cIt stands to reason, then, that service and/or production disruption is another strategy for attackers. Instead of encrypting data, an attacker could target key robot software components to make the robot non-operational until the ransom is paid.\u201dTo demonstrate the vulnerability a proof-of-concept has been developed by IOActive Labs that targets NAO robot but the same technique can be applied on Pepper robot. To deploy ransomware an undisclosed function was exploited to allow remote command execution. This function allows remote execution of commands via instantiating a NAOqi object by use of the ALLauncher module and enabling the internal_launch function.Module files were then infected to modify robot default operations, disable admin features and capturing audio/video and sending it to a command & control server. Once the information is received by the attackers, they can gain elevated privileges, modify root passwords and change SSH settings.Factory reset mechanism is also disrupted by the attackers so as to ensure that users remain unable to restore the system by uninstalling the ransomware. Afterward, the attacker can infect all behavior files that contain custom code. This code is required to execute the main functions and actions of the robots. Injecting the custom code into behavior file classes, it became possible for researchers to modify the robot\u2019s mannerisms/actions/behaviors. The same technique can be used to completely bork the robot or enable it to use bad language and even ordered to attack humans.\u201cWe decided to conduct a proof-of-concept ransomware attack on the NAO robot, leveraging vulnerabilities we uncovered in our prior research in 2017. What we found was pretty astonishing: ransomware attacks could be used against business owners to interrupt their businesses and coerce them into paying ransom to recover their valuable assets,\u201d researchers noted in the white paper.Once the robots\u2019 functioning gets disrupted, it would take weeks to restore their operational status back to normal. But during the time a robot is non-operational, businesses and factories will be losing a lot of money.It is now the responsibility of robot vendors to improve the security of these robots.

It\u2019s the need of the day to prepare for such threats by understanding the key elements that are required to infect robots with ransomware.

It is now being used in some well-targeted email attacks and widespread, multi-million message schemes. Most of the attacks are targeted against automotive industry and the campaigns provide attackers full access to systems running MS Windows.The researchers call it FlawedAmmyy because it is developed using the leaked source code for a legit app Version 3 developed for Ammyy Admin remote desktop software. Whoever installs this app is secretly spied upon by the attackers.\u201cWe have seen FlawedAmmyy in both massive campaigns, potentially creating a large base of compromised computers, as well as targeted campaigns that create opportunities for actors to steal customer data, proprietary information, and more,\u201d stated Proofpoint researchers.These massive spam campaigns are believed to be launched by threat actor TA505, who has already been involved in a number of large-scale campaigns involving Locky, Dridex and Globelmposter ransomware. It is worth noting that TA505 is a prolific hacker group that experts believe has been active since 2014.The phishing emails contain a ZIP file containing .url attachments. These emails are sent to generic subjects such as bills, receipts and/or invoices while the attachment appears as a transaction. The .url files serve as links to websites and launch a web browser automatically as soon as these are clicked upon.However, instead of connecting to an \u2018HTTP://\u2019 link like a normal .url file would do these files connect to a \u2018file://\u2019 link. This means if the victim opens the attachment the system will instantly download and execute a JavaScript over the SMB/Server Message Block protocol instead of launching the browser.FlawedAmmyy RAT can acquire full control over the desktop remotely and offer hackers complete access to the system with a bright chance to steal user data including credentials and documents. The malware can also abuse audio chat. Threat actors are delivering the malware in bulk via large-scale phishing campaigns as well as targeting specific industries side-by-side.According to researchers at Proofpoint, this is the first time that systems are being infected by a combination of two elements with malware. That is, the SMB protocol executes a JavaScript, which then downloads Quant Loader and this fetches the final payload and gets the malware FlawedAmmyy installed on the infected PC.Another bad news is that the targeted victim is never hinted about the computer being infected. Therefore, to prevent your PC from getting infected avoid clicking on links especially those sent in emails by unknown senders and never click or download files from such emails.\u201cAs always, users should not open attachments from senders they do not know and should be cognizant of security warnings when opening files. Layered defenses at the email gateway, IDS, and endpoint can all provide important protection for threats of this nature,\u201d explained researchers at Proofpoint.Ammyy Admin has been contacted to react to the use of Ammyy Admin leaked code by hackers but at the moment the company has not issued any statement in response.", "title": "New FlawedAmmyy RAT steals data and intercepts audio chat"}, {"date": "March 9, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "DDOS", "gaming", "Google", "GTA", "hacking", "Memcached", "NRA", "PlayStation", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "body": "By now the vulnerability in Memcached Servers has been exposed to the masses since its proof of concept (PoC) code was recently published online.

According to a list provided 360Netlab, a Chinese IT security firm, the following companies and websites have been hit by DDoS attacks through misconfigured Memcached servers.This list has been compiled by researchers using their ddosmon platform which is equipped with a dedicated DDoS botnet C&C tracking system to provide insights.

According to the observation of not one or two but three security firms, massive Memcached reflection distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are being launched with an unprecedented intensification factor of 50,000, which is the largest in DDoS attacks\u2019 history.The problem got worsened after someone released the proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code for amplification of the attack, as it has made it even easier for cybercriminals to launch large-scale attacks. GitHub was amongst the first targets of attackers while an unknown American firm suffered world\u2019s largest 1.7 Tbps of DDoS Attack.Now, Corero Network Security has discovered that a Kill Switch can help organizations secure their websites and prevent the threat of massive DDoS attacks launched via exploiting vulnerable Memcached servers. According to researchers, the vulnerability (classified as CVE-2018-1000115) that leads to the exploitation of Memcached servers is much more extensive and dangerous than it is currently assumed.Memcached is an open-source memory caching server that can boost responsiveness of database-driven websites by storing data in RAM, which leads to acceleration of access times. It stores a variety of data such as emails, API data, website customer data, Hadoop information and confidential database records.Since it wasn\u2019t developed for being accessed through the internet, therefore, users don\u2019t need to authenticate via login and passwords and attackers are thus, able to create fake requests to amplify DDoS attacks at least 50,000 times.As per researchers at Corero, any exposed Memcached server can be used to launch a DDoS attack as well as tricked into revealing the user data it has cached from the local host or network. Since Memcached servers don\u2019t need authentication so anything that the server stores is accessible while attackers can easily steal, modify and reinsert altered data in the cache.However, Kill Switch can send a command back to the attackers\u2019 server for controlling the DDoS exploitation trend because it invalidates the vulnerable server\u2019s cache including the malicious payload. Corero researchers have already tested it to be 100% effective on live attacking servers.Given that still there are over 12,000 exposed Memcached servers that can be accessed, it is indeed good news that Corero researchers are able to send back attackers\u2019 commands. It is done by using simple commands like \u201cshutdown\\r\\n\u201d, or \u201cflush_all\\r\\n\u201d in a loop to prevent amplification; the flush_all command will flush the entire content including keys and their values that are stored in the cache.According to THN, a security researcher Amir Khashayar Mohammadi has developed and released a basic DDoS mitigation tool titled Memfixed. The tool is written in Python and sends commands to flush or shutdown the vulnerable Memcached servers.RELEASE: Memfixed-DDoS-Mitigation toolThanks to @dormando for the memcached \u201ckillswitch\u201d;Memfixed is a tool that mitigates the attacks using Shodan to efficiently shutdown and flush vulnerable memcached servers:Author: @037https://t.co/vTf5AWwHdt pic.twitter.com/SfIpmdmr7U\u2014 spuz.me (@SpuzNiq) March 8, 2018Memfixed can obtain a list of exposed and vulnerable Memcached servers automatically using the Shodan API after which it initiates flush/shutdown commands.

What actually happened was a coordinated phishing attack that was also convincingly thwarted by the automatic risk management system implemented by Binance.Apparently, hackers managed to lure Binance users to use a fake version of the exchange\u2019s website in order to obtain login credentials.

As of this moment, the only confirmed victims have registered API keys (to use with trading bots or otherwise).

Withdrawals were although stopped by Binance but it was a bit too late by then as it is believed that the hacker already had gained a solid position in Viacoin on another exchange. Quite possibly, the hacker sold a big chunk of Viacoins soon after increasing its rate on Binance, which shows how vulnerable cryptocurrencies currently are when it comes to security.It must be noted that Binance is counted among the leading exchanges in the world since CoinMarketCap ranked it as the fourth biggest exchanges in terms of traded volume in its top cryptocurrency exchanges list.This is the second attack on Binance within a month which show how much security is compromised and binance in also not drooping its fees which is a big reason traders are shifting to bittrex and other exchanges\u2014 Khalid (@khalidpak2004) March 8, 2018All that we can recommend our users is to store coins in a hardware wallet instead of storing on an exchange or using a wallet that lets you control the private keys.

This means anyone with knowledge of scripts and coding can carry out large-scale DDoS attacks.The first two codes were published on March 5th, 2017. The first code is written in C language and utilizes the list of 17,000 vulnerable Memcached servers to conduct DDoS attacks while the second DDoS tool is written in python and the person behind the creation of this tool goes by the handle of @37 on Twitter. The DDoS tool uses Shodan search engine to generate a unique list of vulnerable Memcached servers to send forged UDP packets.The third code was published on March 3rd on Twitter by a user going with the online handle of @the_ens.The vulnerability in Memcached servers exists because the implementation of the its servers\u2019 UDP protocol is flawed and anyone can launch a major Distributed Denial of Service (DD0S) attack without much ado.This means, cybercriminals have managed to add a brand new and extremely effective technique to their already loaded cyber-weaponry that can twofold DDoS attacks by as much as 51 x 200x through exploiting misconfigured Memcached servers, which are easily accessible through the public internet connection.Memcached servers are web-based memory caches that are quite huge and are used to boost the responsiveness of database driven websites as it can improve their memory caching system. These servers cache the data that is most frequently retrieved and stores it in its memory instead of retrieving it from the hard disk again and again. Memcache servers are a combo of open-source software as well as standard server hardware and just contain huge reserves of memory.The researchers call it an amplification attack which was also explained by Cloudflare last week in their blog post. \u201cOver the last couple of days, we\u2019ve seen a big increase in an obscure amplification attack vector \u2014 using the Memcached protocol, coming from UDP port 11211.

Researchers Syed Rafiul Hussain, Shagufta Mehnaz and Elisa Bertino from Purdue University and Omar Chowdhury from the University of Iowa collaborated to identify vulnerabilities in 4G LTE protocols. They believe that the identified flaws are quite concerning as these are directly written into the LTE protocols and can cause a widespread impact on the tech industry.As per the findings of researchers [PDF], the 4G LTE protocol is a combination of various critical procedures, and each of them needs an intensive security and privacy analysis. The procedures affected by the protocol include the Attach process that lets a subscriber associated device with the network; Detach process that allows the device to disconnect from the network after the device is switched off; and Paging protocol that forces the device to regain system information and used in emergency warning applications.Researchers developed a tool called LTEInspector to \u2018lazily scan\u2019 and detect the vulnerabilities in 4G LTE protocol. The tool checks exploitable vulnerabilities identified in the common wireless telecommunications standard that can help attackers launch ten new kinds of attacks and nine already existing attacks.\u201cThe set of properties that LTEInspector aims to check include authenticity (e.g., disallowing impersonation), availability (e.g., preventing service denial), integrity (e.g., restricting unauthorized billing), and secrecy of user\u2019s sensitive information (e.g., preventing activity profiling),\u201d explained researchers.Purdue and Iowa University researchers state that 4G LTE networks\u2019 security is based on obscurity and a majority of the implementations are proprietary \u201cblack boxes\u201d that make it difficult to perform in-depth security evaluation. Given the broad range of sub-components that need to be configured and the requirement of handling devices configured for another carrier, LTE implementations are quite complex and there is little to no transparency in network security.The findings were publicly disclosed in a paper published last month [PDF]. The new attacks include an authentication relay attack that lets an attacker connect to an LTE network while tricking another device\u2019s identity and location without needing to submit legitimate credentials. Researchers have referred to this as the worst of all attacks. Moreover, an attacker can easily change the victim\u2019s device location in the core networks that would allow setting up of false alibi or inclusion of fake evidence in case a criminal investigation is underway.Furthermore, an attacker can perform a variety of functions such as tracking the device\u2019s location, intercepting phone calls and text messages and injecting false emergency alerts to create what researcher refer to as \u201cartificial emergency.\u201dThe paper is an attempt to show the way LTEInspector works and researchers have suggested that developing sufficient defensive measures is difficult without overhauling the 4G LTE infrastructure.Researchers noted: \u201cWe deliberately do not discuss defenses for the observed attacks as retrospectively adding security into an existing protocol without breaking backward compatibility often yields band-aid-like-solutions which do not hold up under extreme scrutiny.\u201dRemember, an example of fake or faulty emergency alert can be taken from January 2017\u2019s Hawaii\u2019s false missile alert sent by a troubled worker who thought an attack was imminent.

The researcher duo claims that an attacker can hack a computer by issuing voice commands and force it to visit a non-HTTPS website. According to researchers, the attack requires a USB network adapter which when attached to the victim\u2019s PC, the traffic to the PC is intercepted and redirected to the malicious website that the attacker has loaded with malware. Using a mouse, an attacker can connect the targeted PC to any Wi-Fi network.\ufeffHowever, the attack method relies upon having physical access to the target machine, which serves as the only hindrance to attackers. But, it must be noted that physical access is needed only for compromising the first computer and not to amplify the attack.\u201cSo this attack is not only limited to the physical access scenario but also can be used by attackers to expand their access and jump from one computer to another. [It] very much could be like a Hollywood movie where everyone is asleep and no one is in the office and the computers come to life and are shouting at each other,\u201d Tal Be\u2019ery told Motherboard.This means, when a computer is infected, it can be forced to communicate with other computers available on the local network and spread the infection using a technique called ARP Poisoning. This method allows an infected PC to trick the machines on the local wireless network to route their incoming traffic via the attacker\u2019s network.Shulman noted that \u201ceven when a machine is locked, you can choose the network to which that machine is attached. It\u2019s interesting if it\u2019s to abuse a locked computer but .. it\u2019s more interesting if it can be done remotely.\u201dMicrosoft was informed about this issue and the company took immediate measures by passing Cortana\u2019s internet requests via Bing but the software still responds to requests when the PC is locked. To ensure that your computer stays protected, you need to disable Cortana on Windows 10 lock screen by accessing  Settings> Cortana and disable the option \u201cUse Cortana even when my device is locked.\u201dTal Be\u2019ery stated that the issue is caused by the developers\u2019 penchant to introduce new interfaces into computers without properly assessing their security implications. It is, therefore, important to discover loopholes associated with voice commands on new command interfaces such as those that rely upon hand gestures.Shulman added that: \u201cwe start with proximity because it gives us the initial foothold in [a] network. We can attach the computer to a network we control, and we use voice to force the locked machine into interacting in an insecure manner with our network.\u201dUntil then, to protect computers users can configure it to password-lock after a specific duration when the machine is inactive, which would prevent someone from infecting the computer by gaining physical access. This would also discourage nosy colleagues from taking a sneak peek on your home screen while you are not on your desk and in other situations when you are away from your computer.The researchers plan to present their findings at the Kaspersky Analyst Security Summit due to be held on Friday in Cancun. A proof-of-concept dubbed as Newspeak or Fake News Cortana has been developed by Be\u2019ery and Shulman. Newspeak can monitor all requests and responses made to Cortana on a network.Previously, a similar attack called Dolphin Attack was revealed by researchers in which voice assistant apps Siri and Alexa were found vulnerable to attacks including using simple command like \u201cHey Siri\u201d to forcing the iPhone to open a malicious website or even asking Nexus 7 to call on \u201c1234567890\u201d, or Amazon\u2019s Echo could be asked to \u201copen the backdoor.\u201dSource: Motherboard", "title": "Cortana Lets Hackers Infect Windows PC Even when it is Locked"}, {"date": "March 7, 2018", "authur": "Ryan De Souza", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "Data", "europe", "Fraud", "GDPR", "internet", "Privacy", "Scam", "security", "Technology"], "body": "Data protection has never been more important, and keeping up to date on your requirements as business is becoming a vital part of your business management.

At the time of publishing this article, 50 XMR is about $17,309.However, researchers advise Memcached server users to disable the UDP port and increase their security by using firewalls.Previously, Arbor\u2019s ATLAS global traffic analyzer recorded the largest DDoS attack of 650Gbps on a target in Brazil while Dyn DNS and French telecom OVH suffered a series of massive 1 Tbps DDoS attacks and before the attack on Github both attacks were labeled as the world\u2019s largest DDoS attacks.If you are running a business; do not forget to calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.Image credit: DepositPhotos", "title": "World\u2019s Largest DDoS Attack: US Firm Suffers 1.7 Tbps of DDoS Attack"}, {"date": "March 6, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "ComboJack", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Crime", "Infosec", "internet", "Litecoin", "Malware", "Monero", "security"], "body": "A new cryptocurrency-stealing malware dubbed as ComboJack has been discovered by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 and Proofpoint researchers. It has been targeting cryptocurrencies and digital wallets belonging to American and Japanese users while the malware is being distributed via email spam campaign.The malicious emails contain the subject line \u201cRe: passport\u2026\u201d The attackers trick recipients into opening a PDF attachment that supposedly contains a scanned copy of a passport the recipient has mistakenly left in the email sender\u2019s office. The file does not show the scanned passport image but displays a request to open another file, which is actually an embedded RTF file. This RTF file contains an embedded remote object.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});This object attacks an old DirectX flaw (classified as CVE-2017-8579) and loads an HTA script. The script runs a PowerShell script to download the malware. Microsoft DirectX is basically a collection of APIs that manages multimedia related tasks on Windows OS.After the malware is downloaded, it makes sure that it stays on the device for which it keeps itself hidden from the user. It then creates an infinite loop to keep checking the contents of the clipboard after half a second to assess what sorts of cryptocurrencies the victim has stored on his/her digital wallet.Palo Alto Networks researchers noted in their blog post:\u201cThe contents of the clipboard are checked for various criteria to determine if the victim has copied wallet information for various digital currencies. In the event a wallet of interest is discovered, ComboJack will replace it with a hardcoded wallet that the attacker presumably owns in an attempt to have the victim accidentally send money to the wrong location.\u201dComboJack replaces clipboard addresses to upload an attacker-operated address. Funds are then transferred to the attacker\u2019s wallet instead of their actual address. The attack method relies upon the same tactic that was used by CryptoShuffler malware (identified in 2017). It also benefitted from victims\u2019 ignorance in cross-checking the destination wallet address prior to making funds transfer.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Remember, CryptoShuffler was used by hackers in November 2017 and successfully stole $150,000 from cryptocurrency wallets. The malware modified the original, legitimate address of the user with its own on the clipboard of the targeted device.However, one feature that differentiates ComboJack from CryptoShuffler is that the latter only stole Bitcoin while the recent one targets a broad range of currencies apart from attacking Bitcoin wallets such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero and also targets funds transferred through Qiwi, Yandex Money, and WebMoney. Perhaps that\u2019s why researchers have dubbed the malware as ComboJack since it can steal funds in multiple cryptocurrencies.\u201cBy targeting multiple cryptocurrencies and web-based wallets, the author of ComboJack appears to be hedging his or her bets on which currency will boom and which will bust,\u201d read the blog post by Palo Alto Networks researchers.Cryptocurrency users are advised to avoid using online wallets to store their funds and move to hardware wallets.

Now another startup service called Grayshift is claiming the same including iPhone X and iPhone 8.According to reports, the US-based Grayshift has created a tool called GrayKey that can extract the complete filesystem from the iOS device as well as brute-force passcodes and bypass Apple\u2019s security measures to unlock the phone. Grayshift is run by US intelligence agency contractors and a former Apple security engineer.It is believed that Grayshift has used same exploits that are being used by Cellebrite to crack iPhones. GrayKey targets the Secure Enclave installed in almost all iPhone models that have been introduced after iPhone 5s. It can crack encrypted iPhones running on iOS 11 to access data stored on the phones but it is currently not clear which specific version of iOS 11 is vulnerable to exploitation by GrayKey. That is, does GrayKey targets a flaw identified in iOS 11 or iOS 11.1 or is there any other vulnerability if the identified ones have been patched in iOS 11.2.According to Forbes, an always online, limited version of GrayKey can be bought for $15,000 but this version will be limited to 300 uses only and the unlimited version of the software is priced at $30,000. It is much cheaper than Cellebrite\u2019s software, which costs $1,500 per iPhone whereas GrayKey costs around $50 per hack.GrayKey doesn\u2019t need to send devices to the lab, which is why it is possible for Apple to obtain a copy to reverse engineer the tool and identify the salient security holes that it exploits. Although software like GrayKey gets developed with the intention to aid intelligence agencies and law enforcement critics are of the opinion that it is always a possibility that the software is used for illegal purposes.However, iPhone users need not be concerned or consider GrayKey as a security threat since the exploit is quite costly and it won\u2019t be easy for an average attacker to target anyone without a hefty payoff. Moreover, the tool works only if an attacker has physical access to the device. Grayshift has also clarified that the tool works on disabled iPhones and would make repeated guesses to extract passcodes, which we know as brute-forcing, to penetrate the device.Apple, on the other hand, has been improvising the basic features of its phones to thwart brute-force attacks. Such as every time the company releases a new model, it increases the time between passcode attempts after multiple failed passcodes. After ten failed attempts, the following path will allow the user to erase data. Settings -> Passcode \u2013> Erase DataNonetheless, the best way to keep your iPhone secure is to always keep the firmware updated to the latest iOS version and keep checking latest security updates from Apple.Image credit: DepositPhotos", "title": "After Cellebrite, Grayshift Claims to Crack Encrypted iPhone X & 8"}, {"date": "March 3, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Air Force", "Bug Bounty", "cyber security", "HackerOne", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "security", "Technology", "USA", "USAF", "Vulnerability"], "body": "106 Security Flaws Identified in Operationally Significant DoD Websites under US Air Force\u2019s Bug Bounty Challenge.A team of white hat hackers working with HackerOne, a vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform hosted a bug bounty event in collaboration with the US Air Force to identify bugs and security vulnerabilities in Air Force systems.Related: 17-years-old kid hacks US air force for the good This live-hacking event, dubbed as the Hack the Air Force bounty bug challenge 2.0, was the second installment of last year\u2019s bug bounty challenge introduced by the US Air Force (USAF). The first bug bounty challenge was held from 30th May to 2017-23rd June 2017 and around 207 valid security flaws were identified while the event was attended by participants from the US only.At Hack the Air Force 2.0 event, hackers managed to identify 106 valid vulnerabilities in the cyber-security systems of the US Air Force. The department paid $103,883 to successful hackers, which is somewhat lower than what was paid by the Air Force last year, which accumulated to a total of $133,400. This time the event went global as hackers from 26 countries including UK, Canada, USA, Netherlands, Sweden, Latvia, and Belgium were invited to participate in the event and look for security flaws in the USAF systems and also to fix them. The purpose of the initiation of this program is to improve the security of USAF\u2019s public-facing digital assets.According to a HackerOne spokesperson, all the identified vulnerabilities are completely new and have never surfaced before. The event started on 9 December 2017 where 24 hackers collaborated with DoD (department of defense) and USAF personnel and around 55 flaws were detected in 9 hours. The event was 20 days long and operated by HackerOne; according to co-founder and CTO of HackerOne, Alex Rice, this is the very first time his firm has worked with Defense personnel \u201con site\u201d in a live-hacking event.\u201cWe have done the bug bounty programs remotely in the past, which is common and this was the first one to start off with a live event,\u201d Rice told eWeek.The identified flaws affected over 300 public websites (which were deemed operationally significant by DoD and belonged to the USAF). 55 of these flaws were noticed in December on the very first day while the others were detected later on. The event was held in New York.Hack the Air Force 2.0 is part of a bigger project from the DoD called Hack the Pentagon program, which was introduced in 2016. It is indeed quite an expensive program but comparing to Google that spent $112,500 to a lone hacker in 2017 for identifying a single vulnerability the sum spent by DoD is not an extravagant amount.According to DoD, over 3,000 security flaws have been fixed under the federal bug disclosure initiative that started in 2016 as Hack the Pentagon and until now the government has spent over $233,000 in rewards. The results of Hack the Air Force 2.0 were disclosed on February 15th. The highest reward of $12,500 was issued for identification of an exploit chain in USAF\u2019s website through which two security researchers managed to access the DoD\u2019s unclassified network.Related: US Air Force EC-130H Aircraft with Hacking Kit can Hack Enemy Networks", "title": "US Air Force Hacked for Good at HackerOne\u2019s Bug Bounty Event"}, {"date": "March 3, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Akamai", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "GitHub", "internet", "Monero", "Money", "Ransom", "security", "Technology"], "body": "After a brief hiatus, attackers have returned with a series of new DDoS attacks and this time they have introduced a new technique for launching DDoS attacks, which is much more devastating than before.According to the findings of IT security firm Akamai\u2019s findings, attackers are now launching record-breaking DDoS attacks using a new method where victims are required to pay ransom in order to prevent cyber attacks. The difference is that this time around attackers have managed to embed ransom notes in the traffic itself.A number of DDoS attacks (distributed-denial-of-service) were launched over the past week against a wide range of targets and the targeted servers were overloaded with fake traffic while the websites were taken offline using Memcached servers, which basically improve the performance of certain websites, to intensify the strength of the attack.One such massive attack (world\u2019s largest DDoS attack ever) was thwarted by code-sharing platform Github on Wednesday with the help of Akamai. This attack of roughly 1.35 terabytes per second of data is believed to be the biggest ever recorded so far. Akamai security researchers helped Github fend off this attack but while doing so, researchers noticed that hackers are now stuffing the traffic with ransom notes. It is not uncommon to launch DDoS attacks with an objective of extorting targets with cryptocurrency demands but now the attackers are issuing demands within the inbound traffic flow. As per Akamai, there are over 50,000 exposed Memcached systems that can be exploited to launch massive DDoS attacks.In its blog post, Akamai noted: \u201cThis attack was the largest attack seen to date by Akamai, more than twice the size of the September 2016 attacks that announced the Mirai botnet and possibly the largest DDoS attack publicly disclosed. Because of Memcached reflection capabilities, it is highly likely that this record attack will not be the biggest for long.\u201dIt is worth noting that on February 28th a Russia-based DDoS mitigation firm Qrator also published a warning about the possible threat of huge DDoS attacks using Memcached servers. Qrator stated that the probable possibility of launching high-value DDoS attacks were initially identified by a China-based team of security researchers at 0Kee Team cybersecurity firm while the concept of launching attacks through the exploitation of Memcached servers was introduced in the year 2014\u2019s Black Hat U.S security conference talk entitled \u201cMemcached injections.\u201dKrebsOnSecurity\u2019s Brian Krebs noted in his blog post that on Thursday a Boston-based cyber-security firm Cybereason revealed that it was closely tracking Memcached attacks lately and that attackers are embedding a brief ransom note and payment address into the junk traffic that is being sent to Memcached services.As per Akamai\u2019s findings, a note was discovered in a flood of DDoS attack data the purpose of which was to request for payment in crypto-currency. Attackers asked for payment of 50 XMR or Monero that is equivalent to $16,000; a digital wallet address was also included in the note. The note read: \u201cPay_50_XMR_To\u2026,\u201d.Cybereason noted that the payment request is repeatedly loaded until the file size reaches one megabyte. Cybereason\u2019s principal security intelligence researcher Matt Ploessel stated:\u201cThe payload is the ransom demand itself, over and over again for about a megabyte of data. We then request the Memcached ransom payload over and over, and from multiple Memcached servers to produce an extremely high volume DDoS with a simple script and any normal home office Internet connection. We\u2019re observing people putting up those ransom payloads and DDoSsing people with them.\u201dCurrently, Akamai researchers are unsure whether organizations have fallen prey to this technique because the payments are required in Monero, which is quite difficult to trace in comparison to bitcoin. But, there is also another complexity associated, which is that attackers also will definitely struggle to identify which victims have paid the ransom given Monero\u2019s anonymity. Yet, Akamai warned potential victims that ransom payment is not a wise idea because doing so won\u2019t ensure that attackers will stop bombarding with faux traffic. Therefore, companies should avoid giving in to the attackers\u2019 demands.\u201cIf a victim were to deposit the requested amount into the wallet, we doubt the attackers would even know which victim the payment originated from, let alone stop their attacks as a result. Even if they could identify who\u2019d sent the payment, we doubt they\u2019d cease attacking their victim as it was never really about the money anyways,\u201d read Akamai\u2019s official blog post.Watch attackers sending Monero ransom demand during the attack.

The malware aims at stealing personal and financial data from targeted devices.Dubbed Android.Triada.231 by researchers, the malware carries the ability to download malicious plugins which steal banking credential from the user and intercept social media and messenger communication.Furthermore, the malware can root devices, infect Zygote which is also known as the \u201capp process,\u201d that works as the parent of all Android application processes. This means targeted users are left with no other choice but to reinstall the operating system and lose their personal data in case there is no backup.\u201cOnce the Trojans inject into this module, they penetrate other running applications. In doing so, they obtain the ability to carry out various malicious activities without a user\u2019s intervention: they covertly download and launch software,\u201d noted Dr. Web researchers.Previously, Dr. Web found Triada malware in low-cost Android devices Leagoo M8, Leagoo M5 Plus, Nomu S20 and Nomu S10. However, now the researchers have identified 42 more Android manufacturers whose smartphones have been infected by the malware but at that time the devices came with pre-installed malware. \u201cThe key feature of Android.Triada.231 is that cybercriminals inject this Trojan into the libandroid_runtime.so system library. They do not distribute the Trojan as a separate program. As a result, the malicious application penetrates the device firmware during manufacture. Users receive their devices already infected from the box.\u201dIn this case, however, researchers analyzed the targeted vendors and tracked the culprit back to a software development firm in Shanghai, China and noted that the malware was penetrated into the firmware at the request of the Leagoo partner which happened to be the same Shanghai-based firm.This company (Shanghai-based software development firm) provided Leagoo with one of its applications to be included into an image of the mobile operating system, as well as with an instruction to add third-party code into the system libraries before their compilation. Unfortunately, this controversial request did not evoke any suspicions from the manufacturer. Ultimately, Android.Triada.231 got to the smartphones without any obstacles.A list shared by Dr. Web shows companies and their model numbers which are currently infected. Keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive list and researchers believe that the list of infected devices could be much bigger.Currently, the malware is targeting users in Russia, China as well as other Central European countries.

In a newly identified scam, a malicious app is being used to obtain user credentials directly from the targeted devices. This is accomplished via new Android malware dubbed as Android.Fakeapp.This time around, the scammers have employed a rather aggressive approach to stealing Facebook login credentials by directly stealing data from the devices, which are mostly detected in Asia-Pacific region. The malware is being sourced from third-party markets and English speaking users are the primary targets in this campaign.According to Symantec\u2019s findings, when malware is installed, the user cannot suspect anything out of the ordinary because the app hides from the home screen and the service run in the background. A number of steps are undertaken by this service to steal credentials from a Facebook user\u2019s account, which include checking for a prospective Facebook account that is to be targeted by obtaining the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number to the C&C server.In case there isn\u2019t any account to target then it launched a fake Facebook login user interface after verifying the installed app to obtain user credentials. This user interface is displayed occasionally until login credentials are acquired. The compromised Facebook account is accessed through a JavaScript from a hidden WebView and it is hidden by setting the display to be on transparent.Furthermore, the malware ensures that CAPTCHA isn\u2019t available and if it is then it sends the information to the C&C server after which caches and cookies are removed and malware again attempts to perform its given task. After it manages to log-in to the targeted Facebook page it manages to leverage a varied array of activities; it can remove the user\u2019s private data as well as data of the contacts and transmit it to the C&C server. In this regard, the malware adopts a step-by-step approach in which general data is fetched immediately, which includes the user\u2019s login ID, password and device IMEI number. Then it switches attention to the profile details including contacts, education, work, basic information about family and relationships and locations. Lastly, it targets other activities such as friends, groups, pages, posts, likes, check-ins and events related information.These tasks are achieved through sophisticated techniques as the malware can search and harvest information using dynamic web techniques and content is stolen through Ajax calls. In order to stay protected, Facebook users need to update the software and avoid downloading from unfamiliar sites while only preferring to download apps from trusted sources.

At the moment, attackers are making nearly $43 per day while the combined balance so far is $3,900, which is quite a modest sum if we compare it to previous crypto-mining campaigns.This is not surprising that uTorrent misconfiguration vulnerability is being exploited in the wild by malicious threat actors because uTorrent client suddenly has become the lucrative gateway to mining cryptocurrencies and other scams.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Recently, researcher Tavis Ormandy from Google\u2019s Project Zero discovered multiple vulnerabilities in uTorrent. These vulnerabilities were linked with the way JSON-RPC handled calls while the victim accessed an attacker\u2019s website as it led to the implementation of a malicious JavaScript, which causes a DNS rebinding attack to receive authentication code from the webroot folder.In case this technique is successful, the attacker can compromise the torrent client settings and then the entire machine would be compromised through using a locally installed torrent client instead of JSON-RPC. The vulnerabilities identified by the Seattle-based security firm F5 researchers are somewhat similar to Ormandy\u2019s findings.F5 researchers noted that rTorrent developer \u201cexplicitly recommends\u201d to not use RPC function on TCP sockets, which indicated that the vulnerable XML-RPC interface is not enabled by default. Moreover, the malware downloaded by the exploit doesn\u2019t completely run but also scans infected computers for other miners and when it detects any it removes the rival miners.Currently, it isn\u2019t clear if there is a rTorrent update to be released to fix the vulnerabilities as the developer of rTorrent didn\u2019t comment on this aspect. Therefore, rTorrent users need to inspect their devices for infection symptoms such as the higher amount of bandwidths and processor power being consumed, etc. Thr F5 researchers are advising that users need to make sure that the vulnerable RPC interface is disabled until a fix is released. Users of other BitTorrent apps also need to be wary of RPC interface and disable it whenever it is possible.Related: Hackers Compromise Tesla Cloud Server to Mine Cryptocurrency", "title": "Beware; rTorrent Client Exploited to Mine Monero Cryptocurrency"}, {"date": "March 2, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Coding", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "GitHub", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "security", "Technology"], "body": "The online version control and code distribution platform Github has suffered a series of massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, causing service disruption by forcing its website Github.com to go offline.In the first phase of the attack, Github\u2019s website suffered a shocking 1.35 terabits per second (Tbps) spike while in the second phase Github\u2019s network monitoring system detected 400Gbps spike.

This means, cybercriminals have managed to add a brand new and extremely effective technique to their already loaded cyber-weaponry that can twofold DDoS attacks by as much as 51 x 200x through exploiting misconfigured Memcached servers, which are easily accessible through the public internet connection.Memcached servers are web-based memory caches that are quite huge and are used to boost the responsiveness of database driven websites as it can improve their memory caching system. These servers cache the data that is most frequently retrieved and stores it in its memory instead of retrieving it from the hard disk again and again. Memcache servers are a combo of open-source software as well as standard server hardware and just contain huge reserves of memory.The findings were reported by the three CDN specialists on Tuesday and all have observed a sudden increment in DDoS attacks that are launched via User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. These packets were noticed to be amplified by Memcached servers over the last two days. As per their findings [PDF], Memcached developers did not follow appropriate security measures while implementing support for the UDP protocol, which is why various DDoS attacks have been carried out through exposed servers lately.Cloudflare engineer Marek Majkowski provided a technical explanation of the DDoS attacks in a blog post: \u201cOver the last couple of days, we\u2019ve seen a big increase in an obscure amplification attack vector \u2014 using the Memcached protocol, coming from UDP port 11211. Unfortunately, there are many Memcached deployments worldwide which have been deployed using the default insecure configuration.\u201dAkamai SIRT Alert stated in its post that it is not easy to determine the exact amplification factor of Memcached servers; however, Akamai noted that around 1Gbps per reflector was generated while other firms reported about 500 Gbps attacks using Memcached reflection.Due to the inappropriate implementation of UDP protocol, hackers can easily send a byte-sized request to any exposed Memcached server, which will not respond with a similar tiny size packet but with thousand times bigger packets. If cybercriminals manage to prepare the attack well, they can launch an attack with lowest possible IP spoofing capacity, as low as 1Gbps, and successfully launch very large attacks that can reach up to hundreds of gigabits per second.According to Cloudflare researchers, it is evident from the UDP protocol specification that \u201cit\u2019s one of the best protocols to use for amplification ever! There are absolutely zero checks, and the data WILL be delivered to the client, with blazing speed! Furthermore, the request can be tiny and the response huge.\u201dCloudflare also reported about a recent DDoS attack that was launched against Cloudflare and attackers sent 15-byte packets which were responded to by Memcached servers with 750KB packets. Since the UDP protocol doesn\u2019t need a source address in its header, therefore, the original IP address of the packets can be spooked very conveniently and cybercriminals can trick the Memcached server into sending larger response packets to the targeted IP address.Furthermore, in their default configuration Memcached servers can expose their UDP port to external connections, which means the server without a firewall is an open gateway for abuse via DDoS. It is estimated that there are more than 88,000 misconfigured Memcached servers currently at risk of abuse and most of these servers are located in North America and Europe.The problem can be fixed easily as well; Cloudflare reports that Memcached server users need to disable their UDP port and augment the servers\u2019 security by putting them on firewalls and place them on private networks.", "title": "Hackers can compromise Memcached Servers for DDoS attacks"}, {"date": "March 1, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Data", "internet", "LEAKS", "Marines", "Military", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "USA"], "body": "The United States Marine Corps Force Reserve has become a victim of a massive data leak this week due to which sensitive, private data of around 21, 426 Marines, sailors, and civilians got exposed. Reportedly, on the morning of Monday, 26th February, the Defense Travel System or DTS of the Defense Department sent an unencrypted email to the wrong email distribution list.This email contained an attachment, which actually was like a treasure trove of valuable sensitive and confidential personal information including bank account numbers, truncated social security numbers, bank routing numbers, bank electronic funds transfer numbers, truncated credit card information, mailing addresses, emergency contact information and residential address of thousands of Marine Corps personnel and civilians, stated Marine Forces Reserve\u2019s spokesman Maj. Andrew Aranda in the official command release.It must be noted that the DTS is a travel management system that the Defense Department uses for management of officially authorized trips, travel expenses, and itineraries. The unencrypted email was not only unintentionally sent to civilian accounts but also to those accounts that were hosted within the unclassified, official \u201cusmc.mil\u201d Marine domain.According to Marine Corps Times\u2019 report, currently, it is unclear how many people received this uncalled for email. Maj. Aranda stated that the mistake was \u201cquickly noticed\u201d and the Marine Forces Reserve implemented email recall procedures in order to minimize the number of recipients. Involvement of any malicious threat actor in this misconduct was also ruled out by Maj. Aranda.\u201cThe Marine Corps takes the protection of individual Marines\u2019 private information and personal data very seriously, and we have steps in place to prevent the accidental or intentional release of such information,\u201d said Maj. Aranda.At the moment, the data exposure is being investigated by the Marine Forces Reserves to evaluate the extent of the breach and the department is also planning to implement favorable, productive changes to improve the security of personal data and prevent similar incidents in the future. The affected personnel and civilians will also be notified about the breach and guidance will be offered by the department to mitigate the risk of identity theft and other frauds. However, such incident not only poses online threats but also put victims at the risk of being a target by criminals and terrorists for instance in three separate incidents [1, 2, 3] the terrorist group ISIS leaked three \u201ckill lists\u201d containing sensitive and personal details of U.S. Military and Security Personnel. The group also urged its supporters in the United States to follow the list and kill every official on mentioned in the list.In another incident, Ghost Squad Hackers leaked a list of 2,437 US Army personals including names, emails, phone numbers, Dob, addresses, zip codes, credit card data including types, numbers, expiration date and CVV codes in plain text.Image credit: Shutterstock", "title": "Personal Data of 21,426 US Marine Force Reserve Personnel Leaked"}, {"date": "February 28, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Android", "APPS", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "Google", "hacking", "Malware", "Privacy", "Scam", "security", "Spyware"], "body": "Another day, another Android malware \u2013 This time IT security researchers have discovered a malware which aims at stealing personal data from Android devices, recording live calls and surrounding noises in order to blackmail the victim \u2013 Dubbed RedDrop by Wandera researchers, the malware was discovered in 53 applications on third-party app stores including calculators, image editors, languages teaching and space exploration apps.All the infected apps request invasive permissions but one of the requests allows the malware to be persistent between reboots which is destructive for targeted Android devices. Moreover, cybercriminals behind the development of RedDrop malware have been using over 4,000 compromised domains to spread the infected apps. Once the infected app is opened it further downloads seven more malicious APKs with dropper, spyware, trojan, and data exfiltration functionality. Once the user starts using the malicious app it starts sending SMS\u2019s to a premium service using the victim\u2019s money which goes undetected.The data which is stolen by RedDrop\u2019s data exfiltration functionality includes photos, contacts list, IMEI and IMSI number, SIM card information, nearby WiFi networks and live recordings of the device\u2019s surroundings. Upon successfully collecting the data the malware sends it to the developers\u2019 Dropbox and Google Drive folder which is used for extortion and blackmailing.\u201cWhen all of the functionality is combined, RedDrop aims to extract valuable and damaging data from the victim. As soon as the information is collected, it is transmitted back to the attackers\u2019 personal Dropbox or Drive folders to be used in their extortion schemes and as the foundation to launch further attacks,\u201d explained Nell Campbell of Wandera.The malware was first spotted by researchers on a Chinese server luring victims into visiting a domain hosting adult content. However, it is still unclear who is behind its development and distribution. Here is a screenshot shared by Wandera explaining the campaign which used adult content to target victims.\u201cThis multifaceted hybrid attack is entirely unique.

Originally created by an ex-Rutgers University student, Mirai malware has been resurfacing time and again since its initial launching in September 2016 and every time we get a new version of the malware the devastation gets twofold.More: Tor Proxy Used By Cybercriminals To Initiate Bitcoin TheftAccording to the findings of security researchers at Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard Labs, a new version of Mirai malware dubbed as OMG is currently spreading, which can convert IoT devices into proxy servers apart from showcasing all the DDoS capabilities of the original version. The capability of turning IoT devices into proxy servers offers the attackers a new way of making money from the malware just like Satori IoT bot malware, which was discovered in December 2017, is capable of mining cryptocurrency instead of launching DDoS attacks.\u201cWith this development, we believe that more and more Mirai-based bots are going to emerge with new ways of monetization,\u201d explained FortiGuard Labs research team in their official blog post.To turn IoT devices into proxy servers, OMG uses an open source tool called 3proxy and includes two strings that comprise of a command for adding and another for removing specific firewalls rules so that traffic is redirected on two random ports. The malware also has the ability to search for open ports and destroy any processes that are related to HTTP, telnet, and SSH. It also uses telnet brute-force logins to spread the malicious code.\u201cThis means that it can also do what the original Mirai could i.e. kill processes (related to telnet, ssh, HTTP, by checking open ports and other processes related to other bots), telnet brute-force logins to spread [sic] and DOS attack,\u201d wrote Fortinet researchers.After it gets installed on a vulnerable IoT device, the malware establishes its contact with the C&C server and labels the compromised system as a new bot. The C&C server analyses the data message and then instructs the bot malware regarding if it has to transform the infected IoT device into a proxy server, launch a DDoS attack through it or terminate the connection.In its blog post, Fortinet researchers noted that attackers can earn money through proxy servers by selling the access to these compromised servers to hackers and cybercriminals. Proxy servers are valuable to cybercriminals as these provide them a way to stay anonymous while carrying out malicious activities such as invading a network or data stealing. Multiple attacks can be launched via a single source and attackers may get some types of filtering and IP blocking too.Fortinet further noted that OMG is a unique Mirai version because of its two-dimensional attack options. Gabriel Gumbs, product strategy vice president at STEALTHbits Technologies, stated that proxy servers can be effectively used to cover the \u201corigins of an attack, reconnaissance activity, or for simply re-routing a user\u2019s search for information to sites controlled by someone pushing a specific agenda.\u201d Furthermore, Gumbs added that IoT bots can be useful in facilitating disinformation campaigns.Image credit: DepositPhotosMore: Hackers behind Mirai botnet & DYN DDoS attacks plead guilty", "title": "Mirai Variant \u2018OMG\u2019 Turns IoT Devices into Proxy Servers for Cryptomining"}, {"date": "February 27, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Android", "Apple", "Cellebrite", "Google", "hacking", "iOS", "iPhone", "iPhone X", "Israel", "Samsung", "security", "Smartphone", "Technology"], "body": "You must remember the long and tedious battle between Federal Bureau of Investigation and iPhone manufacturer firm Apple over unlocking of an iPhone owned by the terrorist involved in the San Bernardino mass shooting around two years back.

As per the Israeli firm, its new hacking tool would unlock just about any iPhone available in the market that runs on iOS 5 to iOS 11 including the newbie iPhone X. It is worth noting that Cellebrite develops digital forensics tools and programs for cell phones and its most popular product is the Universal Forensic Extraction Device or UFED that helps investigators extract all the passwords and data stored in a mobile phone.Although the company hasn\u2019t publicly announced that it can unlock iOS devices but Forbes reports that within the past few months Cellebrite has developed new techniques described in the literature called Advanced Unlocking and Extraction Services that allow it access to iOS 11.This new technique is being marketed to law enforcement agencies and private forensic firms across the globe. Using the new techniques [PDF] it is possible to break the security of any Apple device including the iPad, iPad mini, iPad Pro, iPad touch apart from iPhone and all those devices that run on iOS 5 to iOS 11. Moreover, according to unnamed sources from the police forensics community, Cellebrite also can unlock iPhone 8 and iPhone X because both devices have somewhat similar security.That\u2019s not all, Cellebrite, an Israeli firm established in 1999, is capable of unlocking a variety of other devices including Google\u2019s Android OS based smartphones developed by Samsung such as the Note and Galaxy series, HTC, Google Nexus, Alcatel, LG, Huawei, Motorola and ZTE to name a few.

The file size does not increase as the video is played through a headless web browser opened in a popup window.Amit Dori, a security researcher from Israel, who works with Votiro, was first to draw attention to this issue. Amit Dori says that cybercrooks may host a benign video on their servers and add a cryptojacking script to mine Monero or another cryptocurrency. Once the user clicks on the playback, browser launches and CoinHive or another popular miner may start earning crypto to the distant scammer.This issue could be partially avoided if Word allowed to whitelist domains and play only YouTube or Vimeo videos. Some security researchers believe that such a scenario is extremely unlikely. Hidden web browser mining financially justifies itself only in case the user does not disconnect the player for a long time. Now, most people prefer watching videos on YouTube, some download them. But who is going to watch or insert movies into MS Word? According to Amit Dori, crooks still may try to insert longer video or add several short videos with smooth transitions from one video clip to another.Still, in order to make a profit, the scammer will have to convince thousands of users to open Word booby-trapped documents on daily basis.For now, crooks find that the most effective way is to hack the video streaming services and to place crypto miners there. Visitors stay on such websites for a long time and do not notice high CPU and processor load while watching movies.The most profitable in this respect are torrent websites and other resources with pirated content. Porn sites and game portals are also great for that.The vulnerability discovered by Amit Dori can be used not only for cryptojacking but for other purposes too. For example, nothing prevents intruders from embedding phishing scripts into the Word player. The Internet Explorer window makes it easy to extract information from unsuspecting users. For example, scammers may put a restriction on viewing for those who have not passed the authentication procedure and have not typed in their personal data.The online video function is also available in other Microsoft Office products, for example, in PowerPoint and OneNote, however, it is more secure there since it allows access only to certain domains.Amit Dori already notified Microsoft about the problem, but the corporation does not consider it a security issue. Therefore, experts recommend being vigilant when working with Word documents that contain video. You should always install fresh updates, including the Internet Explorer browser. When watching Word videos loaded from suspicious servers, users should use a VPN to encrypt their traffic and never type in their personal data.The Microsoft Word application was previously used by scammers to spread malicious scripts.

However, later NanoCore was also found targeting gaming users on Steam.According to court documents [PDF], NanoCore malware worked as a keylogger allowing attackers to record each and every keystore, stole password, turned on webcam and spy on target remotely, secretly view, modify or delete documents on the system, it also worked as a ransomware by locking user files and asking for ransom and used the infected system as stresser or booter to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.Huddleston also developed a licensing software \u201cNet Seal\u201d which he used to make a profit by selling it to other software developers, some of whom used Net Seal to distribute their own malicious software. By developing and selling Net Seal, Huddleston assisted in the distribution of that malicious software.He used PayPal to accept payments for Net Seal deals; offering users to distribute (either malicious software or other software) to 50 PCs. In return, Huddleston received thousands of payments via PayPal from Net Seal customers.\u201cBy developing NanoCore and distributing it to hundreds of people, some of whom he knew intended to use it for malicious purposes, Huddleston knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted thousands of unlawful computer intrusions and attempted unlawful computer intrusions, including intrusions and attempted intrusions that occurred within the Eastern District of Virginia\u2026 Huddleston agrees the evidence would show that NanoCore was used in a massive \u201cspear phishing\u201d scheme designed to infect and attempt to infect thousands of victim computers, including computers within the Eastern District of Virginia,\u201d revealed court documents.Huddleston also worked with 21-year old hacker Zachary Shames (another HackForum user) of from Great Falls, Virginia and the creator of Limitless keylogger (Limitless Keylogger Pro). Huddleston provided him access to Net Seal which allowed Shames to distribute Limitless keylogger and target unsuspecting users. The keylogger stole personal data from the system including passwords, conversations, login data, banking credentials and recorded keystrokes.In total, Limitless keylogger was sold to over 3,000 people and infected 16,000 devices worldwide.

The yet unrevealed flaw is believed to be so dangerous that it can let hackers hijack any customer account with ease by posing as a customer through T-Mobile website.According to the 18-year old Gamble, the bug was discovered under the T-Mobile\u2019s bug bounty program via HackerOne and he was awarded $5,000 (\u00a33,569) for that. The flaw was found on 19th December 2017. HackerOne is a platform that allows bug finders and tech firms to connect with each other.T-Mobile maintains that there is no such evidence that suggests the data of its customers have been accessed by threat actors. In its official statement T-Mobile explained that the bug was fixed \u201cwithin a matter of hours\u201d therefore, it is not possible that hackers might have accessed customer information.\u201cIf there had been customer impact we would have immediately taken proper steps to follow up,\u201d T-Mobile told Motherboard.Conversely, Gamble argues that the vulnerability was live for several hours and it is quite possible that hackers got a chance to exploit it before it was patched and any user who logged in to T-Mobile website during this time could have had his/her account hijacked.\u201cYou could monitor it for a very long time and honestly I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever suspect it,\u201d said Gamble.Gamble\u2019s bug report was reviewed by another security researcher Scott Helme, who stated that the flaw was similar to logging in to your account and then leaving the keyboard free so that the attacker could exploit it.Gamble, at the age of 15 attempted to hack computers of various senior US government officials between 2015 and 2016 including those of the CIA-director at that time John Brennan, Obama\u2019s senior advisor John Holdren, ex-Deputy Director at the FBI Mark Giuliano, My FiOS account of James Clapper, the Director of US\u2019s National Intelligence and JABS (Joint Automated Booking System), a secret portal responsible for managing federal arrests records of law enforcement agencies. The attacks were launched using social engineering techniques and the location was his home computer at the Coalville, Leicestershire. Later in October 2017, Gamble pleaded guilty at Leicester crown court to 8 charges of using a function with the intention of gaining unauthorized access and 2 counts of unauthorized alteration of computer material.Gamble identified and reported the bug to T-Mobile while he was waiting for his sentence for these crimes; in December Gamble discovered that T-Mobile had left logins of customers exposed on the internet, which could have let anyone know where to steal session cookies from. When Gamble accessed the log thrice, he received over 800 customer login details.\u201cEveryone that was logging in could\u2019ve had their account hacked. You could monitor it for a very long time and honestly, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever suspect it,\u201d said Gamble.It is worth noting that this is not the first flaw that has been identified in T-Mobile but just one of the many security flaws that have been identified so far. Such as in October 2017, another flaw was identified in T-Mobile website that allowed hackers access sensitive information of the cell phone carrier\u2019s customers including email IDs, IMSI, billing account numbers and the standardized unique number of the phone that verifies subscribers, etc. The flaw was actively exploited for hijacking customers\u2019 phone numbers before it got fixed.Via: Motherboard", "title": "Teen Exposes T-Mobile Flaw Allowing Mass Hijacking of User Accounts"}, {"date": "February 24, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["1Password", "breach", "Cyber Attack", "hacking", "Haveibeenpwned", "internet", "Password", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "body": "1Password\u2019s \u201cpwned password\u201d will check your password on the list of leaked passwords in previous or unannounced data breaches.You must have heard about the various mega breaches like the ones experienced by MySpace, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Yahoo, Instagram or the one we reported yesterday in which 3,000 databases with 2 million accounts have been found on Dark Web and the repercussions faced by the users. If you also had an account at one such service then you can expect hackers to take control of your account, whether you like it or not. And, if the same password is used to access multiple accounts at different platforms then you will be locked out of accessing all your accounts.But there are situations when the user has no clue at all about the password being stolen and companies often take years to notify users about a data breach or never inform the affected users. What are your chances then of finding it out whether your password has been stolen or not?The first solution that comes to mind in such a scenario is to check out security expert Troy Hunt\u2019s HaveIBeenPwned website, which was launched last year and serves as a database listing all the breaches. However, now you have another option in the form of 1Password. This is an amazing service that makes it a lot easier to check and find out if your password has been hacked and registered users will be notified to change their password if it is no more secure. The website works by integrating half a billion of dumped credentials featured on Hunt\u2019s Pwned into 1Password\u2019s database.1Password can be accessed by opening your password vault. You need to click on any of your credentials and press Shift+Control+Option+C and if using Windows OS press Shift+Ctrl+Alt+C and then click on Check Password button that will be present right next to your password. As soon as you click on Check Password, you will get to know if the password is listed on Hunt\u2019s HaveIBeenPwned database.The basic idea behind this service, explained Hunt, is to help users in independently verifying if their password has been hacked or not and if they should use it or not. \u201cMind you, someone could actually have an exceptionally good password but if the website stored it in plain text then leaked it, that password has still been \u2018burned\u2019,\u201d wrote Hunt.According to 1Passwor\u2019d blog post, one of its key features is to let users check that the password they want to use is already breached or not and if it is compromised then 1Password will inform the user to pick another one. Additionally, it has the standard password strength indicator bar that lets web used improve their security practices. Then there is Pwnage check that further minimizes the risk of password reuse since it verifies if the specific password has already been part of previous data breaches. The Pwned passwords, which are hashed with SHA-1, are being used to facilitate this feature. Pwned passwords are also available in downloadable, plain text format and queryable through an API, which prevents the sharing of complete passwords with third parties.The service is now available to everyone who has a 1Password membership.

Recently, the social engineering experts at breach notification website Hacked-DB discovered a massive trove of data containing login credentials of millions of users on the dark web.In total, Hacked-DB told HackRead they have discovered 3,000 databases containing 200 million unique user accounts including containing email addresses, potential personally identifiable information, potential financial accounts, unique IP addresses, unique account identifiers and other highly sensitive information linked to organizations and individuals all around the world.The vast majority of these compromised databases were not detected prior to this leak and the overall size of the files leaked is 9GB. The leak includes databases from 2011 to today in 2018, and the information includes personal accounts with cleartext or hashed passwords that can easily be reversed to the password itself.Hacked-DB Chief Operation Officer Mr. Yogev Mizrahi told HackRead that: \u201cThis leak is extremely interesting from a hacker\u2019s point of view since it can potentially give adversaries a fairly large ground of identities to work with when it comes to identifying theft and such\u201d.Hacked-DB CEO Mr. Chen Heffer said that \u201cThese leaks go mostly under the radar since they are not published to the public anywhere and by no one.

Recently, the researchers at Czech IT security researchers at Avast reported a sophisticated campaign in which attackers used Facebook and Facebook messenger to trick users into installing a highly sophisticated Android spyware.The scam was reported to Avast by one of their customers informing about receiving messages on their Facebook messenger carrying strange looking links sent by unknown profiles going by the names of Alona, Christina, and Rita using images of attractive women.

The most targeted victims were from Israel while a small number of victims were identified in China, France, Germany and the United States.Based on the evidence such as login activity, IP addresses, Middle Eastern time zones, registrant data of domains used by hackers to distribute malware, Avast researchers believe that this campaign is being run from Lebonan. However, at the time of publishing this article, it was unclear if the Tempting Cedar Spyware campaign is still targeting users or it has been shut down.\u201cThe cybercriminals behind the Tempting Cedar Spyware were able to install a persistent piece of spyware by exploiting social media, like Facebook, and people\u2019s lack of security awareness, and were thus able to gather sensitive and private data from their victims\u2019 phones including real-time location data which makes the malware exceptionally dangerous, concluded Avast.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Just last month researchers at Lookout Security exposed a cyber espionage campaign called Dark Caracal in which attackers targeted thousands of victims across 21 countries.

Recently, the IT security researchers at Austrian firm SEC Consult have discovered a set of critical vulnerabilities in Mi-Cam baby monitors which allow hackers to take full control of these devices and spy on children.Mi-Cam baby monitors are manufactured by a Chinese firm MiSafes and are equipped with Internet-connected video monitoring system along with 720P HD quality camera. These monitors allow parents to keep an eye on kids through Android and iOS devices, However, currently, these devices are vulnerable and other than parents, hackers can also spy on kids and perform a number of other tasks including \u201cunauthenticated access and hijacking of arbitrary video baby monitors.\u201dAccording to researchers, there are total six vulnerabilities out of which one lets attackers breach the device\u2019s security on Mi-Cam Android app without the need for client SSL certificate or password. The only thing an attacker has to do is use a proxy server in order to intercept communication between the monitor and smartphone.Another vulnerability exists in the device\u2019s password forget function. Mi-Cam allows users to reset their password and in order to verify the user, it sends a 6-digit validation key to the email address used by the customer at the time of signing up. However, hackers can use brute force technique and compromise a targeted account.Furthermore, one of the vulnerabilities lets attacker gain hardware level access to the device and extract the firmware since these devices hold \u201cunlabeled Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) interface.\u201d Moreover, by extracting the firmware attackers can identify \u201cvery weak 4-digit default credentials for the root user accounts used by the video baby monitor.\u201dThe firm has also identified that software used in these baby monitors are outdated and already affected by publically known vulnerabilities including those detailed in SEC Consult\u2019s security advisory under the \u201cOutdated and Vulnerable Software\u201d section.Currently, over 52,000 video baby monitors and user accounts are vulnerable but despite informing MiSafes on several occasions since December 2017, there has been no response from the company, therefore, the critical security flaws still exist in the affected product. The researchers strictly advise that users should stop using these baby monitors as there is no update available otherwise they might be the victim of non-stop hacking attempts.Remember, Internet-connected (IoT) devices are highly vulnerable and not only allow hackers to scare kids but also let pedophiles can keep an eye on vulnerable children or in some cases record footages and sold on the dark web.

These devices are hacked for political or financial benefits. Therefore, doctors and government regulators must implement \u2018aggressive\u2019 methods to prevent hack attacks to ensure the safety of patients.\u201cAnytime devices operate through the internet it opens up a theoretical possibility. While hackers may not be able to influence the device parameters at this point in time, one could see the diagnostic information from a given device,\u201d said Dr. Lakkireddy.The modern pacemaker is like a tiny computer that is equipped with dedicated software and is implanted under the skin near the collarbone. Its purpose is to ensure that heart keeps on pumping actively as well as transmit information about the condition of the patient to the doctor and notify immediately if there is something wrong. With their hacking prowess, hackers can infect the software to drain the battery of pacemaker or turn off the device.Moreover, if it is a case of ICD then it can deliver a heart-stopping shock to the patient. This sort of \u2018intentional harmful interference\u2019 can be detrimental to the health and well-being of the patients, which is why physicians are referring it as a credible threat.\u201cTrue cyber-security begins at the point of designing protected software from the outset, and requires the integration of multiple stakeholders, including software experts, security experts, and medical advisers,\u201d said Dr. Lakkireddy.Image credit: DepositPhotos", "title": "Life-saving Pacemakers, Defibrillators Can Be Hacked and Turned Off"}, {"date": "February 21, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Apple", "Cyber Attack", "Fraud", "hacking", "internet", "keylogger", "Linux", "Mac", "Malware", "Scam", "Windows"], "body": "Another day, another malware \u2013 This time it targets macOS and it comes with keylogging capabilities.Security researchers have discovered a malicious new malware strain called Coldroot that remains undetected by all antivirus programs including all on Virustotal since just 18 out of 20 antivirus tools were able to detect it as malicious. This Mac malware is a Random Access Trojan (RAT) that was shared online on Github in 2016 as part of a joke to target Mac users. Ever since 30 March 2016, this RAT has been available freely on Github and even today it is actively distributed.Coldroot is now capable of affecting all main desktop operating systems and can silently gain remote control on a compromised/vulnerable computer. It must be noted that AV firms haven\u2019t yet noticed this malware. The details of Coldroot were revealed publicly by a security researcher and Digita Security\u2019s chief research officer Patrick Wardle.Wardle identified that it was a \u201cfeature complete, currently undetected\u201d malware and was being sold by its suspected author Coldzer0 on the Dark Web since 1 January 2017. He further revealed that Coldzer0 also offered potential customers information about the methods of malware customization. Furthermore, Coldzer0 posted a video stating that the cross-platform Coldroot RAT can be used for targeting MacOS, Linux, and Windows-based systems.The malware\u2019s improved recent version was identified initially in an illegitimate Apple audio driver namely \u201ccom.apple.audio.driver2.app.\u201d It is displayed as a document and asks for admin access and then silently installs and communicates with its C&C server for additional instructions. Once the user clicks on it a pop-up message appears that seems like a regular authentication message. It requests for user\u2019s MacOS credentials. When credentials are provided, Coldroot modifies the TCC.db privacy database allowing malware the required accessibility to perform system-wide keylogging.\u201cIt should be noted that if no command or tasking is received from the command & control server, the malware will simply continue beaconing\u2026 interestingly, sending the name of the user\u2019s active window in each heartbeat,\u201d writes Wardle.Moreover, the malware manages to stay into the infected system by installing itself as a launch daemon. This way, the malicious code launches automatically every time the infected computer is turned on.The malware is capable of capturing screenshots, initiate and end processes, search for and upload new files, start a remote desktop session and shut down the operating system remotely. Currently, it is unclear if the recent version of Coldroot is the same that was uploaded around two years back or it is a modified version of that malware. The malware still contains the contact details of its original author, which could be a deliberate attempt to deceive others by someone who picked the malware from Github and modified it with new features.Wardle stated that the malware may not be able to affect newer operating systems like MacOS High Sierra particular because the system\u2019s TCC.db is protected through System Integrity Protection (SIP). But he believes that the malware\u2019s active distribution shows that hackers are continually trying to target MacOS and to stay protected users of MacOS must switch to the operating system\u2019s latest version.Image credit: DepositPhotos", "title": "Coldroot Mac Malware Silently Performs System-Wide Keylogging"}, {"date": "February 21, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Amazon", "Cryptocurrency", "Cryptojacking", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "Technology", "Tesla", "Wikipedia"], "body": "It is 2018 and the easiest way to make quick money at someones else\u2019s expense is mining cryptocurrency. This time, however, researchers have found two new victims of cryptojacking including Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors) and Wikipedia, an online content based encyclopedia.These findings came from two separate IT security firms. First, according to researchers at California based Cloud Threat Defense company RedLock who discovered that hackers compromised Tesla\u2019s Amazon cloud account to mine cryptocurrency while according to Sucuri researchers an article on Wikipedia was edited and inserted with a third party link which was compromised to mine cryptocurrency.An unknown attacker or a group of attackers were able to breach the security of Tesla\u2019s Amazon cloud account and mine cryptocurrency through it. Moreover, it also allowed attackers to access the company\u2019s highly sensitive data such as telemetry.According to RedLock\u2019s researchers, the incident was discovered while looking for publically exposed Amazon Web Services (AWS) buckets and one of them turned out to be of Tesla open for public access without any password.\u201cThe hackers had infiltrated Tesla\u2019s Kubernetes console which was not password protected. Within one Kubernetes pod (an open-source system developed by Google and now maintained by Cloud Native Computing Foundation.), access credentials were exposed to Tesla\u2019s AWS environment which contained an Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) bucket that had sensitive data such as telemetry,\u201d RedLock\u2019s researchers noticed.The attackers used the opportunity to mine cryptocurrency on the server at Tesla\u2019s expense however it is unclear how much cryptocurrency was generated. The researchers also noted that the whole campaign was highly sophisticated since attackers did everything to lay low and did not use a well-known public mining pool (according to Fortune, attackers used cryptocurrency mining software called Stratum in their attack).The attackers also covered their tracks by hiding the original IP address behind CloudFlare\u2019s firewall and kept the CPU usage of the server as low as possible which allowed them to evade detection by not raising suspicion.The Redlock\u2019s researchers contacted Tesla with their findings who acknowledged the incidents and secured the database \u201cwithin hours.\u201d \u201cWe maintain a bug bounty program to encourage this type of research, and we addressed this vulnerability within hours of learning about it. The impact seems to be limited to internally-used engineering test cars only, and our initial investigation found no indication that customer privacy or vehicle safety or security was compromised in any way,\u201d said Tesla in a statement.Giovanni Vigna, director of the Center for Cybersecurity at UC Santa Barbara and co-Founder/CTO of malware protection provider, Lastline, told HackRead in an email conversation that \u201cAccounts that provide access to cloud resources are a very lucrative asset for coin miners, as the criminals can mine coins at the expense of the account\u2019s owner.\u201d\u201cKubernetes allows for \u201cDockerized\u201d instances to be deployed and run at scale, providing the perfect environment to perform large-scale coin mining. In this case, access controls mechanisms should be particularly well designed, as access might result in thousands of dollars in cloud-time bills,\u201d said VignaAccording to Sucuri researchers, on February 2nd Wikipedia redirected users to a website that was compromised with CoinHive cryptocurrency miner that used visitor\u2019s CPU to generate Monero (XMR) coins. It must be noted that Wikipedia was itself not compromised but it was a result of a Wikipedia editor who added a link to a malicious site as a source for an article \u201cFeminist views on transgender topics.\u201dThe presence of malicious link was identified by a Wikipedia user while reviewing the sources in the article. Another user decoded the malicious script and concluded that \u201cit was purely coincidence that a user linked to a site that happened to be infected.\u201dHackers are becoming sophisticated and persistent in cryptojacking attacks. Lately, some high-profile platforms have been compromised to mine cryptocurrency including YouTube, BlackBerry\u2019s mobile site, Oracle\u2019s WebLogic servers, Android-based Smart TV & phones, US Court and UK\u2019s NHS websites and even the world\u2019s largest state-owned oil pipeline company Transneft had its computer system was hijacked to mine cryptocurrency.", "title": "Hackers Compromise Tesla Cloud Server to Mine Cryptocurrency"}, {"date": "February 20, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Chrome", "gaming", "internet", "Malware", "Password", "Privacy", "security", "Spyware", "Technology"], "body": "Flight Simulator Lab is caught secretly installing a software which steals Chrome passwords from the browser while checking if the user has installed a pirated copy of their software.Over the years there have been many DRM (Digital rights management) schemes, some of which were quite intriguing but not as much as this one that we are now going to reveal to you. As per the findings of Reddit user Crankyrecursion, the studio specializing in the development of flight simulator\u2019 custom add-ons, FlightSimLabs or FSLaba, is involved in the secret installation of a program to assess if the user is running a pirated version of their software. This program is installed on user\u2019s computers and happens to be a Chrome Password Dump tool. Crankyrecursion revealed his findings on February 18th.As per a report on TorrentFreak, the program is designed to initiate a procedure that allowed FlightSimLabs to steal usernames and passwords from the web browsers of unsuspecting computer users. Indeed it is an excellent DRM scheme since the code is built-in to the FSLabs\u2019 A320-X, which is an expansion for Microsoft Flight Simulator X.It is rather ironic that instead of challenging the findings or denying it categorically, FlightSlimLabs\u2019 boss Lefteris Kalamaras admitted that the code is there but it has been designed to be used on pirated versions of their software only. So, this means it is not a technical glitch or vulnerability but the software is meant to be there.User Luke Gorman proved after breaking-down the Text.exe that anyone paying for FSLabs\u2019 A320 module will be having this program installed on the computers without their consent or knowledge. Since the program can steal passwords, therefore, it can be termed as malware. The program not only asks the user to disable anti-virus while it is being installed but also is unable to protect their passwords.Kalamaras has denied that the tool performs indiscriminate dumping of Chrome passwords. He added that: \u201cthere are no tools used to reveal any sensitive information of any customer who has legitimately purchased our products.\u201d Basically, the software is there to notify the firm whenever the expansion is installed through pirated serial numbers. Kalamaras also noted that \u2018Test.exe\u2019 is a part of the DRM; its main targets are pirated versions of copyrighted software that are illegally obtained. The software is extracted temporarily only and is not used on legal copied of their product.A cyber-security firm Fidus Information Security also approved the assessment and stated that although the company provided detailed information about their product there is no mentioning of the password dumping tool or text.exe.\u201cWe can conclude the password dumping tool (test.exe) is only called when a fraudulent serial is used,\u201d wrote Fidus.However, Fidus has questioned about the protection of stored data and the reason behind transferring of the data over HTTP when it is encoded with B64 and whether it is legally allowed for a firm to do something like this. According to the founder of Fidus, Andrew Mabbit, the presence of malware as a password dumper in a trusted installed just to combat piracy is nothing short of \u201cinsanity.\u201d\u201cWhen run, the program extracts all saved usernames and passwords from the Chrome browser and appears to send them to FSLabs. This is by far one of the most extreme, and bizarre, methods of Digital Rights Management (DRM) we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d stated Mabbit while speaking with Motherboard.Being wary of the criticism the company received after the revelation of the presence of password dumping tool, FSLabs released an update installer minus the malware on February 19th followed by a fresh statement from Kalamaras that read:\u201cWhile the majority of our customers understand that the fight against piracy is a difficult and ongoing battle that sometimes requires drastic measures, we realize that a few of you were uncomfortable with this particular method which might be considered to be a bit heavy handed on our part. It is for this reason we have uploaded an updated installer that does not include the DRM check file in question.\u201dThe statement also contained another apology from FSLabs: \u201cWe have already replaced the installer in question and can only promise you that we will do everything in our power to rectify the issue with those who feel offended, as well as never use any such heavy-handed approach in the future.

The sad part is that the scam is performed at the expense of innocent users\u2019 computer processors as the mining campaign requires immense space and hardware resources. Usually, we hear about hackers tricking users into entering login credentials in order to compromise the computer and use the processor or some hackers choose to hack exchanges for mining cryptocurrencies.However, Check Point researchers have identified a new, highly malicious campaign that is being referred to as the biggest mining operations to date. In this campaign, hackers are targeting the famous Java-based open source automation server Jenkins CI servers for deployment of malware. Researchers believe that through a secret mining operation, hackers have managed to mine cryptocurrency worth millions of dollars (approx. $3 million and \u00a32.34m worth of Monero cryptocurrency).Dubbed as JenkinsMiner, the campaign has the imprint of China all over it. It has been active since last 18 months and it is designed to target different versions of Microsoft Windows. XMRig miner is installed on Windows-based computers to generate cryptocurrency and hackers have now shifted their focus on Jenkins CI server to make more profits. JenkinsMiner is quite similar to RubyMiner because both malware negatively affects servers leading to slowing download times and even resulting in complete Denial of Service or DoS if the attack is strong enough.The campaign involves sending 2 simultaneous requests to the CLI interface. The crypto miner operator then starts to exploit Jenkins Java deserialization implementation vulnerability, which is classified as a CVE-2017-1000353 vulnerability. It is caused by the absence of a comprehensive process of verifying the serialized object due to which just about any serialized object gets accepted. After the initiation of first session request, the second crafted request is sent after matching it to the session header. This request contains two key objects, the capability object that informs the server about client capabilities and the command object that contains the Monero miner payload. The injection code then comes into the picture as it enters the Jenkins server at this point. By sending the Start command, the miner is executed and thus, begins the process of cryptocurrency generation.In this operation, a combo of XMRing miner and a RAT (remote access Trojan) are used for targeting vulnerable computers across the globe. In their blog post, Check Point researchers noted:\u201cThe operation uses a hybridization of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and XMRig miner over the past months to target victims around the globe. The miner is capable of running on many platforms and Windows versions, and it seems like most of the victims so far are personal computers.\u201dIt is also observed that with each campaign, the malware undergoes various updates and the mining pool also gets modified. Though this is a well-operated and organized campaign in which many mining-pools are used for generation and collection of cryptocurrency but it is evident that only one wallet is used by the operators for depositing the amount.It must be noted that RubyMiner malware was also discovered by Check Point\u2019s research team in January. This malware targeted Windows and Linux servers and ran out-dated software for installing the XMRing crypto miners and compromise computers for mining digital currencies. Remember, previously, YouTube, BlackBerry\u2019s website, and Oracle\u2019s WebLogic servers was also exploited extensively by hackers to mine Monero.

On Thursday it was reported that a bug in various iOS and macOS apps were unable to display an Indian Telugu language character and instead crashed into a loop.Just a few months back Apple had to issue an emergency update for its macOS High Sierra for fixing a bug that revealed passwords of encrypted APFS volumes through the password hint feature. In iOS 11.3 and macOS 10.13.4 software updates Apple has fixed the Telugu character bug. However, this explains that Apple is definitely having a tough time these days.As per latest findings from Carbon Copy Cloner software developer, Mike Bombich, the APFS system included in the macOS Sierra has a disk image flaw that leads to loss of data. The software developer explained that he identified the data writing vulnerability in the APFS while working on Sparse disk images, which refers to a file that macOS places on the desktop. This file has the standard disk volume structure and the macOS considers it to be physically attached drive. Sparse disk images are quite flexible and commonly used when performing backup and disk cloning operations.A disk image is a type of file format containing the whole structure and contents of a disk volume like USB, DVD, CD, network share along with hard disk drive. Most Mac applications use disk images especially the backup software application through which users are able to create copies of other volumes to move files quickly in and out of a previous back up the image at some later date.Bombich explains that he noted that an APFS-formatted sparse bundle disk image volume displayed quite a lot of free space despite that it was full. This sparked curiosity and he copied a video file to the disk image volume and it got copied without giving any error. Surprised to find this, Bombich opened the file and played the video completely as well as checksummed it and learned that it was indeed intact and copied fully on the disk image. After unmounting and remounting of the disk image, the file got corrupted.This led to the identification of two key issues, firstly, that the free disk space on the APFS-formatted Sparse is not getting updated as it should have been when the actual physical host disk is not free. Secondly, there is the issue of lack of error reports in a situation where write requests fail to grow the disk image dynamically due to which data gets written into a void.The identified bugs were reported to Apple\u2019s diskimages-helper application service by Bombich. He further noted that SSD startup disks and similar other regular APFS volumes aren\u2019t affected by this bug, which is good news since the majority of users won\u2019t be at-risk due to the bug.The flaw is most effective when backups are created to network volumes. However, sending out files into the void is definitely not good for any backup software, which is why Bombich has stated that its software will not be supporting the APFS-formatted sparse disk images unless the bug is resolved by Apple.", "title": "Critical macOS Sierra disk image flaw leads to data loss"}, {"date": "February 19, 2018", "authur": "Alex Bennett", "topics": ["cyber security", "Education", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Jobs", "Kali Linux", "Linux", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Windows"], "body": "Looking for which cyber security certifications you should get your hands on?

You\u2019ll also be on track to earning a great salary \u2013 the average monthly earnings for GSEC holders is $96,000. While it is unlikely that you\u2019ll land this salary with just this entry-level certification, it may demonstrate that GSEC-certified professionals are committed to career development will go on to achieve top cybersecurity roles.While the GSEC can be achieved through self-study, many professionals will opt for a training program that includes the exam. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to pay $1,699 to attempt the GIAC Security Essentials exam.GIAC was founded in 1999 with the aim of validating the skills of information security professionals. The GSEC is just one of a range of certifications that address a broad range of cybersecurity skills, from entry to advanced levels.The CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) is aimed at the cybersecurity elite and is a fantastic way to demonstrate your expert knowledge, advance your career and join a worldwide community of cybersecurity professionals. This certification shows you have what it takes to build and manage an information security programme. As a result, the CISSP certification is highly sought-after by security professionals, especially those aiming for CCISO (Chief Information Security Officer) roles.To achieve the CISSP, you\u2019ll need at least five years\u2019 cumulative work experience across two or more of the eight CISSP domains \u2013 which cover cybersecurity topics like, risk management, software development security, and security operations. You\u2019ll then need to pass an exam to gain the certification.A major driver for professionals to achieve the CISSP is to improve their marketability. With an average salary of $107,000 for CISSP holders, it\u2019s easy to see why.Since it was introduced by ISACA in 1978, more than 129,000 professionals have proved their skills with the CISA certification.Earning the CISA showcases your information security auditing knowledge and demonstrates your ability to assess vulnerabilities, report on compliance and institute security controls within an enterprise. Achieving the CISA is often seen as mandatory to work as an Information Security Auditor. As security demands create fresh challenges for businesses, employers continue to recognize the credibility provided by the CISA.Within two years, 41% of enterprises will be running business-critical IT services in hybrid, public and private clouds, data from Traditional IT revealed.Because of this greater reliance on cloud technology, the need for professionals with proven cloud skills is increasing.(ISC)2\u2019s CCSP (Certified Cloud Security Professional) is one of the leading cloud credentials and is a perfect benchmark for security professionals. A result of the unique partnership between (ISC)2 and the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), the CCSP is ideal for experienced security professionals looking to move into cloud-focused roles or expand their existing skillset. By achieving the CCSP, you\u2019ll prove your expert knowledge of cloud application, data, and infrastructure security. You\u2019ll also build your knowledge of cloud compliance, legality and privacy. This high-level certification builds on knowledge gained through the CISSP. CISSP-holders will be pre-qualified to sit the CCSP exam, otherwise, you\u2019ll need five years of relevant security work experience.The Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) offered by ISACA is highly-regarded in the cybersecurity industry as a managerial certification that also builds technical knowledge. There\u2019s growing recognition for this expert-level certification, due in no small part to the success of the CISA certification, also offered by ISACA.This certification is ideal for technical cybersecurity professionals that want to make the move into management and gain recognition of their managerial and communication skills. When preparing to pass the CISM exam, you\u2019ll need to study governance, risk management, incident management and security program development.While there is some overlap between the CISSP and CISM certifications, the CISSP is more technically focused.To sit the CISM exam, you\u2019ll need five years of relevant work experience, with a minimum of three years\u2019 information security management experience. However, you will be able to substitute years\u2019 experience with other security certifications, like the CISSP, CISA or GIAC certification.With hundreds of cyber security certifications on the market, they couldn\u2019t all be squeezed into this shortlist. That said, we\u2019d like to give some honorable mentions to certifications that didn\u2019t make the top five.To build knowledge of the tools and techniques used by cybercriminals, consider taking an ethical hacking course and achieving EC-Council\u2019s Certified Ethical Hacker certification. With an average salary of $79,000, this entry-to-intermediate certification is one to consider.If you\u2019re a networking professional looking to specialize in the security of Cisco certifications, the Cisco CCNA Security is ideal. You\u2019ll prove your ability to develop security infrastructure and vulnerabilities on networks and set yourself up for a $77,000 salary.", "title": "5 Proven Cyber Security Certifications That Will Boost Your Salary in 2018"}, {"date": "February 17, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "IBM", "internet", "Malware", "Monero", "Scam", "TrickBot", "TROJAN"], "body": "Another day, another malware \u2013 This time TrickBot\u2019s variant is stealing Bitcoin by hacking cryptocurrency transactions.TrickBot malware, which emerged in late 2016, has taken the cyber world by storm. TrickBot is a type of destructive code offering a combo of redirection and web injection attacks. It does not directly attack banks or blockchains but hijacks individual transactions successfully through interfering in an on-going transaction.Until now it was thought that TrickBot can only be used to steal funds from financial entities but according to latest findings from IBM\u2019s researchers, the new variant of this malware can steal Bitcoin as well. According to X-Force cybersecurity firm by IBM, hackers have repurposed this malware for stealing Bitcoin.According to the blog post, the threat actors operating TrickBot have managed to expand the attack scope of this Trojan to countries across the globe and they particularly targeted financial institutions like banks and credit card service providers. Private banking firms and businesses were also potential targets in this regard. The sole purpose of using the Trojan at mass level was to make a higher amount of profit through carrying out fraudulent transactions. However, as per latest research, TrickBot is being used for stealing cryptocurrency.Security experts are of the opinion that TrickBot is among the top-five malware that are specially designed for stealing funds and this new version of TrickBot is used for targeting new and experienced investors alike who are buying cryptocurrencies from exchanges. The attack is successful primarily because the malware intercepts cryptocurrency login credentials, wallet information, and credit card data of the victim. There are various cryptocurrency platforms offering a variety of services like trading coins for another type of cryptocurrency, transferring coins between wallets or purchasing Bitcoin using a credit card. TrickBot is targeting a service that allows users to buy bitcoin and Bitcoin cash through credit cards and the attacks are facilitated through the malware\u2019s web injections that intercept the flow of a legit credit card transaction.The variant tracks the transactions of users who want to purchase Bitcoin using their credit cards since in normal situation a user is required to provide his or her public bitcoin wallet address to the exchange and also the amount of cryptocurrency that is to be purchased. This information is entered on a form after which the user gets redirected to a payment gateway from the Bitcoin exchange platform. This gateway is located on another domain operated by a payment service provider. Once there, the user then fills in the required personal data including billing details and credit card related information and lastly, the user confirms the Bitcoin purchase. This is the exact point when TrickBot comes into action and \u201chijacks the coins,\u201d as stated by IBM in its blog.\u201cThis particular attack targets both the Bitcoin exchange website and that of the payment service to grab the coins and route them to an attacker-controlled wallet,\u201d wrote IBM\u2019s X-Force researchers in their blog post.Moreover, the Trojan targets the transactions from all angles; such as it gets the login credentials of the user\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange account as well as credit card information and wallet data due to which attackers are able to target the victim from different fronts.\u201cThis means that even after the initial attack, cybercriminals can empty existing cryptocurrency wallets, make additional exchange purchases as the victim, and use the credit card information for whatever else they desire,\u201d stated a spokesperson from IBM\u2019s X-Force.Researchers did not reveal the name of the one exchange that is particularly being targeted in this campaign but we do know that previously Coinbase Inc. was effectively targeted by a cyber-gang using an earlier variant of TrickBot variant in August, which was also capable of credit card-stealing.Researchers have concluded that through the emergence of the new TrickBot variant, we can realize the extent of sophistication attackers have achieved in targeting websites and exchanges as their web logic and security controls have improved tremendously.\u201cIt highlights what we already know about this malware gang: it is a group that continues to study new targets and expands its reach,\u201d noted researchers.The bad news is that they also believe that there\u2019s more to come: \u201cAs the theft of cryptocurrency becomes increasingly popular among financial malware operators, we expect to see a many more campaigns targeting the various platforms and service providers in the cryptocurrency sector.\u201dThe \u201cgood\u201d news, according to IBM, is these attacks are labor and data intensive \u2014 and required cybercrime gangs to do a bit of work understanding their targets to maximize the effectiveness of their attack.The bad news \u2014 other than the obvious, according to IBM \u2014 is that more attacks are certainly on the way.\u201cAs the theft of cryptocurrency becomes increasingly popular among financial malware operators, we expect to see many more campaigns targeting platforms and service providers in the cryptocurrency sector,\u201d IBM notes in its blog post.", "title": "TrickBot Variant Steals Bitcoin by Hijacking Cryptocurrency Transactions"}, {"date": "February 16, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Amazon", "AWS", "Data", "FedEx", "internet", "LEAKS", "Passport", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "body": "It is just another day with just another privacy invasion \u2013 This time it is FedEx whose customer data has been exposed online, thanks to unsecured AWS S3 bucket.In July 2017, FedEx Corporation, a multinational courier delivery services company based in the United States announced that its subsidiary company TNT Express was facing issues due to the infection caused by nasty Petya ransomware attack. The attack was so serious that the company remained clueless regarding the revival of some of the affected systems while its quarterly profit was slashed by up to $300 million.Now, FedEx is back in news for all the wrong reasons as the IT security firm Kromtech has discovered a trove of data dating from 2009-2012 belonging to FedEx\u2019s customers which were exposed online for anyone to access with an Internet connection.In total, the company found 119,000 customer records including scanned copies of passports, driving licenses and security IDs of Americans and international customers such as Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Kuwait, Mexico, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, EU countries and others.According to Kromtech\u2019s blog post, one of the files also contained names, phone numbers, home addresses, and zip codes of customers however no emails or passwords were found in the unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. Furthermore, researchers affirm that the data was never accessed by third or malicious parties.Moreover, an in-depth investigation by researchers revealed that the data belonged to Bongo International LLC, a company that FedEx bought back in 2014 and provides package and mail forwarding services for customers worldwide. However, the service was shut down in April 2016 yet the data remained on the server.Kromtech security researchers discovered the data on on February 5th, 2017 but after several failed attempts to get in touch with the related authorities at FedEx, the researchers connected with ZDnet and on February 13th the company removed the data from the exposed S3 bucket.Varun Badhwar, a cloud security industry expert, and CEO and co-founder of RedLock told HackRead via email that:\u201cCloud security breaches due to publicly exposed cloud storage services such as the one at FedEx have plagued the industry for over a year now. Unfortunately, this problem is not going away anytime soon despite cloud service providers\u2019 efforts to provide additional tools to organizations to detect such misconfigurations since changes to sharing permissions for these services are being made by users without any security oversight.\u201cEven if an organization enforces strict monitoring to ensure such mistakes are not made within its own public cloud environment, it still needs to ensure that third-party providers that have access to the organization\u2019s sensitive data are taking similar measures. In the case of FedEx, this breach was the result of negligence on the part of Bongo International, a company that was acquired by FedEx 4 years ago.\u201dAlthough the data has been secured, the nightmare for FedEx might just begin since the exposed data contained personal data of EU citizens. Remember, European Union countries have strict laws to protect the privacy of its citizens. For example, Facebook has been facing a tough time in France and a lawsuit in  Belgium over tracking users. It will be interesting to see if the EU will make a move or warn FedEx over the breach.", "title": "119,000 FedEx users\u200b \u200bpassports, security ID & driving licenses exposed"}, {"date": "February 16, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["backdoor", "Cyber Crime", "DoubleDoor", "firewall", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Malware", "Password", "Scam", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "body": "A new Internet of Things (IoT) botnet campaign dubbed as DoubleDoor has been discovered by NewSky Security, which uses two exploits for bypassing authentication procedures on victim devices and also nullify additional security features. In this campaign, attackers can easily take full control of the targeted devices despite the user has enabled authentication or added a firewall. The malware specifically targets the CVE-2015\u20137755 exploits, an infamous Juniper Networks exploit that was identified in the SmartScreen OS running on NetScreen firewalls along with Zyxel modem backdoor exploit CVE-2016\u201310401.According to NewSky Security\u2019s blog post, the botnet starts its malicious operation by deploying the Juniper Networks exploit to bypass the firewall authentication process. Using this backdoor the attackers are able to access the SSH and telnet NetScreen firewalls through hardcoded password \u201c<<< %s(un=\u2019%s\u2019) = %u \u201d and a random username without needing it to be valid. The attack cycle of DoubleDoor gets implemented using the username netscreen. Once this is done, the botnet deploys the Zyxel backdoor for PK5001Z devices. This is a straightforward exploit that involves using hardcoded su password \u201czyad5001.\u201d Through this exploit, attackers can gain escalated privileges on the device. The attackers are also noted to be performing a \u201cpassword-based attack,\u201d that allows them to gain a basic privilege account such as the admin: CenturyL1nk prior to heading for the superuser. Moreover, the botnet also performs reconnaissance to make sure that the attack is successful and the targeted IoT device has been compromised.NewSky researchers wrote in their blog that the botnet uses a randomized string in each attack since the standard string is absent therefore it becomes difficult to classify that the recon operation is malicious. However, it is noted that the strings are always 8 in length, which is the only common feature. Researchers also believe that the botnet is in its nascent phase. The attacks occurred between January 18 and January 27, 2018, and a majority of them originated from South Korean IPs. The attacks are effective only if a specific, unpatched version of ScreenOS firewalled unpatched Zyxel modems are installed.As per the researchers, double layer IoT protection is quite common in corporate entities as these never rely upon built-in IoT authentication and usually, they implement an additional layer of protection through the firewall.\u201cAlthough such corporate devices can be lesser in number, getting control of corporate environment routers can be more valuable for an attacker as it can lead to targeted IoT attacks,\u201d wrote the researchers.In an email to HackRead, Mr. Ruben Landeros Jr., Director of Information Technology at Zyxel has revealed that \u201cThe vulnerability has been corrected through a solution that we have already deployed to our customers in Dec 2017.\u201dFeature image via DepositPhotos", "title": "New IoT Botnet DoubleDoor Bypass Firewall to Drop Backdoor"}, {"date": "February 14, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["backdoor", "Cryptomining", "Cyber Crime", "Fantomcoin", "hacking", "Mawlare", "Monero", "security", "Telegram", "Windows", "ZCash"], "body": "Another day, another popular app compromised to drop backdoor and conduct cryptomining.Telegram Messenger\u2019s critical zero-day flaw that according to Kaspersky Labs researchers was widely being exploited by cybercriminals since March 2017 to distribute a relatively newer kind of malware on computers has now been fixed by the messenger developers. The vulnerability was equipped with numerous capabilities such as the establishment of a backdoor Trojan and cryptomining.As per malware analyst at Kaspersky Labs Alexey Firsh; \u201cWe have found several scenarios of this zero-day exploitation that, besides general malware and spyware, was used to deliver mining software \u2014 such infections have become a global trend that we have seen throughout the last year.\u201dAttackers were able to exploit the flaw in the Telegram instant messenger\u2019s desktop app for Windows OS. This flaw is identified in the right-to-left override or RLO Unicode coding method, which is a text-formatting standard typically used for coding languages that are written in Hebrew and Arabic but they somehow reversed the order of the code by using a hidden Unicode character in the file name.Using the Unicode formatting *U+202E* attackers were able to alter the code to hide malicious files and make them appear harmless to download them on the targeted computer. They were also able to modify the file extension to deceive victim into downloading something entirely different than what it appeared to be. Such as, a user can be tricked into believing that a .png file is being downloaded while it could actually be a .js file that runs javascript to inject malicious code into the computer.A downloader coded in .NET using the Telegram API as its command protocol can easily launch an altered start registry key on the desktop to let an attacker gain control of the device. The backdoor lets attacker carry out a number of malicious activities on the targeted system such as launching, downloading and removing files as well as accessing web browser history.According to researchers, the attackers are based in Russia since only Russian cybercriminals were aware of this particular flaw and the commands are also implemented in the Russian language. It is believed that attackers could have stolen Telegram directories that included information about the files exchanged by the victims as well as personal communications data.Furthermore, the flaw can be used to conduct various kinds of attacks such as to gain full control of the machine remotely and to drop other malware such as keyloggers or tailor the Telegram malware to mine cryptocurrency including Fantomcoin, Monero, and ZCash. If mining operation continues for a longer period then the excessive use of CPU power would overheat the machine ultimately rendering it useless while the victim would remain oblivious to whatever is happening to the computer.It is yet unclear how much attackers were able to earn from this malicious scheme but researchers noted that the attacks subsided after Telegram was informed about the vulnerability. Although the flaw has been fixed users need to remain cautious and stay protected by not downloading untrusted files from unknown or unverified sources. Moreover, it is a good idea to immediately update the Telegram Messenger Desktop App for Windows to its latest version in order to prevent your device from being exploited.", "title": "Flaw in Telegram Windows App Used for Cryptomining & Backdoor"}, {"date": "February 13, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Android", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cryptojacking", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Monero", "Privacy", "Scam", "security"], "body": "Newly Identified Drive-by Monero Cryptomining Campaign Targeted Millions of Android Devices in Few Months.Hackers usually rely upon infected or rather trojanized applications and redirect notices to carry out a certain kind of online scam called malvertising and nowadays they are increasingly relying on carrying out cryptomining through these very techniques.In their campaign, Android devices are being targeted quite frequently and in a majority of cases, the sole reason behind devices getting infected is that users ignore installing security apps and do not web filtering on their cell phones. That\u2019s why hackers have easily managed to hijack probably millions of Android devices within a few months only for mining Monero coins in the newly discovered drive-by cryptomining campaign.Malwarebytes identified this campaign in January 2018 but they believe that it started in November 2017. Researchers identified it while investigating another campaign called EITest in January. While inspecting different malvertising chains that led to tech support scams through a user-agent of Chrome or Internet Explorer browser on Windows, they noticed that while switching to Android device they got redirected to that cryptomining webpage.In this new campaign, hackers managed to trick unsuspecting Android users into redirecting them to fake, malicious web pages that were designed to carry out in-browser cryptomining through exploiting the processor in order to generate Monero coins (XMR). The campaign has affected millions of mobile users.Drive-by mining can be understood as an automated process of exploiting CPU\u2019s power. It occurs silently and secretively without requiring the consent of the user and displays a CAPTCHA code \u2018w3FaSO5R\u2019 to the user through this message:\u201cYour device is showing suspicious surfing behavior. Please prove that you are human by solving the captcha.\u201dWhen the user enters this code and clicks on Continue, the device will start mining for Monero using 100% CPU power while some users are redirected to Google\u2019s home page. Various similar domains are using this CAPTCHA code but still, they have different Coinhive site keys, the first key was registered in late November 2017 while new domains kept on being created afterward but the template remained the same.Malwarebytes researchers have so far identified five such domains and two of them had more than 30 million visits per month and the cumulative traffic from these domains totaled around 800,000 visits per day. According to Jerome Segura, Malwarebytes\u2019 lead malware intelligence analyst:\u201cWe believe there are several more domains than just the few that we caught, but even this small subset is enough to give us an idea of the scope of this campaign. It is difficult to determine how much Monero currency this operation is currently yielding without knowing how many other domains (and therefore total traffic) are out there. Because of the low hash rate and the limited time spent mining, we estimate this scheme is probably only netting a few thousand dollars each month.\u201dThis code has been hardcoded in the webpage\u2019s source code and it is quite odd that it is able to effectively verify traffic between a bot and a human and redirecting to Google\u2019s page is also another odd occurrence. While users are busy solving the code, the site starts running an extensive and exhaustive cryptojacking script that uses the CPU power to its fullest and mines Monero. This process is so exhausting for the device that it can render the mobile useless if continued for a longer duration.Researchers believe that this campaign might be not be targeted against bots but to low-quality traffic and instead of serving regular ads the hijackers chose to use browser-based Monero miner to make more profit.\u201cUntil the code (w3FaSO5R) is entered and you press the Continue button, your phone or tablet will be mining Monero at full speed, maxing out the device\u2019s processor,\u201d wrote Segura.It was just a couple of days ago when it was reported that hackers had hijacked thousands of UK and US government websites for the sole purpose of generating Monero cryptocurrency. Moreover, popular websites like YouTube, BlackBerry, Starbucks and even the computer system of Russia based world\u2019s largest oil pipeline company Transneft was hacked to mine Monero.", "title": "Millions of Android Phones Hacked to Mine Monero Coins"}, {"date": "February 13, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Browsealoud", "Cryptocurrency", "Cryptojacking", "Fraud", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Monero", "Scam", "security", "UK", "USA"], "body": "There were thousands of UK and US government websites mining Monero including UK\u2019s NHS and US\u2019s Court.It has been raining on cryptocurrency in 2018 especially Bitcoin whose value touched the sky and made people millionaires in days. It also encouraged hackers and cybercriminals to take advantage of the situation and make easy money but the price for it is being paid by unsuspected users.On February 11th, an IT security researcher Scott Helme discovered that there are over 4,000 government websites that have been hacked to mine Monero cryptocurrency including the official website of American court system (uscourts.gov), the website of U.K.\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ico.org.uk), U.K.\u2019s General Medical Council (GMC), National Health Service (NHS) and United States Social Security Administration.According to Helme\u2019s blog post, the targeted websites were infected with a malware that has been using the computing power of sites visitors to mine Monero. Remember, the technique in which websites are compromised to mine cryptocurrency is also known as in-browser cryptojacking in which CPU power of unsuspected website visitors is secretly used by hackers to generate cryptocurrency while users end up with expensive electricity bills.Upon further digging, Helme found that hackers compromised a popular Browsealoud plugin to make their way into the government websites and infected them with cryptocurrency mining malware. The Browsealoud plugin helps visitors access content on websites including dyslexia patients, users not familiar with the English language and mild visual impairments.There are over 3 million Browsealoud users around the world while 6,000 websites are currently using the plugin. However, this time the plugin was used for malicious purposes allowing hackers to manipulate its original code with a Javascript code provided by Coinhive, a company that provides cryptocurrency miner and sends any coins mined to the browser of the websites\u2019 owners.Hey @texthelp you've been compromised, you need to address this ASAP.

The affected service has been taken offline, largely mitigating the issue. Government websites continue to operate securely. At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that members of the public are at risk.\u201dNow that the authorities are aware of the situation Helme fears hackers can pull a similar stunt in the future which could be devastating. The news came as a shock since the general perception about government owned websites is that they are secured and scanned for malware and malicious codes by their administrators on regular bases.Brandon Dixon, VP at digital threat management firm RiskIQ told HackRead \u201cWe are seeing threat actors around the world exploiting what is already a hostile currency in a lawless digital world. Threat actors hack vulnerable sites or spin up fake, illegitimate websites to siphon money off of major brands, often with typosquatting domains and fraudulent branding. By leveraging domains or subdomains that appear to belong to major brands, these actors trick people into visiting their sites running cryptocurrency mining scripts to monetize their content. When we looked at domains running the cryptocurrency mining script Coinhive, we found many examples of typosquatting and domain infringement,\u201d The IT security community is rightly worried about the sudden surge in cryptocurrency mining attacks. Some are even considering it as a replacement for ransomware. Lately, some high-profile websites and institutions have been found infected with cryptocurrency mining malware including YouTube, Oracle, BlackBerry, Starbucks and even the Russia based world\u2019s largest oil pipeline company Transneft.In December last year, Sucuri security firm identified 5,000 WordPress websites were infected with CoinHive cryptocurrency miner scripts and generating Monero through visitors computing power.

It must be noted that the RFNC-VNIIEF is a federal nuclear facility in Russia and it is the same institute where the first nuclear bomb in the Soviet Union was developed.The RFNC-VNIIEF\u2019s head of press service and Institute\u2019s official spokesperson Tatyana Zalesskaya stated that there was an \u201cunsanctioned attempt\u201d to make use of office computer facilities for \u201cprivate purposes including so-called mining.\u201d\u201cTheir activities were stopped in time. The bungling miners have been detained by the competent authorities. As far as I know, a criminal case has been opened regarding them,\u201d Zalesskaya added.As of now neither Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) nor the Institute has revealed the number of engineers detained or the criminal charges implied on the arrested individuals. However, according to reports, they were trying to connect the supercomputer at RFNC-VNIIEF lab to the internet for cryptocurrency mining.The Sarov based RFNC-VNIIEF is a secretive facility, which is not even mentioned in Soviet maps and Russian military guards it 24/7. The nature of work at this facility is such that no computer installed at the institute can be connected to the internet, not even the 1-petaflop capable supercomputer that can easily perform a quadrillion operations within a second. Since somebody tried to connect it to the internet, therefore the FSB quickly identified this activity and an investigation was launched.According to Zalesskaya, companies having extensive computing capacity have been trying to harness their resources for mining cryptocurrency but such schemes will be severely \u201csuppressed at our enterprises [because] this is technically a hopeless and criminal offense.\u201dBBC reports that the top-secret nuclear facility in Russia has around 20,000 employees and it houses the strongest supercomputers in the entire country. One thing that instantly hits us is that Russia is tightening its grip on crypto-miners and those involved in mining.This is not the first time that computers at a high-profile Russian government institution were caught in the middle of mining cryptocurrency. In December 2017, Transneft, a state-owned largest oil pipeline company in the world had its computers used to mine Monero cryptocurrency however the company claimed it was a cyber attack rather than an inside job.Image credit: DepositPhotos", "title": "Russian scientists caught using nuclear facility supercomputer to mine Bitcoin"}, {"date": "February 10, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Apple", "GitHub", "iBoot", "internet", "iOS 9", "iPhone", "LEAKS", "Privacy", "Technology"], "body": "Apple has been going through a rough phase lately and now the company is in hot waters again since the baseband source code for various iPhone models has been shared online. Needless to say that this would pave the way for software-based device unlocks.Apple had noted earlier that the iBoot source code leak was genuine but also mentioned that the source code was created around three years back for iOS 9 and wasn\u2019t officially released to public domain. Therefore, there was nothing to worry about because the source code is out-dated.Furthermore, Apple stated that its products\u2019 security never relies upon the confidentiality of the source code but now that the baseband source code has been released online, Apple couldn\u2019t come up with an instant response. Reportedly, Apple has now sent a DMCA legal notice to GitHub for taking down the baseband source code and to remove it altogether.\u201cThe \u201ciBoot\u201d source code is proprietary and it includes Apple\u2019s copyright notice. It is not open-source.\u201dGitHub was quick to respond and took down the code immediately. However, the act of sending notice to GitHub has further reinforced the fact that the leaked code is indeed genuine.It is worth noting that the source code was present on GitHub and the code happened to be that of a core component of iPhone OS. Due to its unceremonious leaking online, hackers and security researchers would easily identify flaws in iOS software as well as carry out jailbreaks without much difficulty. That\u2019s because the iBoot code is part of iOS and its responsibility is to verify that the OS is being booted appropriately.In fact, it is the iBoot program that loads the iOS and turns on the iPhone. It is also responsible for verifying that kernel is signed by Apple before executing it. You can say that it is the BIOS of iOS devices. Although Apple is claiming that the software is out-dated but experts noted that some of its portions are still being used, for instance, it is present in iOS 11.According to the author of multiple books on Mac OSX and iOS internal structures, Jonathan Levin, this leak is the \u201cbiggest\u201d in the history of leaks and for Apple, this particular setback is a \u201chuge deal\u201d for sure. Levin stated that the leaked baseband code indeed is real iBoot code because he himself reverse engineered it.Levin fears that due to the leaking of the iBoot code, now tethered jailbreaks would make a comeback, which basically means that the phone has to be connected to a computer to be booted. Since Apple has started embedding advanced security mechanisms in its iOS devices, such jailbreaks had become difficult to pull off and only highly skilled experts could think of attempting them. Perhaps this is why the jailbreaking community is so excited and thrilled on the news of leaking of iBoot\u2019s baseband code.\u201ciBoot is the one component Apple has been holding on to, still encrypting its 64-bit image, and now it\u2019s wide open in source code form,\u201d Levin told MotherBoard.", "title": "Apple\u2019 iBoot Baseband Code for Various iPhone Models Leaked on GitHub"}, {"date": "February 6, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Money", "Privacy", "security", "Vulnerability"], "body": "Ledger hardware wallet that is currently operating in the cryptocurrency market is vulnerable to cyber attacks. The vulnerability was identified by unknown security researchers in every single hardware wallet that allows cybercriminals to show fraudulent addresses to Ledger users/customers. When funds are requested to these addresses, the cryptocurrency is transferred to the attacker\u2019s wallet instead of the user. Needless to say that the user will end up losing their funds.Hardware wallets are usually considered the safest option for storing cryptocurrency but the one million users who have been affected by the newly identified threat to Ledger\u2019s hardware wallets makes it evident that even these cannot offer foolproof protection.The flaw was acknowledged by Ledger on February 3rd via a Tweet on its official Twitter account where the company also shared a report [PDF] that described the vulnerability in details. The report stated that a Ledger wallet creates a brand new address every time a payment is to be received but through man-in-the-middle attack, while the user is trying to generate this address in order to transfer cryptocurrency to their wallet, the amount would be transferred to a fraudulent address if the computer is infected with malware.After compromising the computer, the attacker can secretly replace the code that generates the unique address, which causes the problem of depositing the funds to the attacker\u2019s wallet. \u201cAn attacker could be in control of your computer screen and show you a wrong address which would make him the beneficiary [sic] of any transaction sent to it,\u201d the report highlighted.It happens so because the wallet uses a JavaScript code running on the computer. If the computer is infected with a malware all it needs is replacing the code that generates the receiving address with the code that leads to the attacker\u2019s wallet.The report mentions that to prevent attack users must verify whether the wallet address is correct or not before transferring funds. This can be done by clicking on the button under the QR CODE. This button will display the address of the hardware wallet and users will be able to verify the address.The report also explained that the module is not applicable on the Ether wallet interface from Ledger since the Ethereum app does not have mitigation and hence, the user cannot verify if the address is correct or incorrect.Therefore, authors of the report, who haven\u2019t been named by the company as yet, suggest that \u201cIf you\u2019re using the Ethereum App \u2013 Treat the ledger hardware wallet the same as any other software-based wallet, and use it only on a Live CD operating system that is guaranteed to be malware-free.

We\u2019ve received a single reply, asking to hand over the attack details. Since then, all our mail have been ignored for 3 weeks, finally receiving an answer that they won\u2019t issue any fix/change,\u201d said researchers.\u201cCTO of Ledger replies that no fix/change would be done (our recommendation to enforce the user to validate the receive address has been rejected), but they will work on raising public awareness so that users can protect themselves from such attacks,\u201d researchers concluded.Related: How to Safely Store Cryptocurrency \u2013 Review of 5 Safest Bitcoin Wallets", "title": "All Ledger hardware wallets vulnerable to man in the middle attack"}, {"date": "February 6, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Apple", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "hacking", "Mac", "Malware", "Monero", "Scam", "security"], "body": "Another day, another cryptocurrency miner targeting users \u2013 This time, MacUpdate site has been hacked to drop cryptocurrency miner on Mac devices.MacUpdate, a well-known software download, and aggregator platform, has become a victim of a hack attack and the service is now distributing cryptocurrency miners to Mac users, revealed SentinelOne\u2019s security researcher Arnaud Abbati.Dubbed CreativeUpdate trojan/miner, by Abbati, the malware is a dropper of the open source developer tool Platypus that downloads a miner from Adobe Creative Cloud servers \u2013 Whoever has downloaded links from February 1 to February 2, 2018, is currently at risk.Cybercriminals apparently infiltrated the MacUpdate website to distribute the malware. They installed modified copies of the cryptomining apps OnyX, Firefox and Deeper and replaced the download links for each of these modified apps with links that led users to malicious domains. According to Thomas Reed from Malwarebytes, the fake domains show URLs that were already modified but looked legit and convincing to users. OnyX and Deeper are developed by Titanium Software, which can be accessed at titanium-software.fr, but the link has been maliciously altered as titaniumsoftware.org to redirect users to download URLs from this unauthentic address. This new domain was registered on 23rd January but its owner is remained obscured. Conversely, the unauthentic Firefox app is being distributed through fake URL download-installer.cdn-mozilla.net instead of Mozilla.net.What happens is that the user is requested to store the app into the Applications folder, which is a common requirement even with the original apps. The applications have been created by Platypus, a developer tool that produces full macOS apps from various scripts like Python or Shell scripts.MacUpdate trojan/miner is a Platypus dropper downloading a miner from Adobe Creative Cloud servers.https://t.co/62nT9WyBJy https://t.co/lK1GapwFoH https://t.co/l812l8ZWrk https://t.co/1mrYBrpem2https://t.co/sm3J5TIlin\u2014 noar (@noarfromspace) February 2, 2018\u201cThis means the creation of these applications had a low bar for entry,\u201d noted Abbati.Decoy copies of the authentic app are also present in the malware so that users don\u2019t get suspicious. When the fake apps are installed, a payload is installed from the legitimate URL public.adobecc.com, which opens a copy of the original app and activates the malware.The success rate of this method isn\u2019t hundred percent always. As Reed noted:\u201cFor example, the malicious OnyX app will run on Mac OS X 10.7 and up, but the decoy OnyX app requires macOS 10.13. This means that on any system between 10.7 and 10.12, the malware will run, but the decoy app won\u2019t open to cover up the fact that something malicious is going on. In the case of the Deeper app, the hackers got even sloppier, including an OnyX app instead of a Deeper app as the decoy by mistake, making it fail similarly but for a more laughable reason.\u201dWhen MacUpdate learned about the issue, it immediately apologized and a statement as issued by the site\u2019s editor apart from offering instructions on removing the malware:\u201cIf you have installed and run Firefox 58.0.2, OnyX or Deeper since 1 February 2018, please accept my apologies, but you will need to follow these steps to remove a Bitcoin miner which hacked versions of those apps installed. This is not the fault of the respective developers, so please do not believe them. The fault is entirely mine for having been fooled by the hackers.\u201dTo remove the malware, users need to delete all the copies that are titled Firefox, Deeper and/or OnyX and download/install fresh copies. Access your home directory in Finder via Cmd-Shift-H, if the folder is not displayed press the Option/Alt key and click on Go menu where you must select Library (Cmd-Shift-L). Now, scroll down to find the folder mdworker and delete this folder. Access LaunchAgents folder via ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and delete MacOS.plist (~/Library/LaunchAgents/MacOS.plist) and MacOSupdate.plist (~/Library/LaunchAgents/MacOSupdate.plist). Finally, clean the Trash folder and restart the computer.Furthermore, Reed recommends that users must directly download apps from the developer\u2019s official website instead of the Mac App Store as there is no guarantee if the app would be authentic or not. Reed stated that there is always a possibility that your device will be infected with scams, malware or adware. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the software is authentic.\u201cBe aware that the old adage that \u2018Macs don\u2019t get viruses,\u2019 which has never been true, is proven to be increasingly false. Do not let yourself believe that Macs don\u2019t get infected, as that will make you more vulnerable,\u201d writes Reed.Image credit: DepositPhotos/MonsitRelated: BitTorrent Client \u2018Transmission\u2019 Dropping Keydnap Malware on Mac Devices", "title": "MacUpdate Hacked to Distribute Mac Cryptocurrency Miner"}, {"date": "February 5, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Botnet", "Cyber Crime", "Europol", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "RAT", "Spying", "Surveillance", "TROJAN"], "body": "The popular Luminosity RAT has been shut down by authorities and its users have no access to it anymore.In a joint operation, the law enforcement authorities from Australia, Europe, and North America have shut down a \u201chacking tool\u201d called Luminosity Link RAT (Remote Access Trojan) also known as LuminosityLink. In the operation over a dozen agencies including Europol, UK\u2019s South West Regional Organised Crime Unit and National Crime Agency (NCA) took part leading to the successful shut down of the sophisticated trojan.Luminosity RAT allowed attackers to secretly infect a targeted device by disabling its anti-virus or anti-malware program, spy on the victim by monitoring their online activities, record every keystroke, watch them by enabling their webcam and steal data including login credentials.In a press release, Europol said that Luminosity had over 8,600 users in more than 78 countries and its victims are also believed to be in thousands. Originally, the RAT started targeting victims in May 2015 while the authorities identified its presence in September 2016 on a computer system of a suspect arrested by investigators in Bristol, United Kingdom.NCA has also seized over 100 devices and Internet accounts during the operation which are being analyzed by forensic experts.According to IT security researchers at Kaspersky, Luminosity was also used by Nigerian hackers in their phishing campaign in which their prime targets were industrial companies. It should not come as a surprise since Luminosity\u2019s developers sold it on a website for just \u00a330 ($42 \u2013 \u20ac33).Here, it is noteworthy that authorities shut down Luminosity in September 2017 but only shared the details of the operation now due to \u201coperational reasons.\u201d However, the good news is that the RAT is not functional and those who bought it cannot access it anymore.According to Detective Inspector Ed Heath, head of the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit \u201cThe sale and deployment of this hacking tool were uncovered following a single arrest and the subsequent forensic examination of the computer. \u201cMore than a year\u2019s complex work with international policing partners led us to identify a large number of offenders.\u201dLuminosity might be history but there are thousands of RATs and malware targeting unsuspecting users around the world.

The FBI has also issued a security alert on 1st February informing that it has received complaints from numerous citizens who have reported about receiving emails from the Internet Crime Complaint Centre (IC3). The FBI noted: \u201cAs of December 2017, the IC3 had received over 100 complaints regarding this scam. No monetary losses have yet to be reported.\u201dIt must be noted that the IC3 forum lets users file a complaint to the FBI. The scam email has four different variations, according to the FBI, and each of them claims that the recipient has become a victim of cybercrime or fraudulent campaign and therefore, the complaint center requires private, sensitive data to compensate for the loss. The email has been created in a way that it looks legit; such as it contains hyperlinks to certain news articles that are related to capturing of an online scammer.This fake email also contains a text document that is to be downloaded by the users in order to complete the task. However, this document is infected with malware, which is embedded to further extend the data theft process.

However, the majority of these samples are based upon already existing proof-of-concept coding from numerous security experts but it is indeed concerning that the number of unique samples has increased considerably over the past few weeks. The number of samples collected by AV-Test on January 7th was rather low but by January 21st the company managed to collect a hundred samples and at the end of January, the total count of samples reached 139.AV-Test wrote on Twitter that the 139 samples discovered by its researchers \u201cappear to be related to recently reported CPU vulnerabilities.

Marx stated that it won\u2019t be surprising to identify first targeted attacks or widespread use of malware but he also explained that such attacks will happen only if threat actors find it easy to exploit Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities as they are currently focusing more on ransomware and cryptojacking exploits.\u201cDue to the extremely high number of affected computers/systems and the complexity to \u2018fix\u2019 the Spectre-Meltdown vulnerabilities, I\u2019m sure that the malware writers are just looking for the best ways to extract information from computers and especially browsers,\u201d stated Marx.Marx also believes that the malware developers are currently in the research phase in which they are trying to identify ways to exploit Meltdown and Spectre attacks because most of the samples are either recompiled of extended versions of the proof-of-concepts.\u201cInterestingly, for various platforms like Windows, Linux and MacOS. Besides this, we also found the first JavaScript POC codes for web browsers like Internet Explorer, Chrome or FireFox in our database now,\u201d wrote Marx.On Tuesday Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard Labs published a report after assessing these samples and expressed its concerns regarding the probable potential of Meltdown and Spectre malware targeting enterprises and users. The company concluded that 83% of these samples were proof-of-concept based while the remaining 17% were not publicly shared probably for being under NDA.Fortinet has released various antivirus signatures to defend users against those samples but it would be difficult to detect other exploits that are related to these chip vulnerabilities and patch issues have further complicated the situation. To mitigate the threat Marx suggests that if the PC is not in use for over an hour then it is a wise idea to switch it off and always close the browser while going out on lunch break because it will minimize the attack surface to a great extent and also prevent loss of energy.Image credit: DepositPhotos/BeeBright [1] [2]", "title": "139 Malware Samples Identified that Exploit Meltdown & Spectre Flaws"}, {"date": "February 2, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Cryptocurrency", "Cryptojacking", "Fileless", "internet", "Malware", "Monero", "NotPetya", "NSA", "Privacy", "security", "WannaCry", "WannaMine"], "body": "Forget WannaCry and welcome WannaMine, a fileless cryptojacking malware using leaked NSA exploit called EternalBlue.We cannot ignore the fact that cryptocurrencies are much in demand and monetary worth of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero have soared tremendously, thereby, increasing the purchasing power and liquidity of cryptocurrency wallets. In such a time, cybercriminals were expected to make use of the utterly profitable nature of cryptocurrencies and to do this, they have come up with an extremely productive process known as mining. Through cryptocurrency mining, they can drain energies from even the most powerful computer systems.More: New Monero mining malware infected 500K PCs by using 2 NSA exploitsWhats more disturbing is that now cybercriminals have come up with cryptojacking malware that is solely created to suck the CPU power from computers. One such cryptojacking malware is WannaMine. It uses leaked hacking tools of the NSA (National Security Agency) to gain access to computers and drain off processor power to carry out mining. Here, we must recall the NSA\u2019s Windows exploit known as EternalBlue that was leaked in April 2017 by hacking group Shadow Brokers and was later used to launch the disastrous WannaCry ransomware that caused havoc worldwide and locked down NHS systems. WannaCry ransomware managed to infect around 230,000 computers in nearly 150 countries only to pave the way for another highly dangerous ransomware NotPetya. The same exploit is being used again to carry out Bitcoin and Monero mining using cryptojacking malware WanaMine.WannaMine was identified by cybersecurity firm Panda in October 2017 while the malware was mining Monero after hijacking CPU cycles on the targeted computer. Another cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike stated that they have observed an increment in the distribution rate of WannaMine malware as infections caused by this malicious software have doubled in last few months. In fact, it crippled the operations of various companies for days and weeks and used the resources of their CPUs for Monero mining.WannaMine is a fileless malware that utilizes advanced tactics and techniques to \u201cmaintain persistence within a network and move laterally from system to system. WannaMine uses credentials acquired with the credential harvester Mimikatz to attempt to propagate and move laterally with legitimate credentials.\u201d wrote CrowdStrike security researchers.Hackers are using a wide range of techniques to infect computers from email phishing attacks to remote access hack. Using Mimikatz means that the machines patched against the notorious EternalBlue exploit previously won\u2019t be able to tolerate this malware too. \u201cIf unsuccessful, WannaMine attempts to exploit the remote system with the EternalBlue exploit,\u201d read the blog post by CrowdStrike researchers.WannaMine uses built-in Windows components like Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and PowerShell to perform its malicious tasks. Since it is a fileless malware, hence, it becomes quite difficult to detect it or stop it from harming the computers. Although it isn\u2019t the first ever fileless malware it is indeed quite sophisticated in comparison to other malware like Adyllkuzz that require downloading of an application called CPUMiner to operate.It is worth noting that WannaMine malware isn\u2019t as dangerous as NotPetya or WannaCry were because it does not lock the computers but it does drain off 100% of the IT environment capability of a client by excessively using the CPUs, which is concerning for firms running data centers or server farms. While for individual users it would mean that their PCs or laptops\u2019 performance will deteriorate considerably. To protect your computers, it is important to enhance anti-virus security and install cybersecurity tools to ensure endpoint protection and mitigate WannaMine threat.", "title": "Fileless WannaMine Cryptojacking Malware Using NSA Exploit"}]
