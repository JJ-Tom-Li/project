The malware allows attackers to take over vulnerable devices such as Internet-connected cameras, routers and DVRs, and utilize them for DDoS assaults. Some experts believe this brazen attack could serve as an impetus for change, prompting IoT manufacturers and maybe even device users to be more proactive with security.\n\nThe flaw in most IoT devices is a simple, yet pervasive one \u2013 they are often set with default passwords, which their owners never bother to reset. Bots can then scan for vulnerable IoT devices on the open Internet and attempt to take them\u00a0over using these common passwords.\n\n\u201cMirai must become the wake-up call for the hardware industry, the way that the Code Red and Nimda worms were for the software industry 15 years ago,\u201d said Michael Sutton, CISO at cloud security company Zscaler, in comments emailed to SCMagazine.com. \u201cHardware vendors simply haven't been forced to climb the security learning curve the way that software vendors were forced to. That's about to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIoT devices in general are the perfect platform for attackers to issue DDoS attacks,\u201d said Mordechai Guri, Chief Science Officer of cybersecurity startup Morphisec, in emailed comments. \u201cFirst, they are have full Internet connectivity \u2013 most of the time they\u00a0remain idle, hence can be easily abused for DDoS purposes. Secondly, IoT devices, due to their diversity and complexity, have almost no in-device security products installed... Thirdly, they are prevalent, so botnets on IoT devices in the future may consist of many millions of bots. Finally, such an attack is difficult to mitigate, as most IoT devices are embedded systems.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai accepted responsibility for playing an unintentional role in the incident, issuing a statement that it would recall its home webcams that were\u00a0sold in the U.S. after these products were leveraged in the attack.\n\n\u201cSecurity issues are a problem facing all mankind. Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too,\u201d the company statement said, as reported by BBC News. Though it denied that its webcams comprised the majority of the botnet, the company reportedly said it would improve how its products manage passwords and would also send customers a software patch to harden current devices against similar attacks. \n\n\u201cIt is fantastic to see a vendor owning up to their responsibility in this event,\u201d said Craig Young, cybersecurity researcher for security solution provider\u00a0Tripwire, in emailed comments. \u201cIt is very rare to hear of a vendor doing something like this and I hope that it will be the first of many vendors to react strongly to Friday's attacks.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the onus to prevent such devastating DDoS attack is not solely on IoT manufacturers. Dave Larson, CTO and COO at DDoS prevention and mitigation firm\u00a0Corero\u00a0Network Security, told SCMagazine.com in an interview that a \u201ccommunity effort\u201d is required to quash the DDoS plague.\n\nFor instance, DNS providers such as Dyn must continue to scale their capabilities and bandwidth in order to minimize the impact of such attacks. Moreover, ISPs must leverage their ability to detect spoofed IP addresses and block such malicious traffic at ingress. By doing so, DDoS attacks would \u201cat least go down by an order of magnitude,\u201d said Larson.\n\nUsers, too, must be vigilant about changing their devices default passwords. \u201cYou can't just put something on the Internet and hope. You have a responsibility,\u201d added Larson, noting that Corero tomorrow will announce a newly discovered zero-day DDoS attack vector. \n\nAs the various players in the IoT space grapple with their next move, concern mounts that another DDoS attack could take place at any time.\n\n\"There's been a lot of hypotheses around why this attack is taking place now, and the question is: Is Fridays attack a precursor to something larger?,\u201d said Neil Daswani, CISO at ID protection firm LifeLock, speaking to SCMagazine.com today at a joint conference hosted by the National Cybersecurity Alliance and Nasdaq.\n\nIndeed, looking beyond DDoS, there are a host of frightening ways that Mirai could be leveraged to turn seemingly innocent IoT devices into a juggernaut of malicious machines. \"Think about taking an entire army of bots and turning them into encryption mechanisms so they can crack codes,\" said Hunter. Or, you can \"turn bots into an army of devices that specifically filter, save and steal code and secrets.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ddos/topic/47213/", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberthreats/topic/47239/", "topic_name": "Cyberthreats"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}]}, {"news_name": "DDoS attack Friday hits Twitter, Reddit, Spotify and others", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ddos-attack-friday-hits-twitter-reddit-spotify-and-others/article/567621/", "title": "DDoS attack Friday hits Twitter, Reddit, Spotify and others", "author": "Greg Masters", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/greg-masters/author/3591/", "date": "October 21, 2016", "body": "The East Coast was under siege on Friday morning from a large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that brought down more than a dozen prominent websites, including Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, GitHub, Amazon and Reddit. The initial attack was followed later in the day by at least two more waves of attack.\n\nThe attack against Dyn DNS shuttered a number of widely used sites. Most have returned to normal as of noon EST, although Amazon said it was weakened by a \"hostname\" issue. It wasn't clear whether that glitch was related to the DDoS attack that hit Dyn, a Manchester, N.H.-based\u00a0internet performance management company that also offers domain registration services and email products.\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0global denial-of-service attack on Dyn's \u201cManaged DNS\u201d infrastructure\u00a0was so impactful because it went after the basic internet architecture that ties all those sites together \u2013 the domain name system, or DNS, which redirects internet users from simple web addresses, such as amazon.com, to the companies' actual web servers.\u00a0\n\n\"Because DNS is vital to every person, business and website across the entire internet for system stability and performance, online businesses commonly outsource DNS management to third-party providers who have better and more reliable infrastructures to operate on behalf of their customers,\" Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne, told SCMagazine.com on Friday.\n\nHistorically, he said, this has worked to everyone's benefit. \"However, what we're now seeing is that in light of the way the infrastructure works in the security landscape, they are attractive targets for large-scale DDoS attacks \u2013 because if you take out one of these DNS service providers, you can disrupt a large number of popular online services, which is exactly what we're seeing today.\"\u00a0\n\nGiven the drastic increase lately in the size and scope of DDOS attacks, Grossman said that\u00a0DNS providers are scrambling to increase bandwidth capacity to withstand the latest attacks. That's why we have these providers, he said. They do it so that the rest of us that use them don't have to incur the cost of doing so.\n\n\u201cThis is a reminder of how effective an attack on one can be an effective attack on many,\"\u00a0Intel Security CTO Steve Grobman, told SCMagazine.com on Friday. \"DNS is one of those internet infrastructure capabilities upon which we all rely. An attacker seeking to disrupt services to multiple websites may be successful simply by hitting one service provider such as this, a DNS provider, or providers of multiple other internet infrastructure mechanisms.\"\n\nIt's also a reminder of the risk of relying on multi-tenant service providers, be they DNS or a variety of many other managed cloud service providers, Grobman added.\n\n\"Delegating service capabilities to such multi-tenant service providers has tremendous benefits over traditional architectures where you're responsible for running your own capabilities,\" Grobman said. \"But it also means that if those services are targeted with attacks of significant scale, all tenant services relying on a provider could be impacted.\"\n\nGiven how much of our connected world must increasingly rely upon such cloud service providers, we should expect more such disruptions, Grobman said. \"We must place a premium on service providers that can present backup, failover and enhance security capabilities allowing them to sustain and deflect such attacks.\"\n\n\"As these types of attacks continue to grow in size, frequency and complexity, we must ask ourselves, how can companies prepare for attacks of this astounding new scope and size?,\u201d Steve McGregory, senior director of application and threat intelligence at Ixia, told SCMagazine.com on Friday. One solution he offered was that companies must test to prevent these attacks. \"The size of these DDoS attacks have increased by exponential amounts due to the availability of IoT botnets, which are easily used to attack security cameras, routers, and other connected devices.\"\n\nThe availability of these services and large-scale botnets-for-hire makes it relatively easy to launch an attack that can even disrupt the operations of large, robust public websites that are designed to handle high traffic volumes, McGregory said. \n\n\u201cOrganizations can mitigate the impact of these attacks by reducing their attack surface \u2013 blocking web traffic from the large numbers of IP addresses that are known to be bot-infected, or are known sources of malware and DoS attacks,\" he stated. \"Using an appliance specifically for line-speed IP address filtering can deliver this protection by simply eliminating the malicious traffic, helping to keep resources running.\u201d\n\nDDoS is not a new form of attack in and of itself, but methods and strategies around DDoS continue to evolve in the form of larger and more orchestrated attacks, Paul Calatayud, CTO of FireMon, told SCMagazine.com. \"Often, the measure of the level of sophistication of a DDoS attack comes in the form of measured throughput. The attack details are not known in this particular attack, but recent attacks against [security researcher Brian] Krebs are reported to be upwards of 620 Gbps. That is a tremendous amount of data coming at a target at once.\"\n\nWhat causes Calatayud to pause and reflect most in regard to this breaking news is that Dyn DNS is a DNS SaaS provider whose core job is to host and manage DNS services for its clients. \"The impact and harm has a ripple effect attributed to the various clients Dyn services. As attackers evaluate their targets, and organizations run to the proverbial cloud for various reasons, it introduces interesting targets for the bad guys.\"\n\nSo, what can be done? First, evaluating dependency on cloud providers remains a risk you cannot outsource, said Calatayud. \"Begin to plan for situations where cyberattacks against you may never be directed at you, but rather organizations you come to rely upon.\"\n\nIn the case of this attack and DNS, having a secondary DNS service operating at the same time may have mitigated the impact to organizations even when a primary provider goes down, Calatayud said. \"Cloud governance becomes an element of a CISO security program.\u201d\n\nWill Gragido, director of advanced threat protection at Digital Guardian, agreed that DDoS attacks have become increasingly problematic over the last several years, particularly owing to the rise of botnets. \"Organizations all over the world fall prey to them as do individuals,\" he told SCMagazine.com on Friday. \"In many instances, the underlying attack infrastructure is tied directly to botnets, a type of malicious code and content ecosystem family which the threat research and mitigation community has been attempting to mitigate globally for more than a decade.\"\n\nFurther, with the advent of the internet of things, Gragido said the potential for a botmaster to expand their botnet's size is now greater than ever before. \"Increased size and diversity aids in not only allowing the botmaster to remain in business but also ensures that they are able to carry out their desired outcome when those resources are called upon to do so.\"\n\nOrganizations, he added, need to consider mitigative solutions (services or point products) designed to provide protection against complex, volumetric DDoS attacks on a global basis in order to withstand such attacks.\n\nWhile this particular attack may not have been motivated by extortion,\u00a0a new model of ransom-based attacks \u2013 infrastructure ransom as a service (IRaaS) \u2013 could be on the horizon, motivated to pay off threats for fear of infrastructure-wide customer outages, Thomas Pore, director of IT at\u00a0Plixer, told SCMagazine.com.\n\n\"An infrastructure outage, such as DNS, against a service provider impacting both the provider and customers may prompt a quick ransom payoff to avoid unwanted customer attrition or larger financial impact,\" Pore said.\n\nShould a provider come under attack, customers suffering from the extortion impact may start looking to move their services to another provider capable of mitigating the attacks, Pore said. \"This prediction model could suggest a greater financial impact from customer attrition than paying off a few bitcoin to avoid the attack to begin with.\"\n\nThen what happens if these extortion attempts begin to arrive regularly? This may emerge into a new business model, with a consistent revenue stream, Pore said.\n\n\u201cDespite decades of facing outages due to malformed traffic and data flooding, websites remain highly vulnerable to legacy attack vectors,\" Mike Ahmadi,\u00a0global director \u2013 critical systems security at\u00a0Synopsys, told SCMagazine on Friday.\u00a0\"Website providers need to constantly test their implementations with rigor in order to ensure that they can remain viable in an increasingly hostile environment.\"\n\nThe avalanche of IoT devices has created an environment where software and implementation flaws can be exploited at previously unseen levels, effectively turning them into widely distributed information weapons, Ahmadi said, adding that what may have been adequate robustness in the past no longer holds true.\n\nAs with most software designs from the 1980s, security was generally not considered when creating DNS, Craig Young, security researcher at\u00a0Tripwire, told SCMagazine.com. Rather, the infrastructure was originally designed for early networks like ARPANET to allow human-friendly names in place of traditional network addresses, Young pointed out.\u00a0\"Because the web is so dependent on this system, it becomes a very visible point of failure as is the case today with service provider Dyn.\u00a0Without DNS, there is essentially no internet from the perspective of all but the most sophisticated users.\"\n\nYoung hopes that service providers will take this as a cue that they need to distribute their DNS across multiple providers to avoid this as a single point of failure.\n\n\u201cThey're innovating,\" Chase Cunningham, director of cyber operations at\u00a0A10 Networks, told SCMagazine.com on Friday. \"This is a new spin on an old attack, as the bad guys are finding new and innovative ways to cause further discontent.\"\n\nIt was an interesting point to see that the bad guys are moving upstream for DDoS attacks on the DNS providers, instead of just on sites or applications, Cunningham said.\n\n\u201cThreat actors are leveraging unsecure IoT devices to launch some of history's largest DDoS attacks,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cThe immediate solution is for manufacturers to eliminate the use of default or easy passwords to access and manage smart or connected devices.\"\n\nConsumer adoption will be tricky, he admitted, but this change is critical for the greater security of all. \"This response will hinder many of the global botnets that are created and deployed for malicious use.\u201d\n\nOne thing is certain, Plixer's\u00a0Pore added, DDoS attacks are not going away anytime soon.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ddos/topic/47213/", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}]}, {"news_name": "'Biggest ever' pan-European cyber-security exercise concludes today", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/biggest-ever-pan-european-cyber-security-exercise-concludes-today/article/559396/", "title": "'Biggest ever' pan-European cyber-security exercise concludes today ", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "October 14, 2016", "body": "Cyber Europe 2016, a trans-European coordinated cyber attack simulation, has drawn to a close today, concluding months of exercises and scenarios. \n\nEngaging 28 EU member states plus Switzerland and Norway, the fourth annual exercise involved thousands of cyber-security experts. The last exercise to run was CE2014 which involved around 200 organisations. \n\nThis year's event, running since April, is said to be the largest and most comprehensive EU cyber-security exercise to date. \n\nAccording to ENISA \u2013 the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security \u2013 Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016) was an opportunity for cyber-security professionals to analyse complex, innovative and realistic scenarios. \n\n\u201cFor the first time, a full scenario was developed with actors, media coverage, simulated companies and social media, bringing in the public affairs dimension associated with cyber crises, so as to increase realism to a level never seen before in cyber-security exercises,\u201d ENISA said.\n\nFor the past two days, representatives from more than 300 organisations including national cyber-security agencies, ministries, EU institutions and commercial IT service providers collaborated on addressing a simulated crisis that has been brewing for the past six months. \n\nThe CE2016 scenario \u201cpaints a very dark scenario\u201d and was inspired by threats to critical national infrastructure (CNI), the internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing, using threat vectors as diverse as drones, innovative exfiltration methods, mobile malware and ransomware. \n\nThe motto of the exercise is \u201cStronger Together\u201d and the key to success is cooperation at all levels to stymie transnational threats, according to ENISA. The exercise centred on political and economic policies as they relate to cyber-security, with a special focus on the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive which was recently passed by the EU Parliament. \n\nG\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, European commissioner for the digital economy and society, said the NIS Directive and CE2016 aim to promote cooperation between member states. \u201cWe are only as strong as our weakest link,\u201d he said. \u201cCyber Europe 2016 provides a unique opportunity for Member States, public and private partners to enhance cyber contingency plans and pan-European cooperation.\"\n\nUdo Helmbrecht, executive director of ENISA, said: \u201cThe role of ENISA in assisting the EU Member States for cyber crises is essential, both by organising exercises and by bringing together key stakeholders. Six years have passed since our first cyber crisis simulation and in that time the maturity level and response capability on complex cyber issues has increased. We are better prepared than we were, but that does not mean we have done enough and the work must continue. Cyber-attacks are more sophisticated than before. Cyber-security is not a state, it is a process.\u201d\n\nThe outcomes of CE2016 will be analysed by ENISA and the member states, with detailed lessons shared with the participants to establish a list of actions to improve IT security. Many of the findings of the exercise are useful for the implementation of the NIS Directive, the work of the CSIRT Network and the European cyber cooperation platform, ENISA said. \n\nCE2014 was criticised by a number of sources for failing to address the fundamental problems of inter-governmental communication and disparate incident response standards across borders. \u00a0\n\nHowever, an ENISA spokesperson, addressing these critics, said: \u201cThis kind of cooperation between the EU and EFTA countries is crucial for the strengthening of cross border, transnational cyber-incident management. The importance of this exercise \u00a0is to learn whom to contact, to build trust in between the actors in Europe.

Chris Roberts Acalvio's chief security architect, believes Dropbox should have taken stronger action earlier.\n\n\u201cIt's interesting that user accounts taken in an incident in 2012 are only now \"coming to light\". That's an awfully long time to wait before publicly stating that \"we have an issue\". It's frustrating that the organization potentially knew of the problem, but didn't confirm it, as there was no credible evidence that the data was in the wild?\u201d he told SCMagazine.com in an email. \n\nDropbox did state in 2012 that usernames and passwords had been stolen, but gave no details as to the potential scale of the problem. At that time the cloud storage company did recommend users change their passwords and implement two-factor authentication.\n\nOne of the major takeaways from this incidents, besides the importance of good password management, is the potential danger posed for companies whose employees use cloud-storage. \n\n\u201cBusiness leaders, especially those in IT risk management, must take this as another alarm bell worth hearing,\u201d said Chris Ensey, COO of Dunbar Security Solutions, adding that the huge number of SaaS applications available merely increases the pathways in and out of a company that have to be secured.\n\nEven though the important information were salted and hashed cybercriminals can still make use of the data that was posted in the clear, such as email addresses.\n\nMatthew Gardiner, Mimecast's cybersecurity strategist pointed out to SCMagazine.com in an email that these emails could be used down the road as part of a phishing scam. AdamLevin, chairman of IDT911 said email addresses and other, seemingly benign information can still be used against one of the Dropbox users.\n\n\u201cEmail addresses are at the foundation of our digital identities, as they often contain significant names and/or numbers, such as your birthday, college, or work.

In this survey, a discouraging 60 percent of respondents said that employees at their workplace were either not knowledgeable or had no knowledge at all in cybersecurity, despite the availability of these training programs.\n\nBut before pointing the finger at the workers themselves, consider that it might be the training that is inadequate. Indeed, only 35 percent of respondents said that senior executives within their organization placed a high priority on teaching employees about data threats and their consequences. Perhaps it's not all that surprising then that only 50 percent respondents agreed that their company's current level of employee training actually reduces noncompliant behaviors, while only 43 percent believe the training is effective at minimizing loss or theft of confidential data.\n\nDigging deeper, 43 percent said that their corporate training is comprised of merely one basic course, generalized for all employees across all departments. \u201cThese basic courses often do not provide training on the risks that lead to data breaches,\u201d the report explains. In fact, only 49 percent of survey-takers said that their company's security course includes lessons on phishing and social engineering. Even fewer said that their training program covers mobile device security (38 percent) and cloud security (29 percent).\n\nThat a cybersecurity training course would exclude something as prevalent and pervasive as a phishing attack is at best head-scratching to some experts. \u201cPhishing and social engineering attacks have been shown to result in data breaches. Training programs should show the consequences of these attacks and how to avoid falling prey to them,\u201d said Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of Ponemon Institute, in an emailed statement to SCMagazine.com.\n\nMoreover, only 54 percent of respondents' companies indicated that corporate security training was mandatory at their place of work. \"It just seems unconscionable that you have 60 percent of companies say that employees aren't knowledgeable, but only 45 percent make training mandatory,\u201d Michael Bruemmer, vice president of Experian Data Breach Resolution, told SCMagazine.com.\n\nEven when training is required, many companies have exemptions for certain categories of employees, leaving them susceptible to worker error and also potentially setting a bad example. Of the survey takers who replied that their security programs were mandatory, 29 percent said that C-level executives were excused from participating, while 55 percent said that contract workers were exempted.\n\nFurthermore, only 30 percent of respondents' companies required employees to take or retake the course following a data breach \u2014 a stat that's even more worrisome when considering that 55 percent of respondents said their organization had a security incident or data breach resulting from a malicious or negligent employee.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Banks fail to innovate, blaming info security fears, report", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/banks-fail-to-innovate-blaming-info-security-fears-report/article/528176/", "title": "Banks fail to innovate, blaming info security fears, report", "author": "Jeremy Seth Davis", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/jeremy-seth-davis/author/3634/", "date": "May 25, 2016", "body": "Senior executives at retail banks are motivated to begin offerings available, but are held back by cyber security concerns, according to a new study.

A primary concern is whether data stored on cloud services will continue to be secured. Last month, for example, security researcher Chris Vickery discovered an unsecured MongoDB database that contained information related to over 198,000 past customers of a defunct iPhone app.\n\nNest was acquired by Google in January 2014, then acquired Revolv nine months later in October 2014. At that time, the Revolv device was taken off the market.\u00a0Nest is now owned by Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.\n\nRevolv's announcement contained a FAQ section that included just four questions. The answers bluntly informed customers that their devices would no longer function after May 15th, and there will be no reimbursement. \u201cOur one-year warranty against defects in materials or workmanship has expired for all Revolv products,\u201d the founders wrote.\n\nSpiezle, reacting to that statement, told SCMagazine.com, \u201cIt's certainly going to bring on class action suits against Google in this case.\u201d\n\nNest is working with customers \u201con a case-by-case basis to determine the best resolution, including compensation\u201d, a company representative told SCMagazine.com via email.

The idea was that these organizations fielded such depth and breadth of talent and infrastructure that they could manage all their IT tasks, store all their data and manage their security quite well.\u00a0\n\nBut, arguably, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction, directed by the prevailing winds of reducing capital investments and ongoing maintenance costs, improving technology assets more rapidly, and a growing appreciation for outsourcing opportunities. With that in mind, more and more organizations are utilizing cloud computing, software-as-a service (SaaS) and managed security services providers (MSSPs) to gain greater efficiencies and better scalability and taking advantage of newer technologies and more specialized expertise.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe market for cloud computing and SaaS is exploding,\u201d says Danelle Au, vice president of strategy and marketing for Adallom, a cloud access security broker based in Palo Alto, Calif., that delivers visibility, governance and protection for cloud applications like Salesforce, Office 365, Box, Dropbox and Google Apps. \u201cDevelopment and engineering teams were the first to reap the quick-to-deploy advantages of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS),\u201d she says.\n\n OUR EXPERTS: Cloud\n\nThe next wave of cloud computing that we are already seeing is software-as-a-service, Au says. \u201cInstead of dealing with the day-to-day maintenance of supporting an application, IT can just purchase complete application systems via best-of-breed cloud providers, such as Microsoft Office 365 or Google Apps for email and collaboration, Workday for human capital, Salesforce for customer relationship management, and Box for content management.\u201d\n\nFarshad Ghazi, global product manager for HP Security Voltage, an enterprise data security solutions provider, also sees a \u201cbig shift overall toward all things cloud.\u201d There are obvious reasons for the migration, he says, including cost reduction, lack of internal expertise and limiting the need for more infrastructure and space to house hardware and software internally. These third parties are \u201cdoing a better job at providing the full suite of resources, they have the bandwidth to address [customers'] needs, and an elastic format to expand usage,\u201d Ghazi says.\u00a0\n\nIndeed, the global market for managed security services alone is expected to grow an average of nearly 16 percent compound annual growth rate from 2014 to 2020, reaching an expected $29.9 billion market value by 2020, according to a report released earlier this year by Allied Market Research of Portland, Ore. And, according to KPMG's \u201c2014 Cloud Survey Report: Elevating Business in the Cloud,\u201d nearly three-fourths of enterprises (73 percent) report improved business performance from implementing cloud-based applications and strategies.\u00a0\n\nSean Cordero, director of client services for the Office of the CISO at Optiv Security, a newly launched information security services provider (the result of a merger this summer between Accuvant and FishNet Security), believes the managed provider market \u201cis in a massive state of growth as the value proposition is starting to be realized by enterprises that have made the investment into SaaS and MSSP models.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWith this growth has come a greater awareness of the importance of understanding the security posture of each of their service providers,\u201d Cordero says. \u201cThis has led to a shifting in the discussion related to security, which has helped drive improved transparency between the provider and the customer.\u201d\n\nThis trend has been exacerbated, he adds, by the adoption of standards like the Cloud Security Alliance's [CSA] Cloud Controls Matrix, designed to provide fundamental security guidance to cloud vendors and assist potential cloud customers in assessing security risk; the CSA's Security, Trust and Assurance Registry [STAR] program, a publicly accessible registry designed to recognize the varied assurance requirements and maturity levels of cloud service providers; and review standards like the Service Organization Controls Type II, accounting standards that measure the control of financial information for a service organization, and in particular, tests operating effectiveness over time. Cordero is co-chair of the CSA's Cloud Control Matrix.\n\n\u201cThe market is quickly gaining steam,\u201d says Rob Marano (left), co-founder of The Hackerati, a boutique engineering consultancy based in New York City. \u201cHowever, there is natural inertia despite the increased scrutiny given increasing high-profile breaches, especially with the government.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe key message to enterprises these days, Marano says, is that if you own your own infrastructure, you have a high probability of being breached. The common denominator of many of today's high-profile breaches is that they are corporate-owned and -operated infrastructures, not necessarily cloud computing-based, he adds.\u00a0\n\nVidur Apparao, chief technology officer for Agari, a San Mateo, Calif.-based email SaaS security solutions provider, says that at this point the adoption of some cloud or SaaS solution in the enterprise, across all sectors and sizes, seems \u201cubiquitous.\u201d The difference in actual penetration within an enterprise \u2013 in other words, the number of use cases and departments using cloud or SaaS offerings in a company \u2013 varies by sector and security sensitivity, he says. Although, more recently, new offerings have emerged that appeal to specific regulated sectors, such as industry-specific clouds for financial services, government and health care. These cloud offerings take into account the regulations governing each specific sector, Apparao says, and are therefore more attractive to compliance- and security-sensitive organizations and agencies.\u00a0\n\nAnother recent change is the realization by many SaaS companies that they need to adopt a more \u201csecurity-first approach\u201d to convince prospective enterprise customers to make the jump from on-premise solutions, especially for sensitive data. Apparao singles out Box as one such security-first provider, since Box has focused at a marketing and product level on demonstrating to customers that their business-critical documents are safe in the cloud. \u201cSecurity at most companies has been a back-office function,\u201d Apparao says, \u201cbut now it's a business enabler and differentiator for progressive cloud and SaaS companies.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/critical-infrastructure/topic/47217/", "topic_name": "Critical Infrastructure"}]}, {"news_name": "Silverlight exploit now used in Angler Exploit Kit", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/as-kaspersky-labs-researchers-predicted-exploits-of-silverlight-vulnerability-are-now-in-the-angler-exploit-kit/article/527984/", "title": "Silverlight exploit now used in Angler Exploit Kit", "author": "Jeremy Seth Davis", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/jeremy-seth-davis/author/3634/", "date": "February 24, 2016", "body": "The exploits of a Silverlight vulnerability discovered by Kaspersky Labs, has now \u2013 as the Russian cybersecurity firm predicted \u2013 made its way into the Angler Exploit Kit.\n\nThe CVE-2016-0034 vulnerability was patched as part of Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update last month.

Industry sources expect customers will more aggressively evaluate threat intelligence vendors. \u201cI think threat intel feeds will be vetted better,\u201d said RiskAnalytics director of threat intelligence Wayne Crowder. He expected customers to ask difficult questions vendors and demand that they differentiate threat data.\n\nThe scenario customers purchasing threat intelligence data for a six-figure fee will decline, he said, noting. \u201cThe \u00e0 la carte option that applies to a specific sector or vertical may increase.\"\n\nPaul Mockapetris, chief scientist at ThreatSTOP and inventor of the Domain Name System (DNS), said the situation is a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to figure out what products actually work. However, he doesn't believe consumers will be able to determine the products and services that are most effective. \u201cThe analyst community and journalists are going to need to ask the hard questions,\u201d he said. For instance, last year Norse was placed on the industry's Cybersecurity 500 list.\n\nThe Norse website was offline on Sunday, then went back online temporarily on Monday and Tuesday, and was offline again as of press time.\n\nKrebs reported that Norse's assets could be folded into SolarFlare, citing anonymous sources. A distressed sale to SolarFlare could make sense; the security software and hardware provider shares one of Norse's main investors, the venture capital firm Oak Investment Partners. The firm invested $10 million in Norse's series A, led by Oak Investment Partners partner Bandel Carano in 2013. (Norse raised another $11.4 million from KPMG in a Series A1 transaction in September 2015.)\n\nThe backend infrastructure that Norse created could be valuable to a buyer, said Crowder. He told SCMagazine.com, \u201cThe challenge for anyone who buys it will be in communicating how the product will differ from Norse.\u201d\n\nThe Norse meltdown will certainly affect the venture funding landscape for threat intelligence companies, and could even have an impact on funding for the cyber security sector in general.\n\nVenture investments into cybersecurity companies tend to differ from the traditional VC model in which investors assume most of their investments into startups may fail, while the successes fetch high multiples that justify the rest of the portfolio. Cyber security investments tend to be more conservative. That pattern is likely to increase following Norse, said RedSeal CEO Ray Rothrock.\n\n\u201cI hate to see it, but this may be the result of too much money in the business,\u201d said Rothrock, previously a partner at venture firm Venrock Associates. Recent investment data suggests he may be right. According to CB Insights, cybersecurity investments increased from $1.1 billion to $3.8 billion, or 235 percent growth over the past five years.\n\nMockapetris at ThreatSTOP said he expects cybersecurity will continue to attract investors. Speaking with SCMagazine.com, he said, \u201cThe fact that investors pour so much money into cyber companies proves that it's an unmet need.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberthreats/topic/47239/", "topic_name": "Cyberthreats"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}]}, {"news_name": "Intel agencies will target newer, encryption-free tech for surveillance programs: Harvard report", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/intel-agencies-will-target-newer-encryption-free-tech-for-surveillance-programs-harvard-report/article/528447/", "title": "Intel agencies will target newer, encryption-free tech for surveillance programs: Harvard report", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "February 02, 2016", "body": "\nA report\ntoday from Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society tosses\nsome cold water on the hotly contested debate over encryption vs. security,\nasserting that even if pro-encryption privacy advocates prevail, there are\nnewly emerging avenues for intelligence agencies to conduct surreptitious\ndigital surveillance.\n\nThe report, \u201cDon't Panic. Making Progress on the Going Dark Debate,\u201d predicted that\nin lieu of backdoors to encrypted messaging apps, law enforcement will increasingly\nturn to less fortified vectors to conduct offensive online investigations,\nincluding Internet of Things (IoT)\u00a0devices, cloud-based services and apps whose\nbusiness models rely heavily on customer data collection.\n\nReflecting\nthe input of security experts across academia, civil society and the\nintelligence community, the report suggests that IoT devices, particularly\nthose enhanced with networked sensors, cameras and microphones, could serve as\nespecially powerful surveillance tools.\n\n\u201cThese are\nprime mechanisms for surveillance: alternative vectors for\ninformation-gathering that could more than fill many of the gaps left behind by\nsources that have gone dark\u2014so much so that they raise troubling questions\nabout how exposed to eavesdropping the general public is poised to become,\u201d the\nreport cautions. For instance, smart TV manufacturers could potentially be\nordered to let federal investigators eavesdrop on their customers'\nconversations via mechanisms that normally enable voice-based commands.\n\nThe report\nalso notes that in some cases, \u201cMarket forces and commercial interests will\nlikely limit the circumstances in which companies will offer encryption that\nobscures user data from the companies themselves.\u201d For example, online service\nproviders whose advertising models necessitate ample customer data collection\nwill not be inclined to offer encryption services; therefore, their data would\nremain visible to investigators. Same goes for cloud-based services, as\nend-to-end encryption is currently impractical for any cloud-based features\nthat require access to plaintext data, such as full text search.\n\nThe report\nalso notes that metadata\u2014still an important investigative tool\u2014remains\nunencrypted and is likely to remain so in the future.\n\nPaul\nFerguson, threat research advisor at\u00a0Trend Micro,\ntold SCMagazine.com that\nhe largely agreedwith the report's premise. \u201cThe\ntechnology behind a lot of new and emerging services are not built around\nprivacy or security, so it leaves a lot of wiggle room for an adversary to get\naccess to sensitive information, whether that is browsing history, cell phone call detail records, ISP logs, etc.,\u201d said\nFerguson. In this instance, the adversary would be a domestic intelligence\nagency, though it could equally refer to cybercriminals or nation-state actors.\n\nMerritt Maxim, senior analyst at Forrester Research, was\nless convinced that IoT devices and networked sensors currently constitute a\nviable channel for digital surveillance. \u201cIt's a possibility, but the [IoT]\nmarket is still emerging. There are no standards for exchanging or sharing data,\u201d\nsaid Maxim. \u201cAs the market matures, and interfaces and data exchange become\nmore standardized, it might be easier to gather data from sensors.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Industry pros concerned with AWS free cert offering", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/industry-pros-concerned-with-aws-free-cert-offering/article/528399/", "title": "Industry pros concerned with AWS free cert offering", "author": "Jeremy Seth Davis", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/jeremy-seth-davis/author/3634/", "date": "January 26, 2016", "body": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering free digital certificates to help companies automate use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols.\n\nThe announcement has been met with skepticism from some industry pros, in light of a similar move by the open certificate authority Let's Encrypt.\n\nLet's Encrypt began offering open source certificates in September, and then rolled its free SSL certificates out of beta earlier this month.

Those emails were held on a server in Ireland, not the US, bringing to the fore a problem of jurisdiction which has long plagued politicians and regulators. \n\nMicrosoft refused to hand over the emails, saying that the US has no power to ask for that data, as it is held in another country and well outside of their jurisdiction. In April 2014, a federal judge ordered Microsoft to cough up those records to which Microsoft gave largely the same answer as before and was found in contempt of court. The case now sits in a US appeals court, awaiting a decision by a more senior judge. \n\nThe question of national jurisdiction when it comes to the internet has been the bugbear of many a politician. How does one impose national legislation on data or activities that by their nature can switch from one country to another in a second, or occur in multiple jurisdictions at once?\u00a0\n\nIt's a question that has been long waiting in the wings to be answered.\u00a0\n\nThe impact of this case has been made only more intense by the European Court of Justice's smackdown of the European Safe Harbour agreement, which had created a legal channel for the transfer of information between the US and Europe. \n\n\u201cI am not sure that the implications are as profound as they might appear to be,\u201d said Dai Davis, a technology lawyer with extensive experience in cyber-related issues.\u00a0\n\nDavis is sceptical about the broader legal significance of this case: \u201cThese proceedings are because the United States government asked for information in a certain way,\u201d said Davis -- if they had asked for the information using other legislation, there would be no dispute.\n\nSo why go to Microsoft, instead of the Irish government? After all, the desired data is stored in Irish jurisdiction and such a lengthy controversial dispute could have been avoided by merely using the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty meant to foster cooperation in law enforcement matters between the two countries. \n\nThe US government claims that considering Microsoft is a US-based company they need not use that treaty because Microsoft can get that requested information quite literally at the push of a button. The requested information is being asked for under the 1986 Stored Communications Act (SCA), which allows the government to compel companies to hand over any data they own in pursuit of an investigation. The fact that the data in question is in another country, does not seem to matter.\n\nJohn Frank, deputy general counsel and VP of legal and corporate affairs at Microsoft, told trade press earlier this week, \u201cThese are the private communications of our customers. They're not ours. We don't have access to them. We don't want access to them.\u201d\n\nThis could be a matter of principle for Microsoft, who has voluntarily put itself in contempt of court, claiming it is not compelled to deliver the requested information because it is not actually owned by the company, but being hosted by it. \n\n\u201cThat's a very different position to saying that any data stored with a cloud provider is a business record of that cloud provider, that can then be turned over to the government. That is a very dangerous precedent,\u201d Frank continued. \n\nMicrosoft appears to be saying that the 1986 Act would only apply if this data were owned by Microsoft within the US. The fact that it's not, says Microsoft and its supporters, raises questions about judicial sovereignty. \n\nThe global software firm also claims that if the US government were allowed to extract data from foreign territories for the purpose of law enforcement, other countries might be able to do the same. Other countries whose definition of law enforcement might extend to say, merely speaking out against the ruling party, would then use that legally extracted data to oppress its citizens. \n\nAndrew Hewson, principal consultant at MTI, lauded Microsoft's rejection of the US government's request, saying that the danger of cooperation \u201ccould set a precedent for any government to demand access to information held in the cloud on the basis that e-mails from private individuals are company records\u201d.\n\nHewson added: \"The business implications for Microsoft, if they give in to the requests of the US government, could be costly as customers may feel that their data is no longer truly private. As a result, they could choose to move their business to a company that operates within countries without a data sharing agreement with the US.\"\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "NSA chief: anti-encryption arguments 'waste of time' as new reports note 'chill' effect", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/nsa-chief-anti-encryption-arguments-waste-of-time-as-new-reports-note-chill-effect/article/529256/", "title": "NSA chief: anti-encryption arguments 'waste of time' as new reports note 'chill' effect", "author": "Jeremy Seth Davis", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/jeremy-seth-davis/author/3634/", "date": "January 22, 2016", "body": "The long-running encryption dispute between law enforcement officials and private sector industry professionals took an unexpected turn Thursday when the National Security Agency's (NSA) director, Admiral Mike Rogers, changed his stance on encryption technologies.\n\n\u201cEncryption is foundational to the future,\u201d Rogers said, speaking at the Washington D.C.-based think tank the Atlantic Council. He said he sees arguments against encryption as \u201ca waste of time.\u201d The comments have left industry pros wondering what prompted the abrupt change in strategy.\n\nThis shift signals that Rogers is coming to agree with former intelligence directors and security professionals who have argued that the task of securing private data on government servers is at least as important to intelligence agencies as having a strong cyber offensive strategy.\n\nFor example,\u00a0Gen. Michael Hayden, a former NSA director and currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations in December, called building backdoors for government \u201ca weak security position.\" He made similar comments in October, when he argued that the U.S. is \u201cbetter served by stronger encryption, rather than baking in weaker encryption\u201d.\n\nAnd in July, former homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff, former homeland security secretary William Lynn, and former NSA Director Mike McConnell wrote an Op-Ed in the Washington Post arguing for end-to-end encryption of data. \u201cThe smart bad guys will find ways and technologies to avoid access, and we can be sure that the \u2018dark Web' marketplace will offer myriad such capabilities,\u201d the former intelligence officials wrote. \u201cThis could lead to a perverse outcome in which law-abiding organizations and individuals lack protected communications but malicious actors have them.\u201d\n\nOf course, government agencies also have an extensive arsenal of malware and zero-day exploits that enable intelligence agencies to bypass encrypted communications.\n\nRecent studies have cast doubts on the approach of keeping information security weak in order to have access to more information about criminals and nation-state enemies. Arguments against encryption miss the point that Americans are less concerned with the possibility of terrorists \u201cgoing dark,\u201d as Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey stated than by a lack of information security.\n\nIn a study published Wednesday by NCC Group and IDG Research Services, 63 percent of consumers said they expect their financial information would be breached within the next year. The report also found that 60 percent of respondents were more worried than ever about protecting their personal and financial information and 87 percent said they see a need for a secure community of safe websites.\n\nThese consumers have good cause for alarm; it isn't only government agencies that have difficulty securing information. \u00a0The private sector also displays a casual approach to private data. In another study published this week, Sophos found that only 57 percent of companies encrypt private employee HR data, and employee healthcare information is encrypted by just 53 percent of companies.\n\nMike Echols, director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Joint Program Management Office, reinforced this view. \u201cThe speed at which we are rolling out our programs and aligning our value systems between small businesses, federal agencies and big businesses is moving a lot slower than the people who are trying to attack us,\u201d he said this week, at the Association of Government Accountants' Financial Systems Summit. He said neither the government agencies nor private enterprise has done enough to prevent hackers from successfully attacking critical systems.\n\nA\u00a0survey\u00a0published by Ponemon Institute and IID in November found that 47 percent of companies and government agencies have been breached in the last two years.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Quarter of respondents would pay ransom to protect stolen data, survey says", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/quarter-of-respondents-would-pay-ransom-to-protect-stolen-data-survey-says/article/530083/", "title": "Quarter of respondents would pay ransom to protect stolen data, survey says", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 14, 2016", "body": "Nearly a quarter (24.6 percent) of company executives and IT leaders would be willing to pay hackers a ransom to prevent them from leaking critically sensitive stolen data, a global survey of \u00a0more than 200 execs and IT managers found.\n\nMoreover, 14\npercent said they would acquiesce to ransom demands exceeding $1 million.\n\n\nA joint\nproject of the Cloud Security\nAlliance and cloud security software provider Skyhigh Networks, the survey and\nits corresponding report provide a window into IT business leaders' views on\ncloud applications and their security implications.

The code is particularly hard to detect as it writes to a computer's registry file in the same place and manner as a benign piece of software.\n\nThe malicious software than hijacks the token used to authenticate the employee's access to the storage site and since the attack avoids the username and password it is hard to discover, the report stated.\n\nHowever, so far corporations have been lucky.\n\n\u201cAt this time we have not seen any [attack] exactly like we describe, but very soon they will come. This could be in the next six to 18 months,\u201d Shulman said.\n\nShulman did point to evidence that criminals are now moving in this direction. He said the APT 29\u00a0Hammertossattack using Twitter accounts as a command and control tool is similar to MITC in that the attack is going after a data storage center using illegally obtained tokens and not a password.\n\nImperva offered a few defensive ideas against such an attack.\n\n\u201cIdentify the compromise of file synchronization account, and even more importantly, identify the abuse of the internal data resource. We believe that the attackers are eventually after the enterprise data rather than the information stored at endpoints. Hence, an attack is bound to express itself by the attacker trying to access business data in a way that is not typical for normal enterprise users,\u201d the report stated.\n\nShulman noted that those tasked with defending their companies are moving too slow and are instead continue to fight attacks at the perimeter and end point. Finally, the storage host firms must also do their part.\n\n\u201cIf someone grabs a password they notice it and tell the end user, but with tokens no notice is given,\u201d he said, adding that it is more difficult, but not impossible, to pick out if a token is not being used properly.

In July, the groups agreed to establish an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for the auto industry, where information on \u201ccyber-related threats and vulnerabilities in motor vehicle electronics or associated in-vehicle networks\u201d could be communicated, the letter said.\n\nThe new framework, which offers \u201cbaseline privacy commitments\u201d for automakers, entails seven principles: transparency among automakers regarding collected or shared information, presenting consumers choice as it pertains to data collected about them, and having \u201crespect for context\u201d \u2013 or considering the impact collected information could have on drivers.\n\nData minimization, collecting and retaining information only as necessary for \u201clegitimate business purpose,\u201d was also one of the seven principles, along with commitments to protect data, and make sure information, such as subscription and registration data, are maintained accurately and can be reviewed and corrected by drivers. Finally, the last principal is accountability \u2013 making sure automakers take \u201creasonable steps to ensure that they and other entities that receive covered information adhere to the principals.\u201d \n\n\u201cCovered information\u201d is defined as \u201cidentifiable information that vehicles collect, generate, record or store in an electronic form\u201d on behalf of participating manufacturers through vehicle technologies and services, the document said. Personal subscription information, provided while individuals subscribe or register for the technology or services, would also fall under compliance protections.\n\nThe voluntary guidelines are meant to protect vehicles manufactured on and after January 2, 2016. \n\nThe document notes that, when compliance requires an engineering change to a vehicle, participating automakers would be expected to rectify the concerns no later than vehicle model year 2018. \n\nLast August, a grassroots security movement called \u201cI am The Cavalry,\u201d introduced a cyber safety program to encourage collaboration between researchers and automakers as vehicles become increasingly connected. \n\nThe initiative called, the \u201cFive Star Automotive Cyber Safety Program,\u201d outlined critical capabilities automakers should demonstrate, including incorporating security in the vehicle design, development and testing phase, and publishing a coordinated disclosure policy for those wishing to report security vulnerabilities in cars. \n\nLast month, the Electronic Privacy Information Center submitted its thoughts to NHTSA on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, technology that transmits data between vehicles to help warn drivers of potential crashes. EPIC suggested that, before V2V capability was required in light vehicles (like passenger cars and light truck vehicles) that NHTSA should agree not to collect PII without the consent of vehicle owners and require end-to-end encryption of V2V communications, among other security measures. \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "NIST finalizes cloud computing roadmap", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/nist-finalized-requirements-and-action-plans/article/538319/", "title": "NIST finalizes cloud computing roadmap", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "October 23, 2014", "body": "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized the first two volumes of its U.S. Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap, laying critical requirements for security, interoperability and portability, addressing cloud migration challenges and defining priority action plans (PAPs) for each requirement.\n\nDesigned to further the 2011 Federal Cloud Computing Strategy's goal \u201cto identify and reach consensus on cloud computing technology & standardization priorities,\u201d the finalized roadmap reflects comments and recommendations to an earlier draft of the first two volumes.\n\nAccording to the report, NIST crafted the program to accelerate U.S. government adoption of cloud and \u201cleverage the strengths and resources of government, industry, academia, and standards organization stakeholders\u201d to spur innovation.\n\nAmong the critical requirements, security maintains a prominent role, with the standards body modifying two from the earlier draft to specify in one that security solutions \u201cmust satisfy\u201d federal government requirements as well as \u201cbe de-coupled from organizational policy decisions.\u201d Noting that IT security has traditionally \u201crelied on logical and physical system boundaries,\u201d which are more complex in cloud computing, NIST said traditional security mechanisms are \u201cless effective.\u201d \n\nIn an attempt to inspire confidence in cloud security, federal IT and security pros need \u201cmore transparent and effectively demonstrated cloud services' security\u201d before they more fully adopt cloud solutions.

Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Chris Coons, D-Del.; and Dean Heller, R-Nev.; introduced the Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad (LEADS) Act (PDF) on Thursday. The bill aims to update ECPA which was enacted three decades ago, in order to make it clear that police warrants requesting electronic communications, such as emails, don't necessarily authorize the seizure of data stored in foreign countries. \n\nThe legislation would potentially help cloud service and email providers tasked with responding to police data requests as well as protecting the information of customers across the globe. \n\nEarlier this month, tech giant Microsoft was held in contempt of court for not complying with a ruling that required it to relinquish customer emails in an Ireland data center to U.S. prosecutors. The order, however, was seen as a measure that would clear the way for Microsoft to appeal the government request for data. \n\nThe LEADS Act requires law enforcement to have a warrant when requesting data stored abroad belonging to a \u201cU.S. person.\u201d An ECPA warrant would not compel U.S. email and cloud service providers to hand over data on other individuals, however, and would force the government to comply with the laws of countries where data it seeks is stored. \n\nGreg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said a Thursday blog post that the organization applauded the bill's \u201coverall thrust,\u201d and its additional provision that the government must notify customers whose data is obtained via a warrant.\n\n\u201cCurrently, when the U.S. government uses warrants to compel service providers to disclose the stored emails of their customers, there is no requirement that the government provide notice of the seizure to the person whose emails are disclosed,\u201d Nojeim wrote. \u201cThe notice requirement in the Hatch-Coons-Heller bill represents a wise and balanced approach.\u201d \n\nHe did offer, however, that the bill has its drawbacks, including the fact that it could \u201cincrease the pressure for data localization mandates.\u201d Furthermore, providers that move customer data between data centers, bring forth further uncertainty regarding implementation of the law. \n\n\u201cFinally, it is not clear how the bill would apply to providers who move data to different data centers around the globe in order to balance the burden on their network and better serve their users,\u201d Nojeim said. \u201cIf a load-balancing provider stores a user's data at one moment in India, the next in the U.K., and the next in the U.S., will the U.S. warrant reach the data because the data at some point comes to the U.S.?\u201d\n\nOn Sen.

For the past few years, Google has been battling a lawsuit accusing it of violating the WireTap Act for its use of Street View \u2013 a service that offers street-level images of geographical locations by allegedly collecting unencrypted Wi-Fi data transmitted in surrounding areas, like homes and businesses.  \n\nGoogle attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed under the argument that unencrypted Wi-Fi data it collected was categorized as a \u201cradio communication,\u201d a type of transmission exempt from Wiretap Act protections, but a three-judge panel ruled on Sept. 10 that lawsuit proceedings could continue.  \n\nNow, Google is pushing to have the original panel of three judges, or a larger group of 11 judges, to rehear the case.

Further, advancements by cyber criminals \u2013 who continuously find new methods of attack \u2013 means that those charged with defending corporate networks are in a perpetual battle.\n\nAmong the findings in the sixth biannual worldwide survey of information security professionals \u2013 conducted by (ISC)2, in partnership with Booz Allen Hamilton, with the assistance of Frost & Sullivan \u2013 is that secure software development was most in need of attention by the information security profession. The study received responses from 12,000 qualified information security professionals in the fourth quarter of 2012.\n\nThe good news for those in the profession, or for those considering it, is that information security is a stable and growing area of concentration. More than 80 percent of respondents reported they had no change in employer over the past year, and the number of professionals is projected to grow more than 11 percent annually over the next five years. \n\nIt appears too that the market is ripe with opportunities, as workforce shortages persist. In fact, more than half (56 percent) of respondents believe there is a workforce shortage, as compared to two percent who believe there is a surplus.\n\nHowever, Hord Tipton, executive director of (ISC)2, speaking with SCMagazine.com on Tuesday, said this aspect of the study was a cause of concern.\u00a0\n\n\"Two-thirds of C-level personnel acknowledge there is a shortage of security personnel,\" he said.\u00a0\n\nBut, while half of survey respondents believe expansion is worthwhile and there is a need for more human capital, the reality is that the ideal scenario needs to be tempered by budget, he said.\u00a0\n\n\"Many realize they are not going to get the help they need,\" Tipton said.\u00a0\n\nIn terms of keeping up with threats, that's not good news. While Tipton acknowledged there's been significant progress in addressing enterprise security needs, the lack of adequate staffing places a strain on the existing workforce, he said.\n\nFor those in position, the key to success, according to the survey findings, is knowledge, and the certifications to validate it. An all-encompassing understanding of the security market was determined to be the top factor in establishing advancement. The second most important ingredient was found to be communication skills, which means being able to translate technical jargon into terms the board room can understand.\n\n\"Certifications add value, and operations are more efficient with more validated professionals,\" said Tipton, whose organization manages the security industry's flagship credential, the CISSP. Others, however, have argued that certs have lost value as more people have acquired them and that educational experience is more valuable. Some also say certs are too managerial focused and don't attest enough to technical acumen.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, the (ISC)2 study also found that application vulnerabilities are the most pressing security concern among respondents, with malware and mobility not far behind. \n\nCloud, too, is still an area prompting challenges, said Tipton.\u00a0\n\n\"We need more knowledge as there is still no standard cloud architecture,\" he said.\n\nThe overall outlook for those in the profession is bright, according to the study, as incidents from miscreants attacking through computer networks will only rise, and corporations and government need knowledgeable security personnel to thwart attacks and prevent data leakage. However, it is not enough to simply be technologically proficient. It is vital too, the study determined, that information security professionals effectively convey their risk management expertise to the C-suite.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/education/topic/47208/", "topic_name": "Education"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberthreats/topic/47239/", "topic_name": "Cyberthreats"}]}, {"news_name": "PCI council clarifies merchant's cloud security obligations", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/pci-council-clarifies-merchants-cloud-security-obligations/article/542223/", "title": "PCI council clarifies merchant's cloud security obligations", "author": "Danielle Walker", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/danielle-walker/author/3621/", "date": "February 08, 2013", "body": "The group charged with administering the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is now tackling merchants' security and compliance concerns around cloud usage.\n\nThe Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) on Thursday published a new supplement to help merchants select cloud service providers (CSPs), as well as implement best practices within their own business to safeguard data going to the cloud.\n\nThe guidance defines common service models for cloud environments, the roles of third-party CSPs and the businesses that hire them, and operational and technical security challenges faced by these organizations.\n\nBob Russo, general manager of the PCI SSC, told SCMagazine.com on Wednesday that retailers often are tripped up by access restrictions that third-party CSPs place on data in the cloud. \n\n\u201cYou are on a server with 50 or 100 other customers, and [CSPs] sometimes put in the contract that they don't want merchants going through this information, because you might be getting into others people's data or territory,\u201d Russo said. \u201cBut if you are a merchant, you are ultimately responsible for your client's card data.\u201d \n\nHe added that many CSPs also outsource data to other providers.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, your cardholders' data is not only hosted by your CSP, but by their third-party clients,\u201d Russo said. \u201cUnderstand where in the cloud your payment card data is, then understand who has the responsibility to protect that \u2013 and that this is in your contract.\u201d \n\nWith the new guidance, auditors and merchants have further clarification on each party's duties.

These types of attacks affect most, but not all, industry sectors, making cyber security an industry-wide concern.\n\nThe popularity of mobile devices and increased adoption of the cloud has also exposed enterprises to sophisticated and persistent threats.\n\nIt \"tremendously complicates\" the work the good guys have to do to protect the network since information is stored in multiple places, Lobel said. Organizations have to understand what sensitive data they have, where it is stored and which controls are in place to protect it. \n\nOrganizations also have to think about the tools and strategies to defend themselves, said Lobel. In terms of financially driven crime, the focus is generally on blocking off access paths and locking out the attacker. \n\nWith nation-state attacks and espionage malware, organizations must be careful not to let on that they know about the intrusion so they can study how deep the hackers have penetrated and determine the extent of the damage, Lobel said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacktivism/topic/47227/", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberthreats/topic/47239/", "topic_name": "Cyberthreats"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}]}, {"news_name": "SMB cloud security spending to continue growth", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/smb-cloud-security-spending-to-continue-growth/article/542113/", "title": "SMB cloud security spending to continue growth", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "June 20, 2012", "body": "Security spending among small and midsize businesses (SMBs) is expected to grow over the next four years, especially in the area of cloud implementations.\n\n\nIn the soon-to-be-released \"2012 Global SMB Security Market Assessment,\" analysts at Access Markets International Partners (AMI)\u00a0projected that security spending by SMBs would grow by more than 10 percent each year between 2011 and 2016. This outlay included software, hardware, managed services and software-as-a-service. \n\nSMBs are projected to increasingly shift their security dollars toward protecting the cloud, which is defined in the report as covering both software-as-a-service and managed services, Hugh Gibbs, vice president of research and consulting for the firm's EMEA region and the principal author of the report, told SCMagazine.com on Wednesday.\n\nCloud security currently accounts for nearly 17 percent of total spending, or $3.3 billion, within the worldwide SMB market, according to the firm, which has offices in North America, Europe and Asia. By 2016, however, spending for cloud security is projected to jump to as much as 24 percent, or $7.7 billion, Gibbs said. \n\n\"[The] cloud delivery mechanism is the superior model for ensuring security, given the frequency things have to be updated,\" he said.\n\nWhile there are many reasons for the shift, cost savings, the proliferation of mobile devices and the growing popularity of cloud applications and services were the primary drivers, he said.\n\nCloud computing and services offer access to the latest applications and infrastructure without requiring upfront investment of expensive hardware, Gibbs said. \n\nStill, the spending trend was markedly more evident in emerging markets than in more established regions of the world, he said. Emerging markets generally don't have legacy infrastructure or relationships, so they can move right into the cloud, compared to the gradual evolution happening in more mature markets, he said, adding that the cloud gives these regions access to advanced security they may not otherwise be able to afford.\n\nSMBs also generally don't have dedicated resources or contractors handling IT and security management on a regular basis, Gibbs said. \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/critical-infrastructure/topic/47217/", "topic_name": "Critical Infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Dell bulks up on security with SonicWall buy", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/dell-bulks-up-on-security-with-sonicwall-buy/article/541664/", "title": "Dell bulks up on security with SonicWall buy", "author": "Marcos Col\u00f3n", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/marcos-col\u00f3n/author/3617/", "date": "March 13, 2012", "body": "Dell on Tuesday announced plans to acquire SonicWALL, a private company based in San Jose, Calif. that offers network security.\n\nA statement from Dell said the acquisition adds 950 employees to the Dell team, as well as new services to its security portfolio, which currently include managed services SecureWorks and vulnerability management KACE. \n\nSonicWall, which makes unified threat management products that include anti-virus, intrusion prevention and VPN protection, currently has more than 130 patents, both registered and pending, and a customer base of more than 300,000 globally. \n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nIn a statement, John Swaison, president of Dell Software Group, said the move highlights the company's intent to provide solutions for its customers that are \u201ccomprehensive, effective, and easy to implement and manage.\"\n\nIn a conference call reviewing the deal this morning, Dave Johnson, senior vice president of Dell corporate strategy, discussed the importance of augmenting security for the tech giant moving forward.\n\n\u201cWith the acquisition of SonicWALL, Dell will be able to bring to market industry leading, differentiated, yet easy-to-manage, security solutions,\u201d he said during the briefing. \u201cToday's announcement is an important step to broaden our software portfolio in the critical area of security.\u201d\n\nThe discussion highlighted three issues that cause security headaches for enterprises today: the exponential growth of data, cloud-based solutions, and mobile devices in the workplace.\n\n\u201cThese trends create significant business risks,\u201d Swaison said during the call. \u201cSonicWALL gives Dell access to a team with best-in-class resources and technology that will position us very well in the strategic segments of software security.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, SonicWALL was purchased by private-equity group Thoma Bravo for $717 million.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "RSA Conference 2012: Embrace, don't fear, the cloud", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/rsa-conference-2012-embrace-dont-fear-the-cloud/article/541645/", "title": "RSA Conference 2012: Embrace, don't fear, the cloud", "author": "Greg Masters", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/greg-masters/author/3591/", "date": "March 01, 2012", "body": "A panel of security experts on Wednesday at the RSA Conference in San Francisco said the number of cloud implementations are rapidly rising, but the maturity of the industry will bring tremendous benefits and improvements to security.\n\n\nThe session, \u201cCISOs Check the Weather: Beyond the Hype of Cloud Security,\u201d consisted of Jerry Archer, CISO at Sallie Mae; Dave Cullinane, CISO at eBay; Chuck Deaton, director of information security at Humana; and Jason Witty, SVP and information protection consulting executive at Bank of America. The moderator was Jim Reavis, executive director of the Cloud Security Alliance.\n\nAll agreed that the cost savings presented by cloud deployments is enough of an attraction to radically change the landscape. But, some companies still are not comfortable with the idea yet, said Witty. There are, he said, so many variables in how a company can shift operations to a cloud services provider that many potential users are unclear about the best approach. \n\nBut, resistance is futile, said Deaton.\n\n\u201cYou will be assimilated,\" he said.\n\nArcher said the results of a recent survey showed that IT costs can be reduced by 85 percent from a move to the cloud, certainly a fundamental change that will force businesses to at least begin a discussion of outsourcing models.\n\n\u00a0\u201cThis evolution will be unlike anything we've ever seen,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the security component will evolve, Archer said, first with provisions and contracts, and then with protocols and other means to gain insight.\u00a0\n\nHowever, other members of the panel warned of some of the challenges cloud implementations will bring. Cullinane said cloud services offer a huge opportunity for delivering security via the cloud cost-effectively, but said he was worried of not being in control of his company's operations.\n\nDeaton added that security pros have to be as non-disruptive as possible and cannot block innovation. But they certainly can add their two cents and ensure there are no unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cGet in there, voice your concerns and participate,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, Cullinane raised what he labeled one of the big challenges: How does one get in front to figure out how to implement the cloud while at the same time assuring there is as little risk as possible.\n\n\u201cUnless you have visibility into where your data is going, how do you manage risk,\u201d he asked.\n\nDeaton responded that security pros charged with employing cloud services will find a way that will allow their teams to do innovative things, find new strategies to minimize risk, and give \u201cyes\u201d answers when the C-level requests a new program or offering.\u00a0The onus is on security teams to stay ahead of the tide.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe need to change the way we do our jobs,\u201d said Cullinane. \u201cMajor things are happening here.\u201d\n\nFor example, an audience member asked whether one needs to regularly audit their provider. Witty said audits, in fact, become less relevant when all operations are handled automatically via a cloud implementation.\n\n\u00a0\u201cWe're moving to continuous monitoring that validates activity,\u201d he said.\n\n.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "RSA Conference 2012: CloudFlare's three weeks with LulzSec", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/rsa-conference-2012-cloudflares-three-weeks-with-lulzsec/article/541643/", "title": "RSA Conference 2012: CloudFlare's three weeks with LulzSec", "author": "Dan Kaplan", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/dan-kaplan/author/3590/", "date": "February 29, 2012", "body": "The approximately 25 days during which a San Francisco security company counted hacktivist collective\u00a0Lulz Security as a customer proved\u00a0to be an unexpected\u00a0litmus test for the then-less-than-one-year-old start-up.\n\nMatthew Prince, CEO of CloudFlare,\u00a0a cloud-based\u00a0vendor that\u00a0helps protect websites against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, offered a candid glimpse\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0into his company's involvement\u00a0last June with LulzSec.\n\nDuring a talk at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, Prince said that when LulzSec signed up for the free version of CloudFlare on\u00a0June 2, he didn't\u00a0know anything about the group, which by that time, had\u00a0compromised television network PBS only days earlier and\u00a0over the next several days, would\u00a0target\u00a0Sony Pictures and the FBI's InfraGard. The group's website, which featured details about its hacks,\u00a0became incredibly popular,\u00a0generating millions of page views per day. \n\nBut Prince said it also became an attractive target for ethical hackers, often referred to as white-hats, and also competing criminal groups. Prince said his service was hit with an array of attacks designed to knock offline\u00a0lulzsecurity.com, which is no longer operational. That included Layer 7 and Layer 3/4 DDoS attacks, reflection attacks, and IP scans and attacks on router interfaces.\n\nIn short, Prince said, external parties were searching for any weakness or vulnerability in CloudFlare, and thanks to its 14 global data centers, the company was, for the most part, able to\u00a0respond without any disruptions in service.\n\n\"You couldn't pay for pen testing like this,\" said Prince,\u00a0a former ski instructor and lawyer who also co-created Project Honey Pot, an open-source project designed to identify spammers and spambots. \"It was a learning experience.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just digital attackers with whom he had to deal. Providing services for an organization like LulzSec also netted law enforcement interest.\n\n\"We made lots of friends with some three-letter agencies during this time,\" Prince said laughing.\n\nHe was tight-lipped about exactly which information it provided to authorities, saying the company complies with \"valid subpoenas.\"\n\nBut he did say that\u00a0CloudFlare collects and stores limited amounts of information from its customers. When they sign up,\u00a0users only\u00a0are asked to provide an email address, username and password. And LulzSec never used the site's premium service, so no money ever changed hands.\n\nHowever, during its interaction with CloudFlare, LulzSec appears to have tripped up and provided some help to law enforcement trying to hunt them down, Prince said. For one, the username it provided when signing up was the same as an username being used in an\u00a0internet relay chat (IRC)\u00a0room\u00a0that authorities had been monitoring. Also, the group typically logged in from IP addresses that were routed through other countries, but in one case, the sign-on came from a DSL modem based in the U.K.\n\nRoughly a month after LulzSec ceased operations, a key member of the group, known as Topiary,\u00a0was arrested in the Shetland Islands, off the northeast coast of Scotland.\n\nTo this day, Prince said CloudFlare's dealings with LulzSec made his company more secure, and he has no regrets about LulzSec being\u00a0a customer. He said\u00a0lulzsecurity.com wasn't distributing malware, phishing\u00a0scams or child pornography -- which CloudFlare has strict policies against.\n\n\"We don't play censor,\" he said, adding that\u00a0at no time did law enforcement ask CloudFlare to stop doing business with LulzSec.\n\n\"I'm not sure what we would've done in that case,\" he said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud/topic/47232/", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ddos/topic/47213/", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacktivism/topic/47227/", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}]}, {"news_name": "RSA Conference 2012: The threat of the new generation of employees", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/rsa-conference-2012-the-threat-of-the-new-generation-of-employees/article/541640/", "title": "RSA Conference 2012: The threat of the new generation of employees", "author": "Marcos Col\u00f3n", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/marcos-col\u00f3n/author/3617/", "date": "February 28, 2012", "body": "One of the\u00a0largest threats facing organizations today is not a criminal at all, but\u00a0someone\u00a0known as a \"digital native.\"\n\n\"There's an unstoppable force heading this way and it's hitting us at the moment,\" Enrique Salem, president and CEO of Symantec, said Tuesday in a keynote address at the annual RSA Conference in San Francisco. \"It's not a new form of cyber crime\u2026it's a large group of young people called digital natives.\"\n\nTypically born in the 1990s, a digital native is identified as the new breed of young professional in the workplace\u00a0who is accustomed to bringing\u00a0their own computing \"customs\"\u00a0into the office, whether through their own devices or by\u00a0accessing social networks such as Facebook.
