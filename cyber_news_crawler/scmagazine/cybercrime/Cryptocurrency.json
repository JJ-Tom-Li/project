When it comes across a Facebook account that is set to auto log in the user, Digmine is able to co-op Messenger to send the malware to the account owner's friend list. The fact that the miner is controlled from a command-and-control server means its authors or distributors can update it at will, potentially making it more dangerous in the future.\n\n\u201cThe abuse of Facebook is limited to propagation for now, but it wouldn't be implausible for attackers to hijack the Facebook account itself down the line,\u201d said Lenart Bermejo and Hsiao-Yu Shih.\n\nDigmine has so far confined its activities to South Korea, Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, and Venezuela, but because Facebook Messenger is used worldwide and on different platforms, there is every chance the bot will spread. One piece of good news is that it is only effective on desktop versions of the Chrome browser. If Digmine finds itself on a mobile device or different browser, it does not operate properly, Trend Micro said.\n\nOnce downloaded onto a computer, Digmine's first operation is to install an autostart mechanism and launch Chrome with a malicious extension. It then starts mining and finally connects with the Facebook account's friend list via Messenger and begins to spread. In order to keep the victim unaware, a video file is streamed from a website that is controlled by the cybercriminal and contains additional components for the malware.\n\nThe miner is a variant of the Monero miner XMRig and is downloaded by a codec.exe.\n\nTrend Micro notified Facebook, and the social media company was able to remove many of the Digmine-related links from its platform.

Meanwhile, Korean and global news outlets have reported that South Korea's National Intelligence Service spy agency suspects that North Korea is responsible for hacking attacks on one of its country's cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nOn Friday, researchers from Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit reported that the Lazarus Group, an APT actor commonly linked to North Korea, commenced a spear phishing campaign on Oct. 25, using emails that falsely advertise an open CFO position at a European cryptocurrency company. In actuality, it appears the attackers\u00a0 copied a LinkedIn CFO job profile from a\u00a0 cryptocurrency company based in Asia and slightly tweaked it to create the phishing content. (Intezer released a similar report on Dec. 12.)\n\nThe emails used in this campaign, which is likely still ongoing, include a Word attachment containing malicious macros. The attackers attempt to socially engineer recipients into enabling these macros by asking the user to accept the Enable Editing and Enable Content functions. Doing so opens a decoy document, while secretly installing a first-stage remote access trojan capable of downloading additional malware.\n\nSecureWorks notes that elements in both the macros and the first-stage RAT, as well as components in the custom command-and-control protocol, share commonalities with former campaigns attributed to Lazarus.\n\nThe company also warns that this latest attack is part of an larger overall movement on North Korea's part to engage in malicious activities related to cryptocurrency. Indeed, SecureWorks reports that it has found evidence dating back to 2013 of \"multiple usernames originating from a North Korean IP addresses... taking part in bitcoin research,\" and using proxies to mask the originating IP address.\n\n\"CTU researchers assess that the North Korean threat against cryptocurrency will remain elevated in the foreseeable future,\" SecureWorks predicts.\n\nMeanwhile, The Chosun Ilbo, the Yonhap News Agency, the BBC\u00a0and other news agencies have reported, citing unnamed sources, that South Korea's National Intelligence Service believes its neighbor to the north hacked the Seoul-based Bithumb cryptocurrency exchange last February, stealing millions of dollars as well as the personal information of roughly 30,000 people.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the BBC, the stolen funds were originally worth $7 million but jumped in value to $82.7 million at time of publication last Saturday. The hackers reportedly compromised Bithumb via an employee's home PC, and subsequently began trading bitcoin and ethereum on the exchange.\n\nThe BBC also cited reports that the hackers attempted to extort Bithumb, offering to delete traders' stolen personal information in exchange for an additional $5.5 million payment.\n\nThe Chosun Ilbo reports that the South Korean government has fined Bithumb the equivalent of nearly $54,000 for the breach.\n\nThe National Intelligence Service also reportedly believes\u00a0that North Korea hacked the exchanges Youbit (formerly known as Yapizon) and Coinis this year.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "DDoS attack paralyzes Bitfinex", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ddos-attack-paralyzes-bitfinex/article/718191/", "title": "DDoS attack paralyzes Bitfinex ", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "December 13, 2017", "body": "As bitcoin prices fluctuate, Zeifman expects to see attacks escalate.

KISA, which suspects the attackers to be from North Korea, said the attacks included attempts in July and August to infiltrate South Korean bitcoin exchanges along with an attempt to manipulate digital wallet passwords in order to steal the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe attackers tend to favor phishing when looking for bitcoin and evidently these have proven successful as KISA estimated that about $90,000 in cryptocurrency was stolen every month from 2013 to 2015, reported Cryptocoinnews.com.\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Cryptoshuffler trojan diverting bitcoin payments to criminal's pockets", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptoshuffler-trojan-diverting-bitcoin-payments-to-criminals-pockets/article/704202/", "title": "Cryptoshuffler trojan diverting bitcoin payments to criminal's pockets", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 31, 2017", "body": "Cryptocurrency mining may be all the rage right now, but some malicious actors are finding it easier to use a specialized trojan that simply steals the money right out of a digital wallet.\n\nThe CryptoShuffler Trojan uses the devices clipboard and depends upon the user not paying enough attention during the transaction process, Kaspersky Labs reported. So far the process has allowed 23 BTC, or about $145,000, to be stolen in the year that CryptoShuffler has been in the wild. It is also capable of targeting Ethereum, Zcash, Dash and Monero.\n\nCryptoShuffler takes advantage of the transaction process the currencies use. Once installed on a device the malware monitors the clipboard, where the user's wallet ID is normally stored, and when a transaction is recognized as taking place it replaces the correct destination address with its own diverting the funds.\n\n\u201cCryptoShuffler's\u00a0ability to\u00a0replace a destination literally takes milliseconds because it's so simple to search for wallet addresses \u2013 the majority of cryptocurrency wallet addresses have the same beginning and certain number of characters. Therefore, intruders can easily create regular codes to replace them,\u201d Kaspersky said.\n\nThe other key aspect is the fact that most people do not pay attention to what is going on when conducting this type of transaction. \n\n\u201cWhen making a payment, users do not usually check their multi-digit numbers, especially since the wallet addresses in blockchain are complicated and often very difficult to remember. Users don't pay much attention to checking any distinctive features in the transaction line, even if a slight change could cost them a lot,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe bad guys can be stopped by simply paying attention and making sure the wallet ID pasted into the destination address to make sure it is your own.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/trojan/topic/53138/", "topic_name": "Trojan"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}]}]}]
