[{"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "The dark web marketplaces and undergrown marketplaces are full of vendors selling databases, weapons, illegal drugs and malicious software. Now security researchers have discovered yet another ransomware malware not only selling victims\u2019 data but also selling them online.Researchers from Heimdal Security have discovered a variant of the Jaff malware which is part of a larger cyber-server that sells out credit card information and various compromised bank accounts from all across the world.The Jaff ransomware, as researchers like to call it, does not simply stop at stealing private information from the victim\u2019s computer. Rather, it also allows attackers to capitalize further on that information by selling it on a dark web marketplace hidden deep within the darkest pits of cyberspace.This is because it has been revealed that the Jaff ransomware shares server space with the dark web marketplace where not only the bank information of compromised accounts is present, but also information associated with users\u2019 emails and their locations.The information includes account data stolen from credit cards, PayPal transactions, payments made online on e-commerce portals such as Amazon and eBay and much more.Furthermore, the cyber criminal does not have to go through any sort of verification process before being approved for purchasing information. As such, it makes it ever more efficient for attackers to purchase the compromised accounts that have a value of up to $275,241.\u201cMalicious hackers can use Bitcoins to purchase stolen credit cards, some of which have already been verified, and compromised accounts on Paypal, Amazon, eBay and many more,\u201d said security researcher Andra Zaharia.\u201cPrices per item vary from under a dollar to several Bitcoins. Access to the marketplace doesn\u2019t include a vetting process, making the barrier to entry quite low for malicious actors of all kinds.\u201dThe attackers can also use filters to select accounts with the highest value.The Jaff ransomware works by sending an email with a PDF attachment. Once the user downloads the attachment, there is a link to the document that the user needs to click. Once clicked, the malware gets activated and starts to record or steal vital information without the user noticing.The server of the ransomware has been traced back to Russia in St. Petersburg.It seems that cybercriminals have finally made an economy of their own where they can either buy lucrative accounts being sold on the dark web or go for many short-term returns by launching ransomware attacks on users\u2019 systems.Or, they can use both and make incredible amounts of money that would just keep growing. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are seemingly fueling this trend to an alarming extent.This also means that corporations are finding it ever harder to deal with the issues as more advanced forms of ransomware are being unleashed in cyberspace.The model of this newly discovered marketplace, for instance, is self-sustaining as criminals can purchase valuable accounts that belong to a number of countries such as Australia, New Zealand, USA, etc. and use the money to buy more.Given that cyber criminals can now attack and steal at an exponential rate, corporations may not be able to overcome the incredible amount of cyber theft that will come as a result..u32db67c33b5e85dbd75fdf9cff40218c{padding:0px;margin:0;padding-top:1em!important;padding-bottom:1em!important;width:100%;display:block;font-weight:bold;background-color:#eaeaea;border:0!important;border-left:4px solid #34495E!important;box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-moz-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-o-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-webkit-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.17);text-decoration:none}.u32db67c33b5e85dbd75fdf9cff40218c:active,.u32db67c33b5e85dbd75fdf9cff40218c:hover{opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms;text-decoration:none}.u32db67c33b5e85dbd75fdf9cff40218c{transition:background-color 250ms;webkit-transition:background-color 250ms;opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms}.u32db67c33b5e85dbd75fdf9cff40218c .ctaText{font-weight:bold;color:#C0392B;text-decoration:none;font-size:16px}.u32db67c33b5e85dbd75fdf9cff40218c .postTitle{color:#000;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:16px}.u32db67c33b5e85dbd75fdf9cff40218c:hover .postTitle{text-decoration:underline!important}Related:  Here's What a Samsung Galaxy S7 Hacked with Ransomware Looks LikeSource: Heimdal Security | Image Credit: ShutterstockDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["dark web", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "Ransomware", "security"], "title": "Hackers Behind Jaff Ransomware Selling Victims\u2019 Data on Dark Web", "date": "June 3, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Since the spread of WannaCry ransomware attack the cyber security community is doing whatever it takes to identify new threats against unsuspecting users. The recent discovery by security researchers is a threat to both Windows and Mac users.Checkpoint has recently revealed a new malware at large which goes by the name of \u201cFireball.\u201d The malware has infected over 250 million computers up till now worldwide and has been created by a Chinese company in an attempt to generate revenues through forced browser advertisement.Fireball is essentially an adware that has the potential to completely crash your system and allow the attacker to spy on your web browsing patterns. That is, the virus can spy on your search behavior and probably retrieve personal information and data.However, Fireball, as experts claim, is far more dangerous as it is an advanced form of malware that has backdoor Trojan capabilities. This means that the adware can be used to drop malware which can be used to steal private information.Researchers say that adware today, has evolved significantly and that this alone allows the attackers to inject any malware into the victim\u2019s computer without any hindrance.Rafotech, which is the Chinese company behind this campaign, has been using the adware to redirect traffic to certain search engines and using it to advertise its products.Essentially, the adware is used to inject advertisements in browsers simply, and the virus comes enshrouded in other downloadable software created by the company.Hence, if you happen to install free software, the adware gets in your system where it can easily install various plug-ins in your browser and toggle with your browser\u2019s settings in any way the attacker wants.As such, it is likely that your home page will be different from the one you set and you will not be able to change it as well.Your default search engines will be replaced with fake ones. These fake search engines will redirect you to Yahoo or Google whenever you type in a search query.However, the primary purpose of the adware is to track down your search behavior for advertising purposes. As such, the adware uses pixel tracking system to gather relevant information.According to the most recent reports, among the computers infected, 20 percent belong to large corporate networks in various countries. Primarily, India has been affected the most with 25.3 million infections found while U.S is mildly hit with 5.5 million infections.Over 250 million computers worldwide have been  infected: specifically,  25.3 million infections in India (10.1%), 24.1 million in Brazil (9.6%), 16.1 million in Mexico (6.4%), and 13.1 million in Indonesia (5.2%). The United States has  witnessed 5.5 million infections (2.2%), according to Checkpoint\u2019s analysis.Common signs indicating that your computer is infected include not being able to change your homepage and different browser settings from the ones that you set as default.To remove almost any adware, follow these simple steps:For Windows users:For Mac OS users:Source: Checkpoint | Image Credit: Shutterstock/PicotanDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["hacking", "internet", "Mac", "Malware", "security", "WannaCry", "Windows"], "title": "\u2018Fireball\u2019 Malware Infected 250 Million Mac and Windows Devices", "date": "June 2, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});When it comes to taking advantage of vulnerabilities the WannaCry ransomware attack is the latest example of it where hackers used Server Message Block protocol (SMB) vulnerability in Windows OS and infected computers in more than 100 countries.But then some good guys do good things just like in this incident when a group of hackers took over a digital billboard at a shopping mall in Liverpool, England and defaced with a message suggesting the authorities improve their security.

To obfuscate its activity, the original file on the file server remains unchanged; it is only modified/replaced while in transit from the pandemic file server before being executed on the computer of the remote user. The implant allows the replacement of up to 20 programs with a maximum size of 800 MB for a selected list of remote users (targets).As the name suggests, a single computer on a local network with shared drives that is infected with the \u201cPandemic\u201d implant will act like a \u201cPatient Zero\u201d in the spread of a disease. It will infect remote computers if the user executes programs stored on the pandemic file server. Although not explicitly stated in the documents, it seems technically feasible that remote computers that provide file shares themselves become new pandemic file servers on the local network to reach new targets.RELEASE: CIA 'Pandemic' #Vault7 https://t.co/YfxAKT1pog pic.twitter.com/jK8rdFWpCQ\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 2, 2017According to experts, Pandemic is yet another malware that uses the SMB vulnerability found in Windows software to infect computers that share the same local network. As such, the malware can infect an entire network by replacing certain files with the ones that contain Trojans.The malware has the capability of turning computers into \u201cPatient Zero\u201d machines through the Windows file server. That is, a single computer can be used as a means to infect other computers within the network if the targeted computer downloads the infected file.Essentially, the virus does not do anything when it enters a targeted computer. However, when one tries to access a file from the server which has been infected, the file will be automatically replaced with the one that contains the malware.As such, the malware can infect more than one computer as users download the file from the server or access the file through the network sharing system.Furthermore, experts say that it is likely that remote computers which share files, can themselves become the pandemic servers and hence hunt down more targets to infect.The spread can, therefore, be exponential without any stoppage.Also, it has been stated that Pandemic only takes 15 seconds to get installed in the system as a file system filter driver and that it has the potential to replace 20 files with a total of size of 800 MB at any one time. Also, it is effective against both 34-bit and 64-bit systems.Nevertheless, the documents do not reveal as to how Pandemic can be installed in the first place.The leak has been described as the largest ever publication on CIA documents and the documents have their source in CIA\u2019s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia.Source: WikiLeaks | Image Credit: Shutterstock/By Bakhtiar ZeinDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["CIA", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "security", "Vault 7", "wikileaks", "Windows"], "title": "Wikileaks reveals pandemic malware for Windows developed by the CIA", "date": "June 2, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "After the effects of the phishing campaign that used Google Docs as a tool to attack, Google has launched a number of upgrades to Gmail and its browser so that users can be notified and warned of suspicious emails and websites that may contain malware.According to Andy Wen, who is currently involved with Google\u2019s Counter Abuse Technology group, a new machine learning model has been created that will detect spam emails early on and thus delay messages.The messages will, therefore, be analyzed by the model and the email will be classified as spam if it contains any malware or adware.One of the primary advantages of the new model is that it is adaptable and as Google classifies more malware, the model will automatically learn how to analyze the emails so as to look for such threats.Google says that the system will block malicious emails with 99.9 percent accuracy and is therefore highly effective and robust.\u201cMachine learning helps Gmail block sneaky spam and phishing messages from showing up in your inbox with over 99.9 percent accuracy,\u201d Wen said. \u201cThis is huge, given that 50-70 percent of messages that Gmail receives are spam.\u201dThe machine learning model not only applies to emails but also to links that may contain malware. This is because the model supports Safe Browsing which means that users will be warned before opening a URL in Chrome that might be a potential threat.The system is said to be highly beneficial to enterprise users since it will protect them from replying to messages that are malicious. That is, the model will warn users if they are replying to messages that are from contacts which are not in the contact list.This, however, does not mean that users will not be able to send messages to regular contacts. The model is designed as such that it will filter out the context to see that even if a contact is not in the list, it will still consider it safe if regular conversations have been held with the contact in question.Google also said that the new model works by integrating a number of malware, ransomware and spam signals. This means that suspicious emails will be highlighted based on signals and the user will be notified.Furthermore, the system will also determine the safety of attachment. Hence, if an attachment contains any threat, the user will be warned accordingly.As mentioned earlier, the new upgrades are perhaps a response to the recent Google Docs phishing scam which involved the attackers using Google\u2019s OAUTH2 service to scam around 1 million Gmail users.Although Google says that only 0.1% of the users were affected, it is, however, still a matter of concern.As such, in addition to the above security measures, Google also announced that it would be launching a Security Key enforcement so that emails in transit can be encrypted and protected from data theft. Lastly, a new, more robust certificate system will be launched whereby attackers will be prevented from using fake certificates to scam users.Just got this as well.

Typically, a hacker steals an employee\u2019s account credentials to access the employee\u2019s company network and freely roam from system to system. Single sign-on services such as OneLogin are designed to let employees use only one credential to access many companies\u2019 services. Gaining access to OneLogin\u2019s systems is very much like stealing a master key \u2014 once you have that, you have access to all of the systems that an employee can jump into. It\u2019s a tough situation: on the one hand, these identity manager services significantly improve security, as they improve control over passwords and account activation. On the other, as seen here, if you can break the system, that controls all but vanishes.\u201dIf you are a OneLogin customer, make sure to \u201csign in\u201d and see the list of security measures mentioned by the company. Some of the steps HackRead was able to collect from a OneLogin user and includes the following:\u201cForce a OneLogin Directory password reset for your users; Generate new certificates for your apps that use SAML SSO; Generate new API credentials and OAuth tokens; Generate and apply new directory tokens for Active Directory Connectors and LDAP Directory Connectors; Update the API or OAuth credentials you use to authenticate to third-party directories like G Suite (Google), Workday, Namely, and UltiPro; Generate and apply new Desktop SSO tokens; Recycle any secrets stored in Secure Notes; Update the credentials you use to authenticate to 3rd party apps for provisioning; Update the admin-configured login credentials for apps that use form-based authentication; Have your end-users update their passwords for the form-based authentication apps that they can edit, including personal apps; and Replace your RADIUS shared secrets.\u201dTo read the complete list follow the Pastebin link here.This is a massive breach whose consequences will be destructive for users in the long run. Remember, there is a growing trend where hackers are stealing data and selling it on the dark web marketplaces.

Apparently, some of the confidential data related to the US military project was simply left completely unprotected on a server belonging to Amazon. The data included over 60,000 files with some of the very sensitive info publicly accessible and not even protected with a password.That is almost 28GB of confidential data which a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) had left unguarded. BAH is one of the top defense contractors that\u2019s been working for the US and was long considered to be among the best and most profitable spy operations in the world.Among the data that was left exposed are also the unencrypted passwords belonging to contractors who were granted with the Top-Secret Facility Clearance. If misused, the credentials might lead to a lot of sensitive data leak. The leaked files also mention NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency), which is a US agency working as Pentagon\u2019s \u2018mapmakers.\u2019BAH has received an $86 million for one of the defense contract projects and it supposedly involved getting and analyzing the data related to geospatial research. This is the data that was collected with the help of drones and satellites. It\u2019s known that the NGA has worked with CIA on many occasions, as well as DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency), and NRO (National Reconnaissance Office).The server on which the files were left was discovered a week ago by Chris Vickery, UpGuard\u2018s cyber risk analyst. The server in question mostly contained files that are public, so finding this must have been quite a shock. Especially since the servers used by the US government are always kept on the separate space, which is known as GovCloud. GovCloud is also protected heavily, by both physical and digital security protocols.Recently discovered data leakage situation report is being written up.

However, they\u2019ve called the data unclassified, but still sensitive. This potential disclosure was taken very seriously, and the affected credentials were immediately revoked, as the NGA claims. Apparently, none of the classified info got out, which was a lucky coincidence.Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t an isolated incident, but rather the last in the series of the unsecured server incidents that are giving away sensitive data. Another incident from earlier in this very year involved a backup drive that wasn\u2019t protected even by a password. With such poor security, it\u2019s not a surprise that the sensitive info related to the US Air Force members has leaked.BAH has stated that the files left unprotected are now secured and that the complete investigation is being carried out. So far, they claim to have found no evidence of any classified data being compromised. This organization was once the employer of the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Snowden, as you probably know by now, has copied and publicly released a lot of the classified information without any authorization.BAH was supposedly also hacked by Anonymous, back in 2011. During the hack, over 90,000 emails were said to be stolen, as well as login information for several of the personnel that\u2019s working for multiple military-related government organizations.Source: CyberreSilience | Via: Gizmodo | Image Credit: Shutterstock/FaithieDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Amazon", "Data", "internet", "LEAKS", "Military", "NSA", "Privacy", "security", "Snowden", "USA"], "title": "Secret Pentagon Files Left Unprotected on the Amazon Server", "date": "June 1, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Shadow Brokers, the group that is now famously known for leaking the NSA hacking tools, Eternal Blue and Double Pulsar that infected computers worldwide with the WannaCry ransomware attack, is now announcing a new dump service through which, it will leak additional exploits for monthly subscriptions.Soon after the WannaCry attack in mid-April, the group revealed a teaser in mid-May that it has new exploits that it will be providing for a fee.This is not the first time that the group has tried to commercialize its activities. Recently, it launched public auctions, crowdfunding campaigns and tried selling other exploits but failed to make any progress.As part of the dump service, the group has claimed in a post that among the new exploits, there are those which include vulnerabilities in Windows 10, mobile handsets, web browsers and router exploits.In order to subscribe, one has to go to a link as provided by the group. The user will then have to send payment in Zcash \u2013 a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin \u2013 by giving their delivery email address.A confirmation email will then be sent and in a mass email sent to subscribers, there will be a link and password that will provide access to the exploits.As you may have noticed, Shadow Brokers has switched to Zcash from Bitcoins. Zcash is yet another cryptocurrency, but unlike Bitcoin, it offers much-enhanced anonymity.That is, transactions conducted through Zcash cannot be traced back to any address and as such it is much more private. This is probably the reason why Shadow Brokers switched to Zcash.In fact, it has been reported that the group had moved its 10.5 bitcoins \u2013 equivalent to $24,000 \u2013 by hiding it behind a number of micro-transactions so as not to get spotted. With Zcash, this is much easier since one\u2019s addresses are not revealed.Whether the exploits are actually with the group or not still remains a question. However, in an attempt to divert the attention of its customers, Shadow Brokers created hype by saying that Zcash is involved with the US intelligence agency.Experts say that this indicates that the group does not actually have the exploits that it claims to have. Rather, the dump service is simply an attempt to get more cash and it is creating a paranoia by announcing that Zcash has ties with the US government.It is likely that this can yet again be a major fraud since the group is charging 100 Zcash as part of subscribing to its service. This is equivalent to $20,000. Only time will tell whether the group has some other plans up its sleeve.Folks, EternalBlue was worth $1 mil+ on the exploit market.

Nevertheless, there can sometimes be no indication that such recording is taking place.Although the bug is quite harmless, the researcher, however, claims that it can be exploited for more sophisticated attacks, reports BleepingComputer..u70a3a597b66d7c61a941f4ea6af39a57{padding:0px;margin:0;padding-top:1em!important;padding-bottom:1em!important;width:100%;display:block;font-weight:bold;background-color:#eaeaea;border:0!important;border-left:4px solid #34495E!important;box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-moz-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-o-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-webkit-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.17);text-decoration:none}.u70a3a597b66d7c61a941f4ea6af39a57:active,.u70a3a597b66d7c61a941f4ea6af39a57:hover{opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms;text-decoration:none}.u70a3a597b66d7c61a941f4ea6af39a57{transition:background-color 250ms;webkit-transition:background-color 250ms;opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms}.u70a3a597b66d7c61a941f4ea6af39a57 .ctaText{font-weight:bold;color:#C0392B;text-decoration:none;font-size:16px}.u70a3a597b66d7c61a941f4ea6af39a57 .postTitle{color:#000;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:16px}.u70a3a597b66d7c61a941f4ea6af39a57:hover .postTitle{text-decoration:underline!important}Related:  Flash Player Bug Records Audio and Video without User PermissionThe red circle: When a website is recording a video or audio, a red circle shows up in a tab. This tab belongs to the window where the code is being executed to facilitate the recording.However, Bar-Zik found that this may not be the case. This is because such content only starts to get recorded once a user grants permission to do so.This may mean that a small pop-up window may be executing the code for recording audio and video content. Since a pop-up window does not have a tab, the red circle will not be shown and hence the user may be unaware that his/her video or audio is being recorded.This can also take place within a very small pop-up that can go unnoticed by the user.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});What\u2019s the issue?  You may be wondering as to why the researcher is so serious about the flaw. Essentially, the researcher believes that users sometimes accidentally grant permission to various websites to record video and audio content.They can do so without even realizing what the permission was about and hence not know that it was for recording video and audio content. As such, attackers may exploit the bug by tricking the user to grant permission and start recording a user\u2019s video and audio to possibly perform a sort of secret espionage on the user.Furthermore, Bar-Zik says that the attacker can start recording even without having a website ask for permission in the first place. They do so by exploiting yet another flaw associated with cross-site scripting..u8f498b96a39c00d18d4db3be802692c2{padding:0px;margin:0;padding-top:1em!important;padding-bottom:1em!important;width:100%;display:block;font-weight:bold;background-color:#eaeaea;border:0!important;border-left:4px solid #34495E!important;box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-moz-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-o-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17);-webkit-box-shadow:0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.17);text-decoration:none}.u8f498b96a39c00d18d4db3be802692c2:active,.u8f498b96a39c00d18d4db3be802692c2:hover{opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms;text-decoration:none}.u8f498b96a39c00d18d4db3be802692c2{transition:background-color 250ms;webkit-transition:background-color 250ms;opacity:1;transition:opacity 250ms;webkit-transition:opacity 250ms}.u8f498b96a39c00d18d4db3be802692c2 .ctaText{font-weight:bold;color:#C0392B;text-decoration:none;font-size:16px}.u8f498b96a39c00d18d4db3be802692c2 .postTitle{color:#000;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:16px}.u8f498b96a39c00d18d4db3be802692c2:hover .postTitle{text-decoration:underline!important}Related:  Google Chrome Browser Listening To Your Conversations without PermissionIssue reported to Google: The issue was immediately reported to Google after it was discovered.

Now, it turns out that someone else was taking advantage of the hack or at least the vulnerability present in Youku\u2019s server. The 21-year-old Mr. Hu (since his first name was not revealed) from Qianxi county in Guizhou province discovered a vulnerability in Youku\u2019s payment system allowing him to make refunds which did not belong to him. Hu stole 13 million yuan (US$1.9 million) from the website and spent it on live-streaming programs tipping models, reported ThePaper.com.Mr. Hu was sentenced to 15years in prison after pleading guilty in a hearing in Beijing, China. The 21-year-old ran an online software store and pleaded guilty to theft at a hearing in Beijing, according to the article. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. However, it seems like the 15 years prison time did not evoke remorse for what he did since in the court he categorically stated that he is sorry for what he did to Youku but he does not regret his actions.\u201cI\u2019m sorry [for what I did] to the Youku company, but I don\u2019t regret this.

From asking visa applicants and travelers for their social media credentials to the installation of face recognition system for locals or banning laptop from 10 countries over ISIS fears rules are changing like never before.Now, things may change since recently, the Secretary of Homeland Security Gen. John Kelly told in an interview that he might be planning on expanding the ban on laptops in US-bound flights. The ban will mean that passengers on flights from countries around the world will not be allowed to carry laptops on air.What is the ban all about? In an interview that aired on Fox News Sunday, Gen. John Kelly stated that he might expand the ban since he believes electronic devices can pose a real threat. He said:\u201cThere\u2019s a real threat. There are numerous threats to aviation. That\u2019s really the thing they\u2019re really obsessed with, the terrorists, the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if it is a US carrier, particularly if it is full of mostly US folks.\u201dAs such, it seems like the General will probably expand the ban to avoid any terrorists slipping past US border security. However, this does not mean that people have welcomed the ban. In fact, passengers complain that the ban would mean that they will not have anything to kill time while they are on the flight. This is particularly true for those who are traveling long distances.Countries currently affected by the ban: On March 21, the ban came into effect taking in its reach a number of countries. The ban prevented passengers on flights coming from ten airports in eight countries from bringing any electronic devices with them and that the devices need to be checked-in with one\u2019s luggage.The countries to which the ban applies include Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Istanbul, Kuwait, Egypt, Cairo, Jordan, Jeddah and Riyadh, Morocco, Qatar, Doha, Saudia Arabia and Amman. It must be noted that it was not only the US that put such a ban on certain countries. The UK too followed a similar pattern and imposed a laptop ban on some countries.Plans for expansion: The ban is expected to increase its coverage and various experts say that the initial ban was simply in the early stage and was rolled out so as to familiarize travelers with the new law. The ban is likely to extend to European countries where US-bound flights from European airports will not be allowed to have anyone with laptops or tablets on board.Increased security screening: The Gen. has not only expressed plans to expand the ban but has also stated that baggage screening will be enhanced so that carry-on bags can be scanned much more effectively for any weapons. He stated that this is necessary since many passengers have a lot of items in their bags and this makes the regular scanners unable to dig deeper.Image Credit: Shutterstock/ioatDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Airport", "Crime", "europe", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Social Media", "Terrorism", "USA"], "title": "US May Expand Laptop Ban to All International Flights", "date": "May 29, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "The importance of keeping customer data safe is something all companies have worried about, and with some businesses suffering data breaches, it can be difficult to implement platforms such as omni-channel. The way omni-channel helps businesses and consumers to access multiple devices and channels can also raise security questions that you will need to answer. How can you maintain the security of your data while still offering a full omni-channel experience to your customers?StrategyIn order to maintain the security of your customer\u2019s data, you need to have strategies in place that have been tailored to each of the channels you are using. The issues surrounding Android security are different from those of PC\u2019s, so you have to have separate guidance for each. Trying to supplement traditional credit data with other information from social media profiles and device IP\u2019s can help to strengthen the identity verification. This is especially true if the user has profiles on multiple social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Utilizing this data is the key to providing better authentication. Balancing ActCompanies want their customers to have as open and cohesive experience as they can, but this type of freedom can cause security issues. Knowing how to gauge such problems while keeping the openness is a delicate balancing act. For organizations running SAP, companies such as www.weaveability.com can assist with the whole omni-channel experience and can help to make a secure environment. However, there are is still the need to monitor and anticipate any potential issues as they arise. AuthenticationOne of the key ways to maintain security is through authentication. This can be a problematic area and has led to serious issues for companies in the past. The strength of the authentication and how that is transferred to the other channels is important to the security of the system and the customer data. Maintenance of the authentication is vital to making sure there are no weaknesses in the system. Anticipating threats and having effective countermeasures will also go some way to keeping your data secure. Keeping up to dateWhile data is what you are trying to protect, it is also what you need to keep yourself and your workers up to speed. You need to be aware of new security issues and other trends in order to amend your strategy if needed. With technology changing all the time, there are always new devices and new ways to access their data. By staying on top of these new vulnerabilities, you can manage your security better and hopefully keep your customer\u2019s data secure. Online security is a very difficult thing to achieve and maintain. You want your customers to have a smooth and effortless experience with your brand, but you also need to maintain trust and security. A breach can erode public confidence in brands, sometimes permanently, so you need to think about how to use omni-channel in a way that can work for your company and your customers.Image Credit: Shutterstock/PhotonPhotoDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Android", "Data", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "How Companies can stay Secure while using Omni-Channel", "date": "May 29, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Checkpoint researchers revealed that various apps were being downloaded through Google Play and that these so-called apps installed adware into users\u2019 Android phones, secretly tricking them into click ads while earning millions through Google\u2019s pay-per-click feature.The biggest ad fraud: It has been reported that after the campaign was revealed, Google removed over 40 apps that were thought to be infected with the malware. However, it seems that Google response was too late as reports indicated that the apps had been downloaded 36 million times. This is quite surprising since even at this magnitude, Google\u2019s rigorous software was unable to detect the malware in these apps. The malware is known as \u201cJudy.\u201dHow does it work? The mechanism is quite tricky and yet very easy to exploit as explained by one of the security researchers. Primarily, the malware is not downloaded when a user downloads an app. Rather, once the app is downloaded and installed, it is only after that the malware gets injected into the app.Later, the apps execute code that automatically keeps clicking on ads on Google thus earning the company Kiniwini, millions in ad revenue. According to the latest estimate, the firm has been making $300,000 per month. Furthermore, there are some apps that instead of clicking the ads automatically, simply display ads that can only be removed if the user taps or clicks on them.Kiniwini and Google have nothing to say: Both Kiniwini and Google were requested to comment on the situation, but both declined to respond to any requests. Kiniwini simply posted on its blog that some of its apps are being removed from Google Play, but did not mention any particular reason for the removal.Kiniwini is not the first: Such adware is not uncommon in the Android world. In fact, a Google security expert states that there are many other apps which effectively hide the malware from detection. They are neither captured by anti-virus software nor are they intercepted by Google. One of the reasons for this is that while on Google Play, these apps are nothing more than innocent software. However, it is only after they are downloaded, that the apps start to get loaded with the infection.Apps Affected with Judy Malware:\u201cAnimal Judy: Persian Cat Care, Fashion Judy: Pretty Rapper, Fashion Judy: Teacher Style, Animal Judy: Dragon Care, Chef Judy: Halloween Cookies, Fashion Judy: Wedding Party, Animal Judy: Teddy Bear Care, Fashion Judy: Bunny Girl Style, Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess, Chef Judy: Triangular Kimbap, Chef Judy: Udong Maker \u2013 Cook, Fashion Judy: Uniform Style, Animal Judy: Rabbit Care, Fashion Judy: Vampire Style, Animal Judy: Nine-Tailed Fox, Chef Judy: Jelly Maker \u2013 Cook, Chef Judy: Chicken Maker, Animal Judy: Sea Otter Care, Animal Judy: Elephant Care, Judy\u2019s Happy House, Chef Judy: Hot Dog Maker \u2013 Cook, Chef Judy: Birthday Food Maker, Fashion Judy: Wedding Day, Fashion Judy: Waitress Style, Chef Judy: Character Lunch, Chef Judy: Picnic Lunch Maker, Animal Judy: Rudolph Care, Judy\u2019s Hospital: Pediatrics, Fashion Judy: Country Style, Animal Judy: Feral Cat Care, Fashion Judy: Twice Style, Fashion Judy: Myth Style, Animal Judy: Fennec Fox Care, Animal Judy: Dog Care, Fashion Judy: Couple Style, Animal Judy: Cat Care, Fashion Judy: Halloween Style, Fashion Judy: EXO Style, Chef Judy: Dalgona Maker, Chef Judy: Service Station Food, Judy\u2019s Spa Salon.\u201dRecently, the Russian security firm, Group-IB, revealed that an Android malware going by the name of Chron was hidden in almost 1 million apps.

This time, however, the bug is cunningly placed in an image source file which is loaded once a web page with that image is accessed.The special filename: Windows OS has always had a flaw in its file system allowing attackers to exploit a file naming convention that has the potential to render a user\u2019s system utterly useless.To give you a bit of background, Windows file system has a number of files which are considered as special due to the way they are handled. Primarily, there are some filenames stored in the operating system that refers to files which do not have any actual files. That is, these files refer to the hardware of the system. However, such files can still be accessed despite not having any real existence.The filenames which can crash your system: Not all of these filenames have the potential to kill your system. However, some files, when accessed in a certain way, can cause damage. For instance, the filename which was used to crash the old Windows operating systems was \u201ccon\u201d. This file referred to the monitor and keyboard of your computer.Although Windows was smart enough to manage any attempts to access the file once properly, it, however, had no idea what to do if it was being accessed twice at the same time. That is, the older bug made a reference in the form of c:\\con\\con and this resulted in Windows to crash. Now, however, the file is being referenced through an image source. Particular images in a web page will access the special filenames and hence disrupt your entire system.Nevertheless, this time round, the filename is not \u201ccon\u201d, but another special file called \u201c$MFT\u201d. This filename refers to the metadata stored in the NTFS directory. Although the filesystem blocks any attempts to access the file, it does not do so if it is being accessed through a directory \u2013 that is, in the form of c:\\$MFT\\123.Doing so forces NTFS to lock the entire system and so you will not be able to access any file. Some browsers try to prevent web pages from accessing these files, Internet Explorer, on the other hand, will allow access.

The device which is implanted in the body of a patient to deal with life-threatening cardiac rhythmic issues? These devices often use radio signals to communicate with the pacemaker to avoid further surgeries. Now, according to a recent research report, these pacemakers contain some security loopholes which make them vulnerable to potentially catastrophic cyber attacks.The researchers, Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts from WhiteScope recently divulged a troubling fact about the pacemaker device that has around 8600 which could be attractive to malicious hackers out there. These pacemaker ecosystem security flaws, if misused by any hacker, could potentially bring about some fatal consequences since the attackers can even adjust the pacemaker should they choose to; posing a grave risk to the lives of patients.\u201cAny pacemaker programmer can reprogram any pacemaker from the same manufacturer.This shows one of the areas where patient care influenced cybersecurity posture.\u201d wrote the researchers in their summary.The researchers continue with their condemnation by saying that the risks have been multiplied with the availability of such devices, its programs and the monitors on public eCommerce and auction sites such as eBay. This was defended by the manufacturer\u2019s claim that the product accessibility is potentially controlled across the globe. The research further claimed that they had found some grave security issues in the pacemaker after purchasing the device which was priced between $15 to $3,000.These security flaws were discovered in four variant programmers from separate manufacturers. Moreover, they have also found the patient\u2019s\u2019 medical data which was left unencrypted in the pacemaker ecosystem; which of course, is a total vulnerability that is needed to be addressed by the manufacturer before the device is targeted by potential ransomware attacks. The researchers disclosed East Coast Hospital as the source of the data. However, this is not the first time when cyber security experts have raised concerns regarding gross vulnerabilities in such medical devices. Back in 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team both released various provisos about the security loopholes in various medical devices that included ventilators, monitors, drug infusion pumps, anesthesia and surgical devices. The potential hackers, if they were to breach standard passwords of these devices, could easily get the access and control to these devices and even could change the settings that can yet again bring severe consequences.These researchers further discussed their subsequent research about home monitoring systems and stated they would put forward the queries that can be used by vendors while evaluating their security issues.\u201cThe findings are relatively consistent across the different vendors, highlighting the need for all vendors to perform an in-depth and holistic evaluation of implemented security controls,\u201d Rios and Butts said. \u201cBy ensuring appropriate security controls are implemented, vendors can help protect against potential system compromises that may have implications for patient care.\u201dImage Credit: Shutterstock/ChooChinDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Medical", "Privacy", "security", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Thousands of Critical Security Flaws Leave Pacemaker Vulnerable to Hackers", "date": "May 27, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Gone are those days when Google play store was a trusted place for downloads and it seems like hackers are bypassing the security protocols of Google play store quite easily as a new attack called \u201cCloak & Dagger\u201d was spotted by security researchers which could let the hackers take over the infected device. According to the security researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology and UC Santa Barbara, these attacks are designed to steal user\u2019s information of an infected device. However, the attackers can do much more damage if they want to.Cloak & Dagger explained: It seems like attackers have infected some of the apps on Google Play store (the exact number and names of these apps are still unknown), and as soon as the infected app is installed, the attacker can begin their magic. The malicious app will require only two permissions called \u201cBIND ACCESSIBILITY SERVICE (\u201ca11y\u201d)\u201d and SYSTEM ALERT WINDOW (\u201cdraw on top\u201d). As soon as the app gets these permissions, it will start stealing all the sensitive information including password credentials, bank details, etc from the infected device.

The update will take quite a lot of time to get to each and every user out there therefore meanwhile avoid download unnecessary apps from both Google Play Store and third-party sites.This demo video shows a demo of the \u201cStealthy Phishing Attack\u201d, one of the Cloak & Dagger attacks:This video shows a demo of the \u201cContex Aware/Hiding Clickjacking + Silent God-mode App Install\u201d, one of the Cloak & Dagger attacks: Image Credit: Shutterstock/YmgermanDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Android", "APPS", "Cyber Crime", "g", "Google Play", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "security"], "title": "New Android Exploit \u2018Cloak and Dagger\u2019 Lets Attackers Steal User Data", "date": "May 26, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});This has become the era where the internet is widely used for the purpose of cyber reconnaissance/espionage/corruption by political parties. To put in layman\u2019s terms, the political leg pulling, posturing and deviance via cyber leaks have become quite common today. Be it WikiLeaks, Yahoo hacks at the time of US National election or any cyber espionage; our curiosity to know the surreptitious secret about famous political figures leads us to believe every leak that goes viral without investigating further to establish the accuracy of the news. We barely think twice whether the leaked news put forward by any hacker is based on facts or whether influential parties are manipulating it for some ill-defined or illicit purpose. Consequently, the public is served up misinformation and half truths and sometimes even outright lies.The Citizen Labs\u2019 latest report, Tainted Leaks: Disinformation and Phishing with a Russian Nexus, shows that we as an audience predominantly possess the nature of being naive and gullible when it comes to evaluating any leak that hits our screen or airwaves. The report expounds some of the latest leaks generated by cyber infiltration that has gained traction or even gone viral. However, these were nothing more than misinformation designed to distract and even detract and render the recipient of the news misguided. These leaks were purposefully publicized with the sole aim to defame leading personalities who were combating government corruption. These preys spread across 39 nations across the globe, affecting government, agencies, industrial figures, security forces, analysts and prominent people from the civil society. Moreover, the targets were the media fraternity including journalists, media moguls, activists and few other highly influential personalities.As per the report\u2019s indication, the civil society holds the record of being the second most targeted party after the government. The director of Citizen Lab has also corroborated this by saying, \u201cFor many powerful elites, a vibrant civil society is an antithesis to their corrupt aims.\u201dThe research kicked off with a widespread phishing and misinformation maneuver associated with Russia. This operation was intended to offer as proof that it was made by manipulating the documents stolen from leading journalists and used to tamper them before their original release to the media. The name of this misleading indoctrination given by Citizen Lab is \u201cTainted Leaks.\u201dThe American Journalist David Satter was the first to fall victim or patient zero if you will. He fell victim to the cyber espionage back in October 2016 by an implanted phishing attack.  This Journalist is widely known for incriminating Intelligence Service of Russia. Back in September 1999, he levied accusations against the government for the alleged bombing in the apartment of Buynaksk, Volgodonsk, and Moscow, causing the death of 293 people. The misfortunate hit Sattar when he mistakenly gave his password to a credential hacking website. Consequently, he had to face the aftermath of his mistake that was in the form of having his emails stolen and having them leaked to the public by a Russian-sponsored cyber hacking group known as CyberBerkut.Before leaking the emails, a handful of Satter\u2019s emails were cunningly altered to give an impression that Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist, one of the leading opposition personality had been receiving the receipt of foreign funding. Moreover, these tainted leaks were aimed to stigmatize the reports that spoke about the corruption of the close allies of Russian President, Vladimir Putin. The dubious timings show \u201cadvance knowledge of the publication of an upcoming piece of investigative journalism concerning senior Russian officials and businessmen.\u201dOne of the implanted sentences in the leaked emails was; \u201cBesides, on October 24-25, Vedomosti columnist Elena Vinogradova will publish an article about Moscow Oblast issues in which senior Russian officials and businessmen close to Putin will be mentioned.\u201d  This addition brings light to the acknowledgment of the mass-surveillance operation that is underway against both the Vinogradova and Vedomosti.Following this patient zero, an infinite number of preys that were discussed in the Citizen Lab report were found to be journalists or those associated with civil society. Most of these preys were found working with the Russian language centers like \u201cSlon/Republic, Vedomosti, Novaya Gazeta, and the BBC Russian Service.\u201dAmong the strategies used, there was a tactic of appending the journalists\u2019 name to tainted emails in a bid to incriminate them in the fabricated program; Painting their picture as agents lining their pockets from foreign funding and working to defame the Russian government. In addition to this, there was another tactic, that is to eliminate the name of Radio Liberty, one of the Russian-language outlets. This is to mislead the masses with the presence of global conspiracy against  Kremlin.\u201cThe operators modified the document\u2019s scope in an attempt to create the appearance of a widespread media campaign,\u201d Citizen Lab wrote. \u201cThey did this by removing or modifying mentions of Radio Liberty throughout the document.\u201dThis tainted stuff was soon propagated across  Russian newly operated agencies/outlets that included Sputnik Radio and RIA Novosti. And then these leaks were used as potential evidence against CIA\u2019s operation to stir up a color revolution not dissimilar to the \u201cYellow Revolution of 1986 in Philippine.\u201dFurthermore, the report divulged the fact that apart from civil society and the government, there are quite an extensive list of targets that hit United Nation members, former senior director of the US National Security Council, a former officer of the US defence agency, some top level members of oil, mining, gas and finance industries of old SU States.Inevitably, these campaigns would continue to grow at lightning speed as the increase in data stealing is exponentially gaining a boost. This all is detailed in the report presented by Citizen Lab and according to Deibert, \u201cIndeed, we could be on the cusp of a new era of superpower-enabled, digital disinformation.\u201d He further added, \u201cThe public\u2019s faith in media (which is already very low), and the ability of civil society to do its job effectively, will both invariably suffer as collateral damage.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Image Credit: Shutterstock/GlebStockDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Espionage", "hacking", "internet", "Phishing", "Privacy", "security", "Surveillance", "Technology"], "title": "Hackers alter stolen emails for clandestine attacks against Putin\u2019s critics", "date": "May 26, 2017"}, {"authur": "Alex Bennett", "body": "With rising salaries and a massive global demand for qualified professionals, cybersecurity is an incredibly attractive industry to work in.

There are thousands of unfilled cyber roles and the situation is getting worse; Symantec now predicts there will be 1.5 million unfilled cybersecurity roles by 2019.The demand has been driven by increasing levels of cybercrime, explosive growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology and business worries centered on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced in 2018.To prove their skills and knowledge, cyber professionals prove often aim for industry-recognized certifications. These qualifications build knowledge and validate it in the eyes of employers and clients. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at five proven cybersecurity certifications \u2013 using aggregate data from PayScale \u2014 that will skyrocket your salary.GIAC\u2019s GCIH (GIAC Certified Incident Handler) proves a professional\u2019s ability to detect, respond to and resolve cybersecurity incidents with minimal damage to the business. This vendor-neutral qualification is aimed at professionals who want to work as Incident Handlers, but is also suited to system administrators and security architects. While often contrasted to EC-Council\u2019s Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), the GCIH certification differs as it focuses on defense and response to cybersecurity incidents. The CEH, on the other hand, focuses its attention on offensive security, like hacking tools and techniques.Professionals can further specialize their skills with advanced-level certifications from GIAC and the GCIH forms an excellent foundation for incident handling knowledge. Because of this, it\u2019s a great way of proving knowledge and commands an average salary of $88,500.As evidence of its importance within the cybersecurity field, ISACA\u2019s CISA certification won SC Magazine\u2019s best Professional Certification Programme in 2017.The CISA is aimed squarely at IT auditors \u2013 professionals responsible for discovering security risks and inefficiencies within business information systems. This renowned certification validates an IT auditors knowledge in the assessment of vulnerabilities in an enterprise environment. It\u2019s tough to achieve and the CISA is designed for experienced IT auditors with five years\u2019 experience in auditing, control, or cybersecurity. Because of this high requirement, this auditing certification commands a healthy $95,000 salary.The ECSA (EC-Council Security Analyst) is the follow-up certification to the popular Certified Ethical Hacker. The certification builds on the knowledge of hacking tools covered in the CEH, providing a structured methodology for penetration testing.To gain the ECSA certification, professionals must complete a hands-on penetration testing exam, consisting of multiple challenges. Obtaining the hash of a protected file or breaking into machines are both potential tasks that must be completed within the time limit.Once the challenges are finished, professionals are then required to submit a penetration testing report, explaining the exploits and detailing fixes. Finally, to get the certification, a lengthy four hour, multiple choice exam must be taken (and passed).Penetration testing \u2014 also known as ethical hacking \u2014 is an exciting and in-demand career. Organizations need penetration testers to secure their systems against cybercrime, and they\u2019re willing to pay well for these skills \u2013 $98,000 per annum for ECSA-certified professionals to be exact.Plus, this is only the second level of a three-tier track. The final level of EC-Council\u2019s penetration testing track is the LPT Master and holders of this expert-level certification will undoubtedly see their salaries rising further. You\u2019ve heard the phrase before and it remains true: (ISC)2\u2019s CISSP is the gold standard security certification. The CISSP is designed for professionals in managerial roles or as a benchmark for professionals aiming for top-level security roles, like the Chief Information Security Officer.CISSP holders are ultimately responsible for an organization\u2019s security blueprint. They control risk management, make the strict security decisions and will face greater responsibility if things go wrong. This \u2018gold standard\u2019 certification is aimed at senior security professionals at the top of their career and should only be attempted by veterans with at least five years\u2019 experience.The CISSP certification is tough and passing the lengthy exam is a large undertaking. Adding it to your resume, however, will qualify you for some of the best roles and salaries in the industry. CISSP holders earn an average median salary of $102,000.The CISM certification tops this list and is another popular qualification from ISACA. It\u2019s designed for security managers \u2013 professionals responsible for the design, management, and implementation of network and computer security technology and policies. The Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) is a top credential for IT professionals who want to validate their ability to manage, develop and oversee information security systems in the enterprise.The CISM aims to validate an IT security professional\u2019s knowledge of enterprise-level security management. CISM holders possess proven skills in security risk management, program development and management, governance, and incident management and response. That\u2019s why it brings in the highest salary on the list, at an impressive $116,000 per annum.The best time to prove your cyber skills\u201cThe market for IT security professionals is poised for another strong year,\u201d notes CompTIA Senior Vice President Tim Herbert. \u201cThe security job category was one of the faster growing IT occupations during 2016.\u201dAs a barrage of catastrophic global cyber attacks accelerates IT security to the top of the C-suite agenda, the demand for cyber skills is unlikely to cease soon \u2013 especially with dangerous threats on the horizon.Image Credit: Shutterstock/Alexander Supertramp", "topics": ["cyber security", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "security", "Technology"], "title": "5 Proven Cyber Security Certifications That Will Skyrocket Your Salary", "date": "May 26, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});WannaCry ransomware attack has left a devastating trail on half of the world and this also includes the Russia\u2019s postal service which was recently targeted and successfully infected by the malware. Some of the service\u2019s computers are still not operational. This is one of the biggest signs of weakness when it comes to Russia\u2019s online defenses and many believe that this might make it one of the major victims of the recent global extortion.The ransomware attack has compromised the automated management system of the Russian post office and many of the touch-screen terminals ended up being infected. This is mostly because they\u2019re still running on Windows XP, which is considered outdated. It\u2019s still unknown how many branches were affected by the attack.According to Reuters, Russian Post\u2019s spokesman has stated that no computers were infected during the attack; however, many of the terminals were still turned off, simply as a precaution. Other than that, everything is still stable and in full working order.Virus #Wannacry hits Russian postal service, exposes wider security shortcomings, Reuters reports. Computers switched off as precaution.\u2014 xaviercolas (@xaviercolas) May 25, 2017Among the infected institutions are the Interior Ministry, Russian Railways and even the mobile operator MegaFon. All of these companies have reported being locked out of their computers, with the ransomware note appearing and demanding $300-600 in Bitcoin. Also, there are several reports that the attack hit the Russian central bank and they have confirmed it by stating that some of the Russian banks were indeed compromised but that those are isolated cases.The virus spread easily because users and corporations are still using Windows XP which Microsoft stopped supporting years ago. It, therefore, contains a critical vulnerability in Server Message Block protocol (SMB) of the Windows OS exploited by WannaCry ransomware malware. Experts believe that using the outdated operating system in the critical cyber infrastructure is the perfect ingredient for cybercriminals to conduct their attacks. It must be noted that up to 20% of all of the infected computers were located in Russia.Investigators have also pointed out that the post office attack shows that WannaCry attackers are not only targeting the \u2018important\u2019 computers but pretty much everyone they can find and get access to. This is why all of the systems need to be updated.Before this attack, Russian postal service has never known any virus related issues as far as it\u2019s publicly known. In this case, workers have revealed that they were instructed not to turn their computers on during the attack and only yesterday received orders to do so. Another post office employee has confirmed that the queuing system was damaged, but they didn\u2019t know the reason why while the second biggest of the Russian mobile operators, MegaFon, has refused to give any comments on how their systems got infected.Another important fact about this attack is that Russian users come in contact with pirated software quite often which are unlicensed and that\u2019s why their security isn\u2019t updated. Despite this, there were no confirmations of pirated, unlicensed software in any of the Russian government institutions that were infected. However, computer piracy is still a pretty big issue in Russia. Some reports claim that up to 64% of software used in Russia in 2015 was pirated. Of course, not only the companies are to be blamed since most home users are using pirated software as well.Vishal Gupta, CEO of Seclore commented on the issue and said that:  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});At this point, Windows 10 costs around $140.92 in Russia, which is around 8,000 roubles.

The scanner, as you may already know, is a lock system that lets a user lock and unlocks one\u2019s phone by simply staring at it and getting one\u2019s irises scanned so as to verify one\u2019s identity. Such biometric technology has seemingly taken over the conventional password systems that are now perceived to be outdated and less secure.Ironically, the hackers at the Chaos Computer Club were able to fool the iris scanner with just a laser print of a person\u2019s photograph with lenses on its eyes. Essentially, the hackers took a photo with their camera focusing on the eyes and took out a laser print of the photo.They then placed contact lenses on the eye and brought the iris scanner in front of the picture.Voila! The scanner verified the identity and was easily unlocked. According to the hacker, the most expensive thing involved in breaking past the iris verification process was to get the original Samsung S8. Also, the laser print was taken out of Samsung\u2019s premium laser printer.Iris scanners are more dangerous than other biometrics: According to one of the spokesperson of Chaos Computer, Dirk Engling, the iris scanner is much more vulnerable to breaches than fingerprints scanners since irises are always exposed. There is no way to hide them, and as such, they can easily be replicated.This is in stark contrast to what the majority believes about iris scanners, which is that a person\u2019s eye has to be cut out in order to break the verification system. Furthermore, Engling stated that a simple high-resolution picture is sufficed to break the system with pictures being easily available on the internet.The rise of biometrics and impending dangers: Unfortunately, despite the dangers, biometrics are overtaking the traditional password systems as evidenced by the recent launch of \u201cselfie pay\u201d by MasterCard and the more common face recognition system introduced in Australia, to replace the traditional passport verification process.

Check Point reported that attackers usually make use of two hacking methods to hijack a system. They either coax users into clicking a link which activates malware or they trick users into downloading a file which contains the malware.Nevertheless, a new method has just been discovered in which an attacker can easily exploit vulnerabilities in media players and inject malware through subtitles into the systems of those who use such media players to stream online content.The problem here is that unlike traditional malware links and files, subtitle files are simply pieces of texts written in a way that makes it impossible for security experts, anti-virus software and users to identify whether the subtitle file has actually been compromised. In such situation, it is only after an attack has been launched that the victim discovers that their security has been compromised.The attack is usually done by exploiting certain vulnerabilities in media files which consider online subtitle repositories as trustworthy and reliable. However, attackers can easily manipulate such repositories and make the media players download the infected media files by toggling with the repository\u2019s configuration.According to CheckPoint\u2019s blog post:How does a media player select a subtitle file? The principal vulnerability lies in how a media player selects a subtitle file to download. As mentioned earlier, media players such as VLC, usually pick subtitle files automatically from online subtitle repositories which have over 25 different formats in which a subtitle file is stored.However, in order to provide a better experience, the media players parse all of the different formats and this involves fragmented software which then gives rise to numerous flaws. It is these flaws that an attacker can exploit to launch an attack.Furthermore, online repositories have a mechanism through which they rank different subtitle files created by various people. An attacker can manipulate the system into making his or her file rank first. Media players, on the other hand, usually select the files that have a high ranking and are therefore tricked into downloading files which have malware. Also, users who download subtitle files manually, may look for the highest-ranking file and thus get the one which has been infected.What happens once the file is downloaded? After you download the infected file, the perpetrator can virtually take control of your entire machine and do whatever he or she wants; they can do anything from stealing your bank details to injecting harmful malware.

Well, it matches with the ongoing situation of WannaCry ransomware attacks as researchers from TrustLook, a cyber security company have collected 386 new samples of WannaCry ransomware.WannaCry is a wicked encryption based malware (aka ransomware) which used Server Message Block protocol (SMB) vulnerability in Windows operating system. The malware uses EternalBlue exploit stolen from the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States and leaked by Shadow Brokers hacking group. Once infecting the device the malware asks users to pay a ransom payment of $300 to $600 in bitcoins.While security researchers (the good guys) are halting WannaCry infection by identifying its kill switch, the cyber criminals (the bad guys) are coming up with new samples or trying to DDoS the existing kill switches to carry on with the infection.\u201cThis attack is unprecedented in scale,\u201d said Allan Zhang, co-founder, and CEO of Trustlook. \u201cWindows users and administrators should ensure that their systems are updated with the latest security patches to help prevent further infections and to slow the spread of the ransomware.\u201dTrustLook has also released a free scanner and vaccine toolkit to protect Windows computers that are vulnerable to the malware. TrustLook\u2019s toolkit can be downloaded from GitHub. Additionally, the company has published hash for each sample which can be seen here.In their second blog post, the company has also discussed the discovery of 26 EternalRocks samples. EternalRocks is a worm which was found last week by security researchers. This worm uses the same SMB vulnerability in Windows like the WannaCry but is much more advanced and sophisticated than WannaCry could ever be since it utilizes seven NSA hacking tools while WannaCry used just two. These tools are EternalBlue, DoublePulsar, EternalChampion, EternalRomance, EternalSynergy, ArchiTouch and SMBTouch.TrustLook has also published hash for each sample. Other than knowing that EternalRocks can do more damage than WannaCry the detailed analysis of it is still pending.

However, instead of doing the things he could, he simply informed the respective companies about the flaws their systems had. This is what ethical hacking is all about.Sajnani was able to hack into the application tracking system of Air India in 2015 (but only disclosing it now in 2017) and exploited a major vulnerability that allowed him to book a ticket from India to San Francisco for just Re 1. However, he immediately emailed Air India notifying them of the vulnerability that resided in their tracking system and consequently received a call from the manager of finance asking Sajnani to prove his claims. He followed the request accordingly and was rewarded for his efforts.SpiceJet was another one of Sajnani\u2019s victims. This time, however, it was not only the system that was defective; rather it was an entire department which did not pay attention to the irregularities of the transactions that Sajnani was able to carry out.Essentially, Sajnani booked a flight from Ahmedabad to Goa for just Rs. 4. The actual flight would have cost him Rs. 4,000. Later, however, he canceled the ticket and made himself eligible for a refund of Rs. 2000. However, Sajnani had to call the helpline informing them he has canceled the ticket and should, therefore, receive a refund.This implies that no one in Spice Jet was aware of what was happening and was also not responsible enough to automatically give Sajnani his refund. Nevertheless, he emailed Spice Jet informing them of the vulnerability in their system. The reply that he got first was simply alarming since it stated that Sajnani could email his resume to the careers department if he wants an internship. Seeing such a response, Sajnani then reached out to the General Manager of Spice Jet, Mr. Pradeep Shah and the reply he got had a .eml attachment named \u201cDouble Facepalm.\u201dSajnani hacked into Cleartrip\u2019s booking system and booked himself a flight for free. He notified the company by sending out an email. Later, the company responded back requesting Sajnani to call them and explain the vulnerability. Nevertheless, realizing the danger of talking about these things over a phone, Sajnani refused and asked them to continue the correspondence over email. Furthermore, the payment system of Cleartrip was found defective as it entitled Sajnani for a Rs. 1,199 refund and the money was credited in his Mobiwik wallet. Sajnani informed Cleartrip regarding this issue as well but did not hear back.Sajnani, for one, was highly disappointed since only a couple of companies responded him professionally, while others either ignored it or took it as a joke. This implies that such companies are too arrogant to accept the weaknesses in their systems.Sajnani stated that at least these companies should have the courtesy of replying appropriately when someone is pointing out the flaws in their digital systems. All of this implies that we all are vulnerable to theft and security breaches and no company is cautious enough to address such issues.Although CloudFlare bug bounty reward is often ridiculed for being a meager t-shirt; companies in India seem oblivious to the ridicule and are doing somewhat similar. Last week HackRead exclusively broke the news about the Zomato hack where it turned out that their bug bounty reward is just a simple certification. This shows that most of the giants are willing to make money but when it comes to spending on their security they are not ready for it or are not willing to absorb the expense.Furthermore, the replies from the companies Sajnani got in touch with also show a lack of education regarding the cyber security in India. While it\u2019s true that India might be the next big thing in the world of technology, the need to educate officials at companies like Air India, SpiceJet and Zomato is a necessity like never before.Image Credit: ShutterstockDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Airport", "Bug Bounty", "hacking", "India", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Indian hacker pwned Air India, SpiceJet & Cleartrip; booked free flights", "date": "May 23, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas Khan", "body": "Online privacy and security have been the focus of debate lately.

However, knowing which Google Chrome VPN extension to install might become a challenge.Google Chrome security plugins are everywhere on the Google store. In this guide, you will get to know about the best privacy extensions on Chrome. Here are the top 3 secure browsing Chrome extensions which will maximize your online privacy:PureVPN Chrome ExtensionPureVPN \u2013 the Hong Kong-based VPN giant \u2013 commenced its operations in 2007. Since then, the company has gained a solid reputation in the online privacy and security industry for all the right reasons.PureVPN provides AES 256 bit encryption as standard and recently launched the Chrome VPN extension, which allows PureVPN users to get unrestricted access to a private and fast internet with vigorous VPN encryption algorithms that secure your online activities. Once connected, you can bypass geo-restrictions and stay safe of unprotected public WiFis.The VPN extension for Chrome from PureVPN allows you to get unrestricted access to 35 countries, unlike the app where you get access to 750+ servers based in 140+ countries. Additionally, PureVPN\u2019s Chrome VPN extension employs latest protocols and exciting features such as WebRTC Leak Protection, malware protection, tracker protection and most importantly, it acts as an ad-blocker, making it the first VPN extension to block ads.Private Internet AccessPrivate Internet Access is another VPN extension that allows you to bypass geo-restrictions and has been in the VPN industry for quite some time now. Like PureVPN, Private Internet Access also has WebRTC blocking protection. However, it does not have the remaining features such as the capability to block ads, protect you against malware or dodge trackers.PIA\u2019s extension enables users to encrypt their web traffic and stay protected when online. You can securely access the Internet at Wi-Fi hotspots. All you have to do is install the Chrome extension, log in with your Private Internet Access subscription credentials, flip the on the switch and you\u2019ll be protected!TunnelBear VPNTunnelBear is also a reputable VPN service that is well-regarded in the VPN industry. Unlike PureVPN and Private Internet Access, TunnelBear is a free Google Chrome VPN extension that gets you around blocked websites.TunnelBear strives to reduce the number of websites and advertisers\u2019 abilities to track you, but it does not guarantee 100% ad-blocking capability. The VPN service secures you on public Wi-Fi\u2019s and offers you access to 20 countries only.You get a quota of 500MB monthly bandwidth which, let\u2019s face it \u2013 is far too less considering how bandwidth gets utilized once you\u2019re on the web.Final VerdictSo, which is the best VPN extension for Chrome? The conclusion can be based on the maximum features and advanced encryption algorithms that secure your online activities once you\u2019re connected.Moreover, the striking difference between three is an ad-blocker which eliminates any chances of pesky ads popping up on your screen and PureVPN chrome VPN extension only offers that.

Its target was Windows users demanding a ransom payment of $300 in Bitcoin in order to unlock their files. Not to mention that it was all possible due to an NSA exploit leaked by a hacking group calling itself Shadow Brokers.The WannaCry infection is not only limited to computers but also affecting medical devices. The IT security community are doing whatever it takes to stop the cyber criminals behind the whole campaign from spreading the virus further and targeting unsuspecting users. One of those researchers was Marcus Hutchins from the United Kingdom who discovered a domain used by WannaCry to communicate at the point of infection. Marcus did not only discover the domain but also registered it resulting in halting infection since the domain turned out to be the KillSwitch for WannaCry attack.Now, Marcus has revealed that the domain he registered is receiving distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack which means the hackers are trying to take down the domain so they can carry on with the malware attack. The hackers are using variants of the Mirai botnet for their attacks. The infamous Mirai malware was discovered last year and conducted the Internet\u2019s largest ever DDoS attack on DYN\u2019s DNS and OVH hosting in France through compromised CCTV, DVRs and routers.Today's Sinkhole DDoS Attack pic.twitter.com/wxT2YUrdOF\u2014 MalwareTech@Vegas (@MalwareTechBlog) May 18, 2017According to Wired, the KillSwitch is under DDoS attack and the attacks have peaked at 20 gigabits per seconds and are trending up. If they succeed, the inoperative WannaCry system will come back to life and begin to spread again.Now a few devious hackers appear to be trying to combine those two internet plagues: They\u2019re using their own copycats of the Mirai botnet to attack WannaCry\u2019s kill-switch. So far, researchers have managed to fight off the attacks. But in the unlikely event that the hackers succeed, the ransomware could once again start spreading unabated.\u201cPretty much as soon as it went public what had happened, one of the Mirai botnets started on the sinkhole,\u201d says Marcus Hutchins, the British security researcher who registered the WannaCry kill-switch domain. Since then, he says, near-daily attacks from that first botnet and others built with the same Mirai malware have steadily ticked up in size and impact.\u2026If the DDoS assault succeeds, WannaCry infections would immediately reignite. The ransomware stops scanning for new victims 24 hours after installing itself on a computer, says Matt Olney, a security researcher with Cisco\u2019s Talos team. But anytime one of those infected machines reboots, it starts scanning again. \u201cThe ones that were successfully encrypted are in this zombie state, where they\u2019re waiting to be reactivated if that domain goes away,\u201d says Olney.It must be noted that the second KillSwtich for WannaCry was identified by a French security researcher Matthieu Suiche but as of now, there is no indication if the KillSwitch domain owned by him is receiving DDoS attacks or not. However, the good news is that Suiche has come up with \u201cwannakiwi,\u201d a tool which helps users to clean their devices from WannaCry infection.

No, it\u2019s not Uiwix or Adylkuzz but more dangerous than all.WannaCry, as you may already know, is a ransomware on the loose. It uses the NSA leaked tools EternalBlue and DoublePulsar and exploits the SMB vulnerability in Windows to hijack computers. Up till now, more than 200,000 computers have been hacked along with major system-level networks.EternalRock, as the name goes, is yet another worm that exploits the same SMB vulnerability in Windows as that exploited by WannaCry, but is much more advanced and sophisticated than WannaCry could ever be.According to a report published by BleepingComputer, EternalRock is packed with up to eight hacking tools which again belong to the NSA. Unlike WannaCry, which only used two tools, EternalRock is a beast that can affect the unimaginable number of PCs and can have long-lasting effects on the entire cyber landscape.According to a security expert, the worm is not yet loaded with malware. That is, as of now, it does nothing. This is probably a good news since it is not being used to launch attacks right now. However, it is only a matter of time before the worm is made active and numerous attacks start emerging on the scene. Unfortunately, it is already out and there is no way in which it can be removed from the field.While WannaCry made itself more evident and made it easier for security experts to track down what was happening, we are not to expect such generosity from EternalRock. This is because EternalRock is much subtle which simply lurks in your system after getting installed. It deliberately delays the infection, and as such, it is much harder to detect. Furthermore, the worm cannot be prevented from spreading just by registering a domain like in the case of WannaCry.Update on #EternalRocks.

Yes, the virtual world has its fair share of downsides as well. Online threats such as data hacking, virus infestation, malware attacks are common. Ransomware is another addition to the list. Ransomware programs such as WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) CryptoLocker and CryptoWall are the most prevalent of threats among e-commerce websites. These malicious applications lurk around waiting for gullible web users to fall into their trap. Once the malware gets installed in the system, it effectively locks all the functions of your computer rendering your OS useless, until you pay the hacker a huge sum of money as ransom. The entire purpose of the ransomware threat is simple to extract money from you for restoring the data it has captured.Since January 2016, there have been 4,000 ransomware attacks, that\u2019s 300% increase as compared to data from 2015.1. In 2015, more than 25,000 enterprise users reported ransomware infections in their computers. A Kaspersky Labs report suggests that in 2016, the number rose to 158,000.2. A Webroot press release claimed that in 2015, close to 100,000 malicious IP addresses were being created every day, indicating how cybercriminals rely on changing identities.Read on to know more about the dangers of ransomware and how to protect your computers from it:Ransomware is not a new term for web developers and entrepreneurs; in fact, this online threat has been around for a quite a while now. It\u2019s been around for a number of years; the first known version dates back to 1989. However, the currently sophisticated ransomware that we see today popped up somewhere around 2010.Ransomware is a threat not just to people in business but also ordinary web users who\u2019re online just to check their emails or their Facebook newsfeed. Listed below is a comprehensive list of dos and don\u2019ts that every web users must follow so as to ensure that they never fall prey to ransomware:In case you didn\u2019t detect ransomware with siem, and your system does get infected, don\u2019t panic. The list of rules mentioned above only ensure that your computer doesn\u2019t fall prey to malware; it gives you no information on what to do if your system is already infected. Business enterprises, established organizations and web browsers \u2013 no one is spared from these malicious ransomware cyber minds.You cannot undo what\u2019s been done, but you do have control over your future course of action. We would now discuss the options a web user has when ransomware has compromised his account or system.Giving in to the demands of the hackers seems like the only practical option when the question of data security looms ominously in the background. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be true. Paying ransom might seem like the easy way out but remember that doing so would only fuel their illegal activities and fund the attackers. Moreover, even if you end up paying the said amount, there is no guarantee that your files would be decrypted and restored safely. Caving into these criminals in the hope of returning the files held hostage only gives them leverage to use the information against you for future attempts of extortion.The first and foremost thing that you should do is try removing the infected program from the server and safeguard your system. Each application has its own removal and deactivation process. These tutorials and help articles will give you a systematic, step-by-step guide on how to successfully remove the affected program without compromising on the security of your system. Note that the removal process works best when the system is disconnected from the network so as to minimize the risk of the ransomware spreading to other applications as well.Once you have terminated the infected program, your next course of action should be to restore the data held by hackers. Using a good and reliable backup platform is the easiest way to reclaim the lost information. When your data gets attacked by ransomware there are two options that you can choose from- either pay the ransom (not recommended) or restore the data via backup. There is no third way out. You can snoop around online looking for \u201cshadow copies\u201d or variants of the original files, but even those are of no help as hackers today use advanced RSA-2048 bit encryption key that not even \u201cbrute force\u201d can break into.Ransomware though possibly the most dangerous of online threats is nothing different from any ordinary malware if you look closely into its nature and functionality. Before we begin to talk about the various precautionary measures to protect your system against any ransomware, please note that the program spreads just like any other malware and needs an outlet, a weak point or a crack in your network through which it can infiltrate your system. Following safe browsing and computing practices and playing by the rules mitigates the risks of a ransomware attack. Mentioned below are some precautionary measures that every web user must adopt. It is better to be safe than sorry.It is always better to be on the lookout for suspicious activities than be complacent and regret it later. Moreover, no malware programs today come with a warning or any such indication of their true nature; hackers are way smarter than that. Cyber minds are always updating their hacking standards using new and innovative technology to dupe customers. Most of the time the infected files and malicious malware comes disguised as an alert message or an unexpected email from your contact list. Never click on any attachment or hyperlink that seems fishy. Also in case, you notice any suspicious file or email that asks for your personal information or bank details, double check it with the source company or sender before you download the attachments or give away any such sensitive data. Think twice before you click on files with suspicious extensions such as .exeThe fact that ransomware acts like any other malware and spread the same way a virus would be encouragement enough to keep your operating system updated as per the latest standards. Keeping all the applications, software and other core programs on your system upgraded to the latest standards only decrease the chances of a ransomware infestation. The developers of a program release updates and bug regularly fix that slowly but steadily changes the basic functionality of the system. If you do not tweak the OS accordingly, your files automatically become susceptible to an online attack.With constant updates and cloud backup support, it is tough for the ransomware malware to infiltrate your system. However, it is always safer if you also install a robust and reliable anti-virus system on your computer or mobile device. The anti-virus protection automatically deflects all Trojan programs, suspicious files and blocks any malware that might prove harmful to your system. Moreover, the cost of anti-virus software is any day less than the price you will have to pay in case your files are stolen by a dangerous program. Anti-virus programs like Quick heal and Avast also offer firewall services for safer web browsing.Always Have BackupIf by any chance your system does get infected with ransomware and the security of your information is at stake, cloud-based storage can effectively save the day. Having a backup either on the cloud or any offline external memory device saves you the trouble of paying to access your own files. Creating multiple backups sounds like a smart solution for users who want to protect their data from ransomware and other threats. For instance, Synology Cloud Station backup is a good option to back up stored data of the PC with the NAS system. Here, you get the option of creating almost 32 versions of the same file!Prevention is always better than cure; this holds true for all your online activities as well. Discussed below are the best security hacks of the year that every web user should apply right this moment to safeguard their files from ransomware and other virus threats.Installing a firewall is perhaps among the safest ways to protect your browser from any malware floating on the web. The firewall stands as a powerful barrier between the browser and your system, it meticulously checks and scans everything you download or install on your device from the internet. FortiGate, SonicWall, Untangle, UTM are among the top firewall programs that offer robust protection against ransomware. These applications are also known for blocking websites that have malicious content that can harm your system in any way.Anti-virus companies such as MacFree, Avast, and Sophos provide users with a centralized console for monitoring and managing your online and offline activities. This is an excellent feature for IT companies and multi-tier organizations that can now get all the notifications about the various departments on the local server as well as track the activities of a SaaS cloud-based platform in a single place. A more advanced version of the anti-virus also gives you the freedom to set up the trigger and execute them on the network accordingly restricting access or disabling certain sections as and when required. Ensure that the anti-virus is always up to date with the latest upgrades released in the market.The ransomware attacks are typically sourced from end-user accounts and can enter the network even if any member of the network installs or clicks on a suspicious attachment. Not all users should be given the same level of freedom and access to the files and folders on the server. This is where the \u201cprinciple of least privilege\u201d comes into the picture. When you assign security permission and accessibility to end-users, give them the liberty and authority to access only those files that they strictly need to complete their assigned tasks. Doing so would drastically minimize the risk of ransomware. It is smarter to authorize a few trusted people in the organization than to open the network for everyone.While a firewall ensures that your files are protected from any external threats looming on the server set up various correct file and folder level permissions protect your data from any internal security threat. Adding permissions and passwords that restrict end-user access to certain files prevent the risk of them hoarding the data and asking you money in exchange for it. You can tweak the access points of the NTFS security system giving only certain trustworthy users the authority to access the files on the server. By doing so, you are automatically blocking all attempts by external parties to barge into your system and steal data.Enabling the creation of volume shadow copies of the existing files and folder on the server is an added protection against ransomware that every organization should adopt. The shadow copies that you store on the shared network of the server can be accessed in case of a malware attack. Also depending on the way you store the files, the application also allows you to restore the files in their original form despite the changes made to them during the course of time (here the changes signify the attack of ransomware that encrypts files). The volume shadow copy feature comes pre-installed on the Windows OS. You can enable it from the File Explorer section.One of the easiest ways of ensuring that your system is protected from ransomware and other online threats is by setting up FSRM or File Server Resource Manager on your primary file server. It screens all the sites and information you access online and tracks your web presence. The system helps you monitor and control end-point access and restrict suspicious files and programs from entering the system via the main server. It minimizes the risk of a malware infestation by preventing the end users or clients from wreaking havoc on your system. FRSM scripted solutions allow you to trigger various policies that deflect the malware\u2019s attempt at infiltrating your device.Data backup doesn\u2019t necessarily involve online storage solutions and cloud-based services. Sometimes it can also be about offline storage. However, that does not mean you store the information in the same system by creating a second base partition in the memory. That still renders the files vulnerable to a ransomware attack. No, what you need is a powerful and dependable offline storage solution that can give you unrestricted access to information in case of an emergency situation or on-site disaster. External hard disks, USB storage devices, and NAS devices are among the most popular off offline backup choices among users.Installing GPO restrictions on the network reflects not only ransomware but all kinds of malware and virus threats allowing you to use the network freely. It provides granular control assisting users in tracking the execution files right from their source to the endpoint. Therefore, by enabling GPO restrictions, you can easily block any suspicious activity and stop any malicious attachments from downloading automatically on the system. You even get the freedom to disable extensions and files from executing. Another method that you can use here is Patching, a technique that can be accessed from third-party applications such as Java, Flash or Abode.Like everything else, even the World Wide Web has its fair share of ups and downs. The technological developments through a boon for online ventures have also contributed to the growth of cybercrime. It has unfortunately also assisted hackers in creating nastier malware that can destroy the very foundations of your website. Moreover, the fact that ransomware has now started infecting Mac devices as well has only added on to the hype around it being the most dangerous of cybercrime tools out there.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Ransomware", "security", "Technology"], "title": "How To Prevent Growing Issue of Encryption Based Malware (Ransomware)", "date": "May 20, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});A BBC Click reporter, Dan Simmons, reported that his non-identical twin brother was able to access his bank account through the newly developed voice-recognition verification system launched recently by the HSBC bank.Most of you may have heard of the voice recognition system before. It was also launched by the Barclays Bank in early 2013 for some of its wealthiest customers and seeing its success, the bank planned to launch it so that it can be available to its retail customers.On another note, HSBC too developed a voice recognition system where customers only need to say \u201cMy voice is my password\u201d after entering their personal details. Therefore, to access their account, they need to record their voice until the system matches it with the original recording.According to the claim made by HSBC officials regarding the mechanism, the voice recognition technology is supposedly the safest way to the bank and protects customers from breaches. However, this claim was made invalid when it was tested by one of BBC reporter\u2019s twin brother.Dan Simmons non-identical twin brother, Joe Simmons, tested the system and was successful enough to mimic his brother\u2019s voice and breach his account. However, what is more, surprising is the fact that despite failing seven times to imitate his brother\u2019s voice, Joe was finally in the eighth time he tried. This is therefore not like the traditional password systems where a user is blocked out if he or she fails to enter the correct password thrice. Nevertheless, even though Joe was able to access his brother\u2019s account, he was not able to withdraw any money. All he could do was view his brother\u2019s recent transactions and make transfers.After the issue had been made public, the officials at HSBC reported that they will be working to make the system more secure and will allow users only three attempts to enter the correct password. However, one of the officials also said that the breach does not imply that fraud can be committed using the voice recognition ID.This is because, according to the official, Joe knew the voice of his brother and was hence able to mimic it while sitting beside him. Fraudsters, on the other hand, would not know someone\u2019s exact voice and would not be able to pass the rigorous authentication algorithm integrated with the system. An HSBC spokesman told the BBC:Tom Harwood, Chief Product Officer at Aeriandi commented on the issue and said that: \u201cBiometrics technology has been widely shown to significantly reduce fraud \u2013 but it\u2019s not the whole solution. And as this experiment has illustrated no security technology is 100% fool-proof. Technology advances have shown that it is now possible to cheat voice recognition systems. Voice synthesizer technology is a great example. It makes it possible to take an audio recording and alter it to include words and phrases the original speaker never spoke. The good news is that there is a way to protect against phone fraud beyond biometrics \u2013 and that\u2019s fraud detection technology. Fraud detection on voice looks at more than the voice print of the user; it considers a whole host of other parameters. For example, is the phone number being used legitimately? Increasing phone fraud attacks on UK banks come from overseas. Voice Fraud technology has been proven to protect against this as well as domestic threats.\u201dThomas Fischer, threat researcher and security advocate at Digital Guardian said that:Statistics show that the system is indeed useful as customers find it highly efficient to use their voice to access their accounts simply. Also, the technology enables the creators to upgrade security more easily and more efficiently that in the case of password-protected systems.Nonetheless, as with every other progress made in technology, minor bugs are inevitable. Such biometric verification IDs are certainly the future of security and are likely to improve with enhanced security features being built into them.

There have been several cases in the recent past in which cyber criminals took over life-saving devices and held them to ransom.Now, it has been identified that WannaCry ransomware, the heinous ransomware that has been on the loose for over a week now, has been reported to have infected not only computer systems but also medical devices that were connected to the overall network of healthcare organizations.The British National Health System: As you may already know, a number of organizations were attacked by the WannaCry ransomware and victims are still being targeted. However, the British National Health System (NSH) was among the most heavily infected with a number of healthcare organizations having their systems hacked by the ransomware.Initial reports said that it was mainly the management systems that were affected. Later, however, the Health Information Trust Alliance in the U.S, stated that medical devices had also been infected. This is because these devices were connected to the infected networks and had Windows running on them. Therefore, WannaCry was able to spread to these devices as such.The screenshot of the hacked device was shared by Thomas Fox-Brewster of Forbes.Advisories released to fight the ransomware: As part of warning the customers who might have such devices, ICS-CERT released a list of vendors who have issued security advisories so as to protect customers from the attack. Companies including General Electric, Rockwell Automation, Philips, Siemens and much more are part of the list.Beckton, Dickson, and Company have provided a list of a number of affected devices along with guidelines as to how Windows-based systems can be secured. Similarly, Siemens has reported that it is working to fix the flaw in the SMB system of Windows.According to Gary Quinn, President & CEO, FalconStor, a computer and data protection firm:  \u201cRansomware attacks can have severe consequences, as the NHS, and many other organizations, have experienced over last few days. The threat of another is imminent, it\u2019s clear the WannaCry attacks are having a huge impact globally. Now, more than ever, organizations and public sector authorities will sit up and realize the importance of protecting data against similar threats. As well as training staff not to click suspicious-looking links, organizations need to deploy a disaster recovery solution and quickly. Once the malware infection is neutralized, the fastest way to recover from these attacks is to use a system-level snapshot of the system that allows near-instantaneous \u201crollback\u201d of the system to a reasonable time prior to the attack. Older traditional systems only take one backup a week, or at best, once a day. It is important that new systems are implemented that will take multiple snapshots a day and allow 5-10-minute recovery of systems dramatically reducing the attacker\u2019s impact to the business.\u201dDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Malware", "Medical", "NSA", "Ransomware", "security", "WannaCry"], "title": "WannaCry responsible for infecting medical devices", "date": "May 19, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});If you were wondering what\u2019s going on with the social media giant Twitter, then don\u2019t worry you were not alone.

He also believes that once extradited to Sweden the authorities may extradite him to the United States where he might face death penalty over leaking highly sensitive documents related to the U.S. military and other diplomatic events on behalf of WikiLeaks.The rape case investigations kicked off in 2010, while this Friday 19th, 2017 was the last day for the prosecutors to decide whether to drop the case or renew it.

Initially, the cyber criminals demanded a sum of $300 but lately, the amount has been increased to $600 in Bitcoin.A Twitter bot watching the bitcoin wallets tied to the WannaCry ransomware attack shows that at the time of publishing this article the cybercriminals behind this attack have received 280 payments totaling 45.95330875 BTC which is $84,094.44 USD). The three bitcoin wallets tied to #WannaCry ransomware have received 280 payments totaling 45.95330875 BTC ($84,094.44 USD).\u2014 actual ransom (@actual_ransom) May 18, 2017The IT security community, however, killed two working variants of WannaCry ransomware within two days of attack yet it only halted its spread temporarily. Remember, the WannaCry attacks were made possible with the NSA hacking tool leaked by Shadow Broker and an existing vulnerability in Windows\u2019 SMB (Server Message Block Protocol). At the same time, Microsoft has urged users to update their systems to the latest version and also criticized NSA and the CIA for not sharing the vulnerabilities they found in the systems.While Microsoft blames others; it\u2019s time for users to update their systems right now, always keep a back of your data and avoid paying ransom payment to the criminals since there is no solid proof that victims have received the decryption key or not.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Microsoft", "NSA", "Ransomware", "security", "WannaCry", "Windows"], "title": "WannaCry Ransomware Attackers are sending new message to victims", "date": "May 18, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Since 2015 the Dark Web marketplaces have been flourishing. From drugs, weapons, databases, fake documents to all sorts of illegal stuff are available for anyone at anytime. Recently, HackRead found out a vendor going by the online handle of \u201cnclay\u201d is claiming to have hacked Zomato and selling the data of its 17 million registered users on a popular Dark Web marketplace.The database includes emails and password hashes of registered Zomato users while the price set for the whole package is USD 1,001.43 (BTC 0.5587). The vendor also shared a trove of sample data to prove that the data is legit. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the sample data publicly shared by \u201cnclay.\u201dUpon testing the sample data on Zomato.com\u2019s login page, it was discovered that each and every account mentioned in the list exists on Zomato.We tried to send a password reset email to some of the email addresses in the data which further revealed that they are registered with Zomato. Here\u2019s a screenshot showing reset email successfully going to one of the users.An email was also sent to Zomato from HackRead.com along with the sample data explaining about the incident. We also requested the company to confirm whether Zomato suffered a data breach or not. But, at the time of publishing this article, there was no response from the company.It must be noted that Zomato already has an existing bug bounty program however the security researchers and hackers who report vulnerabilities only receive Hall of Fame recognition or a certificate of acknowledgment. Also, in 2015 Zomato was hacked by an Indian ethical hacker Anand Prakash, who not only discovered a critical security flaw in Zomato\u2019s data recall system but also informed the company about the same.Zomato is a world-renowned food and restaurant search engine giant founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah from India back in 2008. The site has over 90 million monthly visits and holds 945th rank in the world while it\u2019s among the top 155 most visited sites in India according to Alexa ranking. Therefore, If there\u2019s any truth in \u201cnclay\u2019s\u201d claims which seemingly looks to be true, Zomato will have a busy week.Currently, the same Dark Web marketplace where Zomato data is being sold also holds a number of vendors selling highly sensitive data stolen from tech and social media giants including anti-public combo list with billions of accounts, 100 million accounts from Chinese video service Youku, millions of accounts stolen from vBulletin forums, millions of Bitcoin forums data and millions of Gmail and Yahoo accounts with their plain-text passwords etc. Although Zomato didn\u2019t reply to our email but in their latest blog post the company has acknowledged the breach. This means that HackRead.com\u2019s exclusive findings and hacker\u2019s claim have turned out to be legit. Here\u2019s a full preview of the blog post published by Zomato 7hours ago:Over 120 million users visit Zomato every month. What binds all of these varied individuals is the desire to enjoy the best a city has to offer, in terms of food. When Zomato users trust us with their personal information, they naturally expect the information to be safeguarded. And that\u2019s something we do diligently, without fail. We take cyber security very seriously \u2013 if you\u2019ve been a regular at Zomato for years, you\u2019d agree. The reason you\u2019re reading this blog post is because of a recent discovery by our security team \u2013 about 17 million user records from our database were stolen. The stolen information has user email addresses and hashed passwords.We hash passwords with a one-way hashing algorithm, with multiple hashing iterations and individual salt per password. This means your password cannot be easily converted back to plain text. We, however, strongly advise you to change your password for any other services where you are using the same password.Important note \u2013 payment related information on Zomato is stored separately from this (stolen) data in a highly secure PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) compliant vault. No payment information or credit card data has been stolen/leaked.As a precaution, we have reset the passwords for all affected users and logged them out of the app and website. Our team is actively scanning all possible breach vectors and closing any gaps in our environment. So far, it looks like an internal (human) security breach \u2013 some employee\u2019s development account got compromised.How can this stolen information be misused?Since we have reset the passwords for all affected users and logged them out of the app and website, your Zomato account is secure. Your credit card information on Zomato is fully secure, so there\u2019s nothing to worry about there.What next?Over the next couple of days and weeks, we\u2019ll be actively working to plug any more security gaps that we find in our systems.We\u2019ll be further enhancing security measures for all user information stored within our databaseA layer of authorization will be added for internal teams having access to this data to avoid the possibility of any human breach.We regret any disruption this may cause and appreciate your immediate attention to this information. If you have queries/concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our security team by sending an email directly to support@zomato.com and we\u2019ll reach out to you right away.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "dark web", "Data", "hacking", "India", "internet", "LEAKS", "Privacy", "security"], "title": "Zomato Hacked; 17 Million Accounts Sold on Dark Web", "date": "May 17, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "It seems that WannaCry had a predecessor that apparently carried out attacks which involved mining the cryptocurrency Monero using the same vulnerability found in Windows\u2019 Sever Message Block (SMB) protocol.Adylkuzz \u2013 another NSA enabled malware: According to the researchers, the crypto miners malware uses the same tool, EternalBlue, to exploit the same vulnerability in Microsoft Windows as WannaCry to launch attacks, however, security experts from Proofpoint who discovered the malware found that Adylkuzz was not only enabled through EternalBlue but also through another backdoor called DoublePulsar. Essentially, EternalBlue and DoublePulsar were responsible for installing WannaCry on vulnerable computers.Nevertheless, Adylkuzz uses both DoublePulsar and EternalBlue to get installed and is much subtle than WannaCry was. Once EternalBlue is executed on vulnerable systems, DoublePulsar automatically infects the systems, and it then downloads Adylkuzz from the relevant servers.Also, Adylkuzz has more than one command-and-control (C&C) center. Adylkuzz blocks the entire SMB network which implies that once it is in a system, it does not allow any other malware using the same vulnerability to infect the system. Also, it does not spread to other vulnerable computers since network sharing is completely abolished. As such, it is believed that Adylkuzz might have affected more computers than WannaCry.What does Adylkuzz do? Primarily, the malware stops the victims from using shared Windows resources and adversely affects the performance of their PCs. However, ProofPrint reports the use of Adylkuzz to mine Monero cryptocurrency. According to ProofPrint, Adylkuzz was used to mine Monero cryptocurrency, thereby rewarding the attackers with large sums of money. ProofPrint also showed that Adylkuzz was being executed from different addresses, implying that the attackers did not want payments to be traced back to a single address.Adylkuzz predates WannaCry: Reports say that Adylkuzz might have been infecting systems since April 24 using the NSA tools leaked by the hacker group called the Shadow Brokers, and therefore precedes WannaCry, which appeared on May 12. This was discovered when experts tested a machine vulnerable to EternalBlue attack, and instead of seeing WannaCry, they saw Adylkuzz.Such attacks may be possible in the future: Experts are saying that attacks using the same vulnerability and NSA tools can be possible in the future. This is indeed a convoluted situation with Microsoft blaming the NSA for not informing it about any of these vulnerabilities in the past.Whether NSA did it on purpose or was just negligent about it, the ultimate price is being paid by the civilians who had no clue regarding the flaws.

The announcement came just a few minutes ago when users visiting the site saw a brief message on its home page stating that ExtraTorrent along with all of its mirror has gone offline while all of its data has also been permanently erased.Furthermore, the message warns its loyal users to stay away from its clones and fake site claiming to be operated by the official ExtraTorrent team since it\u2019s expected that the Internet will be spammed with ET\u2019s clones just like what happened in KickassTorrent\u2019s case. Here\u2019s the full preview of the message users can see on ET right now.It is quite shocking for the Internet community to see such a massive platform going down without stating any reason to its users. It must be noted that as of November 2016, ExtraTorrent became the world\u2019s second-largest torrent site, after The Pirate Bay. Although ET suffered several setbacks since the very first day, the platform always surfaced back on the Internet for example in November 2015, the platform lost three of its domain names used for mirrors, but its team was quick to come back with new addresses. In March 2017 again, the platform\u2019s main domain was shut down by its registrar while its backup domain remained online. However this time it looks like ExtraTorrent is gone and gone forever but it\u2019s still unknown if ET\u2019s team feared legal action against them or something else.Sam, the admin of ExtraTorrent, told TorrentFreak ExtraTorrent\u2019s media ripping and release group ETRG has also been shut down while Ethd and Ettv may remain operational. Remember, since 2016 law enforcement authorities have been taking severe action against torrent sites. For intense, Torrents.Eu, KickassTorrents, and TorrentHound have already been shut down while ThePirateBay is still up it has been blocked in several countries and also making news for suffering service outages now and then.

Meanwhile here are some of the ExtraTorrent alternatives which users can enjoy:Previously known as Yify, YTS has made quite a name for itself. The reason behind it is quite simple. The clean interface and the user-friendly ads combined with quality content are what makes it worthy of a place in our rankings.RARBG, a site founded in 2008, is the number third on the list. If you are into searching for movies and TV shows, then you might consider visiting this site. The good thing about this site is that the movies and TV shows come with thumbnails and preview links. Also, the user-friendly interface of this site deserves a lot of credit as well.Isohunt.to is a new version of original IsoHunt. The original site was taken down because of the copyrighted content but came back up with a new domain very quickly. It is best for entertainment-related content, and you can find almost anything instantly on this site.Last but not the least, LimeTorrent secured a spot in our rankings of the top Pirate Bay alternatives. The site has been under the radar of quite a lot of fans regularly and is increasing in the popularity day by day. It is a great source of movies, TV shows, apps, anime, etc.Although, the owner of Kickass Torrents or KAT Mr. Artem Vaulin was arrested last year its original team is already back with the new Kickass Torrents domain offering the same services just like the previous one.

Recently, a security engineer, Bosko Stankovic, found a vulnerability in Google Chrome that hackers can easily exploit to get a user\u2019s credentials such as their username and password and potentially launch SMB relay attacks. It must be noted that WannaCry ransomware attack also exploits an SMB vulnerability present in the outdated version of Windows operating systems.Apparently, the vulnerability is in Google Chrome\u2019s configuration, as claimed by Stankovic who works as a security expert at DefenseCode. He found the flaw in the latest version of Chrome installed on an updated version of Windows 10.According to Stankovic, the vulnerability lets the attacker steal a user\u2019s username and the hashed version of their password by simply tricking the victim to click a specific link created by the attacker. The attacker can then use the credentials to access a user\u2019s email and any other network that uses the victim\u2019s credentials to allow access.In particular, the attacker can launch a Server Message Block (SMB) relay attack, which means that the hacker can use the victim\u2019s credentials to gain access to the victim\u2019s remote server, email or the entire computer. Moreover, the vulnerability can be used to crack the victim\u2019s hashed password as well.Stankovic explained the mechanism by which an attacker steals a victim\u2019s credentials. To begin with, the attacker creates a link, which, when clicked by the user, automatically downloads a Windows Explorer Shell Command File (SCF file) into the user\u2019s computer.This file then gets stored in the victim\u2019s Download folder. However, it does not do anything as long as the user does not open the folder. Nevertheless, once the user accesses the Download folder, the SCF file sends a request to the attacker\u2019s server to retrieve data which is related to a Windows icon.Consequently, when the request to retrieve data is sent to the attacker\u2019s server, the victim\u2019s username and hashed version of his/her password is revealed to the attacker. If these credentials are used to access a corporate network, then the attacker can virtually impersonate the victim to hijack the entire network.It has been reported that DefenseCode did not communicate the vulnerability to Google once it discovered the fault. Threatpost, however, asked Google for their comment on the issue. Google simply stated that it is working on fixing the problem.Some experts are of the opinion that the vulnerability is not solely because of Chrome, but also because of the way Windows manages SCF files. An SCF file is a text file that contains pieces of text which prompt a command and allows the system to locate an icon file.As such, the file can be used to carry out an SMB attack. If the attack is made on a corporate network and that network uses NTLM authentication, then the attacker may not even have to crack the hashed version of the password to gain access.In order to prevent such an attack, you need to go to Chrome\u2019s Settings -> Show Advanced Settings and then check the box which says \u201cAsk where to save each file before downloading.\u201d You can then change the location of the downloaded files, so you do not have to open the Download folder on your computer.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Chrome", "Google", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Vulnerability", "WannaCry", "Windows", "Windows 10"], "title": "Chrome vulnerability can allow attackers to steal user credentials", "date": "May 17, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "The protection of crucial data is highly important. Microsoft Office 365 has a data loss feature that highly secures your data. According to research, four in every ten organizations are currently using or planning to implement this application. It\u2019s no wonder Microsoft has deemed it necessary to implement the right safety measures for all of the application\u2019s users.Unfortunately, even with a slew of safety tools and compliance guidance, there are security issues that still exist. However, you don\u2019t have to be a victim to this. Why leave your safety to chance? Here are ten security tips that will reduce data loss in Microsoft Office 365:There are companies that have written policies which forbid employees from publicizing a customer\u2019s personal data or sensitive information. While this may not be a reliable solution, companies may alternatively choose to encrypt all classified emails. This not only secures the data but also prevents it from leaving the company.In addition to this, files containing information like security or credit card numbers should not be shared. In order to ensure that encryption is successful, workers should be educated on this data protection method.The creation of new policies can help in establishing a system that satisfies the company demand. For instance, employees can be guided by policy tips anytime they want to send out messages. The use of a detection report is also efficient in blocking messages that contain confidential information.Policy tips can also be directed to the Microsoft Office 365 compliance center. This ensures better protection for information. Data Loss Prevention Policy (DLP) can prevent impending data loss and also educate users on how to curb such security risks.Microsoft Office 365 makes it possible to keep your personal and company apps separate. This capability will enable you to set all the relevant device security policies, wipe data and even prevent unauthorized users from accessing any corporate data from your phone. Plus, all your Office 365 apps can be protected by the right protocols. The application has an easy to use Wizard-based setup which will allow you to maneuver and see all the devices that are connected to Office 365.With today\u2019s cyber-attacks being highly sophisticated, a simple password cannot protect you. In order to prevent any account breach, it is important to enable the Office 365 multifactor authentication for all users. This provides an additional level of identity check and prevents the violation of user data. Attackers find it difficult to maneuver a highly authenticated system. As such, you will always be assured of top-notch protection at all times.Microsoft Office 365 allows its users to share their calendar with other users. Although this may sound like a ridiculous data loss preventive measure, it is one that should be taken seriously. For instance, if the CEO chooses to share his calendar, attackers on the lookout may perform a reconnaissance about the organization before launching the data attack. Public calendars will enable these attackers to understand how the company works and determine users who are more vulnerable. This should not be disregarded.While public folders are designed for easy access and offer an efficient way of sharing information, they still pose the highest security risk. As these folders are used by many people simultaneously, they can cause the loss of unrecoverable data if various individuals carelessly handle them.As such, the folders should be migrated in order to enhance business productivity and security. As a business owner, you can migrate public folders to Office 365 with a Public Folder Migrator like ExchangeSavvy. It has a zero-downtime migration process and it is highly reliable.Sensitive data leakage is a big concern for many companies that have fully adopted Office 365. Therefore, the deployment of a cloud access security broker is important as far as supporting cloud-based data loss prevention is concerned. Unauthorized access of sensitive data in OneDrive and SharePoint will be restricted. Finding sensitive data is the first step and the use of a block policy is the way to prevent it from leaking.It is highly important for employees to have the ability to move data around without a documented trace. This is because some of them disclose sensitive passwords to each other and even release security numbers. In order to effectively manage a company\u2019s compliance, securing information is crucial. Fortunately, Microsoft Office 365 provides a reliable compliance center.When using Microsoft Office 365, there is always the possibility of data leakage. For instance, if a free account is created and then later switched to a paid business subscription, Microsoft may confuse the accounts and share the content in the paid subscription account with the trial account.This automatically poses a security risk. Once this is recognized, different browsers and anonymous URLs should be used.Many employees tend to leave unlimited login durations open. This could lead to unfettered access, especially because attackers are willing to take riskier approaches. They can simply open your computer and access all sensitive data. This commonly applies to emails, social media accounts, internal networks and even banking. It leads to the compromising of company or client data. The attacker can change passwords and tamper with important contact details. By applying timeouts, the system will automatically log out and the user will have to take a re-authentication action.Through Microsoft Office 365, users have to enjoy a certain level of freedom when sharing critical information for workflows to be efficient. But this freedom comes with risks. In order to ensure these critical data protection measures work, it is important to understand the gamut of attitudes and behavior of the people that work together within your organization. Only in this way will you be able to identify the proper security steps that should be taken.", "topics": ["Data", "Encryption", "Microsoft", "Password", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Windows"], "title": "10 Crucial Security Tips to Reduce Data Loss in Microsoft Office 365", "date": "May 17, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});WikiLeaks recently leaked some files as part of its Vault 7 series, that contained user manuals for two malware called, Assassin and AfterMidnight. According to the documents, these viruses belong to the CIA.RELEASE: CIA remote control & subversion malware systems 'After Midnight' and 'Assassin' https://t.co/S64RmEsHYl #Vault7 pic.twitter.com/5fMTeqW007\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) May 12, 2017Unlike the recent NSA tool used in the WannaCry attacks, AfterMidnight is somewhat harmless and does not include major privacy breaches. As per the user manual, AfterMidnight acts as a DDL file which executes itself while the user\u2019s PC is rebooting. It then establishes a connection with its command-and-control center from which it downloads various modules to execute.According to the documents, AfterMidnight has three modules which it downloads on an infected device. One is the module that enables data exfiltration. Another module is used for software subversion while the last module acts as an enabler of all the other modules along with providing internal services.Among these, the module which subverts software is perhaps the most annoying for users. This is because the module has the capability of killing or delaying processes and has configurations that are executed in a very controlled manner, designed to prompt the user to do certain tasks.For instance, the manual included instructions on how an attacker can develop the malware and affect a user\u2019s browser so that he or she cannot work on it. This means that by preventing the user from using their browsers, they will be forced to work on other applications and in the meanwhile, AfterMidnight can keep gathering relevant information.Another functionality of AfterMidnight is rather amusing as it allows the operator to block around 50% of the resources in Microsoft PowerPoint. What is more interesting is the wording used in the user manual which implies that people using PowerPoint deserve it.AfterMidnight\u2019s counterpart, the Assassin, is a malware that acts more like a backdoor Trojan. Essentially, the malware has a builder, an implant, a command-and-control center along with a listening post. The implant lets the malware collect and exfiltrates data on a PC running Windows.Also, according to the leaked documents, the CIA stated that the malware would not store more than 16,384 files so as to stop the malware from being overused. It is, therefore, a sort of a cyber espionage malware that allows the CIA to spy on users.It is no surprise that government agencies have software that can effectively affect civilians. However, what is more, troubling is the fact that these agencies have not been able to protect such data which can potentially harm a number of users if gone into the wrong hands.Since the WannaCry incident, agencies should be more cautious and should implement proper procedures to safeguard their confidential pieces of software.

As such, it has become quite important to raise awareness as to how people can effectively protect their privacy and prevent getting their data falling into the wrong hands. Here you will find some easy and efficient ways of protecting yourself and what is the best way to do so.This may sound obvious; however, it is one thing that most of us inadvertently do. Things like online forms, surveys, etc. can delude one into giving out one\u2019s personal information without a second thought. Also, in today\u2019s highly mobile and flexible world, cloud technology can sometimes be inappropriate for storing data that is highly confidential. This may include your passwords, credit card information, important business documents and so on.As such, it is advisable to refrain from storing information on cloud-based platforms, unless you are sure of the security standards.Various websites ask you to agree to their condition of storing your browsing information in the form of cookies to provide you with a better service.Cookies are quite useful since they allow companies to understand your browsing history and therefore display relevant ads or products that better suit your preferences. However, the nature of the information may not always be so innocuous. Most of us tend to allow certain websites to remember our passwords and usernames. This is again, stored in the form of cookies.Such information is accessible to people who are involved in data mining and may also be retrieved by criminals who may use them for all sorts of illegal things. Therefore, ensure that you allow your passwords and usernames only to be remembered by websites that you trust.Folders on your computer can be easily accessed if they are not adequately protected. However, simply putting a login password when you start your computer is not enough. Cyber criminals can use various methods to gain access to unprotected folders without you even knowing. So, is there an easy way to protect yourself? There is. Protected folder for Windows 10 can help you protect all your folders in the most efficient manner possible. It is a robust files protection tool that guarantees 100% safety from illegal theft.Its primary feature is to password protect your folders so that not even the most sophisticated of techniques can break into the data that is stored in them. Furthermore, you can store any type and amount of files by just dragging and dropping the files in different kinds of folders.Essentially, you can store your files so that they are read-only, or store them, so they are password protected, or make them completely invisible. Also, the superior data security technology protects your data from getting stolen even if someone infiltrates into your system. Lastly, if you are storing files on a shared system and do not want anyone to probe into them, you can simply store them in the protected folder and keep everyone at bay.In conclusion, protected folder is imperative since a number of people fall victim to unethical privacy breaches that cost them a lot.

Case in point, Smith, highlighted the fact that hackers got hold of documents belonging to NSA, which explained the Windows vulnerability and how it can be exploited. This naturally raises questions as to the ethics of such behavior since despite knowing the fact that Windows had a flaw, nothing was communicated to Microsoft regarding this.Smith compared the cyber attack with the case of conventional weapons. He stated that the situation was akin to the one where some of US military\u2019s Tomahawk missiles were stolen. He also said that previously, such codes had been leaked by WikiLeaks which belonged to the CIA and hence noted that intelligence agencies should come up with a more responsible and safe method of conducting their operations.This is what Smith had to say when he posted his views on Microsoft\u2019s blog post\u201cApart from all the blame-game, the pressing issue is that the attacks may continue with variants of the ransomware appearing in cyberspace. This is evident from the views expressed by Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Center which expressed its concerns regarding the scale of the attack. It believes that the effects can be much larger than reported and that similar attacks could re-emerge.Europol shared a similar view along with a cyber security expert, Ryan Kalember, saying that new variants of the ransomware have already started appearing. He also stated that it is possible that ransomware that appears now onwards may not come with an off switch, like the one responsible for recent attacks.Up till now, 100,000 organizations have been affected in 150 countries.

We\u2019ll also address how your site\u2019s SEO is improved by having better web security.Google started giving HTTPS websites a ranking boost over HTTP sites back in 2014, but the weighting of that secure connection is growing. At that time, around 10% of websites were HTTPS, and it was 30% by 2016. By spring, 2017, around two-thirds of all websites were HTTPS because of Google\u2019s PR efforts.Google Chrome and other search engines are already warning users if a website for logging in or entering financial information is not HTTPS. The warning is starting to extend to other websites now, and we\u2019re approaching the point where websites that lack HTTPS will disappear from the first page results no matter how good their SEO is. The quality of the content and link building don\u2019t matter if a significant percentage of traffic is scared away by the \u201cthis site may be harmful\u201d warning.If your site is hacked and customer information is leaked, you face a public relations disaster. Your current customers will be afraid to continue to do business with you, and potential clients will be scared away when they learn of the leak. You can prevent this problem by using scanning tools and hosting your site with companies that maintain the utmost IT security. Conversely, if your site is regularly compromised, it will be placed on blacklists that prevent students and corporate employees from visiting it.The compromises don\u2019t have to be major to hurt your website. A disabled firewall and digital defacement with some stupid joke will result in bad press for your company, and customers will wonder what else was left unprotected. Then there\u2019s the impact of all the negative mentions on social media interfering with your SEO and social media outreach.Verifying ownership of your website with Google search console (previously Webmaster tools) lets you receive notifications about security issues and site performance, troubleshoot SEO problems and understand your site\u2019s SEO performance overall. This is why your SEO strategy needs to include verifying your site\u2019s ownership with Google. In 2015, there was a trend of black hat SEO firms trying to verify accounts as owners of compromised sites.Google can\u2019t catch all of these scammers because third party SEO service providers may be listed as full owners while they work on the site. If these scammers can verify ownership, then they can add their spammy content or malware to the site. Their addition of spammy elements like ads for their sites hurts your site\u2019s search engine results page placement. If you struggled with hack attacks in the past or want to prevent them in the future, companies like Click Intelligence can help resolve problems like this.If your website isn\u2019t HTTPS, it is already ranking lower than it could, and soon the bounce rate by those scared away by Google\u2019s security warnings will tank your SEO.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "SEO", "Technology"], "title": "How to Improve Your SEO through Enhanced Web Security", "date": "May 15, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "In the last few days, the internet has been caught off guard with numerous updates being posted regarding the sprawling effects of the WannaCry ransomware that exploited the vulnerabilities in Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system to hack more than 75,000 computers and counting last Friday.Nevertheless, it seems like the worst is yet to come. In a recent report by HeimdalSecurity, another ransomware, going by the name of Uiwix, has emerged, which is exploiting the vulnerabilities found in Windows SMB v1 and SMB v2.Experts say that they have found traces of WannaCry in Uiwix. However, this does not mean that this ransomware is one and the same. Unfortunately, unlike WannaCry, Uiwix cannot be stopped from spreading just by registering a domain.#WannaCry #ransomware: Researcher halts its spread by registering domain for $10.69 | https://t.co/rEVlQBECkI #WannaCrypt0r #Security pic.twitter.com/6xdquDXUgQ\u2014 HackRead (@HackRead) May 13, 2017That is, previously, security experts were able to restrain the spread of WannaCry and its variant by registering the domain through which the ransomware was spreading. However, with Uiwix, this does not seem to be an option. Hence, it is safe to say that Uiwix is far more dangerous than WannaCry.Researcher Finds Kill Switch for the new variant of #WannaCry Ransomware | https://t.co/EM3BLtQPUh #Security #Ransomware #WannaCrypt0r pic.twitter.com/WmR6xWXlYW\u2014 HackRead (@HackRead) May 14, 2017Uiwix works just like WannaCry by hijacking a user\u2019s system altogether and preventing access to it until the user has paid the demanded amount of money. Also, the payment is demanded in bitcoins, and with the current exchange rate, the bitcoins demanded are equivalent to USD 218.Since Uiwix cannot be stopped like WannaCry, the only way to contain the virus is to fix the vulnerability that appears to be present in Windows.It is quite surprising to have two similar ransomware exploiting the same vulnerability to appear twice so quickly. The only explanation is that the vulnerabilities in Windows software have not been fixed yet.What is more surprising though, is that the security experts had been raising the issue with regards to these vulnerabilities in the past and the relevant companies had taken no action. Perhaps, this is because fixing the vulnerability calls for the relevant companies to collaborate extensively and share the resources to remove the flaw. Up till now, such collaboration has not been seen.Given that the virus cannot be stopped as of now, the only way to protect yourself is to take some preventive precautions to avoid any trouble in the future. As such, experts warn that connecting your PC to a public WiFi spot and then initiating a VPN connection can spread the virus more severely. Hence, this is to be avoided at all costs.Also, follow the below-mentioned steps:The best defense against ransomware attacks is keeping a backup of your data. Apart from that, it is advised that users keep their systems updated with the latest security fixes released by Microsoft.This article has been updated after a discussion with Heimdal Security due to uncertainty surrounding the numbers of victims Uiwix has affected \u2013 As of now the total number of victims is still unknown.

This was accompanied by attacks made on the power firm, Iberdrola, and the utility firm Gas Natural.A security researcher going by the online handle of @MalwareTechBlog told AFP that the ransomware was spreading due to being connected to an unregistered domain. The researcher, therefore, said that the spread can be stopped by registering the domain and updating the systems immediately.According to The Guardian, @MalwareTechBlog with the assistance of Darien Huss from security firm Proofpoint found and activated a \u201ckill switch\u201d in the malicious software. The switch was hardcoded into the malware in case the creator wanted to stop it spreading. This involved a very long nonsensical domain name that the malware makes a request to \u2013 just as if it was looking up any website \u2013 and if the request comes back and shows that the domain is live, the kill switch takes effect and the malware stops spreading.\u201cI saw it wasn\u2019t registered and thought, \u2018I think I\u2019ll have that.\u201d The purchase cost him $10.69. Immediately, the domain name was registering thousands of connections every second. They get the accidental hero award of the day,\u201d said Proofpoint\u2019s Ryan Kalember. \u201cThey didn\u2019t realize how much it probably slowed down the spread of this ransomware.\u201dI will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after i registered it, so initially it was accidental.\u2014 MalwareTech@Vegas (@MalwareTechBlog) May 13, 2017The time that @malwaretechblog registered the domain was too late to help Europe and Asia, where many organizations were affected. But it gave people in the US more time to develop immunity to the attack by patching their systems before they were infected, said Kalember.Also, many NHS organizations had Windows XP installed on their computers. Microsoft long stopped supporting the old version of Windows and hence the ransomware took advantage of this and was able to spread so conveniently. The old operating system did not alert the users of any viruses and did not have updates against such threats.A Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson said that those who had enabled updates and had the company\u2019s free antivirus software installed were not affected. Also, the company released an update earlier today which detects this threat as Ransom: Win32/WannaCrypt.Microsoft has made the patch for MS17-010 available for XP and 2k3. Patch over the weekend.

The systems were made to shut down altogether with doctors complaining about the major delays that occurred as a result.

However, since all bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public ledger, it is hard to tell specifically which organizations paid the ransom.At the time of publishing this article, the attacks were stopped.

Medzero researchers who found out this keylogger said that:\u201cThis type of debugging turns the audio driver effectively into a keylogging spyware. On the basis of meta-information of the files, this keylogger has already existed on HP computers since at least Christmas 2015.\u201dConexant\u2019s MicTray64.exe is installed with the Conexant audio driver package and registered as a Microsoft Scheduled Task to run after each user login. The program monitors all keystrokes made by the user to capture and react to functions such as microphone mute/unmute keys/hotkeys. Monitoring of keystrokes is added by implementing a low-level keyboard input hook [1] function that is installed by calling SetwindowsHookEx().In addition to the handling of hotkey/function keystrokes, all key-scancode information is written into a log file in a world-readable path (C:\\Users\\Public\\MicTray.log). If the log file does not exist or the setting is not yet available in Windows registry, all keystrokes are passed to the OutputDebugString API, which enables any process in the current user context to capture keystrokes without exposing malicious behavior. Any framework and process with access to the MapViewOfFile API should be able to silently capture sensitive data by capturing the user\u2019s keystrokes. In version 10.0.0.31, only OutputDebugString was used to forward key scancodes and nothing was written to files.The affected devices are HP EliteBook G3 Notebook series, HP ProBook G2 Notebook series, HP ProBook G3 Notebook series, HP ZBooks and HP Elitebooks. To check whether or not your computer is safe, search for:If your device contains any of the above files, your device is also infected.The keylogger, according to researchers, stores all the logs pressed in a session including emails, passwords, contacts, etc. Although the logs stored by the keylogger are overwritten everytime the PC is rebooted, it could still be a big problem as sometimes these files can be recovered.While researchers couldn\u2019t find the purpose of the keylogger, they believe that storing the data of keylogs is unnecessary and shows the negligence of developer of the driver. ModZero\u2019s CEO, Thorsten Schroeder said:HP and Conexant officials have been warned of this keylogger and an HP official told media that \u201cHP is committed to the security of its customers, and we are aware of an issue on select HP PCs. We have identified a fix and will make it available to our customers.\u201dUntil the authorities release an official patch, users are advised to delete or rename the file C:\\Windows\\System32\\MicTray.exe or C:\\Windows\\System32\\MicTray64.exe files.

Furthermore, they suspect that some other malware \u201cAndr/Rootnik-AH\u201d might even be on the Google play store.According to a security researcher at SophosLabs, Rowland Yu \u201cthe main point is that Google Play allows a compromised certificate [through the associated malware], though they know the certificate has been used to sign rootkit malware.\u201dAs per reports, the malicious Chrome version is Andr/Rootnik-AH, and the malware is capable of reading and sending messages from the infected device, recording media, querying location, etc.This isn\u2019t the first time that security researchers have spotted a compromised app, though previously Google Play store was free from such ill apps. Back in 2015, an infected version of Chrome \u201cAndr/SandRat-C\u201d was seen to infect the users as well, but it wasn\u2019t allowed entry in the Play store.\u201cWhen the first hacked version of Chrome was discovered in 2015, a few people were still downloading apps outside of Google Play,\u201d Yu explained.Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity of apps, and according to security researchers, the malware is capable of evading digital signatures. Furthermore, the fake Google Chrome browser displays the same icons as the legit on making it much harder to spot the difference between the two.Over the past few months, 292 malicious apps have been taken down from Google play. However, there are further 400 shady apps still in the play store. As the security experts are finding new ways to cope with cybersecurity threats, hackers are working hard too.

Now, according to recent reports, it has been revealed that airports in the US might be installing facial recognition technology to screen travelers.The new facial recognition system will allow automatic registration of travelers who enter and leave the US. If a US citizen is leaving the country, the system will register that individual and will generate a signal when the person has returned.Nevertheless, the government has plans to incorporate the system virtually everywhere so as to replace the old manual system of asking for IDs for verification purposes. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has told Verge that it is committed to implementing this plan and is open to discussion with the relevant parties.The system, says the CBP, will enhance security at the airports as people who travel regularly can easily be sent to a different lane from the one reserved for high-risk travelers where proper verification procedures will be undertaken.As you may have already expected, there are indeed certain privacy issues due to which various concerns have been raised. Primarily, the facial recognition system will generate photos of travelers who have been recognized by the system. Although the system is mainly targeted toward visa holders (that is, non-citizens only), the security concerns with regards to US citizens, however, have not yet been addressed adequately.The biggest problem that people fear is that officials might abuse the photos and may be exploited for all sorts of illegal purposes. Moreover, citizens have also raised questions regarding what kind of punishments will the agents get for such abuse.Also, it is possible that an innocent individual might be sent to the lane which is for high-risk travelers and as such, he/she may have to go through the entire verification process. The only answer that one of CBPs spokesperson, John Wagner, has given is that the agency will work through the privacy approvals.Implementing such a high-end system can be risky since there might be glitches in the system that can result in major security issues and more hassle for travelers. For instance, concerns have been raised regarding the practicality of the system.This is because the facial recognition system requires proper light among other things to accurately recognize someone\u2019s face. This means that areas which are dimly lit might face problems. Nevertheless, despite these concerns, the CBP has already planned the initial rollout for the system in which officers will be alerted right at the gates if there is a photo mismatch.Image Credit: PROSteve Jurvetson/FlickrDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Facial Recognition", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Surveillance", "Technology", "USA"], "title": "Face recognition system at US airports may target citizens", "date": "May 10, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The IT security community is quite active in exposing cyber criminals developing malware to conduct malicious activities. The malware like Mirai and Bashlike aka LizKebab are already busy infecting millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and conducting DDoS attacks worldwide.Now, security firm Trend Micro discovered that an IoT malware, called Persirai is infecting a number of surveillance cameras manufactured by a Chinese firm whose name has not yet been revealed.The malware infects the devices by exploiting a vulnerability that is present in these cameras. The flaw lets an attacker use the vulnerability to gain remote access to the wireless cameras and virtually take control of the devices.Also, the malware works by infecting a number of cameras at once so as to form a botnet and then launches a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which leads to a complete shutdown of the website that has been attacked as such. Up till now, reports have shown that around 1200 cameras have been found to contain the flaw and there are possibly 120,000 cameras which can be exploited through Persirai.Although there is not much to be known about this IoT malware, security researchers, however, say that the malware seems to have some code which is similar to Mirai \u2013 another malware which has been responsible for affecting IoT devices such as CCTV cameras, DVRs, Internet routers, etc.It seems that the Malware has not been used to its full potential since no DDoS attacks have been reported for which Persirai is responsible. One theory for such an odd behavior is that the creators of the Malware might still be testing it.It is also possible that the creators wanted to reveal the vulnerabilities in the cameras and as such, it was nothing more than an instant of ethical hacking. Nevertheless, given that the vulnerability is already known and can be exploited as long as the cameras are out there, there is no telling as to when or who might exploit the flaw and launch an attack.As of now, the security firm Trend Micro is contacting and trying to collaborate with the vendors of all the infected cameras and is trying to fix the problem. Until the issue is completely fixed, no name will be revealed as to who is the producer of these cameras.Given that there is no information as to which cameras are infected, the best way to protect yourself if you own a camera is to create a firewall and disable any access to the malware\u2019s command and control centers.

But, in Thailand instead of targeting ordinary users, hackers targeted the big fish in the business. By big fish, we mean influential companies in the country, and the worst part, they couldn\u2019t even lodge an official complaint in fear of their reputation being hurt.A classic Ransomware attackHackers usually infect their targets with an illegal software, a fake Wi-Fi hotspot designed by the hacker to spread malware and sometimes even a free software is infected with malware. A police inspector with the TCSD\u2019s sub-division 1, Pol Maj Pathompong Silapasuk said:Well, this is exactly what happened with Thai companies when they were forced to pay ransom to the cyber criminals, according to Bangkok post.The incidentUsually victimized parties ask for police help but here, the companies chose to remain silent and some of them even paid a hefty amount of ransom to get their systems and data back.

However, we will update this article as soon as we get the list.Why were Police not involved?There were a lot of reasons for that. First and foremost, the companies didn\u2019t want to take chances of losing their reputation in the market and with their partners. Another thing was obviously because the affected companies believed that the police might not be able to resolve the issue in time and the data on the affected devices was too precious for the firms to lose.The role of BitcoinBitcoins are quite famous these days not only to the general public but also in the world of hackers. The hackers demanded their targets to pay the ransom in Bitcoins. The reason for that, was, of course, it\u2019s almost impossible to track a Bitcoin transaction.A lessonUsually, the cyber security firms maintain that they can handle the cybercriminals behind the ransomware tactics and that paying ransom is not a smart thing to do. But one of the affected company lost more than 1 million baht (USD 28,876) just because they chose to hire a security firm instead of paying the ransom.Mr. Somsak CEO of Design Alternative Co was affected by the incident, and instead of paying the ransom, he chooses to hire a German security firm to deal with the matter.

All one has to do is be vigilant and keep an eye who\u2019s sending the email and what the sender is forcing you to do. For example, recently we exclusively reported two highly sophisticated phishing campaign targeting Facebook and iCloud users. The Facebook scam tricked users into believing that their account had been disabled and to get access back they needed to click on a link but doing so asked them to enter their credit card data and Facebook login credentials.In the iCloud scam, users were tricked into believing that their Apple ID was logged in from a different device and for security reason users need to click on a link. The link took users to a phishing website asking their credit card data, personal details, a government issued ID card and access to their device\u2019s microphone and camera.Both scams could have been easily identified by the grammar mistakes in the body of both emails. However, it is advisable to look but don\u2019t click the link, check the spelling mistakes in the email, look for threating language, check if the email contains exclamation marks, review the signature of the email, do not download files from an unknown email, copy the subject of the email and search it on Google, you can also copy the phishing link without clicking it and search it on Google or scan it on sites like VirusTotal.If you are using web browsers like Safari, Opera or FireFox there are chances that these browsers won\u2019t warn you about a suspicious link meanwhile usually Chrome does warn users. For example in the iCloud discussed above the malicious link was already marked as a deceptive site to visit by Chrome browser.

If you have an account on these platforms, it is advisable to log in to your account by entering the web address into your browser\u2019s address bar or via their official app. Stay safe online.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Facebook", "Google", "hacking", "internet", "Paypal", "Phishing", "Phishing Scam", "Scam", "security"], "title": "Google Docs Phishing Scam Cost Minnesota State Thousands of Dollars", "date": "May 7, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Earlier this week, the research team which is part of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection system, detected several attacks being carried out against a software\u2019s update system whose name has not yet been revealed \u2013 All that is known about the software is that it is a well-known editing application and that the creator or vendor of the software also experienced attacks.The consequences of the attack: It is said that the attackers, by hacking the software update system, were able to gain remote access to certain targeted computers. They were then able to execute malware without the victim knowing about the infection.How was the carried out: Microsoft\u2019s researchers said that the attackers used PowerShell scripts combined with the Meterpreter reverse shell. This allowed them to silently infiltrate the target and as such the victim was not aware that his or her system was being hacked.

They specifically pointed out the need to have stronger security features placed in such automated update systems, saying that robust encryption is necessary if such attacks are to be prevented in the future.Furthermore, Microsoft said that it would be much better if software vendors abstained from executing their systems blindly and that they should always validate digital signatures against their own certifications.\u201cIt\u2019s early discovery allowed incident responders \u2013 a collaboration of security experts from the targeted industries and developers working for the third-party software vendor \u2013 to work with Microsoft security researchers to promptly identify and neutralize the activities associated with this cyber espionage campaign,\u201d according to Microsoft.A piece of advice: Masking malware as updates to software is standard practice in the cyber world.

Almost 900 members of a global \u2018dark web\u2019 pedophile ring in the United States and Europe have been arrested after a two-year investigation.What exactly is PlaypenThe playpen was a Dark Web website which distributed a number of pictures showing children being sexually abused. These children were reported to be of only kindergarten age. The website had almost 250,000 visitors worldwide.Related: Child Pornography Case: 73-year old Pedophile gets 300 years sentenceAccording to the FBI, the website had been tracked by the FBI when it first appeared, but the exact location of it was unknown. This is because the website was being operated in a way so that it could only be accessed through Tor browser.Tor, like a VPN, but more robust, allows a user to remain anonymous on the web and hence use the internet to protect their privacy and in Playpen\u2019s case to perform all sorts of illegal acts. Nevertheless, the founder of the website accidentally revealed his identity and therefore allowed the FBI to track down his IP address.The culpritsThe main culprit behind the website was Steven W. Chase, a 58-year-old man who created the website sometime in August 2014 and was based in Naples, Florida. After being identified, he was sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment. Special Agent Dan Alfin who investigated the case said that: Two of his accomplices, Michael Fluckiger and David Lynn Browning who served as Playpen\u2019s co-administrator and global moderator respectively, were also sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment after they were found guilty in December 2015.Operation PacifierYou might probably be wondering as to where is all the controversy in all this. Well, the real problem began when the FBI was known to have been performing a court-approved investigation in which it was allowed to operate the website for up two weeks after the founder was arrested. Nevertheless, as you may already know, the investigation was done for the purposes of identifying all those involved who were visiting the website.Although this is an innocent purpose in its own right and the FBI did manage to find out and rescue the child victims who were being abused, the problem, however, lied in the way the FBI carried out the investigation.According to reports, the FBI launched Operation Pacifier in which it injected malware into the systems of more than 8,000 users in an attempt to hack their computers and see whether they were regular visitors of the website.Related: Police Dogs Trained To Sniff Out Hard Drives Coming For Pedophiles#FBI hacked 8K computers in 120 countries against child pornography site | https://t.co/jJGj94F0H9 #Hacking #Tor #DarkWeb #Cybercrime pic.twitter.com/gzN60H8QD5\u2014 HackRead (@HackRead) November 23, 2016As such, digital private activists condemned this method as being something that breached privacy laws. On the other hand, the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) seemed to praise the method by saying the FBI will not be able to tackle the issue at the highest level if it were to stick to the 19th-century laws.Whether it was the right thing to do remains controversial. However, the main issue here is probably the fact that child abuse is on the rise and that there might be several other websites that might be doing this ever so covertly.It is essential that proper measures are in place to deal with such situations in the future.Source: FBI, Arrests in Europe: EuropolDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "dark web", "FBI", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "security", "Tor", "VPN"], "title": "Man Who Ran Dark Web Child Porn Site Sent to 30 Years in Prison", "date": "May 6, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Debenhams, a British multinational retailer giant, said that its Flowers website was compromised and as a result, personal and financial information of 26,000 customers was stolen.

It must be noted that last year hackers also exploited the SS7 flaw to hack Facebook account by simply knowing account/victim\u2019s phone number.Now, it has been alleged that the hackers exploited this property to their own advantage. Apparently, once the hackers get access to a network\u2019s operating system either through hacking or an inside person, they can then use the SS7 protocol to reach the network\u2019s back-end system.Therefore, it is highly likely that the hackers got hold of the victim\u2019s bank details through getting into Telefonica\u2019s back-end system and then took funds out of the accounts.What else can be done with the flawed signaling system?Well, it has been theorized that the flaw can be exploited to eavesdrop on mobile conversations or locate a person as to where he or she is exactly. You might be wondering why this flaw has not been brought to the attention of the relevant authorities and why nothing has been done about it? To your relief, the issue was made public when researchers showed how the vulnerability could be used at the Chaos Communication Congress in 2014.Nevertheless, it is sad to say that no network company has taken the issue seriously. Perhaps this is because the telecommunications industry is not ready to believe that hackers can use the protocol to gain access to their back-end systems.This is quite ironic because, according to an expert, people can buy the access for as little as 1,000 euros. Let us hope that the latest protocol, the Diameter, which is meant for the newer 4G and 5G networks is safe because it is primarily built for IoT applications.Related: Gone: Russian Central Bank hacked; $31 million stolenDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Banking", "Cyber Crime", "Germany", "hacking", "internet", "Money", "security"], "title": "Bank Accounts Hacked Through a Vulnerability in The Global Mobile System", "date": "May 5, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "IT security researchers at Trend Mirco demonstrated [PDF] how factory/industrial robots could be hacked and used for malicious purposes by threat actors \u2013 The demonstration centers around the security flaws in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and how they require emergency security implementations.The robots in question are manufactured by forums like ABB, Kawasaki, Fanuc and Yaskawa.

Moreover, hackers can exploit the vulnerable system to control a robot, damage its parts or even cause injuries to people who work in close collaboration with it, for instance, by disabling or substantially altering safety devices.

Related: New iCloud Phishing Scam steals credit card data, access device\u2019 cameraA bit similar to the Windows version: This version of the malware has quite a lot of things in common with the previous version, and according to the researchers, it even has some Windows-centric terms.The attack: Like all other malware, Turla also disguises itself as a legit app, tricking the users into installing it.In the OS X targeting version, the researchers found the snake malware to be hidden in a ZIP file as adobe-flash-player, and once the user opens the attachments, the malware is automatically installed on the victim\u2019s machine. It looks like for now the malware attack can not be blocked by Apple since it seems to have a signed developer certificate- presumably stolen by the hackers.According to security experts, \u201cfor an Application to be run on OS X, it has to be signed with a valid certificate issued by Apple, or it would be blocked by GateKeeper (unless configured otherwise).\u201dThis only goes to show that hackers have somehow managed to steal the developer certificate of a legit developer.The show about to begin: Security experts believe that the snake malware is still work-in-progress.  Fox-IT researchers believe that: \u201cSnake binaries contain strings that can be obtained through snake_name_get() call. These strings are stored as a pair of 0x40 byte blobs that are XOR-ed against each other. In this binary, the blobs only contain placeholders that are yet to be replaced by the actual values, which is another indication that this Snake binary is not yet ready to deploy to targets.\u201d Related: The Nastiest of all Ransomware Mamba Encrypts Entire Hard DriveFurthermore, the researchers explained that: \u201cAs this version contains debug functionalities and was signed on February 21st, 2017 it is likely that the OS X version of Snake is not yet operational. Fox-IT expects that the attackers using Snake will soon use the Mac OS X variant on targets,\u201dA word of advice: Never pay attention to unwanted emails and DO NOT click any attachment if it\u2019s from an unknown email address!DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Apple", "Cyber Crime", "internet", "Mac", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Windows"], "title": "Snake Malware Modified; OS X The Next Target", "date": "May 4, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});When it comes to phishing scams, the general concept is that cyber criminals will only send a link to trick users into logging in with their social media or email credentials. But since that is an old school trick, the malicious threat actors are aiming at much more than your Facebook or Gmail password.Recently, we discovered a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting Apple users. The aim of this attack is to steal their Apple ID, credit card data, a government issued ID card, and or passport. That\u2019s not all, the scam also asks users to provide it with access to their device webcam to take their snap for verification purposes.Related: How to use \u201cFind my iPhone\u201d app to locate your smartphoneIt all starts with users receiving an email in which the sender poses as one of the officials from Apple Inc. The email alerts the user that their iCloud account is on hold because of an unusual sign in activity through an unknown browser and in case they didn\u2019t log in from the device mentioned in the email they need to click on a link to change the password.Here\u2019s what the email claims:Here\u2019s a full preview of the email:Those who understand how phishing scams work will know how to ignore it, but unsuspecting users may fall for it and be tricked into clicking the link and giving away their personal and financial information. Upon clicking the link users are taken to the phishing page which looks exactly like the official Apple ID login page. The users then are then asked to enter their Apple ID and its password to proceed.Here\u2019s the screenshot of the fake Apple ID page:Once the users are logged in, they are taken to another page which asks users for their credit card details including cardholder name, card number, expiration date, CVV code and ED secure password. Upon giving this info, the users are asked to click the next tab. Remember by now the scammers have got your Apple ID login credentials and credit card information.Here\u2019s how the fake page looks like:Because criminals will remain criminals, the more you feed them the more they will ask for. Once the \u201cnext\u201d tab is clicked, users are invited to enter their personal information including full name, date of birth, country, state, city, address, Zip code and phone number. This is done to use user information for further scams like identity theft and social engineering frauds.Here\u2019s how the page looks like:Once your personal information is handed over to the criminals, the page asks users to click the \u201cfinish\u201d tab, but they aren\u2019t done yet. Upon clicking the Finish tab users are taken to another page asking them to upload their password, a government issued identity card or the driver license \u2013 both sides. Here\u2019s how the page looks:The users can click skip to avoid uploading their government issued documents but then they need to allow the website to access their device\u2019s camera and microphone to take a snap of them. The users can also click the \u201cSkip\u201d tab, and the page will redirect them to the official Apple ID website.Good news is that Google Chrome has already detected the scam and marked the phishing domain as \u201cDeceptive.\u201d However, the bad news is that Firefox, Opera, and Safari browsers didn\u2019t show any warning messages to their users therefore if you are using these browsers be vigilant.As far as this phishing scam is concerned, it can be labeled as a highly sophisticated one since cybercriminals are not just after your credentials but also looking to steal your identity which could be used in large scale identity fraud or even terrorism.

If the impersonated signals produce a response from recipient computers, then they are considered as C&C servers. Primarily, the crawler is hunting down remote administration tool (RAT) control centers which affect the user\u2019s webcam system wherein the camera starts recording a video or audio.How does it work?The program does this by constantly scanning for various Remote Access Trojan (RAT) programs that are sold illegally on various internet forums. The list of servers that are serving as the control panels for the Trojan programs is updated in real-time, and as such, researchers, security experts and other relevant parties can use the information to build effective firewalls and security features that would block these programs.Are there any flaws?One of the problems that have been encountered is that when Malware Hunter is scanning for potential C&C servers, false alerts have been produced in the user\u2019s security system according to reports. However, one of the creators of Malware Hunter said the alerts are because Malware Hunter is being applied to incoming traffic rather than to outgoing traffic.Till now, Malware Hunter has identified 5,700 RAT servers with Gh0st RAT having the majority of the servers. Gh0st RAT is a Chinese-created malware that has also been used previously for various cyber crimes since 2009.Malware Hunter versus VirusTotalMalware Hunter, according to its creators is meant to be the most robust form of online crawler and as such, it was compared with VirusTotal, which is yet another type of malware aggregation platform created by Google.Malware Hunter was therefore put to the test whereby the program was made to scan since 2015. The results included 633 RAT controllers that were identified. This was cross-checked with, VirusTotal, which showed 153 of the controllers.This implied that Malware Hunter was able to identify threats even before they had been submitted to VirusTotal.Malware Hunter is indeed a powerful program that allows for rigorous scanning for RAT control centers. Nevertheless, it is yet to be known whether or not the control centers identified using Malware Hunter will be blocked by various security researchers and firewall builders.For more technical details click here to read the 15-page report compiled by Recorded Future.

Once downloaded, the malware activates and downloads additional payloads from remote websites, as well as upload the data from the infected Android device.

This technique can bypass detection even when it comes to Google and its researchers, at least according to researcher Rowland Yu of SophosLabs.BrainTest was discovered in 2015 by Check Point on a Nexus 5 smartphone. The malware used several techniques to remain undetected in the Play Store, as well as to simply remain on the infected device. After the discovery, Google Play was quick to remove the malware, but now it is back with a new name.The discovery was almost accidental, and it happened as a part of the malware hunt that was organized in order to purge the infected apps. Google Play Store is having quite a problem with the infected applications lately, and this sweep was necessary after some apps were discovered to be infected for months, while some were there for years, spreading infections without anyone noticing. The most used malware was the FalseGuide malware, that infected over 40 apps and more than 2 million users during 5 months before it was discovered.Furthermore, last month, a Trojan called BankBot was found targeting hundreds of the Play Store\u2019s apps. Its \u2018job\u2019 was to steal online banking credentials from the infected device. Another incident happened in March when 87 mods for Minecraft appeared in the Play Store. Almost 1 million people downloaded them and were instantly bombarded by ads and scam activities.Related: New Android ransomware proves why antivirus software are a jokeThis has become quite a problem, and the Play Store seems to be too big for a regular sweep, so the elimination of all of these apps pretty much became a whack-a-mole activity.

However, new malicious apps are being uploaded as soon as the problem is solved, turning to an endless cycle, and not even Google has figured out how to stop it so far.Image Credit: FlickrDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Android", "APPS", "Cyber Crime", "Google Play", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "security"], "title": "Super Free Music Player Android App Comes with Malware Infection", "date": "May 3, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "The OurMine hackers are back in the news again.

Recently, the hacker made an attack on Netflix that went public with the illegal release of the yet-to-be-released season 5 of Orange is the New Black.Behind the scenesAccording to recent news, The Dark Over Lord had seemingly infiltrated the studio of Netflix from where he acquired access to one of Netflix\u2019s most famous and watched shows \u2013 Orange Is the New Black. The Dark Over Lord got hold of the show\u2019s latest season \u2013 season 5 \u2013 and demanded Netflix pay an undisclosed amount of ransom. The hacker threatened Netflix that if it does not give in to his demands, he would release the entire season publicly.Related: Cover Your Cams: Webcam of This Couple Got Hacked While Watching NetflixThat being said, Netflix was not the only one who was being targeted here. According to other reports, the Dark Over Lord had also hacked other studios, which mean he has access to a number of other seasons and TV series which he can use to his advantage.As of now, the Dark Over Lord seems to be focusing solely on Netflix. And perhaps to prove himself, the hacker claimed to have had already released episode 1 of Season 5. Nevertheless, no one was able to verify these claims. Remember, the Dark Over Lord is the same hacker who hacked WestPark Capital investment bank last year and demanded ransom from the authorities. He was also responsible for hacking healthcare database of 34,000 patients in the US and selling them on DarkWeb BTC 20 ($29020).https://twitter.com/tdohack3r/status/858255245662707712  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The entire Series up onlineThe next day after demanding Netflix pay his ransom, the Dark Over Lord made a public announcement claiming that they have released episodes 2 \u2013 10 which are available for download through a torrent link on Pirate Bay.This certainly indicates that Netflix neither paid the ransom nor did it do anything to handle the situation. All Netflix had to say after the incident was that they were aware of the situation and that there was a security breach in the system of a major production vendor. They also added that the FBI is working on the situation.So, what\u2019s the big dealThe release of one of the most watched show before its official release date is indeed a troubling incident. Nevertheless, it is not the first time that shows like this have been made public before being officially streamed.Furthermore, people are mostly reluctant to download illegally from websites like Pirate Bay, suspecting that they might end up downloading a malware and knowing that they will be able to watch the show legally once it is released. What is required though, is that Netflix and all other studios need to tighten their cyber security if they wish to avoid further incidents.Tony Gauda, CEO of ThinAir commented on the issue and said that \u201cThe Netflix hack shows that not all cyber-extortion campaigns require sophisticated malware. While Netflix ultimately chose not to pay the ransom, the attack serves as a proof-of-concept for the sort of data weaponization tactics that are becoming increasingly common among cyber criminals. Sensitive data, such as intellectual property, has become the lifeblood of many organizations, which makes the thought of paying to reduce potential fallout attractive.\u201d\u201cOrganization\u2019s need to get ahead of this trend by putting defenses in place that can monitor and protect sensitive data, so that it doesn\u2019t fall through the cracks. Once a security incident or breach is suspected they need to be able to quickly investigate and identify the source, scope, and other details so they can respond to it quickly. Having complete visibility over your company\u2019s sensitive data at all times, before, during and after a breach is critical.\u201dRelated: Making a murder: Anonymous To Help Man falsely Accused of Rape and MurderDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "Dark Net", "dark web", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Netflix", "Privacy", "Ransomware"], "title": "Dark Web Hacker Held Netflix to Ransom", "date": "May 1, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});A new warning has been issued by IBM and the situation seems to be rather serious.

The report states that the U.S was the most targeted country for ransomware and the number of people willing to pay the ransomware was also the highest in the US.A massive increase in Ransomware:Compared to the last year, ransomware attacks increased by at least 36% this year. Not only this, but Symantec also spotted more than 100 new ransomware themselves, and most of them were targeting residents of the U.S. Furthermore, the reports suggest that the rate of people paying the ransomware worldwide was 34%, while in the U.S alone, the rate was found to be 64%. Last year an average of $294 per victim was demanded by the hackers. However, this year the number skyrocketed to $1077.Kevin Haley, director of Symantec, said in an interview, \u201cIt\u2019s the country with the most connected computers in the world \u2014 give or take China \u2014 with a high standard of living and capability of paying are also most willing to pay. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the written amount of ransomware has gone up and that the U.S. is the number one target.\u201dKevin Heley said that as long as the people are willing to pay the ransomware, this demand per victim could increase Furthermore shortly.Not Just Ransomware!Not only were there an increase in ransomware attacks, but Symantec also noted a general increase in other cyber-attacks as well including DDoS attacks, phishing scams, data breaches and the government entities weren\u2019t spared either.Haley told in the interview that \u201cWe used to think that cyber attacks on nation-states were just about stealing secrets \u201cBut it\u2019s moved into doing more. They now understand that they can expose our secrets, can embarrass us, influence and even sabotage events.\u201dAccording to Haley, things could get even worse pretty soon, as the hackers are aware of the fact that police forces do not have funds to fight against them and even if they get caught, they will receive a minimum punishment for cyber offenses because of the current laws.A worrying sign:As per the report, hackers are now trying to fool humans rather than tricking computers. Haley said in a statement that \u201cComputers are getting harder to fool, and that\u2019s driving the attackers to fool humans \u2014 and, unfortunately, the ability to fool humans hasn\u2019t really changed that much.\u201dFurthermore, Haley stated that the number of cyber attacks could skyrocket in the near future as more and more IoT devices are being made.A tiny problem for the CybercriminalsLucky for us, cyber criminals- in particular, those using the ransomware tactic are facing a small problem. They have yet to figure out a way to let the victim pay for the ransomware using the infected device.Haley said, \u201cIt\u2019s a practical matter. How do you put up your ransom note and how do you get people to pay it? \u201cImagine someone trying to write down a TOR address off of their smart television set and walking over to their computer to enter it there. It\u2019s just not going to work.\u201dAs soon as the hackers figure out the solution to this problem, we could see a massive increase in the ransomware attacks.Some PrecautionsHaley, in the interview, talked about some potential steps to ensure the safety of IoT devices.1- Use strong passwords and enable Two-factor authentication.2- Be aware of the surroundings! Be a little suspicious about any unwanted email, especially the one containing an MS Word file.3- Make sure to have a backup of your device.4- In case your system has been infected with ransomware software DO NOT pay to these cyber criminals.

Next thing you know; they managed to steal a BMW. This has happened only days after a Mercedes was taken in a very similar way in the United Kingdom.The car in question, the \u00a360,000 BMW X5, seemed to have disappeared from the driveway while its owners slept. Upon investigating the CCTV footage, it was revealed that two thieves stole it by using some transmitting device that was apparently hidden inside the bag which extended the signal coming from the car keys inside the house. This model uses a keyless start system, which means that the car can be unlocked only by having the fob relatively close, or in this case, transmitting its signal so that the car would assume that you have the keys with you.RELATED: Hacker Steals, Drives Away Jaguar XFR Exploiting Flaw in Wireless SystemSince both of the vehicles were stolen in Essex, it\u2019s believed that they are being stolen by a gang that\u2019s targeting valuable cars which can be sold at high prices. Ray Anderson, a security expert, has stated that this is the fourth time such a theft was reported. His advice was to protect the fob by putting it in a metal box, or perhaps in a fridge since the metal would block signals that are otherwise constantly emitted.Anderson was the one who said that the thieves might be using a device that makes the car think that the fob is closer than it is and that nothing special is required to create this device. The entire process is completed in a very short period once the thieves start receiving the signal, and after that, both the thieves and the car are gone.The owners were sleeping when the car was stolen and only noticed that it was gone in the morning. They wanted their identities to remain private, but they did allow a video to be published so that others would be warned about the danger.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});In a video, two men approach the house. One of them holds a bag near the door, while the other one goes to the car door. The one with the bag starts moving it around the door, trying to catch the signal from within the house. A few seconds later, the signal is found, the car unlocked, and both of the thieves gone. Similar footage showed the same method being used on Mercedes C220 that was stolen on April 11.RELATED: Tesla Model S can be located, unlocked, stolen by manipulating Tesla appsThese keyless cars don\u2019t have regular car keys, but instead a plastic fob with a computer chip and a security code. When the fob is around, the car detects the chip and starting the engine is as easy as pressing a button. This method of theft is believed to be executed via radio transmitters, where one is held as close to the fob as possible, and the other one is by the car door. The first one catches the signal, and the other unlocks the car.Mercedes stated that they were unaware of these thefts, while BMW believes that this method of stealing is extremely rare. A spokesman for the Essex police has stated that they use several tactics to detect this form of stealing.Here the video showing thieves stealing BMW  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "security", "Technology", "UK", "WIFI"], "title": "Car Hackers Remotely Steal Keyless BMW within Seconds", "date": "April 29, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Researchers have recently discovered hundreds of vulnerable apps on Google Play Store which are allowing hackers to inject them with malicious code which, upon downloading, steal all data from an infected Android device.The problem, according to the researchers [PDF] is that some of the apps are creating open ports on smartphones, which is not a new problem since the same issue was faced by computers but it is something new when it comes to smartphone technology.A team from the University of Michigan has tried to use a custom tool for scanning more than 24,000 applications, and 410 of them were found to be flawed. At least one of those apps has been downloaded so many times that there are potentially millions of Android devices which are vulnerable.Researchers also stated: \u2013 \u201cThese newly discovered exploits can lead to a large number of severe security and privacy breaches. For example, remotely stealing sensitive data such as contacts, photos, and even security credentials and performing malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code and installing malware remotely.\u201dThe biggest problem lies with the apps that are used for file transfer between smartphones and computers via WiFi. The flawed security is allowing more than just the devices\u2019 owner to access the transfer and the devices themselves. Furthermore, apps which allow services like WiFi File Transfer, are estimated to have been downloaded between 10 and 50 million times. When the Michigan team decided to scan the campus network to determine how many devices can be found in this flaw; after only 2 minutes they were able to discover a number of vulnerable devices.\u201cTo get an initial estimate on the impact of these vulnerabilities in the wild, we performed a port scanning in our campus network, and immediately found a number of mobile devices in 2 minutes which were potentially using these vulnerable apps,\u201d according to the team.Moreover, it was found that 57 of the 410 apps are truly vulnerable and they have even demonstrated how the attacks work by explaining that the \u201capp opens ports by default and no client authentication or incoming connection notifications are engaged, which put the device user in severe danger.\u201dBasically, the apps are leaving open doors for any malicious code and not many of those would miss such an invitation. Google is yet to comment on the current situation. So far, the only way to fix this problem would be to uninstall these apps and this should not be difficult.

The whole idea behind a smart TV is to let the consumers control their device through the Internet, but what if there is a critical flaw in the security system of the smart TV? What if hackers can easily bypass the security measures of a television and gain the admin access? It would be a nightmare, right?Well, the IT security researchers from Neseso have discovered [Pdf] a critical vulnerability that leaves smart TV\u2019s users at the mercy of the hacker. According to the security researchers, a security flaw in the 32-inch Samsung\u2019s Tizen-based smart TV can be easily exploited by hackers to get the admin access to the \u201cnot so smart\u201d smart-TV.Neseso researchers discovered that there is no authentication procedure in place when connecting to the Smart TV; instead, the TV uses a pre-defined list of devices approved by the user. On the surface it looks as if everything is alright, but here\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with it. The hackers can easily get the whitelisted MAC address!Doing so will hand over the remote control of the smart TV to the hackers. Now imagine sitting on the couch drinking beer while watching your favorite TV show and suddenly someone starts changing the channels and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. How frustrating would that be, right? But that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. There\u2019s more to it.\u201cSamsung Smart TVs running Tizen OS are prone to a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to impersonate a trusted device to obtain unrestricted access without authentication when connected via Wi-Fi Direct,\u201d Neseso Research Team.Once the hacker has access to your smart TV, they can hack into the network the TV is connected to, and we don\u2019t need to explain what happens next, do we?Earlier this month, WikiLeaks reported a similar kind of vulnerability in Samsung\u2019s Smart-TVs allegedly used by the CIA to monitor potential suspects. While this vulnerability has been exploited by the CIA- (not that we are aware of), it is essentially a welcome note to the hackers to come and do their magic.Unfortunately, at the moment, there is nothing much you can do to cope with this vulnerability except for disabling the Wi-Fi option of your smart TV, at least for now. Here, it must be noted that Samsung uses Tizen OS in its mobile phones, smart TVs, and smartwatches. It was just a few weeks ago when an Israeli IT security researcher discovered that Tizen contains not one or two but around 40 Critical security flaws.Is it the time to stop using Smart TVs and switch to the conventional TVs?

The problem seems to lie at the user\u2019s end since most people whose devices were hacked don\u2019t care for updating them and making sure that their security is at its best.On the other hand, in the industrial control, where this kind of devices are used in life-crucial functions, it shows that applying the updates wasn\u2019t that easy, since they\u2019d have to be scheduled, and this is only applied to cases where the devices can be patched at all, which is not always the case.The model where the user is responsible for getting and installing a patch is seen as a relic of a PC age, and it would appear that PC security doesn\u2019t work for IoT. The problem is that the users don\u2019t seem to feel the same need to update their devices regularly, and since the perfect system cannot be written on the first go, this is something that must change.The solution needed to be found; one that doesn\u2019t involve something like recalling the flawed devices for which a similar method was used on the one that involved fixing the ShellShock vulnerability. This was now achieved by Orbit, which provides a shield around the device, and it protects it from exploits. It\u2019s a filter that can regularly be updated, without the need for the user to do a thing.Around 120 million devices are already under the networks protection, which makes them a lot safer. Basically, the IoT companies don\u2019t have to patch up each flawed device, but instead, they update the filter around the device, which is the Orbit network. The updates are applied immediately, and all of the devices are instantly protected from every new threat.The common problem was also how to tell real clients apart from bots that are pretending to be clients. This was worked out as well, through the new TLS Client Authentication. This concept is very useful but still needs to be further developed and worked on. Even though it can authenticate the real customers, it can still be overflooded, and this poses a problem.When it comes to the overall impression that Orbit has left on people, it\u2019s extremely good, and it\u2019s being accepted by everyone, including the CEO of Swift Sensors \u2013 Sam Cece, Ceo of Karamba Security \u2013 Ami Dotan, VP and global head of Qualcomm Ventures \u2013 Quinn Li, and professor of computer science at Princeton University and CTO of Timescale \u2013 Michael Freedman.They all agree that we\u2019re at the beginning of a new era, that will see more and more IoT devices used in everyday lives, and that layers of security like this that already compliments the existing security can never be a wrong thing", "topics": ["Cloud Flare", "DDOS", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Mirai", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "IoT Devices Will Now Have Their Own Private Network \u2013 CloudFlare Orbit", "date": "April 28, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "The Russian police have arrested Tor node operator Dmitry Bogatov.

This is done in order to protect the user\u2019s privacy by sending it through enough relays to make any connection of the original user to the data impossible.When you enter a website while using Tor, the website takes only the exit node as your IP address, which means that Bogatov\u2019s IP address being associated with the posts and the website itself proves nothing, and especially not that he was the one who used it.As for \u201cAirat Bashirov,\u201d whoever this person is, has made steps to verify that he\u2019s in fact not Bogatov.

Mr. Mounir Hahad, Director of Cyphot Labs told Linux Insider that \u201cUnlike the IoT malware Mirai, which targeted default credentials on IoT devices, this brute force attempt to compromise Linux computers is targeting weak passwords people would have chosen.\u201dHow to Tackle this Malware?It is a fact that IoT devices are vulnerable to brute force password attacks since a number of devices are shipped to customers with default login credentials. The users can protect their devices and network from this malware by changing the default password with a strong one. DO NOT use default Telnet and SSH credentials, instead use a strong password! SSH stands for Secure Shell, and it\u2019s a secure way to remotely access a site\u2019s server however in Shishiga\u2019s case situation is different.Remember, after the development of Mirai malware botnet, IoT devices have become extremely vulnerable to large-scale cyber attack. It was due to Mirai malware that Internet\u2019s largest ever DDoS attack took place last year.

The vulnerability exists in the apps\u2019 software 3.9.4 and 3.9.5 which takes advantage of insecure WiFi spots or by the standard man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to trick users into connecting to a WiFi network controlled by the attackers before stealing user data.The vulnerability was discovered by Will Hatzer and Arjun Kumar of Rapid7 who wrote in a blog post that \u201cThe potential data exposure can be exploited one user at a time via passive listening on insecure WiFi, or by the standard man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack methods to trick a user into connecting to a WiFi network controlled by an attacker on the same network as the user. If this is achieved, an attacker would then watch for HTTP traffic directed at http://54.64.135.113:8080/LogManager/LogServlet, which includes the encrypted log file with a filename that includes the user\u2019s email address.\u201dThe data which can be stolen using this method is vehicle\u2019s registration, PINs via a log transmission feature, app\u2019s username, and password. But, since with the help of Hyundai Blue Link apps, users can remotely start their vehicle, remotely unlock or lock the door, remotely activate the horn and lights, access saved POI history and find their car, etc; this information could be used to locate, unlock and start the Hyundai remotely. However, the researchers noted that \u201cIt would be difficult to conduct this attack at scale since an attacker would typically need first to subvert physically local networks, or gain a privileged position on the network path from the app user to the vendor\u2019s service instance.\u201dHyundai Motor America (HMA) was informed about the issue who acknowledged that a vulnerability affected its users. The good news is that Hyundai was quick to fix the problem by releasing updates (Version 3.9.6) on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.Update your Hyundai Blue Link appAccording to an official statement from Hyundai, \u201cThe privacy and security of our customers are of the utmost importance to HMA. HMA continuously seeks to improve its mobile application and system security. As a member of the Automotive Information Sharing Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC), HMA values security information sharing and thanks Rapid7 for its report.\u201dThe Hyundai Blue Link application was launched in December 2016 to give the user instant access to their vehicle but since Internet of Things (IoT) devices are vulnerable from the get-go it shouldn\u2019t  surprise users that Hyundai\u2019s apps were also vulnerable. Previously, security researchers discovered similar vulnerabilities in other apps dealing with the vehicles. For instance, one researcher hacked into the General Motors (GM) mobile app and demonstrated how one could locate, unlock and steal the targeted car.

Researchers have also found that the malware poses as a guide that wants to help gamers with online games like FIFA and Pokemon Go. These guides are actually a malicious software named FalseGuide.It\u2019s been discovered that FalseGuide was hiding in over 40 different guide apps and that the oldest one was posted more than three years ago on 14th of February 2014. Some of the infected apps reached over 50,000 downloads, as claimed by Check Point security. The researchers also said that all of those devices can now be considered infected.The aim, as claimed by experts, was to create a \u2018silent botnet,\u2019 that would later be used for adware purposes. Cyber criminals are well known for their use of botnets and most often these botnets are made of a series of infected devices which include computers, as well as IoT (Internet of Things) devices including DVRS, CCTV cameras, Smart TVs, Smart cars and Smart Switches, etc. Most of the malware that infects these devices are stealthy preventing users from detecting them, which in return allows the malware to remain undisturbed on the device.In the FalseGuide\u2019s case, the malware managed to receive the administrator privileges, which means that the user cannot get rid of the infection. After administrator privileges, the malware proceeded to register to a cloud-based messaging service to receive further instructions. This way, malware can be used to provide its creator a full access to the device or even to allow them to launch DDoS attacks.After the discovery of these malicious apps, Google has done what they could to take them off the Play Store, but the apps already downloaded are still posing a problem. Furthermore, investigations revealed that there were two people behind the scheme going by (probably fake) names of Nikolai Zalupkin and Sergei Vernik.It\u2019s believed that the gaming guides were selected because they\u2019ve been very popular lately, and also because they do not require much time and effort when it comes to feature implementation and development. This means that with a small amount of effort, hackers could reach a wide audience if by using the popularity and success of the original games.Experts also stated that \u201cMobile botnets are a growing trend since early last year, growing in both sophistication and reach,\u201d and that \u201cThis type of malware manages to infiltrate Google Play due to the non-malicious nature of the first component, which only downloads the actual harmful code.\u201d That\u2019s why users should not rely on their app stores to protect them, since there far too many apps available to be verified.Just last week, a Dutch cyber security firm called Securify uncovered a Trojan called \u2018BankBot,\u2019 that was used for financial frauds against Android users. The Trojan was discovered on Google Play Store leading to the conclusion that even official apps stores are not safe from cyber criminals and malware. If you are an Android or iOS user, it is highly recommended to download as fewer apps as possible and to confirm that the apps you are about to install are legit through the company\u2019s official website.

Especially if the use of this malware wasn\u2019t allowed, which would make it illegal.A visiting lecturer in surveillance law at Queen Mary University of London, Eric King, has said that the Met will need to explain why one of their officers had a FlexiSpy account, which is a rather specific brand of malware and is exactly the one that the officer purchased. King also stated that even the act of purchase of this tool is illegal, and is considered a criminal offense if it\u2019s known that the software will be used for unlawful purposes. This is due to the fact that the use of this kind of malware would breach the Computer Misuse Act 1990, reports MotherBoard.The company that sold the malware to this officer is called FlexiSpy, and they\u2019ve been known to sell such software to everyday consumers on regular basis. This company was also recently attacked by a hacker that stole customer data, parts of credit card info, as well as company\u2019s personal files. As you might have guessed, one of the customers\u2019 email address and username belongs to the officer in question.Once the malware that the officer purchased is installed on the device, it allows access to a lot of activity, including accessing Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, phone calls, emails, GPS location and more. It\u2019s a perfect spying tool, once you manage to install it somewhere.The user has an online dashboard, and upon logging into it, they\u2019ll have access to all the data that the malware managed to collect.Since several officers share the same name, it\u2019s not yet clear which one of them bought the software. One of the officers works with the Met\u2019s High Tech Crime Unit, while the other one has a senior position and has worked on the London 2012 Olympics.Still, the proof that one of the officers did buy the malware at least once is the sole fact that they have a username there since you can\u2019t get one until you make a purchase. Not only that, but it\u2019s confirmed that you need to pay for the malware in order to receive your username and password.In addition to this, another Met email address that was dated back to 2014 was found among the stolen data, but the name isn\u2019t included in the address and therefore it can\u2019t be determined who does it belong to.This isn\u2019t the first time that the Met has faced hacking allegations since it was recently reported that UK\u2019s police watchdog investigated the possibility of Met\u2019s secret division that supposedly used Indian hackers to break into emails of activists and journalists. This was back in March, while in September 2013 the Met also shown interest in buying malware. That time, they told Italian surveillance company called Hacking Team that they\u2019re ready to trial a hacking solution. Back then, though, they ended up not buying the software in question.King also said that the law enforcement forces must come clean about these hacking operations if they wish to regain public acceptance or the situation won\u2019t be different from the Police and public relations in the United States.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Police", "Privacy", "security", "Spyware", "UK"], "title": "Malicious software bought by a London Police Officer can remotely hack users", "date": "April 25, 2017"}, {"authur": "Ali Raza", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});International Criminal Police Organisation, also known as Interpol, has stated on Monday that one of their operations uncovered more than 9,000 C2 (command-and-control) servers and government portals that were compromised and infected by malware.Malware is a malicious software that can include computer viruses, spying programs, and similar software, that are used to infect and harm Internet-connected devices.

The blog post states than about 10 vulnerabilities in 20 different models have left thousands of devices vulnerable to cyber-attacks. And yes, these devices are already spread throughout the world.The flaws in question allow the potential hacker to overload the routers and create forced reboots. This is done by creating DoS (denial-of-service) conditions, and it keeps regular users of the device incapable of using it.The bugs also give attackers the chance to bypass SGI scripts and steal private information and even manipulate restricted settings. And not only that, but the hackers that use this method can even execute commands with root privileges, and create the sort of backdoor accounts that can be used for persistent access, and wouldn\u2019t be viewable when it comes to the smart management console for the router.List of vulnerable routers:EA2700, EA2750, EA3500, EA4500v3, EA6100,EA6200, EA6300, EA6350v2, EA6350v3, EA6400, EA6500, EA6700, EA6900, EA7300, EA7400, EA7500, EA8300, EA8500, EA9200, EA9400, EA9500, WRT1200AC, WRT1900AC, WRT1900ACS and WRT3200ACM. In an attempt to discover just how great of an impact the flaw has left, it\u2019s calculated that over 7,000 devices were flawed at the time of the search. Luckily, routers that are protected by network guards like firewalls and similar methods can be considered safe.The problem is that the security company found that almost 11% of the flawed routers still have default credentials and that any hacker knows how to exploit this and gain access, even if the flaws weren\u2019t there already. They\u2019ve even published the list of router models that are flawed.Most of these routers can be found in the US, and their number consists 69%. Other countries with a high number of flawed routers involve Canada, Hong Kong, Chile, the Netherlands, Venezuela, Argentina, and Russia. All of these countries have a 1% or more of the flawed routers, while the 13% of the devices is spread around the other countries of the world, with less than 1% per country.Upon discovering the flaws back in January, IOActive has contacted Linksys and warned that they have three months to patch the devices up before the information goes public. Linksys did what they could, and in March, they created a customer advisory in which they warned customers of the problem and gave instructions on how to deal with it until a more permanent solution was brought.The advisory was released, and the update that will fix the problems is expected in the coming weeks. They\u2019ve even stated that they understand the challenge of reaching out and getting to every one of their users, which is exactly why they created the advisory so that their users would be safe until the real fix is issued.Once the patch is available, IOActive will publish more details concerning the issue.Back in January, similar bugs were discovered in SOHO devices and also in enterprise D-Link routers, which leaves both regular users and corporate networks at risk.

However, this is only a professional guess.The app had over 5000 downloads before it was taken down, and the Bot was trying to steal the banking credentials of those users.Related: 38% of Android VPN Apps on Google Play Store Plagued with MalwareThe attacking mechanism: Once downloaded, the malware tricks users into gaining administrative privileges before removing the icon of the app, letting the user think that the app has been deleted. In reality, however, the app continues to work in the background! That\u2019s not all; the Botnet is designed to display fake screens disguised as banking apps, encouraging the users to put credit card information and other login credentials. As soon as the app gets what it wants, the credentials are then passed on to the hacker through a control and command (C&C) server.Affected apps: The mastermind behind this malware used DexProtector to ensure that the security researchers couldn\u2019t get their hands on the affected apps. To get the list of targeted apps, researchers have to go through measures created by DexProtector, gain the server data and run the program which isn\u2019t an easy thing to do. While the list of affected apps hasn\u2019t been retrieved yet, security experts believe that the malware is targeting ABN, ASN, Region bank, Bink and several other apps.The list of all targeted apps is available on Securify\u2019s blog.Related: New Android ransomware proves why antivirus software are just a jokeWord of advice: This is not the first time that a botnet has been spotted targeting the users, and surely this isn\u2019t the last time either!

As a result of the tight security measures, hackers have come up with a new technique to target users with a highly sophisticated phishing scam using \u201cUnicode characters.\u201dThe Perfect Phishing attackA phishing attack usually depends on two things: a perfect disguise and somewhat the ignorance of users. But not this one as hackers are now faking popular domains like Apple, Google, or eBay on their own fraudulent websites. Hackers are even able to get the little \u201cSecure\u201d green bar for their fraudulent websites making the attack even more sophisticated.If a user is on to one of these malicious sites, practically there is no way of telling that they are fake, and users can be easily fooled to put their credentials on the fake domain.Nearly Impossible to detectAccording to Mr. Xudong Zheng, a security researcher, Google Chrome has a dangerous new vulnerability that makes phishing attacks almost impossible to detect.\u201dHe further added, \u201cIt becomes impossible to identify the site as fraudulent without carefully inspecting the site\u2019s URL or SSL certificate.\u201dThe Flaw-explained in Layman termsAccording to security researchers, the flaw exists because of the inability of an encoder \u201cPunycode\u201d to render some character sets properly.A Chinese character \u201ca\u201d and a Latin character \u201ca\u201d are rendered differently in the web-browser, however, on the surface bot, the characters look like a simple \u201ca\u201d in the URL bar, and this flaw can be easily exploited by hackers.Mr. Xudong showed this critical flaw by creating a fake version of \u201cApple.com\u201d website by using the domain name \u201cxn--80ak6aa92e.com\u201d. He chose foreign language characters and took advantage of the rendering mechanism of Chrome browser.

But here is a temporary solution for Firefox:* In the URL bar type \u201cabout: config\u201d and press enter.* Then, type \u201cpunycode\u201d in the search bar of the browser.* Now search for \u201cnetwork.IDN_show_punycode and change the value of it from false to True.Until an official patch is released by the browsers, users are advised to type in the URLs manually and also to double check the website for any suspicious activity before putting in sensitive information.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "topics": ["Apple", "Chrome", "Cyber Crime", "Firefox", "Google", "hacking", "internet", "Opera", "Phishing", "Phishing Scam", "Privacy", "security"], "title": "Beware; Sophisticated Phishing Attacks Using Unicode Characters", "date": "April 19, 2017"}, {"authur": "Jahanzaib Hassan", "body": "Google is known to be in the spotlight for its success mostly, but this wasn\u2019t the case last night.

But what happened in the United Kingdom ruined a man\u2019s life. The man in question is Mr. Nigel Lang, a UK resident who in 2011 got arrested at his home because, according to the police, he was a suspect for keeping child pornographic content on his electronic devices. That\u2019s when his nightmare began. Even though he was innocent, his arrest was carried out as a result of a typo in an IP address.This means the person who was involved in the crime was never arrested while Lang went through hell due to a police officer who didn\u2019t even bother to double check the IP address and the address they were going to raid.Furthermore, the police went on to search his devices for indecent images, but since the content never existed in the first place, the Police found nothing but embarrassment. But it was too late for Lang who was terminated from his job immediately as a counselor for troubled teenagers.According to BuzzFeed \u201cLang was bailed but under strict and devastating conditions. Social services had visited his partner at home while he was being interviewed to conduct a \u201csafeguarding assessment,\u201d and it was decided he could not live at the family home, visit his son there, or have any unsupervised contact with his son anywhere.\u201d It took police three weeks to search his device but failed to discover any evidence of criminality. Lang decided to find out what exactly happened on his own. He then filed a complaint against the police department accusing them of racially motivated arrest since his partner was white and the home Internet was registered in her name, but she was never questioned about the images whatsoever.Lang\u2019s request to file the complaint was denied, but a letter sent to him by the police revealed that the arrest order came from Hertfordshire Constabulary, a police force over 100 miles away from where Lang lives.\u201cSouth Yorkshire police\u2019s DI Sean McMahon, who investigated the complaint, wrote that in May 2011, officers had received information from their colleagues in Hertfordshire that they had identified an IP address that had shared more than 100 images of children via peer-to-peer software in April that year. Hertfordshire police had established that the IP address belonged to the account in the name of Lang\u2019s partner,\u201d BuzzFeed was told.Moreover, it took Hertfordshire Constabulary three years to accept their mistake. In a letter sent by Tracy Pemberton Hertfordshire Police Lang was told that:\u201cWhen police requested details about an IP address connected to the sharing of indecent images of children, one extra keystroke was made by mistake, sending police to entirely the wrong physical location.\u201d\u201cHertfordshire police were initially resistant, refusing to speak to Lang\u2019s solicitor before they could talk to Lang himself. Over the phone, he was finally told the circumstances behind his arrest: While requesting details about an IP address linked to indecent images of children from an internet service provider, police had added an extra digit \u2013 a single keystroke \u2013 by mistake. When the ISP came back with a physical address for the IP address provided, it led police to Lang\u2019s front door. The internet account set up by Lang\u2019s partner just happened to have the wrong IP address at the wrong time.\u201dWhile Hertfordshire apologized for what happened Lang is still waiting for an apology from the officers who raided his house and arrested him in front of his son.

But there are underlying threats hanging on the connected-car technology\u2018s users which if exploited can allow hackers to remotely shut down a targeted car.These threats were revealed by a cyber security firm Argus on Thursday when the firm demonstrated how a car using Bosch Drivelog Connector OBD-II dongle could be easily victimized with just a Bluetooth connection. The security flaws are present in Drivelog Connect application 1.1.1 and below and Dongle firmware version 4.8.0 to 4.9.2.What is Dongle?In case you are wondering what Dongle is, It is a standard device plugged into the ports located under the vehicle dashboard. The dongle, in some countries, is installed by the insurance companies to assist them with the driving patterns of the car, or sometimes it is installed by the car owners themselves if they wish to have in-vehicle WIFI.The experimentTo show the security flaws, Argus used a device called Drivelog Connect, a device to connect car through a Bluetooth enabling him to review vehicle health, track the mileage and much more. The firm used this device to show what could be done if the hackers can get past the service ID limitation of the security system.Argus wrote in their blog post that in the first vulnerability, the security flaw in the message filter allows an attacker with root privileges on the driver\u2019s phone to send malicious CAN messages outside of the scope a small subset of diagnostic messages (i.e., OBDII PIDs) which can potentially have physical effects on the vehicle.The second vulnerability amplifies the effect of the first and eliminates the need for a compromised phone.Although the model of the victimized car has not been disclosed, Argus officials told the media that any car with Bluetooth enabled Drivelog Connector Dongle and a Wifi connection can be easily victimized.In our research, we were able to turn off the engine of a moving car while within Bluetooth range. As troubling as that is, in a more general sense, since we can use the dongle to inject malicious messages into the CAN bus, we may have been able to manipulate other ECUs on the network. If an attacker were to implement this attack method in the wild, we estimate that he could cause physical effects on most vehicles on the road today.New And ImmatureAmi Shalev, Argus Research team leader, described the current security systems placed in cars as \u201cNew and Immature.\u201d \u201cThese firewalls are really new and immature in their security measures,\u201d He said.Although the hack was performed in a controlled environment, Argus researchers believe that the same attack can be conducted on any car.

Thorsten Kuhles, the head of Bosch\u2019s team, said \u201cA patch that fixes the underlying weaknesses in the encryption protocol will be available shortly.

A group of hackers called \u201cCalisto\u201d exploited a malware previously used by the Italian surveillance firm, Hacking Team, to hack into UK\u2019s Foreign Office network.The Hacking Team is a Milan-based firm providing spyware and other hacking tools to governments around the world, but in 2015, the firm suffered a massive breach after which 400 GB of its data was leaked online. After the leak, the firm warned that \u201cterrorists\u201d could use their RCS Spyware. Now, as per reports, the Foreign Office of the UK was targeted multiple times in the last year, and these attacks began since the April of 2016.F-secure- a cybersecurity firm was conducting the investigation on this matter and found that the hackers were conducting \u201cSpear-phishing,\u201d campaign against their target. Hackers were also trying to gain the victims\u2019 personal information and credentials by sending them fake emails which were then supposed to download the final Payload.The firm discovered that \u201cIn all known malicious attachments, the final payload was a variant of the \u2018Scout\u2019 tool from the Hacking Team Remote Control System (RCS) Galileo hacking platform.\u201d\u201cScout\u201d is a tool used by the Italian Hacking Team for surveillance purposes.The masterplanIf you think that this was just an ordinary \u201cphishing\u201d campaign, then think again! It was a much more sophisticated attack. \u201cCallisto group\u201d created numerous web addresses similar to the legit ones of the Foreign Office website. They even created similar webmail addresses.Though the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) did not mention culprits behind this attack, F-secure believes that \u201cCallisto group\u201d was responsible.According to NCSC officials,\u201dThe first duty of government is to safeguard the nation, and as the technical authority on cyber security, the NCSC is delivering groundbreaking innovations to make the UK the toughest online target in the world. The government\u2019s Active Cyber Defence program is developing services to block, prevent and neutralize attacks before they reach inboxes.\u201dWhether the attack was successful or not is still a mystery, BBC reports that the most sensitive information of Foreign Office is safe.The big PictureAccording to F-secure, Callisto group was previously targeting \u201cmilitary personnel, government officials, think tanks and Journalists\u201d all across the Europe.An anonymous source told the BBC that the hackers might have been involved in influencing the latest US election, as he found two phishing domains linked to an IP address which was mentioned in a US government report. However, conclusive evidence of the involvement of Callisto is still yet to be found.On a further investigation, the security firm found a resemblance between previously Russian attacks and the Callisto\u2019s attacking methods, which could mean that the group is somewhere from Russia as well.

Now, Ken Munro, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, who also happened to be a consumer of one of AGA\u2019s old model cookers was thinking to update his device to the one operated through the app. But he changed his mind when he found out vulnerabilities allowing hackers to turn the oven on/off without the owners\u2019 knowledge with the help of a text message.Related: Maybe Microwaves can be hacked but turn them into cameras? NahIn his blog post, Munro said that \u201cI wanted to know more about its security before spending extra on this option. We found that even Agas can be hacked. Seriously.\u201d According to him, the problem is the way the mobile app communicates with the cooker; even it does not connect to the Internet, an SMS is sent from the Aga\u2019s app to a SIM card embedded in the ovens.This is how it works: The user controls the on/off function via the app installed on their phone, and the app sends a text message to the oven turning it on or off. The researcher explained that this process could be easily hijacked, as hackers could send messages to the cooker that does not belong to them since the SMS messages are not authenticated by the cooker, nor is the sim card set up to send the messages validated on registration.While Munro detailed that the problem is not so much to turn the cooker ON in a dangerous capacity, but the issue is that the company is not taking the security situation seriously enough, as someone with bad intentions could easily find a list of all numbers associated with Aga cookers and control them. He has tried contacting the company numerous times, yet he got no answer but also got blocked by AGA on Twitter.To @AGA_Official PR agency: \"Do you deal with Aga PR?\"\r\r\"Yes\"\r\r \"Can you help me report a security flaw\"\r\r\"Ah, I can't help you with that\"\u2014 Ken Munro (@TheKenMunroShow) April 6, 2017As there is no encryption or a way to verify the communication between the cooker and its app, the researcher detected format between the two devices; these could be copied and be used to control the ovens remotely.\u201cYou probably know it takes hours for an Aga to heat up. Switch it off, annoy the hell out of people,\u201d said Munro. \u201cOne could also power up people\u2019s Agas when they\u2019re not looking, wasting electricity.
