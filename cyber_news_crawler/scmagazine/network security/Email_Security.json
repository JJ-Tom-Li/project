But in 2017, the adversary \u2013 also known as Group123 \u2013 reached beyond the Korean peninsula, reports FireEye. Among its targets were a Middle Eastern financial company that provides telecommunications services, a Vietnamese trading and transport company, and also possibly individuals who help Olympics organizations procure resources for athletes.\n\nOne possible reason the Middle Eastern financial firm was chosen as the target of an APT37 spear phishing campaign was because a business relationship it had formed with an unnamed North Korean company had publicly soured, FireEye suggests. \u00a0Reportedly, Reaper actors sent one of the company's board members a fake bank liquidation letter, in the form an attachment that exploited the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 to deliver \u201cSHUTTERSPEED\u201d backdoor malware, capable of harvesting system information, grabbing screenshots and downloading other malicious files.\n\nOther recent targets, according to FireEye, include individuals tied to North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations, an unnamed entity in Japan linked to United Nations sanctioning and human rights missions, and South Korean academic and strategic institutions.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional redlines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity,\u201d FireEye states in its report. \u201cWe anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\u201d \n\nJust last month, Cisco Systems' Talos research team similarly profiled APT37's 2017 activities in its own research blog post. Additional reports linking the Adobe Flash attack to Reaper then broke in early February.\n\nFireEye has also observed Reaper grow in sophistication, noting a \u201chigh operational tempo and specialized expertise,\u201d with a particular affinity for quickly utilizing exploits \u2013 especially Flash ones \u2013 shortly after they are publicized. The group is also known to use a combination of spear phishing emails, website compromises, and torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware.\n\nInterestingly, one of the strongest clues that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government was reportedly uncovered after the presumed developer of several Reaper malware payloads mistakenly disclosed his own personal data, revealing he was operating from an IP address and access point linked to the dictatorial nation. FireEye also has noted that the compilation times of APT37 malware programs are consistent with North Korea's typical workday hours, and that Reaper's targets are consistent with North Korean objectives.\n\nFireEye reports that APT37 generally favors malware that exfiltrates information from victims \u2013 although one of its payloads, RUHAPPY, can also serve as a destructive disk wiper.\n\nWary of Pyongyang's cyber aggression and threats of nuclear strikes, the U.S. may be developing plans to strike North Korean targets with a \u201cbloody nose\u201d attack that relies primarily on cyberwarfare tactics, as opposed to conventional weapons, according a report in Foreign Policy magazine that cites two former intelligence officials. The article further states that the U.S. government has spent the last six months installing fiber cables, remote bases, and listening posts in Japan and South Korea, as a means for hackers to attempt to access North Korea's Internet.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/zero-day/topic/49474/", "topic_name": "Zero Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Edward Snowden returns to U.S.!

People were also likely to fall for phishing attacks appealing to their appetite offering free food or drinks, emails that evoked the fear of missing out on non-monetary opportunities and attacks that appealed to basic curiosity such as new contact requests or photo tags.\n\nResearchers also saw an increased click rate with certain email subjects as well with missed deliveries and false security notifications gaining the most clicks. The top subject lines of included \u201cA Delivery Attempt Was Made\u201d with an 18 percent click rate, \u201cUPS Label Delivery 1ZBE312TNY00015011\u201d with a 16 percent click rate, \u201cChange of Password Required Immediately\u201d with a 15 percent click rate, \u201cUnusual sign-in activity\u201d with a 9 percent click rate, and \u201cHappy Holidays! Have a drink on us.\u201d With an 8 percent click rate. \n\n\u201cEmail is an effective way to phish users when disguised as legitimate email,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese methods allow attackers to craft and distribute enticing material for both random (general phish) and targeted (spear-phish) means, leveraging multiple psychological triggers and engaging in what amounts to a continuous maturity cycle.\u201d\n\nResearchers were more convincing when targeting users via social media themed email phishing attacks. LinkedIn notifications were by far the most convincing with requests to add people, join networks, reset passwords, and new messages convincing 53 percent of test subjects to click.\n\nThe study also found that login Alerts, 19 percent, tagged photos, 12 percent, free pizza and new voice message respectively gained clicks from 18 percent of test subjects. \n\n\u201cThe most effective templates or phishes are those that cause a knee-jerk reaction in the user,\u201d Stu Sjouwerman, CEO, KnowBe4 said. \u201cThey make him/her react without thinking due to the alarming or urgent nature of the subject.\u201d\n\nSjouwerman added that cybercriminals already know this and that these kind of subject lines will consistently work with the softest of targets and serve as an effective vector into a company.

But in a rather unique twist, this time the campaign takes advantage of the Windows Installer program msiexec.exe.\n\nIn a Feb. 8\u00a0blog post, Trend Micro researchers Martin Co and Gilbert Sison report that the phishing emails associated with this attack use a lure that asks the recipient to confirm receipt of a payment. While much of the content is written in English, there is also a warning, in Korean, that advises recipients to check if their PCs are infected with a virus or malicious code. For this reason, Trend Micro believes Korean-speakers are the intended target.\n\nThe attached document, saved under the name Payment copy.Doc, purports to be a payment confirmation document, but opening it actually delivers the exploit, which is used to download a Windows Installer package\u00a0labeled\u00a0zus.msivia. This package then drops either an obfuscated MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or Delphi binary. In turn, the binary uses a hallowed out instance of itself to produce the final payload, Loki, which is known for stealing passwords and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nTrend Micro researchers believe that the unusual tactic of using Windows Installer may be a way to evade detection by security software that looks for more traditional installation methods.\n\n\u201cSecurity software has become proficient at monitoring possible downloader processes such as Wscript, Powershell, Mshta.exe, Winword.exe, and other similar executables that have become increasingly popular methods of installing malicious payload,\u201d report\u00a0Co and Sison. \u201cDue to their widespread use, it became easy to stop the arrival of threats via these software. However, the use of msiexec.exe to download a malicious MSI package is not something we typically see in most malware.\u201d\n\nWith that said, however, \u201cwe cannot definitively say if these samples are being delivered via the method described,\u201d the researchers add.\n\nOther malware families, including\u00a0Andromeda, have previous abused Windows Installer, the researchers note, but they modify the program or its processes in some capacity. But in this instance, Installer is left untouched and is used exactly as it's programmed to \u2013 only for a malicious purpose.\n\nThis latest attack is also an outlier because Microsoft Installer packages more typically are \u201cabused for malicious purposes to install Potentially Unwanted Applications... This is a new direction for malware creators,\u201d the report states.\n\nAside from taking the usual email security precautions, users can protect themselves from this particular threat by disabling or restricting Windows Installer.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Olympic torch lights the way for cybercrimminals", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/olympic-torch-lights-the-way-for-cybercrimminals/article/743173/", "title": "Olympic torch lights the way for cybercrimminals", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "February 09, 2018", "body": "With the torch lighting for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang taking place today it will be off to the races for skiers, bobsledders and cybercriminals all of whom are looking to make their mark at the games.\n\nThe potential for cyberattacks being launched against those attending the games, and even those watching from afar, is so strong that U.S. CERT has issued cybersecuirty guidelines for those visiting, tips that can be used well after the Olympics ends in any public environment.\n\n\u201cWith the 2018 Winter Olympics commencing soon, we can expect that the events will generate cyber threat activity. Both targeting of specific organizations that are involved in sponsoring, promoting and participating in the game, as well as using the attention it generates as lure content for delivery of malware. Based on historical activity surrounding the Olympics, these threats will likely include cyber espionage groups, hacktivists and cybercriminals,\u201d said Jens Monrad, FireEye's principal threat analyst.\n\nConsidering the on-the-go nature of attending the Olympics all of the recommendations center on mobile security hygiene and are very similar to what attendees of Black Hat and Def Con are told.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Switch off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections when not in use.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use a credit card to pay for online goods and services.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When using a public or unsecured wireless connection, avoid using sites and applications that require personal information like log-ins.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Update mobile software.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use strong PINs and passwords.\n\nOther suggestions include have two-factor authentication for your accounts, keep a screen lock active on your device and most importantly take a minute and think before you click on a link.\n\nThere have already been several hacking attempts centered on the Olympics with documents and emails stolen from the International Luge Federation being leaked and McAfee reported in early January campaign targeting organizations involved with the Pyeongchang Olympics that used the games as part of a social engineering plan to trick folks into opening phishing emails.\n\nWhile nation-state backed cyberattacks cannot be ruled out, most experts believe that with North Korea now attending the games and attack from that direction is unlikely, but it does not mean the games are safe.\n\n\u201cThe largest cyber threat to the Winter Games comes from non-state actors. Hacktivists, cyberterrorists, and fame seekers all see the Olympics as a great venue for their personal cause, whether it's personal fame, the propaganda of a political message or harm for a political purpose,\u201d Ross Rustici, senior director for intelligence services for Cybereason.\n\nPossibly making the attackers job easier, and the defenders more difficult, is the reliance the games IT infrastructure will have on third-party vendors. As a group third-party vendors have not performed well when it comes to protecting data and Rustici believes this could again prove to be a weak spot at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe sprawling networks needed to successfully run the Olympics requires giving access to subcontractors, international journalists and TV networks, international delegations and, in some cases, throngs of tourists. The network security teams will manage millions of network events a day over disperse networks with unique protocols and traffic patterns over systems that include: broadcast networks; industrial control systems; tickets, merchandise and other payment related systems and operational networks related to the running and scoring of the games themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it's not just the systems and devices directly associated with managing the games that are in danger. The relative ease many hackers have infiltrating IoT devices means even the medical devices on site to care for the athletes are a danger point, said Jonathan Langer, co-founder and CEO of Medigate, a medical device security platform.\n\n\u201cAs the technology used in the Olympics evolves, so do the cybercriminals who now target the many connected medical devices that the athletes use. The Olympics exemplify the emerging cybersecurity threats in healthcare, specifically medical device cybersecurity, which is a part of the wave of IoT devices connecting to networks. Hospitals all over the globe are struggling to face off with this new cybersecurity challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nMcAfee has already noted a few campaigns using the games as part of the social engineering aspect scheme in their attacks. \n\nThe first incident took place on December 22 with the last known coming in on December 28. The initial email was addressed to icehockey@pyeongchang2018[.]com with several other organizations that are playing some type of support or infrastructure role in the Olympics being blind CC'd. The email was sent from an IP address in Singapore and it was spoofed to say it came from the South Korean National Counter-Terrorism Center, which at the time was running counter-terrorism drills for the Olympics.\n\nThe malicious actor behind this attack has recently added additional capability to the malware making it more than a basic info stealer making it more persistent enabling it to remove data over an extended period of time.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberattack/topic/47226/", "topic_name": "Cyberattack"}, {"topic_link":

The numbers indicate that adversaries still find the malware to be viable, even though up-to-date versions of Windows would typically catch it, the post states.\n\nDesigned to infect computers with secondary malware, especially banking trojans, Hancitor (aka Chanitor or Tordal) historically has been delivered in email spam campaigns featuring either malicious attachments or links to distribution servers hosting malicious Hancitor documents. Some of these webservers have been compromised, but in many recent cases actors have deliberately set them up to host the malware.\n\n\"Since early October 2017, these distribution servers have usually been servers set up through fraudulent accounts at hosting providers. In September through November 2017, links from Hancitor malspam occasionally resolved to these domain names without any additional text in the URL,\" states the blog post, written by researchers Vicky Ray and Brad Duncan.\n\nMoreover, \"In recent weeks, links from this malspam have been using a custom encoding to disguise the recipient's email address in the URL.\" Having the email address in the URL is a way to track victims, the blog post explains.\n\nThe researchers further noted that most of the malicious webservers registered with hosting providers are located in the U.S., while the majority of compromised domains are based in Asia, and often owned by small and medium businesses.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Cybercriminals exploiting traditional trust measures for compromises, study", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/sites-once-thought-safe-may-be-exposing-you-to-third-party-vulnerabilities/article/742461/", "title": "Cybercriminals exploiting traditional trust measures for compromises, study", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "February 06, 2018", "body": "Cybercriminals are exploiting traditional measures of trust to gain a foothold on users systems by compromising trusted sites via background initiated requests, using phishing sites, and typosquatting.\n\nWhile many companies have used categories such as \u00a0Business and Economy, Shopping, News and Media, and Malware, to help set security policy researchers are warning it's no longer advisable to consider any category as inherently safe, according to the Menlo Security State of the Web 2017 report released Feb. 5, 2018. \n\n\u201cMany companies have used these categories to help set security policy,\u201d researchers said in the report. \u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, it's no longer advisable to consider any category as inherently \u201csafe. According to our research, more than a third of all sites in categories including News and Media, Entertainment and Arts, Shopping, and Travel were risky.\u201d\n\nThe problem stems from third party vulnerabilities with the average website connecting to 25 background sites for content, such as video clips and online ads and that enterprise security administrators don't have tools to monitor these connections.

The report found that 42 percent of the top 100,000 sites on the web, as ranked by Alexa, are either using software that leaves them vulnerable to attack or have already been compromised in some way.\n\nSome of the most popular software putting these sites at risk with 32,669 sites putting users at risk with Microsoft IIS 7.5, 26,796 sites putting users at risk with php/5.45.15, and 18,379 sites putting users at risk with apache/2.2.15.\n\nThe top sites categories relying on vulnerable software included business and economy with 51,045 sites, society with 25,977 sites, personal and blogs with 20,675 sites, news and media with 17,083 sites, and adult and pornography sites with 16,929 sites.\n\nResearchers said business and economy sites experienced the most security incidents and that they contained more sites running vulnerable software, such as PHP 5.3.3, than any other category.\n\nIn order to avoid and defend against potential threats, researchers recommend website owners \u00a0make sure their servers run the latest software updates and investigate technologies such as \u00a0Content-Security-Policy. Consumers should download software updates religiously, avoid vulnerable technologies such as Adobe Flash, and use the Chrome browser when possible, researchers added.\n\nChris Olson, chief executive officer at The\u00a0Media\u00a0Trust said enterprises should be concerned about the increasing frequency of website breaches attributed to compromised third-party code. \n\n\u201cClearly, app sec, antivirus and other traditional website security solutions can't keep pace with the thousands of malicious domains generated every month,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThe onus is on enterprise IT to continuously monitor all executing code \u2013 both first and third-party code \u2013 on websites and mobile apps to discover what and who is executing in the digital environment.\u201d\n\nHe added that unauthorized or anomalous code should be immediately remediated and that today's dynamic internet environment requires a continuous security approach to detect real-time security and performance failures before they have detrimental effects on both the enterprise network and its website users.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malvertising/topic/50030/", "topic_name": "Malvertising"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Adobe releases desperately needed fix for Flash Player bug exploited by zero-day attackers", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/adobe-releases-desperately-needed-fix-for-flash-player-bug-exploited-by-zero-day-attackers/article/742453/", "title": "Adobe releases desperately needed fix for Flash Player bug exploited by zero-day attackers", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "February 06, 2018", "body": "Adobe Systems today released a critical security update for a pair of vulnerabilities in Flash Player, one of which has been actively exploited in phishing attacks attributed to North Korean APT actor Group 123, which reportedly is infecting targets with the ROKRAT remote administrative tool.\n\nBoth bugs are classified as use-after-free vulnerabilities that can result in remote code execution on devices operating on the Windows, Mac, Linux or Chrome operating system.\n\nIt was Kr-CERT/CC, South Korea's national computer emergency response team, that found CVE-2018-4878, the zero-day bug reportedly leveraged by hackers.

The financial, technology and healthcare fields had more records on the Dark Web, but this is primarily due to the fact that those industries have more employees overall.\n\nIn many cases the Fortune 500 firm is not directly to blame for the data loss because their employees used their corporate email address, and possibly the same sign-on credentials, to create an account at a third-party website. If this entity suffers were to suffer a breach and the person has used the same login then the Fortune 500 company could be vulnerable.\n\nCompounding the problem is the large number of weak passwords associated with their accounts.\n\n\u201cComputers, Office Equipment industry has the largest percentage of weak, compromised passwords with 25 percent, followed by Transportation Equipment and Telecommunications industries with 17.6 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively,\u201d the report said.\n\nWhen it comes to shear volume commercial banks have the highest number of weak or compromised passwords with 109,000; telecom is next with just over 100,000; and the computer, office equipment\u00a0 sector is third with 73,000.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Two-year-old malware campaign plagues Ukrainians with Vermin, Quasar RATs", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/two-year-old-malware-campaign-plagues-ukrainians-with-vermin-quasar-rats/article/740534/", "title": "Two-year-old malware campaign plagues Ukrainians with Vermin, Quasar RATs", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 30, 2018", "body": "Researchers have uncovered a two-year-old cyber espionage campaign that's been infecting Ukrainians with either a newly discovered remote access tool called Vermin or the more established Quasar RAT.\n\nAn analysis of Vermin, conducted by members of Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat research team, determined that the reconnaissance malware collects infected victims' keystrokes and clipboard data, and is also capable of deleting and downloading files, renaming files and folders, uploading and deleting files, and capturing audio and video.\n\nPalo Alto was tipped off to Vermin by a fellow researcher who tweeted an image of a decoy document that purports to be an official order from the\u00a0Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. The document was served up by a malicious SFX file (distributed via a phishing campaign) that executes the malware infection when opened.\n\nUpon further investigation, the researchers soon found additional Vermin samples, revealing a larger command-and-control infrastructure that since late 2015 has been infecting individuals with Vermin or, alternatively, Quasar RAT, an open-source malware family used in criminal and espionage attacks. Many of these additional samples didn't even use a decoy document; instead, they consisted of only the payload and a dropper disguised as an icon for a document viewing app such as Microsoft Word.\n\nIn an unusual development, Unit 42 researchers learned that Vermin leverages the HTTP encapsulated Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messaging protocol to establish a secure command-and-control communication -- a behavior that is \"something not often seen in malware samples,\" according to Unit 42 blog post authors and researchers Tom Lancaster and Juan Cortes.\u00a0\n\nResearchers also found that Vermin is composed of mostly original code, written using the Microsoft .NET Framework and often packed with the .NET obfuscation tool\u00a0ConfuserEx.\u00a0\n\nFollowing execution, the malware checks if the victim's system is configured with Russian as the installed input language (often a telltale clue that the attackers are Russian and don't want to attack their fellow countrymen). If the machine is not set to Russian, the malware performs an API call and decrypts an embedded resource that contains the main code for communications and RAT functionality.\n\nAt this point, the malware begins collecting information, including machine name, username, OS name, architecture, local IP address and the presence of anti-virus software. If an AV program is detected, then Vermin's keylogger component is not installed.\n\nOutside of launching targeted attacks against Ukrainians, \"We were unable to definitively determine the aims of the attackers or the data stolen,\" concluded Lancaster and Cortes.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Texas county nearly duped out of $888,000 in Hurricane Harvey phishing scam", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/texas-county-nearly-duped-out-of-888000-in-hurricane-harvey-phishing-scam/article/740054/", "title": "Texas county nearly duped out of $888,000 in Hurricane Harvey phishing scam", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 29, 2018", "body": "The most populous county in Texas nearly lost $888,000 last year, after a local government employee fell for a spear phishing campaign that used Hurricane Harvey as a lure, the\u00a0Houston Chronicle\u00a0has reported.\n\nAccording to the Chronicle, the auditor's office at Harris County \u2013 which includes much of the city of Houston and is home to almost 4.1 million citizens \u2013 received a series of emails beginning on Sept. 21, 2017,\u00a0from someone claiming to be an accountant at D&W Contractors, Inc., a company hired to clear debris and perform repair work on a parking lot damaged by the hurricane in August.\n\nThe email reportedly asked the county to deposit $888,000 into the contractor's new bank account.

The report said the GDGS is known to gather cyber intelligence to bolster its offensive cyber capabilities.\n\nThe group is believed to be currently running six distinct and concurrently operating campaigns some of which have been in operation since 2012.\n\nDark Caracal has ties to a previous operation uncovered by the EFF during its Operation Manul campaign which targeted journalists, lawyers, and dissidents critical of the Kazakhstan government.\n\nThe malicious group usual modus operandi is to use trojanized Android apps to install an APT normally utilizing social media, phishing and sometimes physical access to compromise a targeted system. The malware employed by Dark Caracal ranges from a custom-developed mobile spy tool called Pallas along with the more commonly used found FinFisher, Bandook RAT and other tools that are bought or rented off the Dark Web.\n\nA standard Dark Caracal attack starts with a lure placed on a Facebook group and WhatsApp messages. These normally included political messages or links to Facebook groups that Dark Caracal believes would interest the victim. Successful WhatsApp phishing attacks then lead the victim to a watering hole server, while those hooked via Facebook were sent to a specially constructed malicious website using a fake Google, Facebook or Twitter domain. In some cases the Facebook targets would go to the watering hole server.\n\nNo matter which server the victims landed on the target would be served a series of trojanized Android Apps, which after installation would begin communicating with a command and control server found at adobeair[.] net. \n\nThe EFF and Lookout's investigation was able to identify four \u201cpersonas\u201d, two phone numbers and two domains associated with Dark Caracal, all of which are somehow connected to the email address op13@mail[.]com. \n\n\u201cAliases associated with op13@mail[.]com include Nancy Razzouk, Hadi Mazeh, and Rami Jabbour.

This server also had an additional 33GB of information harvested through Windows campaigns.\n\nThe countries hit included the United States, China, France, India, South Korea and several Middle Eastern nations.\n\nThe type of data exfiltrated is almost as diverse as the victimized countries. In its Androd campaigns the report noted that Dark Caracal was interested in SMS text messages were particularly popular and included the users two-factor authentication and one-time password pins, (some still valid) receipts and airline reservations, and company communications.

A fourth email targeted college students belonging to the organization Friends of MOFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), using content taken from a blog operated by the actual organization.\n\nThe emails contained malicious attachments created in the format for Korean word processor Hangul documents. Embedded PostScripts in these opened documents would trigger an exploit for CVE-2017-8291, an Artifex Ghostscript vulnerability that ultimately allowed attackers to infect user machines with a malicious DLL payload designed to collect device information and exfiltrate files. Further analysis revealed that this malware shares significant chunks of code with Destover, a Lazarus-linked information stealer that was used in an early WannaCry ransomware attack that took place prior to the global May 2017 attack.\n\nBlog post authors and Recorded Future researchers\u00a0Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade and Priscilla Moriuchi also noted that code in the malicious PostScripts contained some transliterated Chinese words, one of which was misused -- leading analysts to theorize these additions may have been intended as false flags to cast suspicions on China.\n\n\"This late 2017 campaign is a continuation of North Korea's interest in cryptocurrency, which we now know encompasses a broad range of activities including mining, ransomware, and outright theft,\" the blog post states. \"Outside of the May WannaCry attack, the majority of North Korean cryptocurrency operations have targeted South Korean users and exchanges, but we expect this trend to change in 2018. We assess that as South Korea responds to these attempted thefts by increasing security (and\u00a0possibly banning cryptocurrency trading) they will become harder targets, forcing North Korean actors to look to exchanges and users in other countries as well.\"\n\nRecorded Future's report serves as further proof that cryptocurrency platforms, exchanges and users remain alluring targets for cybercriminals and adversarial nation-states. (Of course, this trend certainly bears watching, following a rough two days for Bitcoin, which lost more than 50 percent of its peak market value over Jan. 16 and 17, dipping below the $10,000 mark.)\n\nEarlier this month, for example, Morphus Labs'\u00a0Chief Research Officer Renato Marinho, and\u00a0Johannes B. Ullrich, dean of Research at the\u00a0SANS Technology Institute, reported on a January 2018 campaign that was secretly deploying XMRig, a legitimate Monero cryptominer, in victims' machines via Oracle's\u00a0WebLogic application servers.\n\nThe unattributed attackers accomplished this feat by exploiting\u00a0CVE 2017-10271,\u00a0a remote code execution vulnerability found in the servers' WLS Security component. (Oracle issued a patch for the bug late last year, but server owners who failed to implement it remain vulnerable.)\n\nUllrich reported that the exploit appears to be a script released last December by a Chinese security researcher, while Marinho remarked that it's \"pretty simple to execute and comes with a Bash script to make it easy to scan for potential victims.\"\n\nMaking matters worse, Oracle's PeopleSoft HR software, which can use WebLogic as a web server, was also found to be vulnerable and, in some cases, was exploited. \"As you can probably imagine, a compromise of a PeopleSoft system is pretty much a worst-case compromise for an organization,\" Ullrich summarized in his write-up.\n\nFurthermore, Onapsis\u00a0reported\u00a0on Jan. 17 that its researchers confirmed that the Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS), which typically stores\u00a0business, sales, and financial data,\u00a0can also be compromised by the exploit.\n\nBased on additional research, Ullrich stated that the attacker successfully mined 611 Monero coins, which as of Jan. 17 equates to roughly $188,000 (it was $226,070 at the time of Ullrich's writing).\n\nAs for the victims, \"Based on a quick reverse DNS lookup and an ASN lookup, I found a high concentration of affected IPs at cloud providers,\" Ullrich reported. \"This isn't a surprise, since many organizations are moving their most critical data to the cloud to make it easier for the bad guys to get to it. Also, not a big surprise is the relatively high percentage of IPs in Oracle's cloud.\"\n\nIn related news, Radware\u00a0has asserted in its just released 2017-18 Global Application & Network Security Report\u00a0that the soaring value of cryptocoins (this most recent downtrend notwithstanding) is inviting increased malicious activity, including ransomware and stolen-content-for-ransom attacks against organizations, as well as distributed denial of service attacks against cryptocurrency platforms.\n\n\u201cThe rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies and their subsequent rise in price has presented hackers with a clear upside that goes beyond cryptocurrencies' anonymity,\u201d said Carl Herberger, VP of security solutions at Radware, in a press release.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apparent-korean-actor-group123-linked-to-six-phishing-campaigns-including-evil-new-year-scam/article/737293/", "title": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 16, 2018", "body": "Researchers have attributed six separate phishing campaigns targeting South Koreans in either 2017 or 2018 to a single threat actor called \"Group123,\" including multiple operations designed to infect victims with the remote administration tool ROKRAT.\n\nThe six campaigns -- Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are You Happy?, FreeMilk, North Korea Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018 -- have been linked through shared code and tactics, according to researchers with Cisco Systems' Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group.\n\nCommonalities include not just ROKRAT, but also the use of Korean Hangul Word Processor (HWP) documents, similar Program DataBase patterns and reconnaissance codes, and the presence of a browser stealer in certain payloads. Also, many of the campaigns have used email lures that reference the longstanding North Korea-South Korea reunification movement.\n\nDue to the phishing emails' use of Hangul -- a product of\u00a0South Korean\u00a0company\u00a0Hancom Inc. -- and their strong command of the Korean language, Talos believes it is likely that \"the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula\" and that\u00a0\"we are dealing with a new Korean actor.\" However, while state-sponsored North Korea hackers have a history of launching attacks on South Korea, Talos does not outright state if the threat specifically comes from the north.\n\nThe most recent campaign, Evil New Year 2018, is essentially a reboot of the threat actor's original Evil New Year operation that ran from November 2016 through January 2017, explains Talos in a Jan. 16 blog post authored by researchers Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres (with contributions from Jungsoo An).\n\nThe newer campaign, which launched on Jan. 2, 2018, lures victims in with a malicious HWP decoy document, supposedly written by South Korea's Ministry of Reunification. The doc\u00a0claims to offer an analysis of a New Year's speech made by the leader of North Korea (presumably Kim Jong-un, although Talos doesn't specifically name him in its analysis).\n\nThe document exploits a vulnerability in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format in order to download and execute shellcode hidden in a fake image on a previously compromised website. In this case, the shellcode downloads and decodes a fileless variant of ROKRAT from memory as the final payload. Much like the ROKRAT samples distributed in previous Group123 campaigns, this variant leverages cloud providers, including Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox, and Box, to exfiltrate documents and communicate with the attackers.\n\nAccording to Talos, the 2017 Evil New Year campaign similarly involved spear phishing emails that appeared to come from the\u00a0Korean Ministry of Unification and used malicious\u00a0Hangul attachments to drop ROKRAT. \"The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in. This would have been particularly true for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target of choice,\" the Talos blog post states.\n\nThe malicious documents in the earlier campaign featured two links that opened up additional decoy documents containing malicious OLE objects used to drop binaries, which\u00a0 in turn injected shellcode that unpacked and executed reconnaissance malware designed to communicate with the C&C server.\n\nThe Talos report detailed four additional phishing campaigns from Group123:\n\nGolden Time, August 2016 - March 2017: This campaign infected targets with ROKRAT via spear phishing emails that lauded recipients for joining a panel at a phony Korean reunification conference. Other phishing emails purported to be a help request from a resident of the South Korean city Munchon.\n\nAre You Happy?, March 2017: This campaign dropped a ROKRAT module called named ERSP.enc that acts as a disk wiper, capable of\u00a0opening an infected system's drive and writing data to the Master Boot Record. After the malware reboots the affected machine, the MBR displays a string that reads \"Are you Happy?\"\n\nFreeMilk, May 2017: Because this campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, the attackers used Microsoft Office documents instead of HWP docs. \"The attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 [a flaw in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface]\u00a0in order to download and execute a malicious HTA document inside of Microsoft Office,\" Talos explains. This scheme resulted in two payloads: The first, PoohMilk, creates persistence and checks specific files on an infected machines, paving the way for the second malware, Freenki, which collects information on the infected system and can download a third executable.\n\nNorth Korean Human Rights, November 2017: This campaign served another version of ROKRAT, via a malicious HWP document authored by a representative from the Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reunification Of Korean Peninsula. Purportedly, \"the main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items related to \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and \"Enactment of a Law,\" which was passed in 2016 in South Korea. Of course, the document's true purpose was to infect unwitting victims.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "North Carolina introduces data breach legislation, after ", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/north-carolina-introduces-data-breach-legislation-after-incidents-rise-in-2017/article/735761/", "title": "North Carolina introduces data breach legislation, after incidents rise in 2017", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 09, 2018", "body": "More than 5.3 million residents of North Carolina were victims of data breaches in 2017 \u2013 an escalating trend that has prompted state Attorney General Josh Stein (D) and state Rep. Jason Saine (R) to introduce newly proposed legislation to prevent further incidents and protect the public.\n\nUnveiled on Jan. 8, the bipartisan \"Act to Strengthen Identity Theft Protections\u201d updates the state's definition of a data breach, expanding the scope to include ransomware attacks. It also requires that affected companies report any such incident to\u00a0the public and the AG's office within 15 days.\n\nAdditionally, the bill also requires businesses that own or license consumers' personal information to execute reasonable security procedures and practices to protect said data, including medical records and insurance account numbers.\n\nIf a company fails to uphold its responsibilities, it will be considered a violation of the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. According to a fact sheet detailing the proposed legislation, \u201ceach person affected by the breach represents a separate and distinct violation of the law.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the proposed act allows consumers to easily freeze their credit, access free credit reports, and view information collected on them by consumer reporting agencies. If one of these agencies is breached, like Equifax infamously was in 2017, that service would have to offer five years of free credit monitoring to impacted consumers.\n\nThe legislation also states that companies looking to obtain a consumer's credit report or score would first need the consumer's permission.\n\nThe bill's announcement came as the state released its annual report on data breaches reported to the state AG's office. According to the document,\u00a0there were 1,022 reported breaches in 2017 \u2013 a 15 percent increase over 2016. Of that amount, just over half were caused by malicious hacking.\n\nPhishing scams were responsible for the second largest number of breaches, jumping dramatically from just 1.76 percent in 2015 to 24.27 percent in 2017.\n\nIn a press release, Stein said that the findings were \u201cstaggering and unacceptable,\u201d adding: \u201cNorth Carolina's laws on this issue are strong \u2013 but they need to be even stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more and more of our daily activities involve digital interactions, ensuring the safety of North Carolina's citizen's data is of critical importance,\u201d said Saine, also in the release. \u201cWhen there is a breach, we need to ensure that consumers are notified in a timely fashion and that they have the tools they need to protect their personal identity from bad actors.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/legislation/topic/47221/", "topic_name": "Legislation"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "2018 Winter Olympics being used as phishing attack bait", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/2018-winter-olympics-being-used-as-phishing-attack-bait/article/735639/", "title": "2018 Winter Olympics being used as phishing attack bait", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "January 08, 2018", "body": "The opening ceremony for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea are still a month away, but cybercriminals have already started using them as part of their social engineering plans in several phishing attacks aimed at groups involved with the games.\n\nThe attack centers around emails containing malicious Word documents, but a McAfee Advanced Threat Research report shows how much thought the threat actors are putting into the attack that if successful will give the attacker the ability to execute commands on the victim's computer. This includes the ability to install additional malware.\n\nThe first incident took place on December 22 with the last known coming in on December 28. The initial email was addressed to icehockey@pyeongchang2018[.]com with several other organizations that are playing some type of support or infrastructure role in the Olympics being blind CC'd.

Instead of selling the phishing kits for a price as a crimeware service, developers are now offering the kits for free to patrons of underground websites. Yet they still profit by surreptitiously employing exfiltration mechanisms that leverage the data phished by users of their product.\n\nThis allows more experienced cybercriminals who develop the phishing kits to \u201cdecrease their effort and risk, and increase their ROI, by harvesting the work of inexperienced criminals who deploy their kits,\u201d explains Lazar in a Jan. 4 Imperva blog post.\n\nThis strategy has become viable in part because the shelf lives of some phishing pages and servers are growing longer, due to the advent of techniques to used evade security measures. For instance, 17 percent of the 1,019 phishing kits observed by Imperva included a mechanism for blocking unwanted website visitors such as cyber researchers \u2013 making it appear like the website has already been taken down.\n\nAnd 13 percent featured blacklist evasion techniques that can \u201credirect each new victim to a newly generated random location,\u201d Lazar reports. \u201cThis approach allows phishers to hide the real link to the phishing kit from being blacklisted, and thus extend the lifespan of phishing pages and servers.\u201d\n\nThe phishing kits were uncovered and obtained for analysis using URLs listed via two sources: TechHelpList.com and OpenPhish. In a disclaimer of sorts, Imperva notes that the samples they collected may be skewed toward phishing kits typically used by amateur attackers, some of whom never remove their purchased kits from compromised servers, thus leaving them vulnerable to directory\u00a0traversal attacks and allowing researchers to download and analyze them.\n\nA clustering analysis also suggested that around half of the studied kits were created by a small community of experienced actors,\u00a0 with one third appearing to come from one of just three large families of kits. Further corroborating this theory: 51 percent of 271 author signatures extracted from the phishing kits were determined to be non-unique, meaning they were observed more than once.

Meanwhile, Korean and global news outlets have reported that South Korea's National Intelligence Service spy agency suspects that North Korea is responsible for hacking attacks on one of its country's cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nOn Friday, researchers from Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit reported that the Lazarus Group, an APT actor commonly linked to North Korea, commenced a spear phishing campaign on Oct. 25, using emails that falsely advertise an open CFO position at a European cryptocurrency company. In actuality, it appears the attackers\u00a0 copied a LinkedIn CFO job profile from a\u00a0 cryptocurrency company based in Asia and slightly tweaked it to create the phishing content. (Intezer released a similar report on Dec. 12.)\n\nThe emails used in this campaign, which is likely still ongoing, include a Word attachment containing malicious macros. The attackers attempt to socially engineer recipients into enabling these macros by asking the user to accept the Enable Editing and Enable Content functions. Doing so opens a decoy document, while secretly installing a first-stage remote access trojan capable of downloading additional malware.\n\nSecureWorks notes that elements in both the macros and the first-stage RAT, as well as components in the custom command-and-control protocol, share commonalities with former campaigns attributed to Lazarus.\n\nThe company also warns that this latest attack is part of an larger overall movement on North Korea's part to engage in malicious activities related to cryptocurrency.

After recognizing the extent of the problem, the IT team began disconnecting the county's various systems in order to protect them from being encrypted by the ransomware. This effectively knocked the entire county offline while it attempted to address the issue. The attack was enabled through a phishing attack when a county employee opened a malicious attachment which resulted in the ransomware being dropped.\n\nOnce paying the ransom was removed as an option, Gregg said the IT team implemented the county's prepared five phase cyber response plan. This included the force reset of all log-in credentials for county systems and user accounts and tightening the firewall rules.\u00a0\n\nOn December 6 the staff started rebuilding the county database using its back up files and brought in its various cybersecurity partners and law enforcement. At this stage a testing process was started that had each of the county's servers examined in a safe, offline environment to see if it was infected or if any files could be recovered.

Since all email headers must contain only ASCII characters, \u201cthe trick resides in using RFC-1342 (from 1992!), a recommendation that provides a way to encode non-ASCII chars inside email headers in such a way that it won't confuse the MTAs [Mail Transfer Agents] processing the email,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, most email clients and web interfaces don't properly sanitize the string after decoding, which leads to this email spoofing attack.\u201d\n\nBecause iOS is vulnerable to null-byte injection and macOS is vulnerable to \u201cemail(name)\u201d injection, Haddouche said, referring to a demo, the domain part of an original email can be hidden or removed, then replaced, by employing \u201ca combinations of control characters such as new lines or null-byte.\u201d\n\nThe exploits take advantage of the how the email sender name is displayed to bypass DMARC. \u201cThe server still validates properly the DKIM signature of the original domain and not the spoofed one,\u201d the researcher wrote. \u201cWhile MTAs not only don't detect and block these spoofed email addresses, they will happily relay those emails as long as the original email seems trustworthy enough (the attacker can therefore ironically profit from setting up DMARC on that email address).\u201d\n\nAs a result, Haddouche said, the spoofed emails are \u201cvirtually unstoppable.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhishing attacks are one of the most effective ways for bad actors to infiltrate and infect organizations,\u201d\u00a0said Bob Noel, director of strategic relationships and marketing at Plixer.\u00a0MailSploit\u00a0is the latest example of how users can be tricked into opening emails with malicious payloads and links. End users must be trained to no longer implicitly trust emails they receive from either known or unknown senders. Given the continued high rate of phishing success, IT departments should implement Network Traffic Analytics platforms to monitor all network traffic and have access to forensic data when users fall victim to phishing attacks. This visibility enables organizations to understand what happened, return to normal, and protect themselves against the spread of malware like ransomware.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect example of how phishing campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted,\u201d said Eyal Benishti, CEO and founder of IRONSCALES. \u201cAs is the case here, fraudsters are frequently adopting spoofing and impersonation techniques in a quick, easy, and incredibly successful way to lure their potential victims into a false sense of security.

In the case of password cracking, someone didn't just type in the correct password out of the blue. They were scanning and trying different combinations. That is unless it was an inside job or they had inside help. If they do get past that there should be other behavioral activity that would show up and thus caught.

The victims are falsely informed via the malicious mobile web page that they do not have their bank's security app installed on their phones, and must download it in order to comply with\u00a0new European Union money laundering guidelines as well as to encrypt sensitive data such as mTan SMS and online banking connections.\n\nIn the case of a fake BankAustria security app used in a Nov. 2 campaign, Proofpoint found that 7 percent of visitors were socially engineered into downloading this so-called \"application,\" which is actually the Marcher banking trojan.\n\nProofpoint further warns that the faux security application asks for a wide range of suspicious permissions that would elevate Marcher's privileges and give it increased control over the infected device. Chief among these is the request to act as\u00a0device administrator.\n\nLater, when the victim opens up a specific banking app, Marcher attacks in its usual manner, by overriding the app's true screen with a fake overlay that imitates the bank and steals the user's credentials information as it's being entered.\n\nIt might seem redundant for the cybercriminals to employ Marcher in this manner if the initial phishing attack already captured the victim's credentials in phase one of the attack. But not so -- because unlike with phishing attacks, Marcher can repeatedly harvest victims' credentials even after they are changed, explained\u00a0Patrick Wheeler, director of threat intelligence at Proofpoint, in an email interview. Moreover, banking trojans like Marcher often target \"multiple banks and financial services, so even if victims turned over credentials for one bank, the trojan may be able to harvest credentials for others as they use their phones,\u201d Wheeler added.\n\nIn what constitutes a third method of attack, the Marcher trojan in this particular case also presented credit card phishing screens when users opened non-banking apps such as the Google Play Store.\n\n\"...As we use mobile devices to access the web and phishing templates extend to mobile environments, we should expect to see a greater variety of integrated threats like the scheme we detail here,\" Proofpoint reports in the blog post. \"As on the desktop, mobile users need to be wary of installing applications from outside of legitimate app stores and sources and be on the lookout for bogus banking sites that ask for more information than users would normally provide on legitimate sites. Unusual domains, the use of URL shorteners, and solicitations that do not come from verifiable sources are also red flags for potential phishing and malware.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Russian hackers altered Clinton campaign email, part of broader initiative", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/russian-hackers-altered-clinton-campaign-email-part-of-broader-initiative/article/705489/", "title": "Russian hackers altered Clinton campaign email, part of broader initiative  ", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "November 06, 2017", "body": "", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "QtBot downloader discovered in geo-based Locky-Trickbot campaign", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/qtbot-downloader-discovered-in-geo-based-locky-trickbot-campaign/article/705032/", "title": "QtBot downloader discovered in geo-based Locky-Trickbot campaign", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "November 02, 2017", "body": "Researchers from Palo Alto Networks have uncovered a new piece of the puzzle in the case of an ongoing series of malspam campaigns that distribute either\u00a0Locky ransomware or the Trickbot banking trojan, depending on the victim's geographical location.\n\nThis latest discovery comes in the form of QtBot, an intermediate-stage downloader that helps to deliver the final payload, according to a Wednesday blog post from Palo Alto's Unit 42 threat intelligence team. Since Oct. 19, the researchers\u00a0observed more than 4 million \"unique sessions\" with QtBot activity, the report states.\n\nMalspam recipients unknowingly download QtBot upon opening malicious Microsoft Office email attachments that are designed to abuse\u00a0Microsoft Windows' Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. This same DDE technique was also observed in a recent spear phishing campaign impersonating the\u00a0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in order to infect victims with\u00a0DNSMessenger\u00a0malware.\n\nQtBot in this instance is being used as a replacement for malicious VBScripts that had been used in previous Locky-Trickbot distribution campaigns to query websites that provide geo-IP services in order to pinpoint the geographic region of a particular target, thereby determining the final payload.\n\nPalo Alto has likened QtBot to the\u00a0Andromeda\u00a0loader and bot, identifying it as a likely offshoot. Researchers note that both downloader threats exhibit similar\u00a0anti-analysis behaviors; analyze potential hosts' keyboard language identifiers to avoid infecting machines in former Soviet countries; and use Microsoft's Windows Installer program msiexec.exe for code execution.\n\nBlog post authors Brandon Levene,\u00a0Brandon Young\u00a0and\u00a0Dominik Reichel further describe QtBot as \"a Windows executable file that decrypts an importless stub into memory. This payload is later injected into msiexec.exe using common techniques. The payload then decrypts the second stage shellcode and injects it into a newly spawned svchost.exe process. This svchost.exe acts as the handler for the final payload.\"\n\nThe phishing emails serving up QtBot are spawned by the Necurs botnet, and generally trick recipients with generic subject-line lures that suggest the delivery of a financial document or file transfer. After opening a malicious document, users are prompted to click through three dialogue boxes, triggering an HTTP GET request to the command-and-control server, which Unit 42 researchers believe is likely a compromised webhost running a vulnerable version of [the commercial\u00a0web hosting\u00a0platform] PLESK.\" This C&C server then downloads QtBot, which is executed via a PowerShell directive.\n\n\"While geographic location specific malware delivery is not a new phenomenon, the combination of two previously disparate malware family affiliates utilizing unified malspam campaigns and droppers is an interesting shift in tactics,\" concludes the Unit 42 blog post. \"QtBot protects itself and the decision tree by which targeting is established and offers a significantly more robust anti-analysis package to stymie analysts.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Land of the rising trojan: Ursnif banking malware surges in Japan", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/land-of-the-rising-trojan-ursnif-banking-malware-surges-in-japan/article/703312/", "title": "Land of the rising trojan: Ursnif banking malware surges in Japan", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "October 27, 2017", "body": "Malspam campaigns designed to spread the Ursnif banking trojan have been heavily targeting Japanese banks and payment card providers in 2017, especially since September, according to IBM's X-Force research team.\n\nThis attacks has been leveraging Ursnif, also known as\u00a0Gozi, to steal data from secure sessions, perform web injections and execute page redirections, reports Limor Kessem, IBM cybersecurity expert, in a company blog post on Thursday.

This gives attackers the perfect vector to infiltrate into an organization's Office 365 environment,\u201d Sarukkai said.\n\nThis means systems accounts need to be treated like any other corporate account and should be equipped with the proper security and needs to be monitored.\n\nThe attack takes advantage of poorly protected accounts by using its botnet to ping a single account four or five times to try and guess the password. If the password is not discovered it moves on to another account, by doing so it keeps a low profile. Another tactic used to stay under the radar is to only hit one organization at a time. Sarukkai noted that as one attack ramps up another dissipates.\n\nOnce an account has been hacked the malware obtains data from its email inbox, creating a new rule that hides and diverts incoming messages and it then launches an organization-wide phishing attack to spread the malware across the network.\n\nSarukkai gave one example of how dangerous a successful KnockKnock could be to a company. \n\n\u201cIf a hacker gains entry into an Office 365's Exchange Online system account that's used as the username for Salesforce.com, which is in turn used as a Marketo Sync User to integrate Salesforce.com to the organization's marketing automation cloud, then an entry into the Exchange Online system account could also give the hacker access to the entire CRM and marketing automation systems of the organization, putting the enterprise's most valuable data at risk of unauthorized exposure or loss,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first KnockKnock attacks happened in May 2017 and are continuing.\n\n\u201cThe attacks originate from a small networks of 89 confirmed IPs distributed across 83 networks,\u201d he said, adding most of the IPs are registered in China, but some are from the U.S., Russia, Brazil and Argentina.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/botnet/topic/47256/", "topic_name": "Botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud-security/topic/49913/", "topic_name": "Cloud Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Google introduces Advanced Protection cybersecurity program", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/google-introduces-advanced-protection-cybersecurity-program/article/701187/", "title": "Google introduces Advanced Protection cybersecurity program", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 18, 2017", "body": "Google is rolling out a new three-layered cybersecurity plan designed to give extra protection to those most in need.\n\nGoogle Advanced Protection has been in beta for several weeks and is now available to those using personal Google accounts.

However, what it truly contains two JavaScript files called jarallax.min.js and bootstrap-filestyle.min.js. The first step has this remote script http://fbcdnxy.net/coobgpohoikkiipiblmjeljniedjpjpf/remote-postal-code.json, which is executed when Chrome is opened.\n\n\u201cFirst, the extension will connect to Facebook. While I did not see it do anything other than connect, there is quite a lot of code dedicated to Facebook, which could be for spreading the extension via Facebook Messenger,\u201d Abrams wrote. \n\nThe next step is downloading Coinhive which immediately goes to work digging up Monero, but this activity also generates the first sign for the victim that something is amiss with their system. Primarily, seeing the computer's CPU usage spiking as it begins the mining process, Abrams told SC Media.\n\nThe malware's other malicious actions are also noticeable. In order to register the new domains using the victim's name the malware uses the associated Gmail address. Luckily, it can only grab this if the user has it open and running in the background, otherwise this aspect of the attack does not take place. But if Ldi is successful in getting into Gmail and creating the domains the victim will see a registration email from Freenom, a domain service. \n\n\u201cAnother symptom would be receiving an email asking you to verify your email address from Freenom. While the extension automatically clicks on this link in the email, it does not delete the email so a victim will see it in their inbox. All the rest is done behind the scenes without the user even knowing,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nFor an unknown reason only four domains are created and registered.\n\n\u00a0Abrams was not certain what these domains are used for, but speculated it could be to spread additional malware in the future.\n\nLdi was quickly spotted and removed, Abrams said, but using a malicious extension to spread malware is a tried and true method that has suckered in many thousands of victims. \n\nThe good news is once the extension is spotted and removed Coinhive stops operating and the attacker loses access to the person's Gmail and Facebook accounts. \n\n\u201cOnce the extension is removed, everything goes back to normal, except you still have these domains registered under your email being used for who knows what.

Previous phishing campaigns delivered the malware as a final payload following a series of PowerShell commands. According to researchers\u00a0from Cisco Talos, the SEC phishing operation employed a similar infection chain, with the added twist of leveraging DDE for code execution, as opposed to more commonly used macros or OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects.\n\nDDE is a protocol used for interprocess communications, such as the transferring of data between applications. Earlier this year, researchers at SensePost determined that DDE could be essentially exploited to execute malicious code in Microsoft Word.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation reportedly chose not to act on the findings, calling this functionality an intentional feature. However, SensePost noted in a blog post that Microsoft said it\u00a0would consider reclassifying the feature as a bug in the next version of Windows. In the meantime, however, \"We are now seeing it actively being used by attackers in the wild, as demonstrated in this attack,\" Talos reported in a blog post authored by researchers Edmund Brunaghin and Colin Grady, with contributions from Dave Maynor and @Simpo13.\n\nAsked for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson offered the following statement: \u201cThis technique requires a user to disable Protected Mode and click through one or more additional\u00a0prompts. We encourage customers to use caution when opening suspicious email attachments.\u201d\n\nCraig Williams, senior threat researcher and global outreach manager at Talos, told SC Media that Cisco's threat intelligence team first observed the SEC phishing campaign on October 10. In its report, Talos does not elaborate on which companies were specifically targeted by the phishing operation, other than to note that the intended victims were similar to those targeted in prior DNSMessenger campaigns. But Williams informed SC Media that the targets included insurance, finance, and IT companies.\n\nIn this latest attack, the phishers distributed emails that were spoofed to look like they came from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, a platform that corporations use to file their financial reports. The malicious Word document attached to these emails contained logos and branding that contributed to the illusion that the SEC was the sender.\n\nOpening the attachment would trigger a notification indicating that the document contains links to external files, and asking the user for permission to import and display this content. Agreeing to do so triggered the infection, as the document would use the Windows DDE protocol to retrieve malicious code from a compromised government website owned by the state of Louisiana.\n\nThe downloaded code, executed via Powershell, would then commerce the complex infection chain, at which time key blocks of code are decoded and deobfuscated, and the malware studies the infected system to determine how best to achieve persistence, based characteristics such as the user's privilege level. The malware then sets up the DNS-based C&C infrastructure, including defining a\u00a0list of domains that will be used for communications, before presumably executing the final payload. (Talos is crediting another researcher\u00a0known as Wraith Hacker with documenting the final stage of this infection chain.)\n\n\"This attack shows the level of sophistication that is associated with threats facing organizations today,\" Talos notes in its blog post. \"The use of DNS as a conveyance for later stage code and C2 communications is also becoming more and more commonplace.\"\n\nUnrelated to this phishing campaign, the SEC's EDGAR platform was also recently breached by hackers who accessed various companies' documents and used the information gleaned to profit from insider trading.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "North Korea spearphishing campaign aimed at U.S. power grid", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/north-korea-spearphishing-campaign-aimed-at-us-power-grid/article/699599/", "title": "North Korea spearphishing campaign aimed at U.S. power grid", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "October 11, 2017", "body": "Cyberattackers linked to the North Korean government were likely behind a spearphishing email campaign against U.S. electric companies that was detected and thwarted by FireEye.\n\n\u201cThis activity was early-stage reconnaissance, and not necessarily indicative of an imminent, disruptive cyberattack that might take months to prepare if it went undetected,\u201d FireEye said in a blog post that explained the company \u201cpreviously detected groups we suspect are affiliated with the North Korean government compromising electric utilities in South Korea, but these compromises did not lead to a disruption of the power supply.\u201d\n\nBlake Darche', Co-founder & CSO, Area 1 Security, said that since \u201cenergy companies are a major target for phishing attacks...it isn't surprising to see\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u00a0preparing for a cyber war against the United States should any escalations occur on the\u00a0Korean\u00a0Peninsula.\u201d\n\nNoting that nation-states will often attempt to \u201cgather intelligence and prepare for contingencies\u201d by conducing cyberespionage operations, FireEye said that \u201cthe few examples of disruptions to energy sector operations being caused by cyber operations required additional technical and operational steps that these North Korean actors do not appear to have taken nor have shown the ability to take.\u201d\n\nResearchers have not discovered \u201csuspected North Korean actors using any tool or method specifically designed to compromise or manipulate the industrial control systems (ICS) networks that regulate the supply of power,\u201d the blog said. \u201cFurthermore, we have not uncovered evidence that North Korean linked actors have access to any such capability at this time.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/governmentdefense/section/7675/", "topic_name": "Government/Defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Former Congressional IT pro Awan wiped phone before FBI arrest", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/former-congressional-it-pro-awan-wiped-phone-before-fbi-arrest/article/699278/", "title": "Former Congressional IT pro Awan wiped phone before FBI arrest", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "October 10, 2017", "body": "An IT specialist formerly employed by Rep.

Even more\u00a0recent OurMine shenanigans include defacing WikiLeaks' home page, hacking Real Madrid's Twitter accounts, and hacking HBO's Facebook and Twitter accounts.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/social-media/topic/47245/", "topic_name": "Social Media"}]}, {"news_name": "LinkedIn Premium accounts being used in phishing scam", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/linkedin-premium-accounts-being-used-in-phishing-scam/article/688591/", "title": "LinkedIn Premium accounts being used in phishing scam", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 13, 2017", "body": "LinkedIn and Wells Fargo have found themselves once again at the center of a cyber issue, but this time hackers are using the business-oriented social media site to send phishing InMails posing as a Wells Fargo document.\n\nMalwarebytes Senior Researcher Jerome Segura wrote in a blog that the current crop of phishing attacks use previously hacked LinkedIn Premium accounts as a starting point. These accounts are used because they can send InMails not only to their connections, but also to other LinkedIn members. \n\nLike most phishing scams, the initial contact appears innocuous. Segurua said the target receives an InMail stating:\n\nView shared document http://ow.ly/[]\n\nThe shortened URL, a well-known dodge used to spread a malicious link, leads to a phishing site where those using Gmail and the other common email providers are asked to login in using their credentials. This leads to their username, password and phone number being stolen, however, to keep the victim from being suspicious about this activity a fake document, purportedly from Wells Fargo wealth management, is included apparently to act as the document mentioned in the original InMail.\n\nSegura said an unknown number of Premium accounts must have been previously hacked in order for the hackers to begin their crime spree. But once inside even a few accounts the malicious actor can quickly spread out. Malwarebytes offered an example of one phishing email that was sent by a person with 500 connections plus access to everyone else on LinkedIn. \n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cThis kind of attack via social media is not new \u2013 we have seen hacked Skype or Facebook accounts send spam \u2013 but it reminds us of how much more difficult it is to block malicious activity when it comes from long standing and trusted user accounts, not to mention work acquaintances or relatives. This also makes such attacks more credible to potential victims and can lead to a snowball effect when victims become purveyors of phishing links themselves,\u201d Segura wrote.\n\nSpotting a fake InMail is no simple exercise. The criminals manage to spoof the security footer message that is tacked on to each InMail, although LinkedIn does point out that this method is not foolproof.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the delivery method is to be trusted, but the content may not. The same can be said for phishing pages that use HTTPS \u2013 which is the case here \u2013 making content delivery secure but the content itself fraudulent,\u201d Segura said. \u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/social-media/topic/47245/", "topic_name": "Social Media"}]}, {"news_name": "Return of the EMOTET Trojan, spreads via spambots", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/emotet-trojan-returns-with-new-variants-and-targets/article/687619/", "title": "Return of the EMOTET Trojan, spreads via spambots", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "September 08, 2017", "body": "The EMOTET trojan is back, this time spreading via Spam bots.\n\nTrend Micro researchers first spotted the banking malware using network sniffing to steal data back in 2014 and recently spotted an increase in activity in August 2017 coming from new variants that all had the potential to unleash different types of payloads, according to a Sept. 7 blog post.\n\nThe latest versions were spotted TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJLA, TSPY_EMOTET.SMD3, TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJKW, and TSPY_EMOTET.AUSJKV and each had the potential to drop different malicious payloads. Researchers attributed the malware's resurfacing to two main possible reasons first, the authors behind the attacks may be targeting new regions and because and second, because the new variants are using multiple ways to spread.\n\nEarlier EMOTET variants primarily targeted the banking sector while newer variants have been spotted targeted various industries including manufacturing, food and beverage, and healthcare. The newer variants are also spreading primarily through spam botnets as well as via a network propagation module that brute forces its way into an account domain using a dictionary attack. Some variants also use compromised URLs as C&C servers likely helped it spread as well.\n\nThe bulk of infections are in the U.S. which account for 58 percent of all detected infections, while Great Britain and Canada were at 12 percent and 8 percent respectively.\n\nThe new EMOTET variants often are sent via phishing emails claiming to be an invoice or payment notification with the body of the email containing a malicious URL. Clicking the link will download a document containing malicious macros designed to execute a PowerShell command line responsible for downloading the trojan. \n\n\u201cThe malware will attempt to ease its entry into the system by deleting the Zone Identifier Alternate Data Stream (ADS), which is a string of information that describes the Internet Explorer Trust Settings of the file's download source,\u201d researchers said in the post. \u201cThis is one way for the system to find out if a downloaded file is from a high-risk source, blocking the download if it is detected as such.\u201d\n\nThe trojan will then register itself as a system service and add registry entries to ensure that it is automatically executed at every system startup, the post said.\n\nIn addition to the malicious payload, the trojan's command and control server is also responsible for sending modules that will perform spamming module routines, network worm module routines mail password viewer routines, and web browser password viewer routines. \n\nTo address these issues, researchers recommend the use of multilayered and proactive approach to security as well as endpoint solutions.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Where Equifax falls among the top recent data breaches", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/where-equifax-falls-among-the-top-recent-data-breaches/article/687611/", "title": "Where Equifax falls among the top recent data breaches", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 08, 2017", "body": "Equifax's data breach exposing 143 million customer records is certainly a massive number, but it only falls more or less in the middle of the pack when it comes to some of the larger breaches experienced over the last several years. \n\nHowever, the numbers do not tell the entire story.

In addition, a South Korean bitcoin exchange was hit, possibly by North Korean hackers. \n\nBitcoin is currently valued at about $4,500 while Ethereum is at $382, but so far this year the former's value has increased more than 380 percent and the latter's is up 4,000 percent making each a worthwhile target. The fact that these funds can be harvested digitally has always made them a target for attack, or mining, but the higher their value the more interest will be garnered.\n\n\u201cMalware has existed since at least 2011 that harvest's bitcoin wallets.\u00a0 Crypto-currency is becoming more mainstream.\u00a0 Ransomware has certainly bought it to the fore and now the public are aware of it, thus more people use it, there is more money contained within those systems and cybercriminals follow the money.\u00a0 They see it as a good ROI for them,\u201d Carl Leonard, principal security analyst at Forcepoint, told SC Media.\n\nPaul Bischoff, privacy advocate for Comparitech.com, said the scam his company found also has been going on for years, but he believes the uptick in cryptocurrency value will spur more illegal activity. \n\n\"This particular scam has been in place since 2015, so I don't think it had much to do with the rising valuations of Bitcoin and Ethereum. More broadly speaking, however, cryptocurrencies have never been more popular. That fact combined with their rising value does make them an increasingly lucrative target for cyber criminals. As long as those two trends continue, I don't see any reason for thieves to back off,\u201d he told SC Media.\n\nLeonard agreed, adding that he believes cyber bank robbers will start adapting different types of malware to go after cryptocurrencies.\n\nPart of that can be seen with what has taken place with Trickbot.\n\nTrickbot, which is used against large financial institutions to steal conventional currency, has been updated by a user to include the cryptocurrency exchange coinbase.com as a target to go along with the 130 or so bank already on its list. Adding a new institution is not unusual, in June Paypal was added, but now the trojan has the ability to place non-traditional currencies at risk, said Forcepoint analyst Roland Dela Paz.\n\nDespite the new capability, the attack scenario remains the same with the victim receiving an email purportedly from a major financial institution in which the person is told to download what turns out to be a malicious attachment containing Trickbot. Forcepoint has so far captured 8,600 emails from the UK, France and Canada using this scheme.\n\nThe scheme uncovered by Comparitech.com is much more complicated and specifically targets current bitcoin users, specifically those interested in what is termed bitcoin mixing. This is the practice of taking money from one bitcoin account and breaking it into hundreds of smaller transactions so that it can be transferred to another account anonymously. In this case the bad guys have hidden links within apparently legitimate article that pose as tutorials on how to conduct a bitcoin mixing transaction and includes links to two bitcoin mixing services, but these in fact lead to phishing sites that simply steal the person's cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat makes this operation so successful is the \u201carticles\u201d appear at the top of any Google search for bitcoin mixing so they are the most likely to be grabbed and used by a beginner cryptocurrency user.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Spambot weaponizes 711M accounts to spread Ursnif malware", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/researcher-spots-massive-spambot-made-of-711m-compromised-accounts/article/685423/", "title": "Spambot weaponizes 711M accounts to spread Ursnif malware", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "August 30, 2017", "body": "A Paris-based security researcher, by the pseudonym Benkow spotted a massive spambot, dubbed Onliner, weaponizing 711 million email and server accounts to distribute phishing emails laced with malware looking to steal user data.\n\nBenkow discovered the spambot on an open and accessible web server hosted in the Netherlands, that was being used to store dozens of text files containing the email addresses, passwords, and email servers used to send spam messages.\n\nThe spambot was collecting stolen email credentials and server login info stemming from previous data breaches, such\u00a0as the LinkedIn and Badoo hacks, as well also other unknown sources in order\u00a0to send the emails through \u201clegitimate servers\u201d in an attempt to circumvent spam filters, according to a ZDNet report.\n\nThe spambot used 80 million of the compromised email servers to send spam emails to the remaining 630 million targets emails to \u201cfingerprint\u201d potential victims to find ones that were using Windows computers to ultimately spread Ursnif malware, iPhone or Android users aren't affected by the malware.\n\nThe malware arrives as an attachment via malicious email which then drops component files onto infected systems and creates auto start registries to ensure automatic execution startup.
