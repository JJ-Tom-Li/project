[{"topics": ["Crowd Strike"], "title": "Notion of Cloud\u2019s Unmatched Security Shattered by \u2018Venom\u2019 vulnerability", "body": "The CrowStrike researchers discovered that any attacker can burst out of specific virtual machines and exploit whatever is running nearby \u2014 The most disturbing fact revealed is that a portion of cloud-hosted network may also be running on that same system. This revelation nullifies the claim that these vessels are extremely strong and protective.A critical security flaw has been discovered that allow attackers to access virtual machines freely.Jason Geffner and a team of researchers at CrowdStrike, an Irvine, California-based security firm, reported the detection of the zero-day vulnerability. Zero-day vulnerability means a previously identified computer bug has been identified within a common virtual machine medium.Virtual machines are actually computers that are simulated within computers and prevent the networks on these machines from impacting each other. Virtual machines are definitely an efficient method to manage massive computer resources at the same time keeping them secure and isolated.The bug has been named \u201cVenom\u201d which is an abbreviation of \u201cvirtualized environment neglected operations manipulation.\u201d Researchers state that this bug affects a technology called hypervisor. This basically controls and coordinates the system that is being controlled by virtual machines.Venom affects Quick Emulator/QEMU, which is a decades-old, open-source and free hypervisor. It is used in numerous common virtualization products such as KVM (or \u201ckernel-based virtual machine\u201d), Xen hypervisors, the native QEMU client and Oracle VM VirtualBox. On the other hand, the products that don\u2019t get affected are Microsoft Hyper-V and EMC-owned VMWare VMW -0.25%.According to Jason Geffner, CrowdStrike\u2019s senior security researcher who actually identified this flaw, \u201cthis destroys the isolation myth that you can have something run a virtual machine and have it be isolated from everything else. This bug lets you escape a container and get into all other containers. Even if you don\u2019t use these services directly, the chances are that accounts which store your personal data run these products.\u201dCrowdStrike assessed that Venom could put countless organizations and tens of thousands of users at risk.Geffner states: \u201cWith Venom, you\u2019re able to break out of a virtual machine on a system and get access to other data on that system\u2019s network\u201d and the attackers may exploit it to \u201cexecute whatever code they like\u201d simply by overwriting sensitive portions of a machine\u2019s memory.As a long-term remedy, Dan Kaminsky, White Ops security firm co-founder and researcher, suggests that users should tell their cloud service providers that they only will allow sharing of workflow with people within the company or the domain. It is important to isolate the hardware \u201cif you have this sort of bug that can jump from their little piece of a server to your little piece of a serve. The best way to avoid that is to not have anyone else on your server.\u201d He says that it definitely \u201ccosts more, but you\u2019re basically outbidding your attackersCrowdStrike, says Geffner, has alerted all the major software merchants that utilize this risky QEMU code and the team is working closely with them to resolve the issue.Geffner hopes and expects that \u201cthe good guys are able to patch their systems before the bad guys get access to it.\u201d", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "May 14, 2015"}, {"topics": ["WTSP"], "title": "Mother uses Pizza Hut online Order to inform police about hostage situation", "body": "A Florida based woman thwarted a dangerous hostage situation by using the delivery instructions section of an online pizza ordering service by sending plea for help.This has now been officially confirmed that a quick thinking woman and a Pizza order can save lives.Cheryl Treadway, a Florida woman, found herself and her three kids in a hostage situation by her boyfriend Ethan Nickerson on Monday.

Amongst such variations is AlphaCrypt\u2019s capacity to delete the file backup copies generated by Windows via the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).This routine guarantees that the encrypted files are incapable of recovery until the ransom fee is fully paid up by the user. As it is a known fact that payment options depend upon their similarity with the recent discovery of variants. Bitcoin through layered tor browsing is activated without using a monetary rule such as Ukash or money pak, this also enables the program authors to capitalize on their earning power and that too without losing their anonymity.Now they can carry out the procedure with ease to just take the full ransom amount and make it pass through a bitcoin mixer that will only use sophisticated algorithms to work it through millions of addresses and entirely \u2018clean\u2019 the money,\u201d free it from any virus as its mentioned by Webroot\u2019 Tyler Moffitt.\u201cPayment is similar to recent variants \u2013 bitcoin through layered tor browsing.

To avoid this risk, users are recommended to create backups for their files (at least for the most vital ones) and pile them in a safe place, which is either completely detached from the main computer or come with resilient access restrictions.", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "May 12, 2015"}, {"topics": ["CryptoWall", "Cyber Crime", "Encryption", "Malware", "Ransomware", "Scam", "security"], "title": "Seemingly Legit Resume actually contains Crypto-Malware", "body": "The malicious email, targeted at a company\u2019s resume screening department, is equipped with file encryption capabilities.A new ransomware having capabilities of file encryption is being flung at the company workers that perform resume screening for job seekers.

The easiest way to hack into such a system is to find the weakest link between them. Usually, the human link is always the weakest and therefore the easiest route to hack into any organization computer network.Consequently, modern day hackers have shifted from hacking the organization\u2019s systems as their primary target, to hacking the Human Operating System. Hacking an individual requires a different set of tools and a change of tactic from brute force to relying on social engineering tactics to manipulate the different human instincts to the hacker\u2019s advantage.Social engineering is use of soft non-technical skills to gain unauthorized access to private computer networks. Social engineers rely on human interactions to lure people into giving out crucial confidential information that would compromise their Internet security. Hackers use social engineering for varied reasons but the end game is always to defraud you financially by manipulating your human instinct to trust rather than using brute force to break into your system.Social engineering is not a new concept but rather old-age con games applied in a web perspective. The information sought by Social engineers may vary from passwords, bank information, System configuration details and so on. But regardless of the information sought, the objective is always to take control of your system and make a certain gain at the end.Social engineering takes different form and shapes. It could be as simple as someone calling you pretending to be your bank customer care agent and requesting your banking details. It could also be someone posing as a new employee who need log in assistance or your colleague stealing your login credentials through shoulder surfing.Regardless of the form and shape, the success of any social engineering attack largely depend on human weakness in critically analyzing every situation. In reality, internet security is all about knowing when and who to trust with your confidential information at any given time. Alertness and avoiding to take every situation at face value will take you a long way in preventing social Engineering Attacks.Social engineering attacks are propagated in different forms and through various attack vectors. It is a rapidly evolving art that keeps on being perfected every now and then. However, some of the most common social engineering pitfalls include the following.In most cases, the attacker using a hacked account sends you an email address claiming that your \u2018friend\u2019 is stuck in a foreign country after being mugged. They request money for a return ticket and promise to refund the money once they are back. Usually, the email has instruction on how to send the money to your \u2018stranded friend\u2019 abroad.Normally, online fraudster sends email posing as one of your trusted service provider. They request you to urgently update your account details or upgrade your current software through given links. Most phishing emails require you to do something urgently or risk some consequences. Clicking on the embedded links directs you to spoofed websites designed to steal your login credentials.Another common trick used by phishing masters is to send you an email claiming that you\u2019ve won a lottery or certain promotion goodies. You are required to give your banking details in order receive your lotter winning. In other cases the scammer pose as the FBI saying they have recovered your \u2018stolen money\u2019 and therefore requesting to send you bank details to get your money back.Another popular tactic is to undervalue hot product by giving one day 85% discount. Such schemes may appear in legitimate auction sites such as eBay which makes it easy for people to fall for the bait. Usually, the product on offer is non-existent and vendor could be using a hacked eBay account to obtain your banking details.Responding to the emails initiates an interaction with the criminal who may further request for more specific details about your system in order to help you out. In some cases the criminals may request you to log on to \u201ctheir company systems\u201d or simply request for root access to your system. Sometimes they may give you bogus command to run on your system. Such commands are only intended to give the attacker greater access to your computer system.Due to the soft nature of social engineering attacks, most victims don\u2019t know they\u2019ve been hacked and it may take months to identify a security breach. However, in case you suspect that you\u2019ve been a victim of social engineering, the first thing is to do a password workaround.Create new strong password for all your accounts. Ensure that your new password cannot be linked to you or your family because the attackers probably know way too much about you and your family. Secondly, contact your bank, and carefully review your financial statements. Lastly, consider reporting the incident to law enforcement agencies to avoid liability in cases of identity theft and impersonation in criminal activities.In conclusion, Social engineering attacks are old age con game that get better and smarter with time. Hacker will continually use them so long they continue to yield handsome returns year in year out. Preventing Social engineering attacks require knowing when and who to trust on the web. Critically analyze each and every situation before giving out any incriminating information. More importantly, avoid being greedy on the web.

The first changes the commands sent by the operator to the robot by deleting, delaying or re-ordering them. This causes the robot\u2019s movement to become jerky and difficult to control.The second type of attack modifies the intention of signals from the operator to the robot by changing, say, the distance an arm should move or the degree it should rotate and so on. Most of these attacks had a noticeable impact on the Raven immediately upon launch. \u201dImage via Shutterstock", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "April 28, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Android", "Google", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Smartphone", "Symantec"], "title": "Report reveals 1 in every 5 Android Apps is Malware", "body": "Symantec reveals that nearly 1 million or around one-third of all Android apps are actually malware.The firm that exposed around 700,000 virus-laden apps in 2013, is now claiming that \u201c17 percent of all Android apps (nearly one million total)\u201d are actually malware in disguise.According to its latest Internet Security Threat Report, more than one third of all Android apps were found to be what Symantec dubs as \u201cgrayware\u201d or \u201cmadware.\u201d Grayware or Madware means mobile software the primary purpose of which is to bombard your device with ads.Symantec also disclosed the first example of mobile-crypto ransomware for Android devices.

This vulnerability allows cybercriminals crash just about any iOS device that comes within a WiFi hotspot range. They acknowledged the fact that this happens regardless if you have deliberately connected or not. The vulnerability is caused by an iOS 8 bug, which manipulates SSL certificates that are sent to iOS devices via a network. These certificates are basically needed in every app but according to research team at RSA, the bug can facilitate crashing of any iOS device. Moreover, the team revealed that in worst scenario, it can even put the devices into a continuous boot-loop. Initially, the vulnerability seems harmless since it relies upon bad SSL certificates that are sent to you. If you don\u2019t connect to any random WiFi hotspot, you won\u2019t get into trouble. Trouble however arises when the SSL certificate flaw gets combined with an older exploit, which researchers have named WiFiGate. Thus, the team identified that iOS devices have been programmed by carriers in a way that these get automatically connected to specific networks. For instance, AT&T customers\u2019 iOS device will auto-connect to any network named \u201cattwifi.\u201d  Therefore, there is simply no way to avoid getting connected to random WiFi networks.  Resultantly, Skycure team was able to create a tainted Wi-Fi hotspot that any iOS device in the nearest vicinity could connect to and later crash and become useless. Since the device gets stuck in a constant boot-loop, it becomes very difficult to disable Wi-Fi and evade the attacker\u2019s network. In the presentation from the Skycure research team, it was pointed out that the vulnerability can render any iOS device useless in a specific location.

Svpeng managed to infect around 350,000 Google devices in 2014. Four other individuals who allegedly are running a cybercrime gang and appear to be fond of Nazi iconography have also been arrested.This particular campaign disturbed Russian police greatly as it robbed at least 50million rubles ($930,000) from innocent citizens and the country\u2019s largest bank Sberbank picked up on attacks in 2013 prior to becoming an ally in the investigation. However, in the US, UK and Europe, Android users were also attacked by Svpeng. In June 2014, Kapersky had warned that Svpeng is continuously diverting its focus from Russia and notified that around 91% of the attacks were launched against the English-speaking users primarily in the UK and US.This malware is undoubtedly the most sophisticated and effective type of money-stealing Android malware because it utilizes numerous techniques to obtain banking credentials. Initially, it was aimed at stealing funds from victims simply by showing a new window each time a target ran Google Play, requesting users to type credit card number again and again and this info was later transmitted to the hacker\u2019s servers. Later on, for targeting westerners, Svpeng spread FBI penalty notification letters across targeted screen while web browsing was being performed. The letters claimed that the user was caught surfing through illegal pornographic material and hackers demanded $200 in Green Dot\u2019s MoneyPak cards, which was a form of attack that now is known as ransomware. The attack would block all sort of access point to the device making it fully unusable, according to Forbes.For distribution of this malware, a fake link of Adobe Flash Player was sent via SMS texts. The link would allow downloading of the Trojan and scan for particular American banking apps such as those of Wells Fargo, Citi Amex, Chase and Bank of America but there is no proof about the purpose of the app after performing scanning.Although the suspects were arrested on March 24 but the news has been revealed on this weekend.

It lets user login credentials to be exposed from numerous Windows applications by deceiving the apps into authenticating data via a rogue server. Redirect to SMB also lets attackers execute a man-in-the-middle attack on any device of Windows and allows sending communications to a mischievous SMB server and this allows the creation of the username and encrypted password of the user. Moreover, hackers can decrypt the password to access a variety of other vulnerable applications.This vulnerability, says Cylance, is a \u201cforever-day\u201d phenomenon because the original bug has continued to remain a threat since 1997. Spangler\u2019s bug was just restricted to Internet Explorer whereas the Redirect to SMB affects a variety of other applications across all versions of Windows.So, what this means for Windows users? Let\u2019s imagine that a person is in a coffee shop surfing the web on a Windows laptop using unsecured, free public WiFi is actually exposing his device and credentials to hackers who on the other hand can easily launch a man-in-the-middle attack to access the device since it is easy to obtain user credentials from a number of applications. For instance, when iTunes is accessed for an upgrade or scan has been run through Symantec Norton anti-virus, the attacker will be able to access user\u2019s credentials. If a user has synced files from their laptop to Box, the Box login info will be easily transferred to the hacker. Most significant concern is regarding the possibility of corporate files being exposed.According to Wallace, he identified this vulnerability when he looked into the messaging app that the team was testing and then expanded research to other applications. Wallace described, \u201cAt first, I was happy I was able to discover an issue with the chat messenger. It was a mixed feeling of excitement and fear.

The only remedy is to create regular backups but apparently Tewksbury Police Department couldn\u2019t maintain the backup and therefore, when ransomware penetrated its systems, the entire system became useless.In December 2014, the town of Tewksbury learned it the hard way when the police had to pay ransom to retrieve the data encryption key from the hackers.The hackers then asked for \u20ac460/$500 in bitcoins and they received the fee they demanded.

BAT_CYRPVAULT.A or CRYPVAULT was evidenced to have been distributed as an attachment to spam emails.This particular ransomware encrypts files then disguises them as quarantined. Marcos commented that this may be their guise to initiate a sense of urgency for the users to take action on the quarantined files, especially that the files are appended by a .vault extension. In addition, he said it may also be to a symbol for the malware to know that the file has already been encrypted.GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), an open-source encryption tool creates an RSA-1023 both public and private key pair when the CRYPVAULT is executed. GnuPG then encrypts the files with countless extensions like .pdf, .doc, .jpg, .rtf and .zip and thereafter appends the .vault file extension.The Microsoft tool SDelete is used by the malware so that victims have no choice but to pay the ransom before unlocking their files.

Moreover, it has proven to be difficult to bypass on phones that aren\u2019t jailbroken.However, according to MDSec, there is a way to shut down the phone before it starts registering a wrong guess, which allows virtually unlimited guesses.The Lockscreen is amongst iPhone\u2019s major anti-theft defences coupled with its remote shut down and Find my iPhone features. But this new revelation can potentially impact its users.MDSec\u2019s identified method involves recognizing minute alterations in the iPhone\u2019s screen detecting an incorrect password notification just a fraction of a second before the iPhone notes the wrong password. As soon as the system recognizes the changes in the screen it cuts off the phone\u2019s power before the device is able to notify the wrong password.If performed correctly, the method lets attackers to enter around 10,000 probable passwords without locking it. Thus, hackers can very promisingly bypass the iPhone\u2019s primary defence line.Pulling off this method, indeed, requires high level of skills especially in securing the supply of power since turning the iPhone so quickly involves cracking open it and manually disconnecting the battery so that the device runs on USB power.Shutting down procedure also entails that every guess takes about 40sec so entering 10,000 possible passcodes would take a hefty part of one week, giving users ample time to activate the iPhone\u2019s shutdown feature.But it is still plausible that thieves can give it a try to bypass the phone\u2019s lockscreen simply for the substantial payoff a successful operation would offer.Broadly speaking, this revelation depicts how challenging security research is. The order of procedures is probably the only vulnerability in this situation, which displays that a passcode has been unsuccessful just a split second before the phone\u2019s internal system realizes the wrong guess. That split second pause was sufficient for giving MDSec an opportunity that led to a highly elaborative method to bypassing the iPhone\u2019s lockscreen.Watch the demo video below: Additional info: Updated with information about Apple\u2019s fix for the bug in iOS 8.1.1Follow @HackRead | Source: MDSEC ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "April 1, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Cyber Criminals", "Hotels", "Malware", "Privacy", "Public Wifi", "security"], "title": "Hotel Wi-Fi Can Threaten Your Laptop with Malware", "body": "Following Kaspersky Labs\u2019 identification of a unit issuing attacks on distinct high-end hotel guests in Asia and the US, ANTLabs, a technology company based in Singapore, has recently uncovered that a number of their InnGate routers apparently possess a firmware authentication flaw.This means that their highly-regarded and widely-accepted InnGate routers now pose an imminent opportunity for a hacker to inject malware in a user\u2019s computer device. So while one is relaxing in a hotel, a simple task like logging in on a laptop could mean that data sent over the network could possibly be monitored and used for hacking.On a similar note, Cylance, a security firm, who discovered this security flaw said that at least eight out of ten hotel chains worldwide are believed to carry this vulnerability for simply using InnGate routers such as the IG 3100 or InnGate three series.This vulnerability allows for complete compromise of the vulnerable system, but if there are only two running in the world, it\u2019s not really a big deal. In order to test this, we fired up the IPv4 scanning tools Brian uses to hunt for botnet panels.

However, FBI has revoked its support and now maintains that encryption of this type needs to be outlawed, of course, for the safety of Americans.Before the House Appropriations Committee, Jim Comey, FBI\u2019s director, pleaded for a law which would pressurize tech companies to form a backdoor into any encrypted communication device.Does it mean the FBI wants us all to become less safe than we are today? It seems so because that would be the implication if such a law gets imposed. It will ban unbreakable encryption and thus, will definitely weaken our security. It is about time that the White House comes clear about what it actually wants.Comey revealed that the Obama administration might be drafting such a law as of now. He stated that \u201cone of the things that the administration is working on right now is what would a legislative response look like that would allow us \u2026 with the court process to get access to that evidence,\u201d according to The Guardian.This entire controversy has stemmed from Apple\u2019s choice to encrypt iPhone by default to let users unlock the phone using a password or a pin that even Apple doesn\u2019t know about.From a security-oriented perspective, this definitely would be a huge step forward considering the US government\u2019s statement that cyber attacks pose a greater threat than terrorism. Anyone would think that FBI will back this decision from Apple but on the contrary, Comey proposes acceptance of a law that prohibits such an encryption simply because it will make investigations harder.It is an absurd idea that suddenly FBI has gone \u201cdark\u201d and cannot investigate criminals just because of the introduction of a minor improvement in cell phone security. FBI can still visit telecom companies to obtain the metadata of their targeted phone and the department can still track anyone they need to by acquiring a cell phone\u2019s location 24/7. Not to forget that they are still capable of wiretapping the calls and that the four digit passcode that usually iPhone come with by default can be easily broken by the FBI without outside help. So the real motive behind proposing this law is yet debatable.To protect your data, you need to encrypt it. Check out FBI\u2019s official website if you have any ambiguities in your mind. FBI has been encouraging people to enable encryption on their cell phones for years for protecting themselves from criminals.

Of course, Kaspersky Lab strongly denied this claim. However, it can also be recalled how other larger scale firms such as FireEye and Crowdstrike have had their share of the same tribulation when they were largely criticized for failure to inform about the US state malware. However, both of these scenarios suggest how the line between research and espionage is getting thinner, if not blurry.Recently, a similar case arose involving Celil Unuver, a co-founder of SignalSec which is a small time security researcher in Turkey whose main focus was on industrial control software. Unuver was called by the Turkish policemen to present himself at the cybercrime bureau and was advised that should he fail to do so within the three days following the latter\u2019s call, he shall be arrested.For more than eight years, Unuver\u2019s business revolved around publicly divulging some vulnerabilities and offering some to the market legally but throughout the same time, he has committed to staying on the authorized track. He found most customers from the US for the basic fact that there are far more incentives offered by these clients. However, now that he is being questioned by their local authorities, Unuver cannot help but be apprehensive how his line of work and business could be easily mistaken as treason. In retrospect, he tried to recall what could have triggered the said accusation and could only come up with working in the same area as Stuxnet- a state malware who have previously targeted an Iran nuclear plant, where the United States and Israel were closely associated with. In Twitter, he has even joked how was a \u201ccyberweapon seller\u201d thinking that he worked in the same area as Stuxnet but now that he is being questioned, he cannot help but think how this could have been taken so seriously by their local government.Thereafter, he was informed that his case was abandoned after eight long months of difficult ordeal. While it was a sigh of relief, Unuver cannot go back anymore to his usual state, insecure and uncertain of what lies ahead. Likewise, Dmitri Skylarov, a Russian researcher, found himself in the same position, when he was arrested by the FBI for publicly presenting the security flaws of DRM, Adobe\u2019s ebook, noted The Verge.The case of Unuver and Skylarov only prove that even smaller researchers like them are potentially in harm\u2019s way for being mistaken as spies. The lack of understanding between exploit trade and vulnerabilities in the local scene alone only continues to contribute to the danger such circumstance brings.

The method has been named BitWhisper.Air-gapped systems that generally are not linked with other systems and are also isolated from the Internet can be utilized in circumstances that require high level of security simply because these make it difficult to siphon data from them.Usually Air-Gapped technology is used in highly sensitive networks like classified military systems, credit and debits card transaction processes for retailers, and in those industrial control systems that are responsible for operating critical infrastructure. However, it may also be used by journalists for avoid remote accessing of sensitive data by hackers.Siphoning data from this system rely upon gaining physical access to the device/machine, and using any kind of removable media such as a firewire cable or a USB flash drive for linking the air-gapped machine directly to another device like a computer.How to Steal data from an Air-gapped system?The security researchers at Ben Gurion University in Israel have identified the method of obtaining air-gapped system data through heat emissions and the built-in thermal sensors of a computer. The method has been named BitWhisper.BitWhisper allows attackers to secretly siphon passwords and other security keys by using a protected system and then transmit the information to a system that is connected to internet and is in close proximity of the attacker(s). Internet-connected systems may also be used for sending malicious commands through heat and sensor technique to the air-gapped system.Researchers also provided the proof of the workability of BitWhisper in a video footage. In their video, the team used a computer tower to induce a command to a nearby computer tower that represented an air-gapped system.Researchers believe that future research may involve utilizing the IoT (internet of things) as an attack vector- an online heating and air conditioning machine or even a fax machine that can be accessed remotely can be compromised to alter controlled fluctuations in temperature, noted Wired.How BitWhisper Works?It is a fact that varying levels of heat is generated by computers. The heat level depends upon the extent of processing that the CPU is performing. Additionally, the graphics, processing unit and several other components on the motherboard also generate significant amount of heat. Since the system is simultaneously downloading files, streaming videos and browsing the web therefore, it is understandable that this multi-tasking involves a lot of power consumption and results in excessive heat generation.Computers are equipped with numerous built-in thermal sensors for monitoring temperature. These sensors detect heat fluctuations and activate an internal fan to keep the system cool when required and these many even shut down the system for preventing damage.BitWhisper utilizes these particular thermal sensors for sending commands to an air-gapped system in order to retrieve siphon data or perform any other operation. This method resembles the Morse Code since it involves transmitting system through controlled heat fluctuations for connecting with the receiving device. The receiving system utilizes its own built-in thermal sensors for detecting the changes in temperature and translating it into binary digits, that is, 1 or 0.Watch the video demo: Source: BGU | Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "March 25, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Cyber Criminals", "hackers", "keyloggers", "Malware", "PoSeidon", "Privacy", "security", "TROJAN"], "title": "Point-of-sale Systems Targeted By New PoSeidon Malware", "body": "Beware all you retailers, a new Trojan program dubbed as PoSeidon targets point-of-sale or PoS terminals and can potentially steal payment card data for abusing it later.According to Cisco Security Solutions research team, this new malware can perform memory scraping, which means it can scan RAM of all the compromised terminals to locate encrypted strings and matches credit card info with it.In the memory of every PoS system this confidential information is stored in plain text format when specialized merchant software is busy processing it on the terminal.Security experts have been insisting on extending the use of end-to-end encryption mechanism for protecting payment card information from the card reader to the payment service provider but not many have paid attention to their advices as of now.According to CSS researchers, three malware components have been identified by them.

However, jazzier models that offer no-cost or low-cost rates are far more popular.FreedomPop CEO believes that the $10 software package adds about the same features as given by the Privacy Phone.

Makers of smartphone sand app developers have often been criticized for unintentionally exposing the location of users and also of storing this information.This piece of info is definitely scary but in comparison to MailGPS, its nothing.MailGPS app has been named com.services.Google to avoid detection.

In the mail there will be the victim\u2019s phone\u2019s longitude and latitude. The mail will presumably be sent to the attacker.As per Malwarebytes research findings, the email is activated by an SMS command that appears just like the Google\u2019s and other companies\u2019 tools to help locate the stolen or lost Android devices.Virus Radar has also placed the MailGPS in Trojan category.The most frightening part of MailGPS is that it runs in the backgrounds and waits for the SMS command to transmit the location information of the victim.This means the attacker can easily and repeatedly locate the whereabouts of the victim.A majority of Android malware seek to generate quick cash from various victims, which means signing up people for premium SMS services, some sort of ClickFrauds and Scams. The primary purpose is to not let the victim notice something fishy. However, MailGPS is quite strange in this regard since we cannot detect the way from which attacker(s) can make money out of it.It is also possible that MailGPS is a type of spyware as these apps are generally sold by shady developers and people who need to spy on their spouses buy it anyway.

Thus, it was quite possible to bypass the auto-run prevention process in Windows.The team used Cyberlink\u2019s Power DVD as a sample of their findings and stated that the application\u2019s security procedure has gone through minimal modifications since Blu-ray support was implemented in 2009.To limit the operations of Xlet, a Java-based application, the developer uses its personal Security Manager. Xlet contains dynamic menus of the disc and embedded content that can be run in a Java Virtual Machine.In a blog post Tomkinson wrote: \u201cPowerDVD comes with a range of additional Java classes which provide functionality internal to the player, but which are still callable by Xlets on the disc. One of these is the CUtil class which provides access to functions implemented in native code which fall outside of the SecurityManager\u2019s control.\u201dBy exploiting these operations, research team was able to develop instructions that read the arbitrary code the team placed on the disc.A vulnerability that was observed by the team was that Physical Blu-ray players utilized previous work of Malcom Stagg. His project permitted modifications in the Sony Blu-ray BDP firmware so that the anti-piracy technology Cinavia gets removed.Nonetheless, the exploit was doable by launching a library via a USB drive. The drive can be plugged into the device and web browser.Otherwise, Tomkinson trusted the embedded Linux system to offer a path towards the targeted network and utilizing the Xlets present on the disc, it became possible to access the \u201cipc\u201d and \u201cnet inf\u201d daemons. These run the client applications on the Blu-ray player like it has an \u201cexecute\u201d function that can be used to run a command.According to Tomkinson, the exploits for both the Physical Blu-ray and the software of the players can be implanted on the media disc and it is also possible to launch them selectively. This can be done after deciding about the context the disc is required to be played in. Suppressing incidence of malicious activity is performed by starting the video.To minimize the associated risks, Tomkinson advises users to no play Blu-ray discs from unverified sources and deactivate the AutoPlay function in Windows.Moreover, reducing the physical player\u2019s network access will stifle exploitation and this can be achieved by exploring the device\u2019s Setting Menu.

These kinds of attacks are termed as pharming attacks.Pharming Attakcs:Pharming attacks are designed to attract victims towards fake websites. These fake websites are usually replicas of banks and are used to steal credentials and similar sensitive data.Usually, pharming attacks are highly efficient and in majority of the cases these cannot be spotted. By changing the DNS settings of the routers, hackers ensure that victims are redirected to a fake website as soon as they type-in the domain name of the real or legitimate website in the address bar of their web browser.Related Post: ASUS routers can be easily hacked due to vulnerable firmwareProofPoint Study:It was previously assumed that only in network-oriented attacks can the DNS be hijacked but recent attacks show that phishing emails can prove to be just as effective.Proofpoint researchers started monitoring this operation from December 2014 onwards and as per their observations the attacks began with the emergence of a spam email sent from one of the leading telecomm companies of Brazil.Related Post: 16Mn Devices Compromised by Sophisticated Mobile Malware: StudyThe security company observed a small spam run over a four-week period in which no more than 100 emails were sent out specifically to Brazilian organizations and users.These emails contained links pointing to a webpage. This page was hosting malicious iframes, which were designed to abuse cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities that are usually present in the UTStarcom and TP-Link home routers.The device manager\u2019s login page was brute forced by a malicious code when common IP addresses and default passwords were tried out.After compromising the administration page, the IP address for the router\u2019s primary DNS server was also replaced with a malicious DNS IP.Such attacks against users in Brazil were recorded by Kaspersky researchers in September 2014 too. However, it is evident that afterwards, the cybercriminals stepped-up their mechanisms.Previously, both the primary and secondary DNS records were modified by the hackers but in recent such attacks, it has been observed that hackers only changed the Primary DNS server with their malicious server and then the secondary DNS was set to Google\u2019s public DNS 8.8.8.8.This helped hackers in resolving DNS requests from compromised devices if the malicious server wasn\u2019t available and this technique is highly difficult for victims to suspect.Pharming attacks are efficient since there is no need to take over a public DNS.

The system has to be proficient equally at identifying threats that are launched from across the glaciers, meandering under thick slabs of ice and/or flying through the sky. DARPA wants the system to be apt enough to be relied upon for launching a major military mission.Such a system is not easy to design due to the area\u2019s limited access to communication networks and restricted electrical grids. That\u2019s why DARPA stipulated that the system\u2019s sensors should be capable of operating for full 30 days without needing to be refueled.Another hindrance in creation of such a system is that solar powered systems won\u2019t work here as the region becomes darker during winters and 85percent summer days are also obscured from the sun.Additionally, DARPA wants the system to be able to endure at least a drop of -85degree Fahrenheit.A bounty of $500,000 to $750,000 cash will be granted by DARPA to one or more applicants aiming to build such a design. Moreover, the agency is investing $4million to the program initially. It began to work on developing the system\u2019s concept back in 2012.The demand for installing such a system is definitely high as Vladimir Putin, Russian President, has his eyes set on the Arctic, where he intends to beef-up military operations and lay the greatest claim ever made by any country to the seafloor.For now, the United States is lagging behind in the critical measures required for military readiness in the Arctic like Coast Guard infrastructure or the nation\u2019s submarine fleet and icebreakers sizes.This new system will most likely have roles that don\u2019t fall strictly within the domain of military missions such as inspecting drifting ice, which usually poses great threat to shipping.Companies believing that they can build a premier Arctic monitoring system can thus, send their ideas to DARPA.

Use the hardware-based encryption tool, which is firmware password you need to set in Recovery ModeBoth these features are found in the built-in utilities of OS X.It encrypts data present on your MAC device and therefore, intruders cannot access your files. If you use OS X Yosemite, then most likely you already are using FileVault.After you installed Yosemite, you must have been asked about enabling this utility in one of the setup screens.To confirm if you are using this service, open System Preferences\u2014Security & privacy\u2014FileVault.To manually enable this feature, click the lock present in the lower-left corner. It will unlock it and you will be asked to enter your admin name and password. Now click on the Turn On FileVault tab.A recovery key will be provided which you will use in case you need to reset the password.You Must keep this security key at a safe spot and if you don\u2019t have any the store it with Apple.To store the key on Apple you need to create three security Q&A, which will be asked from Apple for retrieving the key in future.Once you are done, restart the device and FileVault will start encrypting the files present on your hard disk. You may continue to use your MAC while the software does its job.Even if FileVault has encrypted your files, it is also possible that some grab your laptop, enter into the Recovery Mode and format your hard drive to claim the device.Thus, a drawback of FileVault is that it sure protects your data from prying eyes, it does not prevent it from being stolen by a thief since the device will become his after a fresh OS X installation.This is why you need firmware password.

These documents are infected with malicious macros.The current campaign targets high-profile banks including Bank of America, HSBC, Barclays, J.P. Morgan and Lloyd\u2019s Bank.Multiple tactics are used by the perpetrators of such malicious campaigns for masking their attack mechanism. One such tactic is of equipping the document with scrambled content.This mechanism gets identified when the macro feature in MS Word software component is enabled.Another commonly preferred mechanism of hackers involves delivering a VBS file containing a \u201c-ExecutionPolicy bypass\u201d policy flag.Usually system administrators use this system as a security mechanism for preventing users from activating scripts that don\u2019t comply with the requirements of their policy.\u201cBypass\u201d command if used in scripts makes it easier to execute unrestricted files without giving warnings.According to Security Researchers at Trend Micro, this three-step infection serves as an evasive tactic. Evasion Tactic is a theory which the \u201cbypass\u201d execution flag for the VBS script supports.Such infected emails appear to have been sent from credible services like FedEx or American Airlines.All these emails have a Word document attached. This document illegally offers exclusive details about the content mentioned in the message such as information about a courier or bank transaction.When the victim opens the Word file, they are asked to enable macros.These macros have commands that initiate downloading of a batch file, a VBS script and a PowerShell file. VBS script is activated by the batch file and this collaboration results in execution of the PowerShell file. The PowerShell file installs the malware onto the computer system of the user.Macros actually are a set of commands that run automated routines in any MS Office document. This feature has been disabled by-default by Microsoft in Office component due to the risk of being used by hackers. Users trying to perform automated tasks need to enable macros manually.Trend Micro\u2019s estimation is that this modified version of Vawtrak steals MS Outlook\u2019s log-in data, personal information stored in Google Chrome, FTP Clients and Mozilla Firefox.The malware\u2019s analysis reveals that it can bypass the SSL mechanism by hooking into the web browser, reports SoftPedia.Cybercriminals can easily trick the victim and compel him into providing the two-factor authentication code by serving client modified pages created by running the connection to the bank via their infrastructure.

The key, called Ki, is unique to each SIM and is burned into the chip when it is manufactured. It is this identification number that allows communication between a user\u2019s mobile and the network provider.The intelligence agencies have stolen encryption keys from Gemalto, one of the largest SIM card and next-generation credit card providers based at The Netherlands, through remote breach of the company\u2019s computer network. The company, producing almost 2 million cards a year, used email and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to dispatch master key files. The surveillance agencies worked upon this insecure transfer to steal the keys through its X-Keyscore program. The spying agencies regularly used this program to access private email and Facebook accounts of employees of major telecom companies. By 2010, the number of keys stolen in one shot was frightening.\u201cIn one two-week period, the team accessed the emails of 130 people associated with wireless network providers or SIM card manufacturing and personalization. This operation produced nearly 8,000 keys matched to specific phones in 10 countries,\u201d according to the Intercept.\u201cAt one point in March 2010, GCHQ intercepted nearly 100,000 keys for mobile phone users in Somalia.

Perfect Forward Security (PFS) allows protection against SIM-key enabled surveillance. PFS generates a unique encryption key for each text, data and call, which is discarded after one use.

Various apps like Tinder, Match and OkCupid have garnered immense fan following lately thanks to their photo sharing, instant messaging and geolocation services. In a year 2013 study, Pew Research Centre found that around 31million Americans have used or are using dating app(s).Related Post: Flashlight Apps Stealing Personal Information Stored On Your SmartphoneHowever, latest analysis from IBM\u2019s security researchers reveals that users of such apps may get exposed to theft, spying and even hacking. According to IBM\u2019s study, 26 out of 41 apps, which were investigated on Google\u2019s Android mobile platform, showed medium to high level security vulnerabilities. This means, more than 60% of the leading dating apps for mobiles are potentially vulnerable to different types of cyber-attacks.\u201cAll the vulnerabilities identified can allow a hacker to gain access to a phone\u2019s camera or microphone even if the user is not logged into the app. This means an attacker can spy and eavesdrop on users or tap into confidential business meetings,\u201d according to IBM.Considering the fact that a majority of these apps can access additional features like the microphone, camera, GPS location, storage and mobile wallet billing information, it is understandable that users become exploitable easily for hackers.IBM, however, refrain from naming the vulnerable apps but it has informed the app publishers about the issues detected in their apps. Employees from nearly 50% of the companies, which were examined for this research, used vulnerable dating apps making the company prone to hack attacks.Why Dating Apps Expose Users to Cyber Attacks?The reason is that users usually don\u2019t care about security issues while using dating apps considering them as safe. According to IBM Security vice president Caleb Barlow:\u201cMany consumers use and trust their mobile phones for a variety of applications. It is this trust that gives hackers the opportunity to exploit vulnerabilities like the ones we found in these dating apps.\u201dAnother reason is that employees use the same phone for personal and professional use, which is known as the \u201cbring your own device (BYOD)\u201d phenomenon. This makes both the user and the firm exploitable. IBM\u2019s report analysed that:\u201cThe trouble with BYOD is that if not managed properly the organizations might be leaking sensitive corporate data via employee-owned devices.\u201dHow can a Compromised Dating App pose Threat?A compromised app can be hugely advantageous for the hackers since on dating sites users are eagerly waiting for feedback from their love interest and hackers can easily send them fake \u201cphishing\u201d emails/messages to retrieve sensitive data, install malware or conduct theft. Such as, hackers can use aphone\u2019s webcam or microphone to eavesdrop and overhear conversations or they can remotely control the phone through an app thus, acquiring confidential business data. GPS data also becomes vulnerable and may lead to user being stalked, personal conversations and text being exposed and billing information hacked. This leads to fake online purchases on websites too.Recommendations from IBM:IBM recommends that users of dating apps limit the divulgence of personal information and instead try to use unique passwords on all of their online accounts. Moreover, they need to install latest software patches timely and gain knowledge about the permissions required by every app they use. Barlow explains:\u201cConsumers need to be careful not to reveal too much personal information on these sites as they look to build a relationship. Our research demonstrates that some users may be engaged in a dangerous tradeoff \u2013 with increased sharing resulting in decreased personal security and privacy.\u201dYou can read the complete report in PDF below: Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "February 18, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Cyber Crime", "FBI", "government", "Pakistan", "Privacy", "Scam", "security", "USA"], "title": "Pakistan arrests FBI\u2019s most-wanted Cyber criminal", "body": "Officials from Cybercrime Circle of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) have revealed that two of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\u2019s ten most-wanted cyber criminals have been arrested by their department on FBI\u2019s request.

The infections were most prevalent in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, China, Mali, Syria, Yemen and Algeria and were going on since more than a decade.The spyware targeted government and military institutions, telecommunication companies, banks, research and defense institutions, nuclear researches, media and Islamic activists.The spies, dubbed as Equation Group by researchers because of their affinity for encryption formulae and algorithms, lodged malicious software in the obscure code called firmware. Disk drive firmware is a very precious part of a PC next to BIOS and launches every time a computer is turned on.\u201cThe hardware will be able to infect the computer over and over,\u201d said Costin Raiu, the lead Kaspersky researcher.Once lodged, the spies had complete control of the system. One of its malware platforms was capable of rewriting the hard drive firmware of the infected computers. It created a secret storage vault that could survive military-grade disk wiping and reformatting. The breach could not be detected even through layers of anti-virus programs.Reuters reported that the group also used various means to spread the infection such as compromising jihadi websites, infecting USB sticks, CDs, and developing a self-spreading computer worm [Fanny].\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous and bad because once a hard drive gets infected with this malicious payload it\u2019s impossible for anyone, especially an antivirus [provider], to scan inside that hard drive firmware. It\u2019s simply not possible to do that,\u201d he added.The authors of the spying program must have had access to the proprietary source code directing the actions of the hard drives because it is almost impossible for someone to \u201crewrite the 1/8hard drive 3/8 operating system using public information.\u201d\u201cThis is an incredibly complicated thing that was achieved by these guys, and they didn\u2019t do it for one kind of hard drive brand,\u201d Raiu said.The operators of the still-active spying campaign could infect machines of any make, which include Western Digital Corp, Seagate Technology Plc, Toshiba Corp, IBM, Micron Technology Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.Western Digital spokesman Steve Shattuck denied sharing any source code with any government agencies.Likewise, Segate and Micron also denied that their products could be compromised and that they were quite secure against any tampering or reverse engineering.Toshiba and Samsung declined to comment. IBM did not respond to requests for comment.Although the firm denied divulging the country behind the cyberespionage, it hinted that the country was linked to Stuxnet, the NSA-led cyberweapon that attacked Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facility and destroyed almost one-fifth of the country\u2019s nuclear centrifuges.A former NSA employee did confirm the lab\u2019s analysis, while another intelligence operative agreed that NSA had developed technique of hiding spyware in hard drives.However, NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines declined to comment.The company published the technical details of its research on Monday to help the infected institutions take preventive and corrective measures.The disclosure may further tarnish and damage NSA\u2019s surveillance abilities, which have been already constrained following leaks of the classified files by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.", "authur": "Pushpa Mishra", "date": "February 17, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Cyberwar", "Egypt", "government", "Israel", "Malware", "Muslim Hackers", "Palestine", "Pornography", "security"], "title": "Gaza Hackers Successfully Target Israel with \u2018Porn Star Video\u2019 Malware", "body": "Egypt and Gaza-based hackers seem to have united against the Israeli government, military network and research infrastructure since the traces of two ongoing malware attacks lead to Gaza- reveals Trend Micro report.Trend Micro\u2019s report didn\u2019t specifically name the targeted or affected websites and Israel\u2019s National Cyber Authority spokesperson states that the government hasn\u2019t received any \u201csubstantial\u201d damage from these attacks. However, Trend Micro did discuss how the hackers accomplished the task.Related Post: Suspended Israeli soldier gets \u201860,000 Facebook likes\u2019 for aiming at Palestinian teen\u201cPicture the following reconstruction based on one attack: An employee in an Israeli government research facility receives and opens a highly targeted phishing email. A pornographic movie starts to play on his screen, which he hurriedly closes before any of his colleagues notice. He then thinks nothing more of the event. Minutes later, an attacker from somewhere in the Gaza Strip in Palestine gets notified that a new victim\u2019s system has been successfully infected. The attacker then proceeds to exfiltrate a package containing all of the interesting documents from the newly infected system.\u201dThree individuals have been identified as part of the attack and all three are working in Tech firms in Gaza. These individuals are also either listed as the buyers of the German domains (from where the attacks originated) or are involved in subsequent attacks launched against Egyptian targets from Gaza.The two Campaigns:Two different yet interlinked campaigns have been identified by Trend Micro. First one has been nicknamed Operation Arid Viper, which is an advanced and high-level attack targeting Israel. This particular campaign involves spreading of malware through spear-phishing emails containing a pornographic video. The video is actually a malware which gathers data from compromised machines through what is known as a \u201csmash-and-grab attack.\u201dThe second campaign has been nicknamed Operation Advtravel. It is a low-level targeted attack affecting only a few hundred in Egypt. It mainly infects personal laptops. Traces of its attackers have been found in Egypt.Stark similarities exist in both these campaigns. For instance, both are being hosted from the same German servers. Moreover, their domains have been registered in the names of same individuals.In comparison to the conventional APT-style attacks, Arid Viper appears much effective and serious whereas Advtravel seems to be slightly amateurish.Trend Micro theorized that both the campaigns have been manifested by military setup in the Arab world. It can also be said that:\u201cThere may be an overarching organisation or underground community that helps support Arab hackers fight back against perceived enemies of Islam\u201d.In the light of this theory, it isn\u2019t hard to comprehend that many such campaigns will be observed in future from this unidentified umbrella organization.Why Hackers Succeeded?The main reason behind the successful accomplishment of these attacks, as explained in the report, is that these weren\u2019t launched from Gaza. A majority of Israel\u2019s Internet service providers and government agencies have banned communications to and from Gaza to prevent these sorts of attacks. However, the fact that Germany is not on Israeli ISPs \u201cban list\u201d helped the hackers greatly in conducting the attacks successfully.Moreover, the use of pornography was perfect alibi and a touch of genius because porn usually takes users\u2019 focus away from malicious activity and if it manages to target professionals at work, they would never reveal or report the incident. The victim\u2019s inefficiency in reporting about the attack will allow the malware to remain undetected and this aids the hackers tremendously.Follow @HackRead", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "February 17, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Bitcoin", "breach", "China", "Currency", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "Money", "security"], "title": "Chinese Bitcoin exchange Bter hacked, $1.75 million in Bitcoin stolen", "body": "While you were celebrating valentines day, the hackers were busy doing what they are good at.

It will allow banks to automatically know the cardholder\u2019s current location through the location-tracking function present in almost all smartphones.This may sound like the bank becoming your \u201cbig brother\u201d however, it will be immensely helpful for cardholders as they won\u2019t have to especially call and inform their banks about their whereabouts. Moreover, as per privacy experts, this new feature must be lauded wholesomely since it can potentially curb the incidences of credit card fraud and can optimize customers\u2019 convenience.The Rising Rate of Credit Card Frauds:It is evident that credit and debit card frauds rates have been on a rise lately and every year such thefts cost banks and consumers billions of dollars. According to Federal Reserve\u2019s latest available data, the banking industry received a blow of $1.57billion in 2013, and $4billion in 2012, due to credit card fraud.The efforts to curb this high rate of credit card frauds have become the primary concern of banks and payment processing firms. Visa\u2019s new software is the proof of this ongoing drive.Our bank spends a whopping $250million on cybersecurity and we are planning to double the expenses this year, states Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase.How it works?From April onwards, banks will be updating their smartphone applications to incorporate this new location-tracking feature from Visa. Upon consumer approval the software will, after some time, update the customer\u2019s home territory within 50miles radius. If the consumer conducts transactions using his or her card then the possibility of risk factor will be minimal. As soon as that consumer travels outside that location, Visa will be notified by the phone. The software will determine this change of location through either the shifts in cellular data plan of the consumer or when the phone is connected to a new Wi-Fi network.When the consumer will use his or her card from a new location, Visa will have knowledge about it already and therefore, a card fraud alert will be avoided.Mark Nelsen, executive of Visa states: \u201cWe will be able to compare the merchant\u2019s location to the most recent cellphone location to show it\u2019s a less risky transaction.\u201dConsumers can deactivate this function any time and Visa also promises that this location tracking feature will not be used for advertising or marketing campaigns.What sort of Frauds can it Prevent?Visa\u2019s location-tracking software will directly target counterfeit credit cards, which means criminals won\u2019t be able to use stolen credit card code and information using new card equipment. Counterfeitcards look just like real credit cards but the information on its magnetic stripe is retrieved (read stolen) from someone else\u2019s card.Visa aims to prevent \u201ca good portion\u201d of such frauds through this software, claims Nelsen. This will be possible because counterfeited cards are usually used from a new location while the owner\u2019s current location will be known to the bank.Visa announced its new anti-fraud measure on Thursday and clarified that not every potential fraud situation will be addressed by this software. For instance, if both the phone and credit card of a user gets stolen then Visa won\u2019t know that a fraud has occurred unless the consumer directly contact and inform the company.This version of the software also won\u2019t address the probability of purchases being made online using data from a stolen credit card, but Nelsen affirms that its future version will be equipped with this capability too.MasterCard also will be rolling out a pilot program to integrate biometric data like fingerprints, face and voice into the firm\u2019s payment system to ensure authentic transactions.Source: Associated PressFollow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Email", "Microsoft", "Phishing", "Privacy", "Scams", "security"], "title": "C-93 Virus Alert Email from Microsoft is a Phishing Scam", "body": "An email is being received by users of Microsoft\u2019s email accounts claiming to be sent from Windows Outlook.

And the FBI will try to conceal such information.These devices that have come to be known as \u201cstingrays\u201d can be used to find out a phone\u2019s whereabouts, intercept calls and text messages. Stingrays are able to give information about nearby phones when locating a phone. A report by Ars stated how a couple of cities in America are presently upgrading their devices with new hardware so as to target 4G LTE phones.The latest revelation regarding the FBI appears from a June 2012 letter that the Law Enforcement agency wrote to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Minneapolis Star Tribune was the first one to obtain and publish it in December 2014. It is probable that similar language is present between the FBI and other local authorities who are using stingrays.The letter states that: \u201cIn the event that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension receives a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) or an equivalent state or local law, the civil or criminal discovery process, or other judicial, legislative, or administrative process, to disclose information concerning the Harris Corporation [REDACTED] the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will immediately notify the FBI of any such request telephonically and in writing in order to allow sufficient time for the FBI to seek to prevent disclosure through appropriate channels.\u201dThe FBI did not reply to Ars\u2019 request instantly for comment. In the meanwhile, the privacy activists did not see the language as they were discouraged.The collusion by state and federal agencies is marvelous as they undermine the requests of public records which is obviously keeping the public away from the use of Stingray technology. The lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Hanni Fakhoury told Ars that a genuinely sensitive law enforcement data could definitely be redacted under the traditional public records act law. However, the belief that the work of federal government to actively become an obstacle against disclosure of records shows clearly that there is a chilling effect on achieving the data that is related to controversial surveillance tool.Staying mumA Californian privacy activist, Mike Katz-Lacabe submitted public record requests to the 100 biggest law enforcement agencies in the country in the beginning of this month. Up till now, only the police in Tacoma has given a notification to the FBI that relates to records request put forth by an Associated Press reporter in October 2013.It is being determined systematically as to which law enforcement agencies have these cellular telephone surveillance and monitoring devices, Mike Katz-Lacabe told Ars through e-mail. The law enforcement agencies in the 100 largest cities in the U.S were the first ones who got his requests. The next target would be the state police departments (or public safety departments) in all of the fifty states and also the country police/sheriff departments.He also said that the national security is sensitive to the secrecy of these devices (Stingray, KingFish, DRTbox). On the contrary, the local police departments use these as standard tools for regular criminal cases and therefore, they should be disclosed like any other law enforcement tools.Worst-kept secretOnly documents have revealed how these law enforcement tools are used and purchased but only limited information is available as to how stingrays work and used by law enforcement agencies. The existence of body-worn stingray was revealed by some leaked documents shown by Ars in 2013. Also, a homemade device constructed for only $10000 was shown by Kristin Paget in 2010.The worst thing is that it was a deceit made by the cops as they lied to the courts about the use of such technology. Just last month, the FBI\u2019s position was made public by two US senators that the FBI used the stingrays in public without a warrant. Harris Corporation which has been the largest manufacturer of these devices has remained silent about the hardware capabilities.It was emphasized by various legal experts that a federal agency like the FBI should not know whether there is any compliance of state law by a state agency.An American Civil Liberties Union attorney, Nathan Wessler, told Ars that it is astonishing in terms of the fact that it is a very unsuitable and over-broad use of the federal authority. The more egregious part is that the FBI knows that many police departments know that the stingray are being used by them after the local police gets an approval from the FBI for purchasing and using the tool. However, when the public asks basic information about how the surveillance is done in local communities, the FBI is invoked to say that such disclosure will threaten national security and so the information should be kept confidential.On the other hand, many believe that the FBI is doing nothing illegal by forcing the police departments to give public records request. After all, the public records do suggest that they are actually public.An Oregon-based public records lawyer, Daniel Stotter, told Ars that sometimes it is very helpful for the FBI in term of catching the bad actors when you get put on a notification. You are not going arrested or picked which is something most believe.

This means confidential information and data plans are being stolen without our knowledge.The study revealed that in 2014, the rate of malware infectivity in mobile devices saw a 25% increase in comparison to the year 2013\u2019s 20% increase.This rate of increment is so incredible that Android devices have now equalled Windows laptops, which used to be the main target of cybercrimes. The infection rates between Windows and Android devices are now even, that is, 50/50 as of 2014.Kevin McNamee, the director of Motive, states in a blog entry:\u201cWith one billion Android devices shipped in 2014, the platform is a favorite target of cybercriminals who can have lots of infection success without a lot of work. Android is more exposed than rivals because of its open platform and by allowing users to download apps from third-party stores where apps are not always well-vetted.\u201dLess than 1% of the infections are found in Blackberry and iPhone smartphones. The rate of mobile infections was 0.68% in 2014.Why Malware growth is continuing at a fast Pace?Malware growth is well supported by the very fact that a majority of mobile devices remain unprotected since their users are not aware of or tend to ignore security precautions.The survey revealed that 65% of the subscribers expect that their service provider is responsible for protecting their devices.55% respondents agreed to pay for this service. Service providers, conversely, would be very interested in ensuring that malware is prevented from invading their network for the sake of retaining their subscribers.Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s network intelligence GM, Patrick Tan, explains that: \u201cWith malware attacks on devices steadily rising with consumer ultra-broadband usage, the impact on customer experience becomes a primary concern for service providers. As a result, we\u2019re seeing more operators take a proactive approach to this problem, by providing services that alert subscribers to malware on their devices along with self-help instructions for removing it.\u201dWith mobile command and control protocols sophistication increasing rapidly, the increment in mobile malware rate is no surprising at all. For example, the use of mobile spyware has increased tremendously since users are now more interested in tracking the location of the device and monitor incoming and/or outgoing calls, emails, SMS and web browsing.Moreover, the first DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks propelled from mobile devices occurred in 2014 signifying that the alleged hacktivism movements against mobile technology may be launched in the coming years.McNamee notes:\u201cThe rise of mobile malware threats isn\u2019t unexpected. But as Google Wallet, Apple Pay and others rush to bring us mobile payment systems, security has to be a top focus. And malware concerns become even more acute in the workplace, where more than 90% of workers admit to using their personal smartphones for work purposes.\u201dFor residential networks, the infection rates also significantly increased during 2014 since 13.6% devices were infected with malware, which shows a 5% increment in comparison to the rate in 2013, revealed Motive\u2019s malware report.This rise is largely due to the rise in infections caused by moderate threat level adware. High-profile threats like rootkits, bots and banking Trojans remained steady with 5%.DDoS attacks also saw a rise in 2014, according to the Motive report, and infrastructure components like DSL modems, home routers, mobile Wi-Fi hotspots, cable modems, NTP servers and DNS servers were utilized for this purpose.It was also discovered that consumers who do not shop online due to the fear of getting their debit/credit card information leaked are actually exposed to greater risk.Apparently, reckless retail cybersecurity violations during 2014 were all caused by malware infections in point-of-sale terminals and cash registers instead of online stores. This happened because stolen cards from online retailers are usually not as valuable for hackers since these can only be used for making purchases online.However, mobility will be the real threat in future.\u201cBy the end of 2015, the number of smartphone users worldwide will surpass 2 billion, representing more than a quarter of the global population.

However, an Indian web developer Laxman Muthiyah claims that he discovered a flaw with which he can easily remove photos from almost all user accounts on Facebook. He immediately notified the company about the flaw and it was patched in due time.Muthiyah is currently serving as a web developer at popular Indian movie website Behindwoods. He says that to confirm this flaw he eliminated sample albums using Facebook\u2019s mobile-access client and a developer\u2019s API.Facebook was reported about this problem on Tuesday and within just two hours it got fixed, says Muthiyah. The company found him eligible for $12,500 bug bounty.Muthiyah\u2019s Story:When asked how he identified this critical flaw, Muthiyah replied that he was just playing around with Graph API, which is the feature of Facebook apps that let developers read and write user data. The developers\u2019 documentation although clearly stated that it cannot delete albums but Muthiyah tried it anyway and the result was just that.In response, the error message that appeared was:This revealed that while the app couldn\u2019t make the API call, there was a possibility of some other app to do that. Therefore, he used his Android access token, which also utilizes Graph API and has a delete option, with the Facebook mobile app and tried this code:And it worked. Muthiyah was ecstatic:\u201cOMG :D the album got deleted! So I got the key to delete all of your Facebook photos :P lol :D.\u201dHe realized that this was a major flaw since all that was needed to hack Facebook photo albums was four lines of code. He reported the flaw to Facebook on Feb 10, in response the company awarded him the bounty within 12hours.The Menace that was prevented:According to web consultant Mark Stockley blogpost on Nakedsecurity blog Laxman could probably have sold that bug to somebody other than Facebook and earned a great deal more money than he got for doing the Right Thing in the nakedsecurity blog.Muthiyah definitely should be lauded for his uprightness and morality. This could have been caused a lot of trouble for Facebook and its users around the world had Muthiyah sold this information to any of its competitors.Wiping out all the photo albums from Facebook might have been a daunting task, states Stockley.\u201cIn practice Facebook probably operates rate limiting or other countermeasures that would prevent a single device from doing too much harm, and even if it doesn\u2019t, the social network is so large an attacker would probably struggle to delete albums as fast as people on Facebook create new ones.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s just a question of horsepower, and horsepower is easy on the internet \u2013 there are kids running botnets of 60,000 computers.\u201dFollow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "February 14, 2015"}, {"topics": ["FBI", "government", "internet", "Malware", "Ransomware", "security"], "title": "Ransomware: Cyber-hijacking Malware now has a new deadly face", "body": "Everything formidable is often associated with its negative half and the same can be said of the internet. The origins of functional internet can be traced back to the 1990\u2019s, the exact period of the origins of the early form of malware. Malware was then just a few lines of code in software that would prohibit the regular operation of a computer. The Brightside of advanced computational algorithms is that they safeguard the valuable assets of major organizations, but their dark side is that they are often misused by malicious attackers with no morality and internet ethics. The world has seen plenty of internet attacks, malware and other dangerous cybercrimes, but the new face of cybercrime is something known as Ransomware.What is Ransomware and how it works?You might have by now come across different types of malware, Trojans, spyware and other types of viruses in the cyber world. Ransomware is an extortion scheme on the web, rather than just a plain old malware. This new scheme involves trapping its preys into a chain of extortion schemes through the use of advanced computing and cryptologyalgorithms. In plain language, Ransomware hijacks its victims\u2019 computer and injects a malware that locks down the computer and they then demand a ransom for providing these files back in their original condition.This malware is in its encrypted form and can exist in the form of any file format like .pdf, .gif, .gzip, .zip or so. Upon the access of these encrypted files, the hacker can freeze the victims\u2019 computer and through a popup window, demand a ransom for unfreezing the computer and its contents. The way Ransomware works might sound superfluous to many reading this, but it is a serious security issue in the cyber world.The rise of Ransomware: This deadly threat in the cyber world has witnessed a tremendous rise in the past few years, since first documented back in 2009. Originated from Eastern Europe and Russia, it quickly spread to other parts of the world, including Western Europe and the USA.Ransomware uses its malware techniques to track your computer location, via your IP address and then manages to display a pop-up message in your local language and orders a ransom to get back access to your computer and its content.Reported Ransomware attacksAlthough it may sound right off a Hollywood flick, there have been many cases of Ransomware reported and documented, while many of them have still gone unreported and off the books. According to reports from Norton security, the serious variants of Ransomware were detected over 500,000 times in a span of 18 days.According to analysts at Symantec, these attacks led to the earnings of at least $33,600 a day, with over 2.9% of victims paid out the ransom on the same day, fetching the criminals over $394,000 in a month. In 2012, many similar cases have been reported in the France, Germany and UK in addition to USA.2013 saw the rise of CryptoLocker, a new type of ransomware, first reported in the early September. CryptoLocker encrypted the files with their malware and sent it out to their victims to later lock down the computers and demand ransom through pop-ups or Emails.This was one of the most widely popular and effective form of Ransomware, making the criminals over $3 million, before it was shut down.Thought that was the end? This might just be the beginning. CryptoWall 2.0andWinLockerare the latest reporting of Ransomware, catching pace in the early 2015. These latest forms of hackers demand payment through BitCoins. Joseph Edwards, is a 19 year old community college student, who committed suicide after his computer was hacked by Ransomware.How to stay away from RansomwareBuying a powerful and robust security subscription is the best way to begin on your journey of safeguarding your computer from Ransomware. This ensures that your virus database is always updated, as scanning for the old and out-datedones doesn\u2019t make any sense. Keeping your operating systems, browsers and other software up-to-date will definitely help.Don\u2019t just take backups of your files on your local hard drives. Back them up timely to an external hard drive or to an online service, from where they can\u2019t be written over or removed.Avoid downloading and accessing suspicious files and try to stay away from pirated downloads.The impact of Ransomware has left many internet users spellbound and this is just the beginning of the rise of such serious cybercrimes. Keeping yourselves adrift of all the latest happenings in the cyber world is an essential and do your best to stay away from suspicious files and websites.Author Bio: Devinder Maheshwari is a Co-founder of beebom.com, a blog about digital tips and resources on software, apps and gadgetsFollow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "February 13, 2015"}, {"topics": ["DARPA", "MEMEX", "Memex Search Engine", "Privacy", "security", "Surveillance"], "title": "DARPA Builds \u2018Memex\u2019 Deep Web Search Engine to Track Sex Traffickers", "body": "A project had been announced by the U.S government\u2019s Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) last year which was to create a search engine that is powerful enough to dig deep in the web and bring out those websites that are not indexed by Google and other commercial search engines.The search engine that will fight against cybercrime is on its way and is named as Memex Deep Web Search Engine. On Sunday night, we had the opportunity to peak into this crime-fighter. Scientific American got the opportunity to view the search engine by previewing the software while 60 minutes got the chance to look at the exquisite technology.It is certain that deep down in the web, there are numerous illegal activities going on ranging from child pornography, drug deals, Cyber-crime to human trafficking. Since the dark side of the web is so far down into the pits that it is far out of the reach of major search engines, however, that was until now.Now the internet will be protected by Memex Search Engine that will prevent hackers, human traffickers and other criminals from affecting the web. While developing the search engine, it was kept in mind that it should surpass the above challenges and extend the reach of current search engine capabilities while organizing subsets of information quickly based on individual interests.Chris White, the inventor of the search engine had a discussion with Lesley Stahl and producer Shachar Bar-On about this Dark Net Search Engine and told how it works and how it is a revolutionary thing in the field of law enforcement investigations.White told that people underestimate the size of the internet. Some estimates suggest that search engines like Google, Mirosoft\u2019s Bing and Yahoo only allow the user to access 5% of the total content on the internet. This means that criminals have a lot of space for conducting unlawful activities.DARPA innovation head Dan Kaufman said on 60 minutes about the Memex search engine and represented the software as something that makes the unseen seen.Kaufman also said that although there are many people on the internet doing kind things, there are at the same time many parasites and that he and his team are working on to prevent them to use the internet against us and so make this world a better place.Watch the CBS video about MEMEX search engine:A nongovernmental organization, a law enforcement agency and two district attorneys\u2019 offices are beta testing the Memex search engine. A much wider group will be doing a beta test in a few weeks and that would be the next stage of testing.One aim of this round of testing is to test the new image search capabilities so that photos can be examined even when portions of it that are helpful to the investigators are hidden. This was in a report by Scientific American. The second target is to bring in different user interfaces and to experiment with streaming architectures that evaluate time-sensitive data.This implies that MEMEX search Engine will enable DARPA to track criminals by just looking at the reflections in TV screens just like the way it is done in Hollywood movies. It was highlighted that DARPA is doing great effort to prevent human traffickers from harming more people.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "February 12, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Android", "LG", "security", "Smartphones", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Critical Vulnerability Allows attacker to have full control over LG Smartphones", "body": "Search-Lab Ltd. discovered a serious security vulnerability in the On Screen Phone protocol used by LG Smart Phones.

Once connected, the attacker could have full control over the phone \u2013 even without physical access to it. The attacker needs only access to the same local network as the phone is connected to, for example via Wi-Fi. The LG On-Screen Phone application (OSP) makes it easy to access and control LG\u2019s Android smartphones through a PC. The connection can be established either by using an USB cable or wirelessly through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. When attempting to connect to the phone via OSP, a popup dialog is displayed on the phone and it is to be confirmed and accepted by the owner. Once the channel is established, the screen contents of the device are being transmitted to the PC as a motion stream, mouse clicks on the PC are turned into touch events on the phone. By using OSP one can control an LG Smart Phone just like it was in their hands.The application is available through the manufacturer\u2019s custom store for install, and is preinstalled on many LG Smart Phones, including G1 & G2. SEARCH-LAB Ltd. responsibly reported this threat to the manufacturer in September 2014 who confirmed the severity of the issue and started working on the fix in turn. The patched version of the application is now available to download through LG\u2019s Update Center and/or will be available in form of Maintenance Release for some models.

On first visit to the Forbes site, the users were directed to an IP address that hosted the Shockwave Flash exploit.  When the ToTD widget opened, it delivered the Flash exploit (hrn.dll) on the local system.

But a popular security consultant, Mark Burnett \u2013 the person involved in the collecting and researching leaked passwords over the internet \u2013 made his resolution of publishing the passwords dump as a risky thing, however, something that can come in handy to the security researchers.WHY IS THE RESEARCHER WILLING TO SHARE PASSWORDS?It has been said by the password researcher that these passwords would provide a sample for other researchers to analyze and understand better the user behavior and will motivate password security.The researcher was requested time to time from various students and other security researches for giving a copy of the password research data so that they can do their independent research.WHAT PANICS HIM OF SHARING HIS RESEARCH?There was an incident where the former Anonymous activist and journalist Barrett Brown was sentenced to a five-year arrest as he shared the hyperlink with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel where other members were distributing hacked information. It is this fear of being sentenced that Mark Burnett is refraining from sharing his research with anyone.Ironically, Burnett is willing to share the information universally so that the world can understand the way people choose pass phrases.Burnett also wrote in his blog post on Monday that it is simply ridiculous that he has to write a whole justification for the release of the data if he does not want legal action taken against him. He says that if it wasn\u2019t for this report, he would have written an article on the data release but now he has to spend the time on this lame thing just to convince the FBI not to arrest him.FROM WHERE DID THE CREDENTIALS COME?Burnett has collected the information that was already present on the internet. He has gathered data breaches at major companies such as Adobe Data Breach and Stratfor hack. Many of the passwords that were found, the researcher said, were already \u201cdead\u201d which means that most of them were already changed and Burnett scrubbed other data like domain names so as to render the information useless for cyber criminals and other hackers. The passwords, however, still present on the list should be changed instantly.A SHORT INTERVIEW WITH MARK BURNETTFew questions were posed to Mark about sharing the usernames/passwords with the world and the answers were as follows:Q: Is there any threat to online users associated with sharing the passwords with the public?A: The passwords are already out there on the internet and so the hackers who want to hack the passwords on this list, are not a threat at all.Q: Have you been approached by any Law enforcement agencies?A: NoQ: Does the data include any passwords or usernames from Adobe and LinkdedIn breaches?A: My research includes those breaches that have both the username and the password and so this excludes LinkedIn and other sites as well. As far as Adobe is concerned, the passwords that were not available on the internet unencrypted have not been included as this rules out adobe as well. Otherwise, the report has a bit of everything.Q: Give a reason as to why should the passwords be shared publicly?A: The data is collected for the purpose of providing clean and consistent set information for those who want to find study it and hence gain knowledge. Although, I have been asked many times to share my research, I have been hesitant to do so. Despite not being completely accurate, the data can be used to improve security.\u2018WHY THE FBI SHOULDN\u2019T ARREST ME\u2019Usually researches are accustomed to releasing passwords alone; however, Burnett said that he has released both the passwords and usernames together. This is an area which has been less looked at but something that can offer greater insight than simply studying passwords.There has been a common fear among researchers to release both passwords and usernames together. This is because when released in combination, they become an authentication feature and if they are linked to an already registered authentication feature in a private IRC cannel, it can be deemed as trafficking and in this case the FBI can surely take it as a crime.The 10 million passwords revealed by the researcher can actually show how frequently do users put their usernames either partly or in full while creating a password. Still, 10 million is a huge amount but Burnett fended this off by saying that the leaked information was already on the internet.We at HackRead are currently analyzing the data and will update you once done.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Backtrack", "Downloads", "Kali Linux 1.1.0", "Penetration", "security"], "title": "Kali Linux 1.1.0 Released!

It was between November 2013 and January 2014 that saw the group\u2019s data exfiltration efforts where the victims ranged from armed opposition members to humanitarian aid workers and media activists in and outside of Syria, FireEye reported.Malware was distributed to the hackers\u2019 targets through some kind of social engineering. This was revealed through a report called \u201cBehind the Syrian Conflict\u2019s Digital Front Lines\u201d.At some point in the conversation, the targets were tempted to open personal photos of apparently beautiful and sympathetic women that were actually malware, shown using female Skype avatars by the attackers.It was noted by the report that attackers frequently asked the victims whether they were on their computers or mobile devices and then sent the malware accordingly. FireEye researchers observed this threat group aiming against the Syrian opposition with Android malware for the first time according to the report.The DarkComet remote access Trojan (RAT) and a customized keylogger were among the cruel tools that formed the collection of the threat group\u2019s arsenal.It was further explained in a Monday review with SCMagazine.com by Nart Villeneuve, a researcher and co-author of the threat report, that the attackers injected DarkComet into the memory of machines by covering it [RAT] up in another piece of software.Villeneuve also said that the custom dropper used to install DarkComet was never seen by researchers to have been used by any other Syrian related malware groups.The report, on further scrutiny by FireEye, revealed that the threat group was conveniently capable of attaining huge collections of data through breaking into only a small number of systems as the opposition shared computers for accessing satellite-based internet. Although it was tough to analyze the exact number of victims in the campaign, it was estimated by Villeneuve to be perhaps 28 computers that were compromised by the threat group leaving 64 Skype databases vulnerable to attackers which was due to the fact that multiple people used the same computers.In the interview, Villeneuve told that the attackers also exfiltrated documents like Excel sheets and photos.Finally, the report emphasized the fact that the campaign was something more than just a cyberespionage directed towards achieving an edge over information or a strategic goal.In contrast, the report said that the threat gives way to actionable military intelligence to be used for an immediate battlefield advantage in the midst of the conflict taking place. The report went on by adding that this \u201ctactical edge comes with a potentially devastating human cost\u201d. Attackers have got military-related data trapped that includes information about military hardware and positions offighting groups along with the fighters\u2019 names and weapon systems, lists of refuges aid recipients and casualties, records for humanitarian efforts and funding, and political strategy and military planning communications.Researchers gave a detailed explanation in appendix A of the report about the malware used in the campaign along with the Android backdoors that the attackers used with a keylogger named ONESIZE and BLACKSTAR \u2013 a custom dropper for DarkComet.During the research of the malicious activity tracked back to the threat group, there were many instances to be found where Lebanon was referred, FireEye reported. This reference also included a user in the country who uploaded test versions of the malware that was executed in the campaign. Also, hackers who used social engineering ploys said in chats that they belonged to Lebanon.The report also stated that social media pages suggest that either it is the refugees in the country being represented as female avatars or it is the Lebanese themselves.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "February 4, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Adobe Flash Player", "Dailymotion", "Malvertising", "Malware", "security"], "title": "New Adobe Flash 0-Day Using Dailymotion.com In Malvertising Campaign", "body": "Adobe Flash Player has again seen a zero-day exploit that has appeared in the field due to a critical vulnerability that enables drive-by-download attacks.

Among all the recently popped out cool things, SpotCam caught our attention for its unique offer \u2013 continuous cloud full time recording for free.This may seem to be normal for people who are not familiar with home video monitoring industry, but actually it is a very bold offer. For a long time manufacturer offer SD card, NAS recording, or event clips recording based on pre-defined triggering condition. All of them comes with limitations of some sort and make those solutions not ideal. Continuous cloud recording, on the other hand, may be the best solution for home users but always come with a monthly subscription fee; Dropcam is the most well-known manufacturers of this type.Now, this new entrant, SpotCam, promise to provide continuous cloud full time recording for free, and this could be a game changer.The camera build is solid and placement is easy, it can stand on the bracket or mount on the wall or ceiling with wall mount kit. Setup of the SpotCam is also a simple process though it did take me a few tries to get everything to work properly. The idea is that you switch modes on the camera \u2014 first making it a hotspot of sorts to connect to your phone \u2014 then switch it back once your Wi-Fi is setup correctly. It\u2019s not a very intense process at all, overall it is quite easy and quick to start viewing the video.As far as the camera\u2019s video quality, it is a 720p ( 1280 x 720 ) at 30 frames-per-second (fps) and delivered a good video image. Lighting is important and this camera provides day/night capability where it will automatically switch to black and white mode in low-light conditions to keep the 30fps 720p quality video. This is a nice feature when using the camera as a baby monitor in a dark room.SpotCam has incredible low light sensitivity being able to go as low as 0 lux with the built-in infrared (IR) illumination. From what we see in the night, SpotCam probably provides the best image quality among all home monitoring cameras so far.SpotCam support alerts for two types of event, they are motion event and sound event. You can configure the camera to send an email to alert you whenever the camera detects motion, sound, and/or goes offline. You can also adjust the motion sensitivity and a motion mask as well as the sound sensitivity.When you do get the email alert, you are told which camera detected which kind of alert at what time and a snapshot of the image is included in the email. A nice way to see that it\u2019s just the kids home from school.You will be surprised how many times you will use the two-way microphone option, which is a feature you find on some higher end video management systems. One way audio is common and this is a very nice touch for this solution.Here comes the reason why SpotCam is different. Your SpotCam cloud account comes with free 24-hour cloud storage for full time continuous recording, it recycles automatically so you always get to keep the latest 24 hours video on the cloud. The best part is SpotCam system allows you to export footage you want to keep and save to local hard drive or youtube, you don\u2019t have to worry about missing important moments after 24 hours. If you wish to upgrade that retention, SpotCam gives you 3-day, 7-day, and 30-day storage options that require monthly subscription fee, and this fee is much lower compare to other cloud solutions in the market.There are many other good designs that we can go on for hours, but simply put, if you are looking for a good quality home wi-fi security camera to keep an eye on things then you owe it to yourself to check out the SpotCam. At US$149.00 MSRP it is by far the best choice for a cloud home monitoring camera.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "February 4, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Facebook", "Malware", "Porn", "security", "Social Media", "Videos", "virus"], "title": "Beware: Porn-based malware Infects 110K Facebook Users", "body": "Facebook appears to be infected with a porn-based malware that has affected about 110,000 Facebook users in just two days.The malware, disguised as a Flash update, comes as a link to a porn video on one of your friend\u2019s post.

This means that although the passwords are hashed, users with weak passwords are vulnerable to unauthorized access. It\u2019s important to note that our two-factor authentication system used for redeeming Raptr Reward Points ensures that even if your Raptr account was among those compromised, the points you\u2019ve earned as a Raptr member are protected.\u201dDon\u2019t think that Raptr points are just a gimmick and actually are useless because for Raptr account holders these are really important. They can use their earned Raptr Reward Points for purchasing items like e-books, games and/or gift packs. Moreover, if they have earned enough points then they can even check out the site\u2019s extensive rewards page, which lists some really cool collectibles.Most significant point of concern for Fong is that many users may have shared their Raptr password or username on another community account. Therefore, he urges all to change their passwords and usernames on those platforms as well.Fong explains\u2026\u201cAlthough the potential risk to Raptr users is pretty minimal, we urge you to access any accounts on other sites and services in which you use the same login and password associated with your Raptr account and change the related password(s) immediately.\u201dWhat really happened? Many believe that this issue is similar to what happened to Diablo III accounts few years back. In that case some of the accounts were compromised and Blizzard refused to claim the responsibility. In fact, in some token, Blizzard was quite on what really affected the user accounts and whether it was a malware attack or someone targeted another platform and retrieved user-accounts and passwords or it was just trolls.However, Fong implying that Raptr\u2019s attacks are similar to the Xbox Live and PSN attacks means that this may be the work of same scrip kiddies who have been trying their hands on various gaming communities.In one of their previous such attacks, they brought down Sony and Microsoft\u2019s services during the Holiday break, which prevented hordes of gamers from playing their favorites games.In the end of his post, Fong encourages gamers to change their passwords as soon as possible and apologized for the inconvenience caused to the community.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Photos", "Privacy", "security", "Vulnerability", "WhatsApp"], "title": "WhatsApp Web has vulnerability that could expose user photos", "body": "Uploading Photos on WhatsApp Web Risky as Privacy Lapses Discovered:WhatsApp Web:WhatsApp Web is a new service launched by WhatsApp. It allows users to sync their mobile and desktop devices with the messaging app.In its blogpost dated 21st January, 2015, WhatsApp announced the new web client and noted that WhatsApp Web \u201cmirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device live on your phone.\u201dThe messenger app has around 500million+ users worldwide. In 2014, it was bought by Facebook for a whopping $19billion.Risk Factor(s) Identified:Although the app has run afoul of privacy activists and regulators for its sloppy behavior in the past but when WhatsApp introduced end-to-end encryption for securing user\u2019s private chats the act was lauded by all.However, this new web client contains some privacy pitfalls which mean it may not be the right time to launch it.A seventeen year-old security blogger, Indrajeet Bhuyan, reported about the problems associated with the web client.These lapses undermine the privacy settings of the web app however, these settings work just fine on the mobile app.Bhuyan states that it is possible that users of WhatsApp Web view the photos which otherwise they are not allowed to view or are not visible to them on the mobile app.When you send a photo through WhatsApp mobile app and delete it afterwards from your device, the recipient will be able to view just photo\u2019s blurred out version.However, Bhuyan states that in WhatsApp\u2019s web client, the sent photo was still visible without any blurring after it was deleted.This means the new web client of WhatsApp is unable to properly sync with the mobile app.Another problem identified by Bhuyan is that even after you restrict your profile photo visibility to contacts only it remains visible on WhatsAp Web.Usually, it is the mobile version of an app that finds it difficult to sync with the desktop app properly. However, in this case it is the reverse since this time the web client is unable to sync with the mobile-based app.Was the WhatsApp Web App ready for Release\u2014May be it Wasn\u2019t?Apparently, these bugs could have been or rather should have been easily fixed before the launching of WhatsApp web client. The presence of these bugs strengthens the fact that WhatsApp probably rushed the app and it was not tested adequately before its final release.Watch the videos below for better understanding about this vulnerability:Another aspect that also makes it apparent that WhatsApp Web app was not really ready for its release is that the web client is just compatible with Chrome and users of iOS mobile app cannot benefit from it as yet.

This vulnerability, named \u201cGhost\u201d, is in the GNU C Library called glibc. This is a C library that basically defines system calls.Several Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Novell have already released patches and fixes and it is recommended that admins patch immediately.Although the flaw was originally discovered on glibc as early as 2000, it was finally fixed in 2013 between versions 2.17 and 2.18, according to Qualys CTO Wolfgang Kandek.Kandek states that when it was discovered, the flaw was not immediately categorized or recognized as a security issue and so many Linux distributions were not fixed at the time. Those include Debian 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, CentOS 6 and 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.While Qualys actually uncovered the vulnerability while performing a code audit, it is still not known if attackers have yet made use of it before its discovery. Kandek wrote in the blog post that the glibc flaw exposes a \u201cbuffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function of glibc. This bug can be triggered both locally and remotely via all the gethostbyname*() functions. Applications have access to the DNS resolver primarily through the gethostbyname*() set of functions. These functions convert a hostname into an IP address.\u201dWhile Qualys analysts have developed a proof-of-concept exploit, they said they won\u2019t be releasing it before at least half of all affected machines are patched.The best action to take now would be to reboot entire servers after they have been updated including all public-facing services such as Web servers and mail servers.\u201cGhost\u201d is just another vulnerability that has been uncovered recently in addition to a long line of flaws in open-source software components such as Heartbleed, Poodle and Shellshock.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "January 31, 2015"}, {"topics": ["Blackphone", "hacking", "NSA", "Privacy", "security", "Spying", "Surveillance"], "title": "Anti-NSA Blackphone can be hacked through a text message", "body": "The mobile device BlackPhone, which was marketed as a super secure phone, has just had to run a patch to fix a vulnerability which allowed hackers to compromise the devices.The malicious code was able to attack the devices through no more than the Silent Text application.The BlackPhone device is actually a target for hackers who view the owners of the device as high profile victims because owners of the device actually paid around $630 for its security features. People willing to pay this much for a phone must have calls and messages that they want to keep secure.The well-known Sydney hacker and co-founder of Azimuth Security Mark Dowd (@mdowd) found out the flaw towards the end of 2014 while BlackPhone was developing the fix at the time. Dowd noted that hackers who exploited the vulnerability could remotely control the device.While it took Dowd a week to find the flaw, he has been known to report vulnerabilities before such as one he discovered in the ZRTP third-party library used in the Silent Phone app in 2013. He was interested in the marketing of those Silent Suite apps and took to researching them further.The Silent Suite actually encrypts phone calls and messages to keep away eavesdroppers through mass surveillance.

That, in itself, is saying a lot for the people at Blue Coat Labs as they have seen it all.The main reason behind the name is the many layers used in the design of the malware and it launches very highly targeted attacks to enter their victims\u2019 computer and steal confidential information from them.There is yet a lot to be understood about the Inception framework attack as it is currently still enshrouded in mystery. What is clear about the malware is that it attacks through a spear phishing email and also target mobile devices including Android, Blackberry and iOS through planned MMS phishing campigns. Over 60 mobile providers have been hit including China Mobile, O2, Orange, SingTel, T-Mobile and Vodafone. But the senders are yet to be unveiled as they have placed certain clues in the malware that has easily thrown off their scent.Initial speculations suggest they could be from India as there is Hindi used in some of their Android malware. They may be in the Middle East somewhere as some Arabic text is used in strings of their Blackberry malware. There is also the suggestion that they may be in the United Kingdom due to the string \u201cGod_Save_The_Queen\u201d which was also found in their Blackberry malware. If that wasn\u2019t confusing enough for their pursuers, their connections are routed through several home routers that they have hacked. Many of these routers are in South Korea, placing more pins on the global map to follow them around.Just to make things more interesting and more geographically spread, the framework uses a free cloud hosting service in Sweden for its Command and Control traffic. This in itself serves to hide the identity of the attackers and may confuse quite a few detection mechanisms.With their identity so deeply masked, their targets are completely the opposite! While the attacks initially targeted Russia and some Eastern European countries at first, it has gone on to expand globally. The victims of these attacks have included political, military, financial and oil industries. Information regarding specific targets are still not public but Blue Coat Labs researchers have confirmed several phishing emails that targeted the following industries: finance in Russia, oil industry in Romania, Venezuela and Mozambique, and embassies or diplomacies in Paraguay, Romania and Turkey.Researchers have also unveiled that decoy documents obtained by Blue Coat Labs hint at an interest in the sectors of embassies, politics, finance, military, and engineering.The initial discovery of the Inception framework came in March 2014 when Microsoft published information about a new vulnerability in Rich Text Format (RTF) named CVE-2014-1761 in addition to two previous RTF vulnerabilities.The masterminds behind Inception were quick to capitalize on these vulnerabilities at first through phishing emails disguised as real news stories which infect the targets and then, undetected, send the victim\u2019s files back to the Command and Control servers at a Swedish cloud service known as CloudMe, used as the backbone of this whole visible infrastructure. After that, having established a connection with a cloud account, the malware then starts to check subfolders for updates which it then downloads, decrypts and uses.Naturally, Blue Coat informed CloudMe about this abuse of their services and the Swedish establishment was very quick to help, providing all sorts of log information.On computers, Inception collects computer name, user name, user group membership, the process it is running in, local ID\u2019s, and system drive and volume information.With the mobile phone malware, it is similar since the infected phone is used to record phone conversations, to collect location data, contacts and account data. Victims of the MMS phishing attacks can be monitored through their phone calls and their daily texts or activities and wanderings. There seems to be cause to believe that the attacks on mobile phones were aimed at selected individuals and phishing campaigns have been prepares for several countries in Asia, Africa, Middle East and Europe.Blue Coat Labs describe the malware as having a clean and elegant code which shows quite a strong backing and what they term as top-tier talent, suggesting a very well-resourced and professional organization behind Inception. In other words, it is not the work of a handful of people. The number of layers used to protect the attackers is so advanced that it is even seen as somewhat paranoid.Since there are very little clues to follow up on, the nature of the targets that are connected with political, economic, and military sectors, seem to indicate that whoever is behind Inception could possibly be a nation state or even a private entity with specific interests.Blue Coat offers guidance to avoid infection by advising is to keep software updated and avoid jail breaking phones or installing apps from unknown sources. Signs of being targeted include unsolicited emails that contain RTF documents or even MMS messages suggesting that certain phone applications need updating,Blue Coat Labs seem to think that this is a huge campaign and we have barely seen the beginning of it. The attacks may have started in Russia but it is now clear that there are verified targets all over the world.Source: Blue Coat.", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "December 13, 2014"}, {"topics": ["China", "e-cigarettes", "Malware", "security", "USB", "virus"], "title": "Warning: Beware of Malware Planted In Chinese E-Cigarettes.", "body": "Electronic cigarette manufacturers may have highlighted its numerous benefits to letting you lead a healthy, stress-free life, what they certainly did not highlight was that the device can be used for malware distribution as well.Electronic cigarettes, popularly known as e-cigarettes, produce vapors simulating smoke of a real cigarette and to do this the device needs to be charged.

The Shellshock is a Bash bug able to find a way to exploit any operating system, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Apple Mac OS X or Linux operating systems.2. It sends and executes command to the infected system through a malicious code.3. The terminal area which infects the system is usually blocked for access, but Shellshock Bash bug can open all the terminals of a system.RELATED STORY: Your email Password, Credit Card at Risk Web Encryption Compromised by Heart Bleed BugA security researcher on Twitter going with the handle of @ErrataRob shows how this bug runs on Mac OS X.Here is a shocker for you: This bug doesn\u2019t affect Windows operating system. Yes! It doesn\u2019t but if an attacker is able to run the malicious code, it can get the access of computer devices. A working working example is when an Apache Web Sever runs bash command to process task along with the data entered in the online forms.RELATED STORY: KALI Linux Website Hacked Using Heartbleed BugAt the moment there is no update from the companies owning the above discussed OS. However, government of US and the UK has issued national alerts in response to the bug, warning that it may compromise organisations responsible for critical national infrastructure such as power stations if it is not rapidly dealt with.A good explanation about this bug has been given in the video below:In a statement issued today the ICO said:The Shellshock flaw could be allowing criminals to access personal data held on computers or other devices, which should be ringing real alarm bells. The worst thing would be to think this issue sounds too complicated businesses need to be aware of this flaw and need to be monitoring what they can do to address it. Ignoring the problem could leave them open to a serious data breach and ultimately, enforcement action.This bug was originally discovered by a 38-year-old French software developer Stephane Chazelas, living in Edinburgh. This Flaw uncovered by chance, he said to The Independent Today.A report suggests that this bug was in the market for last 25 years and chances are that hackers have been using it to infect million of users online. Another report reveals that Apple had already fixed this bug but never revealed that its OS was vulnerable to this bug.RELATED STORY:Heartbleed now reforms into Cupid attack targeting Wi-Fi networks and AndroidStay with us, we will update the article with new information on the Shellshock Bash bug soon.The difference between the previous Heartbleed attack and in this type of attack is that the TLS connection runs on EAP, which is an authentication framework used in Wi-Fi networks. EAP also used in wired networks and Peer to Peer connection.In this attack, the types of EAP used are EAP-PEAP, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS. All these EAP use TLS connection.For a successful attack on vulnerable clients, attackers use hostapd (with the cupid patch) to set a malicious network. When the vulnerable client attempts to connect via sending request to TLS connection, the hostapd will in reply send malicious heartbeat request with vulnerability.Author Bio:Jason Parms is working as an Internet Marketing Manager at SSL2BUY Inc.

Among the apps they easily hacked were Gmail, CHASE Bank and H&R Block. Amazon, with a 48 percent success rate, was the only app they tested that was difficult to penetrate, according to UCR blog.The assumption has always been that these apps can\u2019t interfere with each other easily, said Zhiyun Qian, an associate professor at UC Riverside. We show that assumption is not correct and one app can in fact significantly impact another and result in harmful consequences for the user.The method of attack starts with installing a malware app on the device, it doesn\u2019t t has to be some complex app, a wallpaper app will be good enough to begin with.Once that app is installed, the researchers are able to exploit a newly discovered public side channel the shared memory statistics of a process, which can be accessed without any privileges, the publication writes, explaining that Shared memory is a common operating system feature to efficiently allow processes share data.Once the app is installed, the researchers can monitor changes in shared memory and connect them to the device to track user\u2019s activity in real-time.For a successful attack, keep two things in mind:1. Make sure that the victims are unaware of the fact that they are under attack.2. The attack should take place exactly when the user is performing the action.We know the user is in the banking app, and when he or she is about to log in, we inject an identical login screen, said electrical engineering doctoral student Qi Alfred Chen from the University of Michigan. It\u2019s seamless because we have this timing.The researchers have released demo videos showing how exactly the attack is conducted and how the victim\u2019s login credentials and credit card details can be retrieved in real-time.Solution:You can save yourself from hackers and getting your personal info leaked by simply avoiding download of useless apps.", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "August 22, 2014"}, {"topics": ["Malware", "security", "Tech", "USB", "Vulnerability"], "title": "BadUSB exploit hacks your computer", "body": "A common shortcoming that most of the USB devices possess is one which can be noiselessly made use of to introduce infection into computers. This is done in a fashion which prevents detection and this has been concluded by security researchers themselves.Most of the USB thumb drives have a major dilemma like several other USB peripherals that they fail to provide protection to their firmware. This refers to that software which is known for running upon the microcontroller which is inside them according to the founder as well as the chief scientist of the Security Research Labs based in Berlin namely Karsten Nohl.This denotes that the firmware on a USB device can be replaced by any malware program with the help of SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) commands. Nohl further claims that it can be made to act as any other piece of hardware.This spoofed piece of hardware can then be used imitate key presses as well as transfer commands in order to download and for the execution of a malware program. This malware then can also be used for reprogramming the other USB drives which are put into the infected computer. This way it becomes a self-multiplying virus.Proof of concepts!The Security Research Labs have come up with many proof of concept annihilations they it intends to showcase to the Black Hat security conference which will be held in Las Vegas in the coming week.One of these comprise of a USB stick which performs similar to three different devices. Two of these are thumb drives while one is a keyboard. Once the device is plugged into the computer and detection by the OS takes place, it acts in the capacity of an average storage device. But once the computer is activated again and once the device has detected that it is dealing with the BIOS, it turns this hidden storage device on and also imitates the keyboard.While acting within this capacity, this device then sends the required button presses to present the main boot menu and this will boot a Linux system which originates from the thumb drive which is hidden. It then infects this boot loader of your computer\u2019s hard disk drive. It then acts like a certain boot virus.One more proof of concept attack which was developed by the Security Research Labs revolves around reprogramming this USB drive. It then acts like a speedy Gigabit network card.The USB device also is known to emulate a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server and this assigns a DNS (Domain Name System) server to this spoofed controller. The OS will make use of the gateway which has been specified by the real network card and by taking control of the DNS server. This is known to translate the domain names into the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. In order to depict that the attack is not merely possible via the thumb drives, the researchers will make use of a certain Android phone which is connected with a computer. This is done to imitate a rogue network card.Any USB drive can be polluted and Nohl says that if you allow anyone to connect a certain USB thumb drive on the computer you trust them with your computer.The price of convenienceThese attacks which have been developed by the Security Research Labs outline the complexity of possessing the characteristics of both a standard USB and its security simultaneously. Unfortunately, this dilemma cannot be fixed. Many efforts have been made by the researchers and but none of them help the problem completely. One point where this problem can be catered to is present in the USB specification. But even if this specification is altered it would take a considerable amount of time before the brand new standard is accepted.OSes can also inquire users to make sure that the addition of new USB devices to the computers takes place which is a sort of USB firewall. This might be difficult due to the fcat that several USB devices make use of a series of zeros in their serial number and it becomes challenging for distinction to be made according to Nohl.A very clear place to solve this problem would be the USB microcontrollers and this involves the updating of the firmware to be automatically signed. Nohl also speaks that his team and he himself have not come across such protective measures in several USB thumb drives which they have tested.Even if the manufacturers commence the implementation of these measures, there will be a need to differentiate between old and new drives.

The latest hacking attacks, known as \u201cCringent\u201d or \u201cPower Worm\u201d uses the cloud technologies to target its victims. The exploit code, instead of creating executable code, uses certified technologies such as Windows PowerShell, Google DNS Servers, Dropbox or Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive.The malicious document triggers a memory-corruption vulnerability in the RTF parsing code along with an ASLR bypass. The attack follows a three-phased approach: acquiring the components, running commands, and infecting the files.Loaded with virus, the word or the excel file creates a subdomain under two domains for which the DNS records need to be accessed. Rather than storing the files at the IP address indicated by these sub-domains, the hacker stores a txt record on Google DNS server, thus completely avoiding the local DNS blocking.The command in Windows reads:nslookup -querytype=TXT {malicious domain} 8.8.8.8This allows the hacker to access two links, each pointing to genuine cloud storage: Dropbox and OneDrive.In the second phase, the already installed Tor and Polipo software aid the hacker to access the command-and-control server through the two GUIDs contained in the URL:{C&C server}/get.php?s=setup&mom={GUID #1}&uid={GUID #2}A correct GUID allows a PowerShell script to be downloaded to proceed with the infection.In the third stage, the malicious code, Cringent, lowers the security settings of the Microsoft Office and modifies its registry using the PowerShell script. It further disables all alerts and macros so as to avoid the victim being warned.In the penultimate step, it searches for all word and excel files on the computer (.docx and .xlxs) and converts them to .doc and .xls, respectively, thereafter creating a Visual Basic module for them.And finally, it deletes all the original files and when these files are opened, a chain reaction of infection starts rendering the files useless and leading to loss of important data.Microsoft advises the users to be vigilant and requests removal of any Tor and Polipo software.Since 2007, Microsoft Office uses only .docx and .xlxs; so presence of large number of .doc and .xls file should be viewed with suspicion.The attack targets only Word 2010 documents, it fails on Word 2013, reports the official blog of Microsoft.According to the blog, the user can stay protected against this vulnerability by disabling the opening of the rtf files or by enforcing Word to open the rtf files always in the \u2018Protected View\u2019 in Trust Center settings.Additionally, the Microsoft is also providing its users with a \u2018Fix it automated tool,\u2019 which prevents opening of all .rtf files in all Word versions.The tool sends out a message when an .rtf  file is being opened:It further adds that if blocking the .rtf files is not an option, the files could be opened in the protected view mode which prevents loading of ActiveX controls.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Pushpa Mishra", "date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"topics": ["hacking", "Malware", "Malwarebytes", "Scam", "Scammers", "Spam", "Syria", "virus"], "title": "Spammers using \u201cNo War on Syria\u201d petitions to steal personal information", "body": "Spammers are taking advantage of the various online petitions against the recent news about the alleged arming of the Syrian rebels by the US to trick Internet users to disclose their personal information, according to media reports.

If you chat on WhatsApp, it\u2019s time to be careful and avoid getting too private. An IT security expert Bas Bosschert has discovered a critical vulnerability, allowing another Android apps to access and read all of a user\u2019s chat conversations. So how and what happens:When you allow WhatsApp to build a back-up data for your chats in order to install the app on other computing devices, the back-up data is sent to WhatsApp database and is saved in the SD card of your smartphone. Now rather than building a unique password or code for each and every user, WhatsApp is using the exact same code for all of its users, which is a bad news because any developer can make an app to decrypt and penetrate in to the data including chats, images and videos. So as long as you grant the app permissions it asks for, your messages will be exposed to third-parties. An important point is that this security flaw is affecting the Android users only. As far as the Apple\u2018s iOS is concerned, the app does the same thing, but Apple blocks all access to the WhatsApp database where the data is stored.How it is done:To learn how it is done, visit Bosschert\u2019s official blog here.How to avoid it?According to my personal view, it is very simple to avoid getting your chats exposed to a third party. All you have to do is to NEVER download/use or allow an unknown/phony app on your Android phone.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"topics": ["Edward Snowden", "Facebook", "hacking", "NSA", "Snowden", "Spying", "Surveillance", "USA"], "title": "Snowden Leaks: NSA Posed as Facebook to infect computers with malware", "body": "According to one of the recent report, NSA is believed to be spying many Facebook users since 2010. NSA used a number of automated techniques to install malwares into users systems.NSA codenamed these techniques as \u201cTRIBUNE\u201d, executed via a network of malware implant which were the main source of gathering all possible data for surveillance. According to the documents disclosed by Snowden, there were about 85,000 to 100,000 implants deployed by NSA worldwide.The LA Times report said to infect computers with malware, the NSA has relied on various tactics, including posing as Facebook. This was done by fooling computers into a network of malwares which was originally presented as Facebook server. Through, this act NSA was able to extract all the information from user\u2019s hard drive. However, Facebook claims that hackers or NSA can not use the social media to conduct such attacks anymore, but it warned that other websites and social networks may still be vulnerable to those types of attacks. In response to the report, NSA denied using or posing as Facebook to infect user computers.NSA began this network on implants back in 2004 with 100 to 150 implants which were created manually. But, now they can easily enter into a number of devices and the list is as follows: * Use a computer\u2019s microphone to record audio* Use a computer\u2019s webcam to take photos* Record a computer\u2019s Internet browsing history* Record login details and passwords use for Web services* Log users\u2019 keystrokes* Extract data from flash drives when they are plugged into infected computers* Block users from accessing certain websites* Corrupt files that computers attempt to downloadFollow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["DDOS", "Flaw", "hacking", "Leaked", "LEAKS", "NEWS", "security", "Snapchat", "SocialMedia", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Vulnerability that lets hackers hack Snapchat and disable your iPhone", "body": "Snapchat app vulnerability is highlighted again, and this time the hackers can temporarily freeze your iPhone and force restart, according to media reports.A Spanish researcher, Jaime Sanchez, along with another researcher have discovered a flaw in the Snapchat\u2019s code that makes it possible for the hackers to launch denial-of-service attack.Sending thousands of messages at one time through Snapchat to an individual user can cause the iPhone to freeze and eventually crash forcing the user to do a hard reset. If the apps is being used on an Android device, though the flaw does not cause it to crash, but it definitely slows down the device to such an extent that the application cannot be used till the hack is under process.Snapchat is a popular mobile application for iPhone and Android that allows users to send across photos and videos. Once received, the messages gets deleted after being opened. Every time a user sends a message, a code is created to verify the user\u2019s identity. The code called token is a combination of letters and numbers.The drawback with the Snapchat apps, as discovered by Sanchez, is that it allows the used tokens to be re-used and this can be channelized by hackers to send new messages. Sanchez demonstrated the Snapchat\u2019s vulnerability to Los Angeles Times reporter Salvador Rodriguez by sending 1000 messages within 5 seconds to his iPhone causing the application to freeze and then crash. Sanchez wrote about his flaw discovery on seguridadofensiva.com but has not contacted Snapchat because of the latter\u2019s lack of respect for the cyber security research committee. Earlier in August and December 2013, Snapchat was informed about a flaw that could divulge user data by Gibson Security. But it fell on their deaf ears and another group exploited the information to reveal the user names and phone numbers of nearly 5 million Snapchat subscribers.When LATimes contacted Snapchat about the flaw reported by Sanchez, the company spokeswoman appeared ignorant but did say that they were interested to learn about it and gave their email address to be contacted.However, the official website does contain a message informing users about their work on the vulnerability and their plans to contact Sanchez on the latest threat.Meanwhile, Sanchez claims that his Snapchat account and IP address have been blocked by the app. The company could not be contacted to comment on that.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Pushpa Mishra", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Authentication Hacking Attack", "hackers", "hacking", "Hacks", "Infosec", "security", "Vulnerability"], "title": "How to Prevent Your Website from Authentication Hacking Attack? (In Depth Analysis)", "body": "Websites though being secured remains at a risk of getting attacked in one or the other way. Internet is coming up with a new attack almost every day, Phishing, Sniffing, Snooping, hijacking, identity hacking are to name a few.Authentication hacking is one such type of attack. As we all know that authentication is very vital in terms of security of any kind of applications. For accessing any type of assets, one has to verify himself/herself by providing his/her usernames and passwords to get the authority to the applications or the data.Authentication attack can be stealing of credentials (usernames and passwords) and hence accessing and stealing of important data or applications.Normally, a HTTP transaction consists of following authentication protocols:All the authentication protocols work on the HTTP and/or on SSL/TLS implanting the credentials in the request/ response traffic. Authentication attack cannot be claimed as technical security fault in the Operating System or the server. It merrily relies on the security measures taken to preserve the complex passwords and severity of the attack from a hacker.Where a vulnerable site will lead you to?Authentication attack as mentioned above is mere a breaking in to the system by hacking the actual credential and faking to be a valid user for corrupting the system or stealing of the data.If attacker gains the entry into the system as a user he/she may get a limited access privileges to the data while if he/she gains access as an administrator with universal privilege, you can image what damage he/she can cause to your system or business.Tools prove to be the backbone of the hackers:Howsoever smart the hacker must be, it is very important to fill in the exact matches of the usernames as well as the passwords. Once a hacker knows about the user with the high privilege, he/she would not be far away from guessing out the correct password. And now with available tools and techniques, it is not that difficult to guess the password for any hacker.Below is a list of the combinations of the usernames and password guesses:Usernames GuessesPassword GuessesThese were some of the guessable usernames and passwords. If a hacker fails in guessing the passwords then the tools like WebCracker and Brutus comes for help.Tools like WebCracker and Brutus tries to enter in to the system with their pre installed lists of usernames and passwords, dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks.How to determine the page\u2019s authentication?Authentication tester is a technique which helps you test the page\u2019s authentication. One such authentication tester is Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner. It will automatically test all the pages which may require authentication.How to prevent an authentication attack?If you want make sure that no attack has happened, you can make use of automated tool that will display the returned error codes and page information from the host web server. Ensure the security by enforcing any error page or unexpected request to generate a HTTP 200 OK response, rather than various 400 type errors. This will confuse the attacker as to differentiate from valid and invalid attempts.To avoid the brute force authentication attack, one can add some random content on the page displayed to the client browser. Also the client should be able to submit the random content as part of authentication process. One way to do this is to present the random content in a graphic GIF, JPG or PNG format using colors and fonts randomly each time.For example: Using Web tools like Acunetix Vulnerability scanners will help preserve your data as it checks for the SQL injections and Cross site scripting at the same time.Scan your website with GeoTrust Web Site Anti-Malware Scan, It helps find malware (if any) and also demolish it. Web Site Anti-Malware Scan monitors the website to help clean up the infected website. It supplies with on-demand scan and instant alerts.All you need to do is to remain a little bit aware and to use the best security practices.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["hackers", "hacking", "internet", "NBC", "Olympics", "security", "Sochi", "Sochi-Olympics", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Internet Minefield: NBC Reporter was immediately hacked in Sochi!

They can be like ripe fruit for hackers. Setting up a fake Wi-Fi network to steal personal information is an easy task for these hackers. When a user tries to connect with public Wi-Fi, especially at an airport or coffee shop, he/she may not know whether the Wi-Fi network signal is authentic or fake. It is here that hackers could steal your data over such public connections. Such unsafe surfing is sure to open you up to a number of online threats. We\u2019ll talk about some of these security risks involved in accessing public Wi-Fi.What threats could be expected while using a public Wi-Fi?Well, an unsafe surfing is likely to attract a number of online threats let us see some of them:Evil Twin/Wi-Fi Phishing: Justifying its name, in Evil twin the access routes creates a cloned network with a same network name. Evil Twin works in the same way as the normal phishing threat does, when the user enters into the wrong access route, evil twin starts stealing system\u2019s data or attacks in any other way.New war drivers: War drivers are those who try to hack network illegally especially on open network like a public free Wi-Fi network. These war drivers could be anyone like hackers, professional criminals or even the employees or competitors of the particular business.Viruses: One of the ancient types of the online threats is virus also influence wireless network. Viruses enter into the wireless network, send requests, and connect to the local area networks to make a way to the nearest wireless networks and corrupt the network system coming in its way.Data eavesdropping: This is very common Internet threat. With lots of interceptable signals and data sharing techniques, eavesdropping also prevails in public Wi-Fi network.How can you keep a safe distance from threats?All you have to do is to stay alert and updated. Following steps will help you to stay protected while using a public Wi-Fi network:1. Turn off SharingMany times, we use computers and Internet for sharing purposes such as files, images, audios, videos, graphics, and printers and so on. Being on a public network it is obvious that someone will try to access your data and files. To prevent this you need to turn off the sharing feature of your OS.Windows:For turning off sharing files on windows:On the left corner, click on the Change advanced sharing settings and under the Home or Work tab Change the settings as given below:Mac OS X:2. Turn on the Firewall Although the firewall does not secure the network thoroughly, it is still necessary to keep unwanted traffic away from the network. Operating Systems like Windows and Mac OS X come along with the basic Firewall.Windows:Mac OS X:3. Update your antivirus softwareInstalling the antivirus software is not enough; you also need to update it from to time-to-time. Antivirus software will alert you on finding any suspicious content.4. If not in use then turn it offIf there is no need of internet connection then turn the Wi-Fi connection off. Keeping Wi-Fi during idle time may invite unwanted vulnerabilities, and can result into snooping or sniffing attack.5. Implement VPNVirtual Private Network is widely famous for keeping your entire stuffs private. VPN are available in both paid and free modes. This is the perfect alternative and an unbeatable solution for those who frequently need to connect with public Wi-Fi networks.6. Check for SSLAn SSL secured website is always starts with HTTPS. SSL confirms the encryption process carried out by that website/server, and hence guarantees a secure online communication. Any site, which is not https, is not worth trusting.Certificate authority issues SSL certificate that is used to secure domains, websites, web applications, software, source code, documents, as well as mobile applications.So always, make sure that you check for the \u201chttps\u201d in the websites before dealing out with any website.7. Two- step authentication- a safer method to avoid threatsAll the reputed businesses or websites have implemented two- step authentication process, which is also called two-factor authentication. In this process, one has to provide two different credentials to log on to one\u2019s account.Therefore, even if any hacker reaches up to your password, he/she will not be able to access your account without authentication code.8. Being available all the time is not good for your healthStaying online all the time is also one of the reasons of hijacking of your email accounts or bank accounts or account of social networking sites. After finishing your work, you should log out from all of your accounts. In addition, one should disable the setting in laptop and mobile phone of automatically connect to the Wi-Fi hotspots. Below is the process of disabling Auto- connecting to public Wi-Fi networks in windows.Certain facts like not connecting to unknown networks, providing minimum information if asked for on the network, being demanding in asking for encrypted networks and so on should also be taken into consideration before connecting to a public Wi-Fi network.Working on Internet is not as safe as it should be, one should be aware of the prevailing threats and their prevention.

The sensor has been embedded on the home button of iPhone 5S. Two security masters Robert David Graham and Nick Depetrillo have launched a website which says that the sensor system has yet not been broken by anyone. The two have started to collect bounty for anyone who becomes the first person to break into the security ID by acquiring fingerprints through some cup or beer mug etc.\u201dGummy bears had already been used by some hackers for acquiring the fingerprints\u201d, says Graham in conversation with the ABC News.

The sum has already reached a total of 16000 dollars and the contributions are being made in the form of biticons, alcohol bottles and cash. I/O capital Partners have donated 10,000 dollars for this purpose.Graham explained that a well-established principle among the security communities is that you cannot trust anything unless you have a bounty tagged with it.

He gave a link to Zuckberg\u2019s college friend with a post made to his wall. Even though, he was not in his friend list. He said this mail via facebook feedback page which says a $500 reward on each bug found on the site.According to Khalil\u2019s official blog, after getting a disappointing response from facebook security team, Khalil decided to post this matter directly to mark Zuckberg\u2019s page. In his post described the bug in detail along with a negative response from Facebook\u2019s security team. Few minutes after the posts was on the wall, one of the facebook\u2019s engineer contacted Khalil and asked khalil for all the details regarding the vulnerabiility.After receiving details from khalil they blocked account and fixed the vulnerability. However, he didn\u2019t received any reward from facebook as it requires some rules to be followed and Khalil had breached Facebook\u2019s privacy and security terms.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "Malware", "Online fraud", "Online scam", "Scam", "Social Media", "twitter", "Zeus"], "title": "Zeus Trojan returns: Targets Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn", "body": "During recent times, social media has by some distance defeated ordinary ways of trading.

Following up to this news, two of the Youtube downloading products: Best Video Downloader and Easy YouTube Downloader were suspended.The shocking factor of this news was the fact that all ad spaces were sold to few of the world\u2019s leading brands which include: Amazon, Blackberry, Kellog and Toyota. However, it is unlikely that these firms could have any idea about it. In actual these ad spaces were belonging to malvertisers.This program works in a systematic manner first it shows alerts to the Youtube users to install java update for better results. As soon as users click on to update, he/she is taken to some disreputable site. However, these alerts are only shown when a user has installed some malicious add-ons which are key for these advertisements to be injected into user\u2019s youtube home page and other page belonging.Users without these plugins are less likely to be affected through this malvertising. The security firm spider.io believes there are about 3.5 million users who are having these plugins installed. Youtube terms of services ban the users from downloading any video clips and just allows simple streaming.Google is now inspecting all the programmes that are affecting its users. Anyone found of doing it is banned from using any of the Google\u2019s monetization and marketing tools. As far as Sambreel is concerned it\u2019s not the first time  when the firm is accused. Last year, PaidContent reported Sambreel on launching programmes on the site which offered special deals and promised to customise web pages.

It is through the settings panel in the browser that all the password can be viewed without any encryption. Besides the password related to personal accounts, sensitive login details of companies would also be compromised in case the user who worked on Chrome leaves the computer unattended and with an active screen.Viewing of the passwords can be easily done by clicking the icon of settings and then choosing the tab \u2018\u2019show advanced settings\u2019\u2019 and then moving on to the tab \u2018\u2019Manage and save passwords\u2019\u2019 in the section that says \u2018\u2019Password and Forms\u2019\u2019. An obscured lists of passwords will then be visible for different sites and clicking besides such password will show plain text to these passwords. The text which is so revealed can be transferred to any outside source via copying it or by taking a screenshot.Justin Schuh who is the head of the Chrome Developer team said that they have been aware of the flaw and he also said that there was no plan to bring any changes to the system.Sir Tim Berners-Lee who is tagged as inventor of the web has termed the response to be very disappointing and he has also said that this flaw is a way to catch on all the sensitive logins and passwords of your big sisters.Chrome is among the three most used browsers in the world and has millions using it along with Internet Explorer from Microsoft and the Firefox browser. Chrome is seen as a crucial asset to the company in their future efforts of monetizing the use of web via typing the users to their Google accounts and then by developing synchronization between their mobile systems and their desktops.Elliot Kember who is from New Zealand and is based in UK is the software developer that has pointed out this flaw in Chrome Browser. He said that the people using this browser are the general public and they are not developers. He also said that Google has been so massive in advertising its browser on YouTube, on billboards and in cinema pre rolls and there is no way that people would want their passwords to be accessible so easily. To sum up, He said that the flaw is not okay at all.Some of the other browsers that had the same issue have closed them. The same flaw was revealed with Firefox back in 2010 as they were using the same plain text for the stored passwords but they added the option of master password to remove the flaw. So no password will be revealed unless the master password will be entered provided if the user has formulated a master password for the purpose. Some of the older versions of Internet Explorer were facing the same flaw previously. Safari which is the browser from Apple also requires the same master password before making any saved passwords visible.Schuh mentioned at hacker news that many have asked us the question that why we aren\u2019t going for a master password or anything similar to it even if we do not believe that it is going to work. We have carried out a lot of debates on the issue with the same result that we do not want to render our users with some false security options. We have made it very clear over and over again that when you provide access of your OS to any user, he/she can latch onto everything.However many developers are of a different view point and one of them said that the effectiveness of some safe can only be judged by the time needed to be invested for breaking it. No safe is unbreakable as it is the optimal effort, time span and the noise that is needed to break it open. Installing some software, dumping the cookies will require time but in the case of no such security, any person without having any technical knowledge can latch on to all the passwords within a few clicks.One of the security managers at some publishing company has said that the viewing of passwords in this manner tells that they are in reversible form when stored and this also means that dark coders can easily launch some Trojan to steal the passwords.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"topics": ["Barnaby Jack", "Barnaby Jack Dies", "Barnaby Jack's Death", "Black Hat Hacker Barnaby Jack", "hacking news", "Medical Devices Vulnerabilities", "SECURITY NEWS", "Vulnerability", "Vulnerability News"], "title": "Elite hacker who was due to demonstrate how heart implants could be hacked found dead", "body": "A high profile elite security researcher and a hacker Barnaby Jack unexpectedly passed away in San Francisco just days before he was due to demonstrate how heart implants can be hacked in order to kill a someone.The hacker was due to expose critical vulnerabilities present in medical device at the Black Hat security conference Las Vegas taking place next week.BBC reports that Earlier Jack claimed that he had found vulnerabilities in several medical devices which could allowed him to kill a man from 30 feet (nine metres) away.

The bug can enable a hacker to go on and remotely access any personal data that is contained within the phone and initiate unauthorized or illegal transactions within a matter of minutes.Karsten Nohl who is a very famous code breaker from Germany provided evidence related the programing flaw and an alert is now being sent to Mobile phone operating companies by the International Union of Telecommunication.The bug has a great potential of directly impacting the Plastic SIM card that contains key and essential information of the user and was previously considered to be quite secure. No such hacking has been seen in the last decade but there are threats that the bug is now quite evident and there is great risk of such invasion. Nohl through utilizing a hidden text message managed to obtain the distinct encryption key that a SIM card has and that allowed him to gain access over an individual\u2019s cell phone.Nohl stated to Reuters that we are now almost SIM cards and have the ability to do all what a normal cell user can do. If the user has information related to MasterCard or his/her PayPal account on the phone, we can gain access to it. Nohl also stated that the bug gives us the ability to exploit the user for both surveillance and for financial purposes.Nohl is a 31 years old hacker who is a very ethical man and performs the task of identifying and breaking into different systems of different companies and then provide them with such evidence so that these companies can go on and fix such flaws before any criminal mind can exploit it.Nohl stated that via using the OTA program or Over the Air Program, his team has been quite successful in breaking into SIM cards for good two years now. His program uses the unseen messages that are normally sent by cell phone operating companies for the purpose of changing the phone settings.He also stated that we were very close to giving up on this idea of breaking into the flaw and then we found it out accidentally.Nohl stated that when an incorrect OTA command was sent to the cell phone, it replied with an error message that contained the distinct encryption code that belonged to the cell phone and this encryption code is actually the virtual key to the phone. Nohl said that the code was decrypted easily and he managed to do it within a minute. After such decryption the phone is under the direct control of the hacker and can be easily operated through the computer without the user having any idea about it.This bug was however not present on all the SIM cards that are being used. His estimates suggested that a quarter of the SIM cards that are using the DES standard security system contain this bug. Though the DES system is slowly being phased out but still there are more than 3 Billion cell phones that contain such systems. This is the reason why he suggested that about 750 million active cell phone users are in danger of this bug. The other bad news is that the owner of such SIM cards cannot identify it easily whether there cell phones are susceptible to such bug or not.Nohl has already informed the concerned authorities about this serious flaw and also pointed out that about 6 months will be taken by hackers to be able to exploit this flaw. Nohl will provide all the details of his break in hackers conference that is about to take place at the end of this month in Las Vegas.The leading companies have gone on to acknowledge the facts about this flaw and have stated that they are making the desired provisions to counter it. The authorities have however calmed the people by stating that there has not been a single incident where such bug has been used to exploit users.The vice president of the Cyber security and technology, which is the largest mobile industry group in America, has stated that the hackers have no intention towards exploiting such flaw and this is not what they are inching for.General Hamadoun Toure who is the ITU secretary told Reuters that these facts indicate towards the path where we are leading to in terms of cyber security risks.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"topics": ["Android", "Android Vulnerability", "NSA", "NSA Spying", "NSA Surveillance News", "Snowden", "Spying", "Vulnerabilities"], "title": "Vulnerabilities in Android will allow NSA to strengthen its grip on users", "body": "Just a few days after the reports on vulnerability in the android devices, more shocking news are disclosed.

According to a recent report that has been published by the Federal Reserve of US, around 48 percent of the smartphone users in the last 12 months have used the mobile banking platform for carrying out their monetary transactions with banks. This number has gone up by 6 percent as it was around 42 percent back in December last year. Approximately half of the smartphone devices users have installed mobile banking transaction apps in their devices and are using them for such activities.Anti-virus and online security provider Mcafee reported recently that a Trojan has replaced a famous South Korean mobile banking app with some malware. Well this is quite alarming for the ones using that app. This malware steals confidential information of the user for the purpose of conducting various types of financial frauds. It is very much similar to other mobile threats that have been reported in South Korea. This malware uses the SMS Phishing or smishing (SMS phishing) attacks by sending fake messages to users on behalf of the commission of financial services asking such users to set up new anti-malware app for their devices. The short URL that it provides for the purpose when clicked starts downloading the malware which appears like a Google application with the play store symbol but no other label.The victim when executes this malware, it scrolls the device and checks that if the users has any of the following banking applications installed i.e. KB Kookmin Card ( by the largest credit card corporation of the country), Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank, Nonghyup Bank, Hana Bank, KFCC or SC First Bank. If any or all of such banking apps are detected by the malware, the device will be routed and a de-installation of the banking app will be performed without notifying the user. The following commands for rooting are executed of the purpose.However if the user has not got the device rooted, the malware or the fake app will ask the user to de-install the original banking app. In exchange it will offer the user to install another banking application with similar icon but with suspicious permissions.This newly installed fake app will be contained in assets folder of the malware app that the victim originally installed under instruction of the fake SMS. The newly installed replacement app is basically the original malware but has menus and icons which have been customized with reference the legitimate banking apps as have been mentioned above. This allows the malware to catch on the confidential financial information of the victim user. For some of the banks that have been mentioned earlier, the Phishing attack also renders a report to the user that the app link being provided has been certified and attested by Yessign which is a certification authority of South Korea. This certification or report asks the user to give assent to the terms that have been mentioned in the certificate for allowing it to collect personal information for use. This ensures the user that the app being offered is an authentic app of the banking company though it isn\u2019t.The malware app sometimes even ask the user to feed in banking credential like social security no, account password, account no, withdrawal account no, banking ID, User ID, Resident registration no and password etc.Then the malware tries to gain the values and serial number of the grid card followed up by asking for certificate password which is another factor for authentication.For KFCC and Nonghyup banks, it only asks for information in one interface: social security no, name, cell phone no, user password and ID, serial number and security card no, user password and account no.The acquired information is later transmitted to a server through HTTP along with the victim\u2019s cell phone number. Apart from the Phishing attack, following functions can also be performed at the backend by this malware and that too without any permission or approval from the victim.Considering the fact that the use of android mobile applications for conducting banking transaction has increased so much, there is a prominent risk that such malware can emerge in other regions of the world such as America and Europe and can cause huge loss of funds to people. The malware threat which is targeting banking transaction through mobile has emerged from a joint PC attack for mobiles e.g. Spitmo and Zitmo. Similarly it uses Phishing attacks through the use of apps like the Fake token and via using SMS messages where a URL is provided for downloading an infected replacement app in place of the legitimate or authentic app of the baking company for the purpose of obtaining various authentication factors. These authentications as has been discussed above include account password, certificate password, mTANs sent through SMS and information about the grid card. This malware also operates in a conventional android malware manner i.e. it sends SMS without the permission of the victim.Now comes the point of how to detect if any such malware has infected your device or how to get rid of it. Mcafee Android mobile security indicates any such threat or malware as Andriod/FakeBankDropper.A and as Andriod/FakeBank.A. It notifies the victim if any such threat is found and also protects the device from any sort of data loss.

In addition, the ability of the virus can be greater, it is capable of modifying messages, URLs, Facebook pages at any time.Finally, although the malware appears to have been designed with a focus on targets Brazilians, Microsoft concludes that the Trojans can easily be modified to attack users in other regions.Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"topics": ["@WilyXem", "SECURITY NEWS", "SQL Vulnerable Sites", "Technology news", "Vulnerability News"], "title": "Websites of Pakistan Army, Vatican Catholic Church and Italian Chamber of Commerce Vulnerable to SQL Injection", "body": "A hacker going with the handle of @WilyXem on Twitter has claimed to found SQL vulnerabilities on the official website of Pakistan Army,  Vatican Catholic Church and  Italian Chamber of Commerce.WilyXem explained that these vulnerabilities can be further exploited easily to deface or access the secret information on the server.Details of each vulnerability with its screenshot is mentioned below, all screenshots have been provided by WilyXem.

Instead, the attackers took advantage of an existing WordPress vulnerability and abused the site, herding it into a voluntary botnet. WordPress has a built in functionality called Pingback, which allows anyone to initiate a request from WordPress to an arbitrary site. The functionality should be used to generate cross references between blogs, but it can just as easily be used for a single machine to originate millions of requests from multiple locations.It turns out that most WordPress sites are susceptible to this abuse. Since this feature is enabled by default, and there is no protection mechanism within WordPress against it.Hi-Res VersionThis gives any attacker a virtually limitless set of IP addresses to Distribute a Denial of Service attack across a network of over 100 million WordPress sites, without having to compromise them.Some of the largest news and media sites are hosted on WordPress these days and each of these sites carry lots of DDoS firepower that can be exploited in this way. Some of the more noticeable sites that were found to be exploitable included Venturebeat.com, TechCrunch.com, TheNextWeb.com, WordPress.org itself and apparently Kobe now has another Achilles\u2019 heel at kobebryant.com.It doesn\u2019t take any coding to take advantage of this vulnerability and induce these third party requests.Using a UNIX command line tool, it\u2019s as easy as executing:This would cause example.com to send an HTTP request to the target. Run a few thousand of these in parallel, and you have the equivalent of a modest botnet, with a virtually unlimited pool of source IPs. Most websites cannot withstand even a few hundreds of requests per second \u2013 especially if these are requests that take up a lot of resources.The Pingback mechanism has been known to be a security risk for some time. In fact, just last December an exploit was posted on Github that allows users to perform port scanning using this mechanism. It was made public by Acunetix. At the time, Bogdan Calin from Acunetix also mentioned the possibility of launching Denial of Service attacks using Pingback, which was already a known issue.The vulnerability (CVE-2013-0235) was fixed in WordPress 3.5.1, by applying some filtering on allowed URLs. This solved the issues of attempted port scanning and SSRF, but other than that left the functionality intact, without any additional mechanism to prevent abuse. The six year old bug #4137 \u2013 \u201cPingback Denial of Service possibility\u201d, remains terminally open.What has made this surface is the fact that, until recently, the whole xmlrpc mechanism was disabled by default. WordPress 3.5 was released with this feature enabled and exploitable, by default. Any website with Pingback functionality enabled is susceptible, and can be used by hackers to launch Denial of Service attacks.Most of these websites, especially the larger ones, felt very little impact from their participation in the attack. Beyond the attacked sites themselves, only the smallest websites might be penalized for increased bandwidth consumption, and only in extreme cases would a hoster feel a strain on their bandwidth or CPU.If you leave a door open, someone will figure out how to exploit it, and the size of the internet amplifies it. Like misconfigured DNS resolvers allow attackers to amplify bandwidth attack, these websites allow attackers to amplify their IP distribution and add an extra layer between their targets and their true identity.[Via: Incapsula]Follow @HackRead ", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"topics": ["Danish Tariq", "SECURITY NEWS", "Vulnerability News", "XSS vulnerability"], "title": "Pakistani Researcher Founds Critical XSS Vulnerability on Brazzers, BMW, Toyota and Ford Website", "body": "Earlier I updated readers with latest vulnerabilities that were found on IndiaTimes and ASK.com by a Pakistani security researcher Danish Tariq, this time he is back with couple of more vulnerabilities.

It is basically a Trojan Virus which is really malicious for Android phones and is sent an email which has the title of world Uyghur conference related to human right activists coming from China, Tibet, Mongolia and Turkestan.Kaspersky has also said that this attack is the first one which has been specifically designed from Android phones because the ones which were launched previously were for Mac and windows computers though they were against the same groups.A senior official of the research time at Kaspersky lab, Mr. Baumgartner exclaimed in an interview that this Trojan virus is the first one which has been launched to Target Android phones through a public documentation. Attacks have been devised in the past and the Android malware is also not a new one, but it is the first instance of a targeted attack which has been publicly documented.The file which is being used in the attack is Android application package (.apk) and is used to install and distribute various applications on the operating systems of Google\u2019s mobiles. One of the Tibetan activists on 24th March received such a file which invited him to open the attachment which titled being a letter from the officials of the organization of human rights.After the application starts, a virus penetrates into the command and control server which is though situated in Los Angeles but is registered with a company that is located in Beijing. The app signals to the server that the virus has penetrated into the phone and then it functions to hack data from the cell phone such as SMS, contacts etc.Mr. Baumgartner also told us that the malware after infection does not starts to steal data on an immediate note and gives time to the process so that more data is stored on the phone and then the hackers can get the information which may be stored by the users after a specific time or a specific meeting which he/she is about to attend.The malware which is still believed by Kaspersky lab as some prototype may have been devised by Chinese hackers because it contains some words in The Chinese language along with the words in Tibetan.Mr. Baumgartner added that though the reason or cause behind the virus may be cyber espionage but whether the hackers have been sponsored by some state is still to be seen. The technical and the social engineering strategy of the malware have both been on a sound note because the malware used the account of a Tibetan activist to attack some Uyghur activist. This is something which has been previously used as war strategies where trusts and confidence between groups were exploited for different purposes.So, Android users for now should prevent the opening of APK files which are attached to some email unless and until the source is a truly trusted one.Follow @HackRead", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "March 28, 2013"}]
