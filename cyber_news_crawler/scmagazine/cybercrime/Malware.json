ESET spokesperson Anna Keeve told SC Media via email that the malware behaves similarly to the PlugX RAT, which is also nicknamed Korplug and has existed since 2012; however, the two programs are not to be confused with each other.\n\nOceanLotus, aka APT32 and APT-C-00, has been distributing the backdoor, which ESET discovered several months ago, via spear phishing emails and watering hole campaigns.\n\nThe phishing emails include attached malicious documents containing the dropper Win32/TrojanDropper.Agent.RUI, which delivers Korplug while also presenting users with a legit-looking decoy document. Often written in English or Vietnamese, sample decoys have presented themselves as technical specs on an Mi-17 Russian helicopter, a fake resume, various business documents, and a document containing details of a complaint sent to the Vietnamese telecom company Saigontel.\n\nThe compromised websites used in watering hole attacks attempt to trick visitors into thinking they're installing an installer or software update, when they're actually downloading a dropper that once again produces Korplug. In a full technical write-up, ESET reports that one dropper, RobototFontUpdate.exec, comes disguised as a fake font update, while another pretends to be a repackaged Firefox installer.\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the RobototFontUpdate.exec dropper found that it leveraged heavy code obfuscation and even some garbage code to thwart any attempts at detection. After establishing persistence and deleting the lure document, the dropper produces two more files: a digitally-signed executable from a real software developer \u2013 McAfee and Symantec among them \u2013 and the Korplug backdoor, in the form of a malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file with the same name as the aforementioned executable (but with a different extension).\n\n\u201cThe two files figure in a tried-and-tested trick called \u2018DLL side-loading', which consists in co-opting a legitimate application's library-loading process by planting a malicious DLL inside the same folder as the signed executable,\u201d the ESET blog post explains. \u201cThis is a way to remain under the radar, since a trusted application with a valid signature is less likely to arouse suspicion.\u201d\n\nAfter it's officially executed, Korplug fingerprints the infected system, sends the victim's computer and OS data to the command-and-control server, and waits for commands.\n\n\u201cOnce again, OceanLotus shows that the team is active and continues to update its toolset. This also demonstrates its intention to remain hidden by picking its targets, limiting the distribution of their malware and using several different servers to avoid attracting attention to a single domain or IP\u00a0address,\u201d the blog post concludes. \u201cThe encryption of the payload, together with the side-loading technique \u2013 despite its age \u2013 is a good way to stay under the radar, since the malicious activities look like they come from the legitimate application.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Middleboxes in Turkish telecom redirecting users to nation-state spyware", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/middleboxes-in-turkish-telecom-redirecting-users-to-nation-state-spyware/article/750892/", "title": "Middleboxes in Turkish telecom redirecting users to nation-state spyware", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "March 14, 2018", "body": "According to Citizen Lab researchers, Turkish internet users trying to download legitimate Windows applications from official vendor websites such as Avast Antivirus, CCleaner, Opera, and 7-Zip are being redirected to malicious websites that are infested with malware.

The malware looks to steal personal and device information from several sources existing on the device including mainstream chat, communication, and social media apps that are already on a user's device and installs legitimate versions of applications that provide the advertised services in order to trick users into thinking they downloaded the correct application.\n\nSome of the legitimate apps that are used as decoys can be found on Google Play but the malware laced version have so far only been found on third party app stores. Henbox was linked to a malicious DroidVPN app yet researchers noted that about one-third of the HenBox apps contained embedded APK objects that did not refer to legitimate apps.\u00a0\n\nThe malware was linked to infrastructure used in separate targeted political attacks in South East Asia and attackers that have previously used PlugX, Zupdax, 9002, and Poison Ivy in attacks dating back to 2015. Researchers said the app has evolved over the last three years and that the vast majority of apps contain several native libraries and other components that allow them to achieve their objective. \n\n\u201cMost components are obfuscated in some way, whether it be simple XOR with a single-byte key, or through the use of ZIP or Zlib compression wrapped with RC4 encryption,\u201d researchers said in the blog. \u201cThese components are responsible for a myriad of functions including handling decryption, network communications, gaining super-user privileges, monitoring system logs, loading additional Dalvik code files, tracking the device location and more.\u201d\n\nIn order to prevent infection researcher recommend users keep installed apps updated,\u00a0review app permissions to see what the app is potentially capable of exploiting and\u00a0avoid\u00a0third-party app stores that may host pirated versions of paid apps from the Google Play app store. \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyberespionage/topic/47252/", "topic_name": "Cyberespionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}]}, {"news_name": "Mac malware rockets 270 percent - users warned 'safe' perception is wrong", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mac-malware-rockets-270-percent--users-warned-safe-perception-is-wrong/article/750750/", "title": "Mac malware rockets 270 percent - users warned 'safe' perception is wrong", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "March 13, 2018", "body": "Malwarebytes has released figures that show that in the year 2017 alone, Mac threats increased more than 270 per cent, while malware targeting Mac operating systems more than doubled from 2016 to 2017.\n\nIn a supporting blogpost, the company highlighted four case studies from 2018 that demonstrated a \u2018similar pace of malware development'. The first, OSX.MaMi, changes DNS settings on infected Mac computers, and also installs a new trusted root certificate in the keychain. \u201cBy redirecting the computer's DNS lookups to a malicious server, the hackers behind this malware could direct traffic to legitimate sites, such as bank sites, Amazon, and Apple's iCloud/Apple ID services, to malicious phishing sites. The addition of a new certificate could be used to perform a \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack, making these phishing sites appear to be legitimate\u201d, said the researchers. \n\nDavid Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab told SC Media UK that while Mac malware may still be relatively rare compared to the vast volumes aimed at Windows, Mac malware tends to be more targeted: \u201cWhen it comes to targeted attacks the creators of APTs have been active in ensuring their code is as multi-platform as possible. There are plenty of examples of multiple platform-capable targeted attacks that include Mac malware.\u201d \n\nIndeed, Malwarebytes second example was a piece of nation-state malware, called Dark Caracal, including a new Java-based cross-platform RAT (remote access tool, aka backdoor), that is capable of infecting Macs, among other systems. Another technique highlighted is the supply chain attack, an example being OSX.CreativeUpdate, where the MacUpdate website was hacked, and a variety of popular downloads were replaced with malicious links that ultimately installed Monero-mining malware. \n\n\u201cThis would result in the computer slowing down and the fans starting to run at high speed. This has a number of negative impacts, such as significant hits on the performance of the computer, reduced battery life, increased usage of electricity, and even potential for overheating the computer and damaging the hardware (especially if the fans were not working at peak capacity or the vents were clogged with dust), noted the researchers.\n\n\u201cCertainly, as the Mac market share has increased we have seen increases in attacks. We've also seen huge rises in platform independent attacks such as phishing, as well as browser-based attacks, such as Java coin miners, as well as redirection attacks\u201d, commented Emm. \u201cCrypto-mining malware has seen a significant rise across the board of late, partly due to mainstream adoption, and partly due to the relatively low barriers to success. Unlike a successful ransomware attack, which requires network infiltration, encryption of data and then a ransom payment, drive-by coin mining is a much less convoluted route from user PC to monetary reward for the attacker.\u201d\n\nThe most recent piece of Mac malware highlighted by Malwarebytes is called OSX.Coldroot, and is a generic backdoor, albeit compromised by as variety of bugs and OS dependencies (installation will fail on macOS 10.11 El Capitan, or later).\n\n\u201cThe dangers of seeing the Mac platform as being immune to malware are significant, and there is the added dimension of Macs being \u2018carriers' of malware in a mixed business environment. I think we'll see most Mac malware activity in the targeted attack area during 2018, due to the simple question of ROI - it costs proportionally more to develop Mac malware, so there has to be a clear reason to do so for attackers\u201d, summarised Emm.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link":

tool, the Remote Control System (RCS), were spotted in the wild throughout fourteen countries, according to ESET researchers.\n\nThe RCS features include the ability to extract files from a target's device, intercept emails and instant messages, and remotely activate webcams and microphones.\n\nResearchers choose not to name the countries to prevent potentially incorrect attributions based on the detections, but said the recently spotted malware is indeed the work of Hacking Team developers, and not the result of source code reuse by unrelated actors, according to a March 9 ESET blog post.\n\nResearchers uncovered several samples of Hacking Team's spyware created after the 2015 hack, all of which had been slightly modified compared to variants released before the source code leak.\n\nThe changes introduced in the post-leak updates were made in line with Hacking Team's own coding style and are often found in places indicating a deep familiarity with the code making it unlikely that another threat actor created the newer version, the post said. \n\nResearchers said its highly unlikely that that anyone other than the original Hacking Team developer(s) \u2013 would make changes in exactly the places when creating new versions from the leaked Hacking Team source code.\n\nThe samples were compiled between September 2015 and October 2017 and were deemed to be authentic based on telemetry data indicating the appearance of the samples in the wild within a\u00a0few days of those dates, researchers said. .\n\n\u00a0\u201cOne indicator supporting this is the sequence of digital certificates used to sign the samples \u2013 we found six different certificates issued in succession,\u201d researchers said in the report. \u201cFour of the certificates were issued by Thawte to four different companies, and two are personal certificates issued to Valeriano Bedeschi (Hacking Team co-founder) and someone named Raffaele Carnacina\u201d\n\nThe spyware also

basketball players in the country vie for the national championship in a breathless whirlwind of games this month and worrying over brackets, aren't enough, fans must now consider the prowess of cybercriminals who likely will bring a little March Madness of their own to bear.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMarch Madness is back and with it comes a great opportunity for cybercriminals who are intent on making some quick cash,\u201d said Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum.\u00a0\u201cEmail infection, fake betting websites and traditional phishing attacks are all expected to have their day in the sun.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLike any other major sporting event that draws millions of viewers, March Madness will attract bad actors trying \u201cto make money using time-tested, fraudulent means,\u201d said Dan Lohrmann, chief security officer at Security Mentor. \u201cThese online trends almost always play out before, during and after the events take place. Cybercriminals are completely prepared for the excitement and hype surrounding March Madness by\u00a0infecting emails\u00a0with malware, creating fake betting websites and growing the number of phishing attacks they carry out.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, bad actors are out for money, according to Ajay Menendez, executive Director, HUNT Analyst Program\u00a0at SecureSet, smishing or phishing potential victims to install malware and eventually tap bank and other accounts. \u201cThere are many other actions they can take to either directly or indirectly score these criminal actors money, said Menendez.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey could simply encrypt your files and then hold you for ransom, ergo ransomware.\u00a0 They could utilize your system as part of a large zombie army and resell that as a paid service to others.\u201d\n\nFending off cybercriminals should be a slam-dunk for fans who take precautions to protect themselves, the pros said. \u201cFirst of all, avoid emailed requests to participate in polls, surveys and contests related to March Madness, unless you know that you personally signed up to be a part of such things from a known, and reputable, site,\u201d said Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at AsTech. \u201cUnsolicited appeals to sign up and provide information may be efforts to steal your personal information.

Is this a site that you've seen before?\u201d He explained that \u201cit is far better to use a well-known brand or one you or colleagues/family/friends have used in the past. Did you really place that bet and have you really scooped the pot?\u00a0 The number of \u201cwinners\u201d over the next couple of weeks will be pretty astonishing, however, just be sure you're on the right side and don't end up becoming another statistic on the losing side.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Slingshot APT campaign exposed after six years of sophisticated spying", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/slingshot-apt-campaign-exposed-after-six-years-of-sophisticated-spying/article/750416/", "title": "Slingshot APT campaign exposed after six years of sophisticated spying", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "March 12, 2018", "body": "A cyber espionage campaign bearing all of the hallmarks of an extremely advanced nation-state actor used malware to spy on international targets for six years before it was finally detected and exposed, Kaspersky Lab\u00a0reported on Friday.\n\nDubbed Slingshot, the clandestine campaign heavily targeted the Middle East and Africa, and employed uncommonly sophisticated tactics for remaining invisible while exfiltrating troves of information, according to Kaspersky, whose researchers made the discovery last February. For instance, the adversaries were found to have compromised routers from Latvia-based Mikrotik to deliver a malicious downloader that executes additional malicious code, including two never-before-seen payloads.\n\nOne of these final payloads,\u00a0GollumApp, contains nearly 1,500 user-code functions and is responsible for persistence, file system control and command-and-control communications. The other,\u00a0Canhadr, or NDriver, provides kernel-level access to the hard drive and operating memory, while avoiding debugging and security detection measures. Even more impressively, it is able to execute malicious code while in kernel mode, without crashing the file system or triggering a Blue Screen -- something Kaspersky calls a \"remarkable achievement\" in an FAQ\u00a0web page\u00a0describing the campaign.\n\nKernel access means that the actors have total control and unfettered access to screenshots, keyboard activity, network data, passwords, USB connections, desktop activity, clipboard savings, personal information including Social Security numbers, and more. \"There are no restrictions, no limitations, and no protection for the user (or none that the malware can't easily bypass),\" the Kaspersky FAQ page warns, noting that the campaign was still active as of its analysis.\n\nKaspersky made its big discovery when an investigation into a suspected keylogger turned up a malicious DLL file that's capable of interacting with a virtual file system and acting as a malicious downloader. This DLL, named Slingshot (which gave the overall campaign its eponymous name), replaces the victim\u00b4s legitimate Windows library \"scesrv.dll\" with a malicious version, allowing the attackers to interact with various modules and further compromise the machine with malware.\n\nKaspersky researchers believe the attackers have used several different attack vectors for introducing the Slingshot malware. But so far, most of the observed infections were executed by somehow smuggling the malicious DLL into an package of otherwise legitimate DLLs that are routinely processed by Mikrotik routers. Once the Mikrotik server's administrator was infected, Slingshot could then begin loading the secondary-stage spyware.\n\nThe researchers suspect that the attackers are likely also exploiting Windows vulnerabilities as an alternative vector, although they do not know of a specific exploit in use. \"During our research, we discovered a campaign component that was developed to download main components of this APT to the victim computer, but this component was not involved in the [Mikrotik router] scheme. That's why we assumed that it may have been used in other initial attack vectors, explained\u00a0Alexey Shulmin, lead malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, in an interview with SC Media.\n\nKaspersky also thinks some victims could have been infected through other routers -- a theory supported by the presence of another malicious downloader component called KPWS.\n\nThe actors behind Slingshot were able to hide their activity for years by employing a variety of evasive maneuvers, including string encryption in its modules, calling system services directly to bypass security product hooks, and anti-debugging techniques, Kaspersky reports. Also, whenever the malware detects signs of a system shutdown or another significant event, it can shut down its components while still ensuring they complete their tasks cleanly and properly, without any leftover forensic traces.\n\nKaspersky says it knows of roughly 100 Slingshot targets located in Kenya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya, Congo, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia and Tanzania.\u00a0Most of these targets are individuals, but a few are government organizations and institutions.\n\nWhile Kaspersky doesn't explicitly attribute the campaign to a particular actor, it does note that clues in the code point to an English-speaking adversary. \"Researchers have also observed some technique similarities between Slingshot and the threat actor known as Grey Lambert,\" said Shulmin. \"However, accurate attribution is always hard, if not impossible to determine, and increasingly prone to manipulation and error.\"\n\nThe Lambert threat actor family, also known as Longhorn, has historically been linked by experts to the CIA.\n\nKaspersky also reports on its FAQ page that Slingshot's complexity is similar to that of the malware programs ProjectSauron and Regin, which have commonly been linked to the NSA. While it does not go unnoticed that the newly discovered GollumApp payload is, like Sauron, a\u00a0Lord of the Rings\u00a0character reference, Shulmin claims that Kaspersky wasn't actually saying ProjectSauron's authors are behind Slingshot.\n\nSo far, researchers have seen around 100 victims of Slingshot and its related modules, located in Kenya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya, Congo, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia and Tanzania. Most of the victims appear to be targeted individuals rather than organizations, but there are some government organizations and institutions.

According to Avast, its researchers found that four Piriform computers were infected with the cybercriminal tool\u00a0ShadowPad, which gives attackers remote control capabilities as well as additional modular functionalities such as keylogging and password stealing.\n\n\u201c\u2026We found out that the keylogger had been active since April 12th, 2017, recording keystrokes on these computers, including keylogs from Visual Studio and other programs,\u201d states blog post authors Vince Steckler, Avast CEO, and Ondrej Vlcek, EVP and GM of the consumer business unit. \u201cThe version of the ShadowPad tool is custom-built, which makes us think it was explicitly built for Piriform. By installing a tool like ShadowPad, the cybercriminals were able to fully control the system remotely while collecting credentials and insights into the operations on the targeted computer.\u201d\n\nShadowPad is believed to originate from the Chinese hacker group Axiom, whose code was already spotted in the original first-stage CCleaner malware by Kaspersky Lab researcher Costin Raiu.\u00a0(Cisco Talos later confirmed this connection to the Chinese actor, which it calls APT 17 or Group 72.)\n\nInjected in August 2017 and discovered a month later, the first-stage malware is essentially a backdoor that initially compromised machines and enabled the attackers to exfiltrate non-sensitive data about them. Of these impacted machines, only about 40 PCs operated by high-tech and telecommunications companies were further infected by a second-stage malware \u2013 leading researchers to conclude that the scheme was a supply chain attack designed infected a large pool of victims, from which a select targeted few would be further compromised.\n\nThere is no evidence that ShadowPad ever found its way onto any computer beyond the four Piriform machines \u2013 suggesting that remediation of the original attack may have foiled the attackers'\u00a0plans before they were executed.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/web-security/topic/47254/", "topic_name": "Web Security"}]}, {"news_name": "RedisWannaMine cryptojacking attack exploits EternalBlue vulnerability and public Redis servers", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/rediswannamine-cryptojacking-attack-exploits-eternalblue-vulnerability-and-public-redis-servers/article/750096/", "title": "RedisWannaMine cryptojacking attack exploits EternalBlue vulnerability and public Redis servers", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "March 09, 2018", "body": "A newly discovered and unusually sophisticated cryptojacking attack attempts\u00a0to install cryptominers on both database and application servers by targeting misconfigured Redis servers, as well as Windows servers that are susceptible to the EternalBlue NSA exploit.\n\nResearchers with Imperva uncovered the threat\u00a0when its web application sensors detected signs of a remote code execution attack exploiting an Apache Struts vulnerability. Dubbing the attack \"RedisWannaMine,\" Imperva warns in a Mar. 8 blog post that compared to most cryptojacking threats, this one is\u00a0\"more complex in terms of evasion techniques and capabilities. It demonstrates a worm-like behavior combined with advanced exploits to increase the attackers' infection rate and fatten their wallets.\"\n\nAfter probing the remote host associated with the attack, Imperva's researchers found several suspicious files, including\u00a0\"transfer.sh,\" a cryptominer downloader. Upon successful infection, this shell script file installs a publicly available tool called \"masscan\" that is billed on GitHub as\u00a0an Internet port scanner that can sweep the entire internet in five minutes.\n\nArmed with the masscan tool, transfer.sh can now launch a process called \"redisscan.sh\" to discover and infect public Redis servers included within a large list of IPs, via port 6379. (Redis describes itself as an \"open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.\") using\u00a0redis-cli\u00a0command line tool, that the downloader previously installed, that runs the \u201cruncmd\u201d payload command script, which infects the server and gains persistence.\n\nBut this is just the first of two attack vectors.

Cybercriminals are therefore counting on infected users being inattentive when they paste the modified destination information.\n\nAccording to Palo Alto, ComboJack targets four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero. In that sense, it is very reminiscent of\u00a0CryptoShuffler, another thieving malware that modifies cryptocurrency wallet information, discovered in 2017 by Kaspersky Lab. However, unlike CryptoShuffler, ComboJack also goes after digital payment systems too -- specifically, Qiwi, WebMoney (transactions in USD or rubles) and Yandex Money.\n\n\"By targeting multiple cryptocurrencies and web based wallets, the author of ComboJack appears to be hedging his or her bets on which currency will boom and which will bust,\" the blog post explains.\n\nWhile the malware's tactic is clever, its early results don't appear impressive. While it is not possible to track the activity of all of the malicious wallets -- Monero's emphasis on privacy doesn't allow it, for instance -- the ones Palo Alto can observe have no funds in them, as of the writing of this article. \"It was a pretty low-volume attack and requires quite a bit of luck on the attacker's side to properly execute, so that's likely why it has more or less been unsuccessful,\" Grunzweig told SC Media in an email interview.\n\nPalo Alto and Proofpoint found the malware on Feb. 25 while examining an email-based malspam campaign targeting American and Japanese users. The email purports to come from an individual named Kim Moon, who claims that someone has lost a passport. The spam attempts to trick recipients into opening an attachment of what appears to be a PDF image of the recovered travel document.\n\nOpening this PDF file reveals a single line of text that includes an embedded RTF file, that exploits\u00a0CVE-2017-8579, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Microsoft DirectX, to load an embedded remote object. This object, an HTA (HTML Application) file, runs a PowerShell script that commences a string of self-extracting executables (SFX) that ultimately yields the final payload of ComboJack.\n\nComboJack then uses the Windows tool attrib.exe to set its own attributes, allowing the malware to hides its file from the user and execute with SYSTEM level privileges, Unit 42 reports. After establishing persistence, ComboJack next begins checking the contents of the victim device's clipboard for wallet for payment information every half-second.\n\n\"Each type of wallet address follows its own, different naming convention,\" said Grunzweig to SC Media. \"For example, a Monero wallet uses a length of 95 or 106 and starts with \u20184'. The malware is hardcoded to look for different wallet types based on its convention and if it finds it, replaces it with its own wallet information.\"\n\nAs Palo Alto Intelligence Director Ryan Olsen noted in a separate company blog post on Tuesday, there has been a marked increase in cybercriminal cryptomining activity over the last six months.\u00a0But crypto wallet stealers have also emerged as another option for adversaries to capitalize on the cryptocurrency craze.\n\nOf the two, cryptomining malware is generally more attractive to cybercriminals, said Grunzweig, in that it is a \"more efficient monetization of attacks. On the other hand, the wallet-stealing malware, while \"more hit and miss,\" is also more \"likely to net a bigger payoff when it does hit,\" he added.\n\nPatrick Wheeler, director of threat intelligence at Proofpoint, shared a similar point of view: \"There are different approaches to using infected clients to steal cryptocurrencies: from a wait-and-see approach (clipboard replacing like ComboJack) to actively rifling through the filesystem (as with an information stealer) to active CPU usage using a coin mining bot,\" he said, in an email interview with SC Media.\n\n\"Stealing wallets can gain a lot of money from a victim, but only if they're holding cryptocurrency, so you have a small chance of success, but a potentially large payout when you do succeed. Cryptocurrency coin mining is the inverse: every single infected computer can be used to mine cryptocurrency, so it has guaranteed success but a low payout. Cybercriminals follow the money, and in this case they have a choice between a very low probability of a small return, or a very high probability of a small return.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "Recently patched Flash vulnerability spotted in massive malspam campaign", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/the-vulnerability-was-spotted-in-a-new-campaign-with-changes-made-to-bypass-traditional-static-detection-systems/article/748049/", "title": "Recently patched Flash vulnerability spotted in massive malspam campaign", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "March 02, 2018", "body": "A recently patched Flash Player flaw was exploited in a widespread attack spam campaign primarily targeting South Koreans.\n\nThe vulnerability was first spotted in the wild as part of a different malspam campaign in late January 2018 by the South Korean Computer Emergency Response Team (KR-CERT), in attacks launched by the North Korean threat group APT 37, also known as Group 123, according to a Feb. 4 Security Boulevard blog post.\n\nResearchers from the Hauri security firm, however believe the exploit has been in use since November 2017.

Wandera found RedDrop to be extremely dangerous and destructive. In a single drive by attack it can deliver seven or more more malicious APKs unbeknownst to the victim from its C&C server that have a wide variety of malicious activities.\n\nThese include trojans, droppers, spyware and data extractors. Some of the information the latter malware removes include photos, contacts, images, audio recordings of the device's surrounding area and device related information. \n\nThe malicious apps themselves pose as everything from space exploration to image editors and calculators. Wandera pointed out that each app is well designed and fully functional, which helps make it look innocent to the user.\n\n\u201cThis multifaceted hybrid attack is entirely unique. The maliciuos actor cleverly uses a seemingly helpful app to front an incredibly complex operation with malicious intent. This is one of the more persistent malware variants we've seen,\u201d said Dr Michael Covington, VP of Product Strategy at Wandera.\n\nThe type of information that is pulled from the device is destructive on both the personal and possibly corporate level.

But in 2017, the adversary \u2013 also known as Group123 \u2013 reached beyond the Korean peninsula, reports FireEye. Among its targets were a Middle Eastern financial company that provides telecommunications services, a Vietnamese trading and transport company, and also possibly individuals who help Olympics organizations procure resources for athletes.\n\nOne possible reason the Middle Eastern financial firm was chosen as the target of an APT37 spear phishing campaign was because a business relationship it had formed with an unnamed North Korean company had publicly soured, FireEye suggests. \u00a0Reportedly, Reaper actors sent one of the company's board members a fake bank liquidation letter, in the form an attachment that exploited the Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 to deliver \u201cSHUTTERSPEED\u201d backdoor malware, capable of harvesting system information, grabbing screenshots and downloading other malicious files.\n\nOther recent targets, according to FireEye, include individuals tied to North Korean human rights issues and strategic organizations, an unnamed entity in Japan linked to United Nations sanctioning and human rights missions, and South Korean academic and strategic institutions.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional redlines and international norms. Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity,\u201d FireEye states in its report. \u201cWe anticipate APT37 will be leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts on their sponsor.\u201d \n\nJust last month, Cisco Systems' Talos research team similarly profiled APT37's 2017 activities in its own research blog post. Additional reports linking the Adobe Flash attack to Reaper then broke in early February.\n\nFireEye has also observed Reaper grow in sophistication, noting a \u201chigh operational tempo and specialized expertise,\u201d with a particular affinity for quickly utilizing exploits \u2013 especially Flash ones \u2013 shortly after they are publicized. The group is also known to use a combination of spear phishing emails, website compromises, and torrent file-sharing sites to distribute malware.\n\nInterestingly, one of the strongest clues that APT37 acts in support of the North Korean government was reportedly uncovered after the presumed developer of several Reaper malware payloads mistakenly disclosed his own personal data, revealing he was operating from an IP address and access point linked to the dictatorial nation. FireEye also has noted that the compilation times of APT37 malware programs are consistent with North Korea's typical workday hours, and that Reaper's targets are consistent with North Korean objectives.\n\nFireEye reports that APT37 generally favors malware that exfiltrates information from victims \u2013 although one of its payloads, RUHAPPY, can also serve as a destructive disk wiper.\n\nWary of Pyongyang's cyber aggression and threats of nuclear strikes, the U.S. may be developing plans to strike North Korean targets with a \u201cbloody nose\u201d attack that relies primarily on cyberwarfare tactics, as opposed to conventional weapons, according a report in Foreign Policy magazine that cites two former intelligence officials.

The first two are 32-bit, Windows-based dynamic link library (DLL) executables, which configure the Windows Firewall to allow incoming connections, thus allowing machines to function as proxies. Illicit communications are masked as HTTPS sessions by leveraging public certificates sourced from legitimate Internet services. In reality, however, the traffic is actually encrypted using an unidentified algorithm.\n\nAccompanying these two DLL files is an Android-based Executable Linkable Format (ELF) file that connects to hard-coded Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and acts as a RAT program.\n\nBADCALL is also composed of three separate files -- and as with HARDRAIN, the first two are Windows executables designed to disable the firewall (by modifying a registry key) and transform infected systems into proxy servers. They, too, disguise malicious C2 communications as encrypted HTTPS traffic, but in actuality they encrypt their activity using a rudimentary cipher (XOR/ADD and SUB/XOR, respectively).\n\nThe third file, meanwhile, is an Android Package Kit (APK) that, according to the BADCALL report, acts as a RAT program \"capable of recording phone calls, taking screenshots using the device's embedded camera, reading data from the contact manager, and downloading and uploading data from the compromised Android device.\" It can also execute commands and scan for open Wi-Fi channels.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/government/topic/47207/", "topic_name": "Government"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Adobe Patch Tuesday patches issues in Acrobat, Reader and Experience manager", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/adobes-february-patch-tuesday/article/744165/", "title": "Adobe Patch Tuesday patches issues in Acrobat, Reader and Experience manager", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "February 13, 2018", "body": "Adobe's Patch Tuesday updates included security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and Macintosh to address\u00a0critical\u00a0vulnerabilities that could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.\n\nAll of these vulnerabilities were rated a 2 priority meaning the updates resolved vulnerabilities in a product that has historically been at elevated risk with no known exploits.\n\nAdobe also released patches for Experience Manager to address a cross scripting vulnerability in Apache Sling XSS protection API rated\u00a0important as well as a moderate reflective cross-site scripting vulnerability, both of which could allow the disclosure of sensitive information. \n\n\u201cOn the third-party front,\u00a0Adobe\u00a0has released an update for Acrobat and Reader this month,\u201d Ivanti Director of Product Management Chris Goettl said.\u00a0\u201cAPSB18-02 resolves 41 total vulnerabilities (CVEs) and 17 of those are rated Critical, but the more concerning release from\u00a0Adobe\u00a0this month was the February 6th update to\u00a0Adobe's Flash Player that resolved a Zero Day vulnerability being used to target South Korea.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say both Adobe releases should be top of the priority list this month.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vulnerabilities/topic/47222/", "topic_name": "Vulnerabilities"}]}, {"news_name": "Confucius cybergang spreads backdoor ridden chat apps in Romance scams", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/confucius-cybergang-targets-south-asian-businessmen-military-personnel-and-others/article/744147/", "title": "Confucius cybergang spreads backdoor ridden chat apps in Romance scams ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "February 13, 2018", "body": "As Valentine's Day approaches, cybercriminals are looking to once again seize the opportunity to target lonely singles in romance schemes looking to persuade victims into downloading malware hidden in chat apps.\n\nThe Confucius hacking group has been observed using these scams to deliver malware similar to that used by the Patchwork cybergang.

However, the IOC is allowing innocent Russian athletes to compete, but only under the Olympic, and not Russian, national flag.\n\n\u201cThat certainly seems like a motive for someone inside Russia to disrupt the games,\u201d Richard Henderson,\u00a0Absolute Software's global\u00a0security strategist, told SC Media.\n\nFrench Caldwell, a former White House cybersecurity advisor and current chief evangelist with MetricStream, pointed out that if you anger Russia in some manner being hit with a cyberattack is always a possible result.\n\n\u201cFrom the public reports, one thing that stands out is that initial access was gained through compromised login information of accredited users. If you know you have the Russian government as your enemy, you know there is a likelihood that they or their proxies could attack \u2013 the question is how,\u201d Caldwell told SC Media.\n\nThe games' organizers have confirmed that an attack did take place during the opening ceremonies on February 9 hitting several non-critical systems, including its internet and television systems. Cisco Talos confirmed that the incident took place saying that while the infection vector is unknown the malware was a destroyer as there is no evidence that it attempted to remove any data. The attackers used a list of system credentials to gain access.\n\nCrowdstrike Intelligence said that in November and December of 2017 it had observed a credential harvesting operation operating in the international sporting sector. At the time it attributed this operation to Fancy Bear, but only with a medium level of confidence and Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike's VP of Intelligence, said there is no evidence connecting Fancy Bear to the Olympic attack.\n\nThere is other evidence pointing to Fancy Bear. It has already been credited with attacking an Olympic organization. In September 2016 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that the group had hacked its systems and accessed athlete data, including confidential medical related to the Rio Games; and, subsequently released some of the data in the public domain, accompanied by the threat that they will release more. \n\nHenderson also noted that the malware itself shares many similarities with the kind previously used by both Russia and China, but even that is not a true smoking gun.\n\n\u201cOf course, we can expect that various state-sponsored groups will learn from earlier campaigns and malware and integrate components into their future attacks, muddying the waters when it comes to being able to conclusively point the finger at one specific group,\u201d he said.\n\nInterestingly, South Korea's primary cyber opponent, North Korea, is unlikely to be behind any attack as the Hermit Kingdom is using the games to help thaw relations with its southern neighbor. Several high-ranking North Korean officials, including North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong and North Korea's nominal head of state Kim Yong Nam, attended the opening ceremony sitting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in.

It also used hard coded credentials found within the binary file itself.\n\nThe initial evidence indicates that the hacker has a great deal of knowledge of the Pyeongchang system infrastructure such as username, domain name, server name and passwords. Forty-four accounts were found in the binary file itself. The stealer supports: Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. The malware parses the registry and it queries the sqlite file in order to retrieve stored credentials, the researchers said.\n\nThe destructive phase of the attack begins almost immediately by using the cmd.exe from the host to begin deleting all shadow copies on the system and by going after the systems possible recovery methods. The malware also uses the cmd.exe to shut down wbadmin.exe to make file recovery difficult. WBAdmin is a tool used by admins to recover individual files, folders and whole drives.\n\nNext, cmd.exe is used to damage bcdedit to ensure that the Windows recovery console does not attempt to repair anything on the host.\n\nOnce the malware made any recovery harder it deleted the security windows event log making an analysis of the attack difficult.\n\n\u201cWiping all available methods of recovery shows this attacker had no intention of leaving the machine useable.

But in a rather unique twist, this time the campaign takes advantage of the Windows Installer program msiexec.exe.\n\nIn a Feb. 8\u00a0blog post, Trend Micro researchers Martin Co and Gilbert Sison report that the phishing emails associated with this attack use a lure that asks the recipient to confirm receipt of a payment. While much of the content is written in English, there is also a warning, in Korean, that advises recipients to check if their PCs are infected with a virus or malicious code. For this reason, Trend Micro believes Korean-speakers are the intended target.\n\nThe attached document, saved under the name Payment copy.Doc, purports to be a payment confirmation document, but opening it actually delivers the exploit, which is used to download a Windows Installer package\u00a0labeled\u00a0zus.msivia. This package then drops either an obfuscated MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) or Delphi binary. In turn, the binary uses a hallowed out instance of itself to produce the final payload, Loki, which is known for stealing passwords and cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nTrend Micro researchers believe that the unusual tactic of using Windows Installer may be a way to evade detection by security software that looks for more traditional installation methods.\n\n\u201cSecurity software has become proficient at monitoring possible downloader processes such as Wscript, Powershell, Mshta.exe, Winword.exe, and other similar executables that have become increasingly popular methods of installing malicious payload,\u201d report\u00a0Co and Sison. \u201cDue to their widespread use, it became easy to stop the arrival of threats via these software. However, the use of msiexec.exe to download a malicious MSI package is not something we typically see in most malware.\u201d\n\nWith that said, however, \u201cwe cannot definitively say if these samples are being delivered via the method described,\u201d the researchers add.\n\nOther malware families, including\u00a0Andromeda, have previous abused Windows Installer, the researchers note, but they modify the program or its processes in some capacity. But in this instance, Installer is left untouched and is used exactly as it's programmed to \u2013 only for a malicious purpose.\n\nThis latest attack is also an outlier because Microsoft Installer packages more typically are \u201cabused for malicious purposes to install Potentially Unwanted Applications... This is a new direction for malware creators,\u201d the report states.\n\nAside from taking the usual email security precautions, users can protect themselves from this particular threat by disabling or restricting Windows Installer.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "UDPoS malware spotted exfiltrating credit card data via DNS server", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/udpos-malware-first-new-malware-spotted-in-a-while/article/743172/", "title": "UDPoS malware spotted exfiltrating credit card data via DNS server ", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "February 09, 2018", "body": "The first new point of sale (POS) malware seen in quite a while was spotted disguised as a\u00a0LogMeIn service pack exfiltrating data via a DNS server.\n\nForcepoint researchers discovered the malware and said it appears to be a new family of malware dubbed 'UDPoS' due to its heavy use of UDP-based DNS traffic, according to a Feb. 8 blog post. The malware's most distinguishing feature is its use of DNS requests for data exfiltration which researchers described as an unusual technique albeit one that has been seen in other POS malware. \n\nThe malware also uses a Command & Control server located in Switzerland which is not a location malicious actors typically use for their infrastructure.\n\nIt is unclear whether or not the malware is currently being used in campaigns in the wild although the malware's coordinated use of LogMeIn-themed filenames and C2 URLs coupled with evidence of an earlier Intel-themed variant suggest that may be the case.\n\nResearchers contacted LogMeIn to determine if the firm's services or products were abused as part of the malware deployment process but learned the threat actors were using LogMeIn-themed filenames and C2 domain as a camouflage technique.\n\nThe malware maintains a small footprint of only 88kb yet still features a monitor component that is a multi-threaded application which creates five different threads after its initialisation code is completed.\n\n\u201cUDPoS appears to have drawn inspiration from several other POS malware families, so while none of the individual features are entirely unique the combination of them appears to be a deliberate attempt to draw together successful elements of other campaigns,\u201d said Luke Somerville, Head of Special Investigations at Forcepoint. \u201cThe malware contains a hard-coded list of AV and virtualization products to detect (a common feature of many strains of malware) but owing to a coding error only appears to look for the first item in this list.\u201d\n\nSomerville said it's unclear whether this is a reflection of the malware still being in a relatively early stages or a just a developer's error.

However, the use of a zero-day vulnerability to spread ROKRAT in this latest aggression represents a first for this group.\n\n\"Group 123 [has] now joined some of the criminal elite with this latest payload of ROKRAT... They did use exploits in previous campaigns but never a... new exploit as they have done now,\" states a Feb. 2 Talos blog post written by\u00a0researchers\u00a0Warren Mercer\u00a0and\u00a0Paul Rascagneres. \"This change represents a major shift in Group 123's maturity level.

The exploit downloads a shellcode payload from legit, third-party, South Korean websites that have been compromised. The shellcode, in turn, unpacks and executes a ROKRAT (aka DOGCALL) variant.\n\n\"DOGCALL is a backdoor commonly distributed as an encoded binary file, downloaded and decrypted by shellcode following the exploitation of weaponized documents,\" said Cristiana\u00a0Kittner, FireEye principal analyst, in an email interview with SC Media.

The malware, named OSX.CreativeUpdate, is a new miner that bides its time in the background sucking up computer resources to mine Monero.\n\nMacUpdate issues an apology and instructions on how to remove the malware in the comments of each app affected.\n\nWith each altered app the threat actors redirected those clicking on the links to a malicious website that sported slightly altered URLs to help obfuscate the action.\n\n\u201cBoth OnyX and Deeper are products made by Titanium Software (titanium-software.fr), but the site was changed maliciously to point to download URLs at titaniumsoftware.org, a domain first registered on January 23, and whose ownership is obscured. The fake Firefox app was distributed from download-installer.cdn-mozilla.net,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe injection takes place when the end user is asked to drag the app into the computer's applications folder. What is being moved, however, is a .dmg (disk image file) containing the malware. Once the malware is moved to the new folder it will install a payload from the legitimate site public.adobecc.com as a decoy measure. This activity, in turn, signals the malware to activate.\n\nReed noted a few issues with the malware that sometimes cause it to fail.\n\n\u201cFor example, the malicious OnyX app will run on Mac OS X 10.7 and up, but the decoy OnyX app requires macOS 10.13. This means that on any system between 10.7 and 10.12, the malware will run, but the decoy app won't open to cover up the fact that something malicious is going on,\u201d he said.\n\nLuckily this malware can be removed, but Reed also suggested end users only download apps directly from the developer's site, not from an aggregator, or from Apple. And since malware also tends to act somewhat funky he said one warning sign that something may be amiss with some new software is if the downloaded app either does not function as advertised or does nothing at all. If this happens removing it is a good idea.\n\nFinally, Reed tried to put the idea that Macs don't get malware to bed.\n\n\u201cFinally, be aware that the old adage that \u201cMacs don't get viruses,\u201d which has never been true, is proven to be increasingly false.

As more adult content sites begin to turn into content sharing platforms where users can submit their own content, create loyal communities, and like and share content, cybercriminals have found value in stealing and selling adult site login credentials on the dark web, putting more users at risk.\n\nAnd while the outcome of said malware remains the same as in most cases of cybercrime, victims are less likely to report the crimes to anyone because of the stigma associated with admitting to looking for or watching porn. \n\nKaspersky Lab researchers spotted at least 27 variations of PC malware, belonging to three infamous families, specifically designed to hunt for credentials to paid-for porn websites. Among these malware, where banking trojans that had been modified to steal adult website credentials. Cybercriminals also used phishing attacks to obtain the stolen credentials as well. \n\nThe firm's Naked Online report found that in 2017, these malicious families were seen more than 300,000 times attempting to attack more than 50,000 PCs across the world. The motivation for the stolen credential market is may be price of legitimate services as an annual unlimited account could cost as much as $119.99 or $9.99 per month. The desire for anonymity could also be a driving factor as users may not want to deal with purchasing showing up on bank statements. \n\nIt's also worth noting the average list prices on the dark market for an unlimited account are usually one tenth of the official costs, a stark contrast to other services and products sold which often command a premium. In addition to the low prices, the accounts were being sold in almost unlimited numbers.\n\nResearchers spotted more than five thousand unique sales offerings during the course of their researcher and speculated that many of the breached credentials may have come from the sites themselves. \n\nSince 2016 more than 72 million sets of account credentials for adult content websites were stolen and later appeared online from sites including Cams.com (62.6 million), Penthouse.com (7.1 million), Stripshow (1.42 million), 380,000 of\u00a0xHamster accounts, and about 791,000 from\u00a0Brazzers\u00a0data.\n\nThe top five most most-often sold credentials were those for accounts on Naughty America (2,575 sales offers), Brazzers (1,228 sales offers), Mofos (789 sales offers), Reality Kings (294 sales offers), and Pornhub (153 sales offers). Researchers said it's important to not view the ranking as some sort of testament to the security of the sites, but more so as a testimony to the popularity of the sites.\n\nDespite the vast market for stolen credential, researchers warn purchasers of the stolen content put themselves at risk buying stolen credentials is illegal and it's likely the credentials will have already been blocked by the time they are purchased. \n\n\u201cWhatever the motives are behind the development of malware to hunt for porn-account credentials, it is obvious that users of these kinds of websites are of interest to cybercriminals,\u201d researchers said in the report. \u201cThis fact is further substantiated when we look at malware aimed at Android users.\u201d\n\nResearchers also found mobile malware is making extensive use of porn to attract users as they identified 23 families of malware using porn content to hide malicious clickers, rooting malware, and banking Trojans.

Meanwhile, the malware itself targets machines from Cincinnati, Ohio based manufacturer Diebold-Nixdorf -- specifically its front-loading Opteva series 500 and 700 terminals. However, a Jan. 25 Diebold-Nixdorf security alert published by Krebs states that terminals from additional ATM vendors that do not require physical authentication could also potentially be affected.\n\nA confidential Secret Service alert sent to financial institutions and later obtained by KrebsOnSecurity warns that the attackers have been assigning \"cash-out crews\" to ATM locations in the guise of machine technicians so that they can physically access the terminals. The crew replaces the machine's hard disk with a malicious one, and uses an endoscope to look through and navigate the internal mechanisms of the ATM machine, in order to attach a cord that connects to a malicious laptop and accompanying mobile device. At that point, the phony technicians contact their co-conspirators, who are now able to control the ATMs and force them to dispense cash, which is subsequently collected by money mules.\n\nIn its alert, Diebold-Nixdorf describes the operation in further detail, noting that it echoes previous attacks launched in October 2017 against Mexican ATM locations:\n\n\"As in Mexico last year, the attack involves a series of different steps to overcome security mechanisms and the authorization process for setting the communication with the dispenser,\" the alert states. \"The original hard disk of the terminal is removed and replaced by another hard disk, which has been prepared by the criminals before the attack and also contains an unauthorized and/or stolen image of ATM platform software.\"\n\n\"In order to pair this new hard drive with the dispenser, the dispenser communication needs to be reset, which is only allowed when the safe door is open. As a preparation, a cable is unplugged to manipulate the sensor state to allow the pairing functionality to become available. In order to initiate the dispenser communication additionally a dedicated button inside the safe needs to be pressed and held. With the help of an extension, which is inserted into existing gaps next to the presenter, the button is depressed.\u00a0According to customer CCTV footage the criminals use an industrial endoscope to achieve this.\"\n\nJackpotting is reportedly already a well-established threat to financial service and ATM operators in Europe, Asia and Mexico, but such attacks are a notable first in the U.S. Citing an unnamed source close to the Secret Service, Krebs also warned that more U.S.-based attacks are planned by the responsible criminal organization.\n\nJane Khodos, senior communications director at the Financial Services - Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), sent SC Media an official statement, assuring businesses that the jackpotting operation \"does not appear widespread in the U.S. at this time,\" adding that exposed ATMs in outdoor locations, are most at risk. \"ATMs and systems have multiple defenses, including physical and cyber. Financial institutions are constantly reviewing and improving layered security in response to changes in the evolving threat landscape,\" the statement continues.\n\nAlso known as logical attacks, jackpotting operations aren't the easiest to pull off, either. \u201cWhat's interesting about these attacks is that they require considerable physical access to the ATM itself, meaning that there is a high risk of getting caught, and there are far less complex attack vectors that could have been chosen. In other words, it's very surprising the method that these criminals have come up with,\" said\u00a0Leigh-Anne Galloway, cybersecurity resilience lead and ATM expert at\u00a0Positive Technologies, in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe attack can mostly be mitigated by limiting physical access to the ATM, the service area, and requiring physical authentication by maintainers,\" Galloway continued. \"We have seen quite an increase in logical attacks over the last couple of years and this is certainly one of the most novel.\"\n\nDavid Tente, executive director, USA & Americas at the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA), told SC Media in an email interview that the trade association is aware of the reports, but has \"not received any information from ATMIA members at jackpotting in the U.S.\"\n\nAccording to ATMIA's 2017 global Annual Fraud Survey, only seven percent of reported incidents last year consisted of jackpotting or attempted jackpotting.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Researchers trace BitPaymer ransomware back to Dridex developers", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/researchers-trace-bitpaymer-ransomware-back-to-dridex-developers/article/739904/", "title": "Researchers trace BitPaymer ransomware back to Dridex developers", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 26, 2018", "body": "A relatively new ransomware that infected Scottish hospitals last summer appears to be created by the same developers who are responsible for the dreaded Dridex banking trojan.\n\nCommonly known as BitPaymer, the ransomware has now earned the moniker FriedEx due to its newfound affiliation, with which its shares similar code and techniques to conceal information about it behavior, according to researchers from ESET.\n\nJust like its banking Trojan cousin, BitPaymer \u201cresolves all system API calls on the fly by searching for them by hash, stores all strings in encrypted form, looks up registry keys and values by hash, etc.,\u201d states Michal Poslusny, ESET malware researcher, in a company blog post. \u201cThe resulting binary is very low profile in terms of static features and it's very hard to tell what the malware is doing without a deeper analysis.\u201d\n\nUpon further investigation, ESET learned that FriedEx code also uses many of the same functions as Dridex does (including one for generating a unique UserID identifier for victimized machines), and even orders these functions within the malware binaries the same way.\n\nESET also found samples from both malwares that use the same PDB (Program Database) path. Moreover, certain Dridex and FriedEx samples have the same or nearly synchronous date-of-compilation timestamps, with identical randomly generated constants \u2013 which suggests that they were likely compiled concurrently.\n\nIf that weren't enough proof that the two are related, both malwares are compiled in Visual Studio 2015.\n\n\u201cWith all this evidence, we confidently claim that FriedEx is indeed the work of the Dridex developers,\u201d the blog post concludes. \u201cThis discovery gives us a better picture of the group's activities \u2013 we can see that the group continues to be active and not only consistently updates their banking Trojan\u2026 [but] also follows the latest malware trends, creating their own ransomware.\u201d\n\nAccording to ESET, FriedEx/BitPaymer is focused on high-profile targets and companies, and is typically delivered through an RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) brute force attack. Discovered in July 2017, the ransomware would soon after infected several hospitals operated by Scotland's NHS Lanarkshire health care board.\n\nDridex first debuted in 2014, and it is estimated that the trojan is directly responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over the years.

Researchers said that these traits haven't been seen in cryptominers until now. \n\n\u201cWhile many cryptominers install as an application and run on a system as a package, WannaMine uses applications already present on a system to run such as PowerShell and WMI,\u201d York said. \u201cWannaMine is also very challenging to get rid of due to its persistence mechanisms and its aggressive approach to spreading.\u201d\n\nYork went on to say that while there is a strong understanding of the malware concerning how it operates and the potential impacts it can have on a business, the most challenging questions to answer in any investigation are \u201cwho did this?\u201d and \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\nThe prevalence of these attacks also signal the broader issue of how these attackers are able to get into these enterprise networks in the first place. Enterprises reduce their chances of this by having solid endpoint protection and by ensuring that all of their systems are patched and up to date.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Millions of machines download XMRig cryptominer after users click on devious links", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/millions-of-machines-download-xmrig-cryptominer-after-users-click-on-devious-links/article/739594/", "title": "Millions of machines download XMRig cryptominer after users click on devious links", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 25, 2018", "body": "A newly discovered malicious URL redirection campaign that infects users with the\u00a0XMRig\u00a0Monero cryptocurrency miner has already victimized users between 15 and 30 million times, researchers have reported.\n\nOperating for less than five months, the campaign has particularly hit hard countries in southeast Asia, northern Africa and South America, according to a Jan. 24 blog post from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat research team. Telemetry data indicates that over 3.5 million victims are based in Thailand alone, with Vietnam (more than 1.8 million) and Egypt (roughly 1.1 million) the next most frequently attacked geographic targets.\n\nThe attacks are generally carried out by combining redirection services with the URL shortener Bitly, in order to present deceitful malvertising links on various legitimate websites. These advertisements were delivered via Adfly, an ad-based redirection service.\n\n\"It appears that Adfly is the method of distribution to unwitting users, while Bitly is being abused by the malware authors to eventually download XMRig,\" explained Christopher Budd, senior threat communications manager at Palo Alto, in an email interview with SC Media. (Budd noted that, upon disclosure, Bitly removed the offending URLs in timely fashion.)\n\nWebsite visitors who click on these shortened links believe they are downloading advertised files, updates or services (e.g. file sharing services), but they are actually being redirected to another domain that use a infection chain to download XMRig, a legitimate mining tool that in this case is being used unethically to secretly harness victims' processing power.\n\nThe infection process typically starts with the downloading of a malicious executable that in turn drops a VBS and LNK file (the latter for persistence). The VBS file then leverages various HTTP redirection services (prior to Oct. 20, 2017, it was leveraging Microsoft Windows' BITSAdmin tool) to download and execute another remote VBS file. This secondary VBS file fingerprints the infected machine and then installs the appropriate version of XMRig.\n\nResearchers have already identified over 250 unique Windows-based executables used in this campaign, more than half of which were downloaded from 4sync, an online cloud storage provider. In addition to executing the cryptominer via VBS files, the malware also uses XMRig proxy services to hide the mining pool destination and uses Nicehash, a marketplace that connects customers who wish to buy or sell hashing processing power.\n\nBecause Bitly clicks can be tracked, Unit 42 researchers were able to identify roughly 15 million redirections as a result of this campaign. However, fewer than half of the observed XMRig campaign samples use bitly, leading Palo Alto researchers to conclude that the actual number of malicious redirects is likely closer to 30 million.\n\n\"Monero mining campaigns are certainly not a new development... However, it is less common to observe such a large-scale campaign go relatively unnoticed for such a long period of time,\" wrote blog post author and Palo Alto threat intelligence analyst Josh Grunzweig. \"By targeting random end-users via malicious advertisements, using seemingly innocuous names for the malware files, and using both built-in Windows utilities and scripting files, the attackers are able to gain a foothold on victim systems at large scale.\"\n\nIn a separate blog post published today, Unit 42 revealed that the Iran-linked APT group known as OilRig clandestinely installed an Internet Information Services (IIS) backdoor called RGDoor on the web servers of eight Middle Eastern government organizations, as well as one financial institution and one educational institution.\n\nThe researchers believe the backdoor was installed as an insurance measure in case these institutions discovered that they had been previously compromised and infected with a malicious webshell called TwoFace. In such a scenario, the attackers would still have access to the webservers, even if TwoFace was removed.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Elusive FinFisher spyware can finally be cracked, researchers believe", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/elusive-finfisher-spyware-can-finally-be-cracked-researchers-believe/article/739568/", "title": "Elusive FinFisher spyware can finally be cracked, researchers believe", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "January 25, 2018", "body": "", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Hide 'N Seek IoT botnet caught using Peer-to-Peer communication", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hide-n-seek-used-custom-built-peer-to-peer-communication-to-exploit-victims/article/739293/", "title": "Hide 'N Seek IoT botnet caught using Peer-to-Peer communication", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "January 24, 2018", "body": "An emerging botnet comprised of compromised IoT devices dubbed \u201cHide \u2018N Seek\u201d or HNS is using custom built Peer-to-Peer communication to exploit victims and build its infrastructure. The botnet may also represent an overall change in how threat actors are looking to use botnets.\n\nBitdefender researchers first spotted the botnet on Jan. 10 before it disappeared for a few days only to return 10 days later in a significantly improved form. Before long, the botnet had spread from Asia to the United States with over 18,000 bots and counting, according to a Bitdefender blog post.\n\nThe botnet also uses multiple anti-tampering techniques to prevent a third party from hijacking or poisoning and can perform web exploitations against a series of devices via the same exploit as CVE-2016-10401 and other vulnerabilities against networking equipment.\n\nHNS also\u00a0embeds a plurality of commands such as data exfiltration, code execution and interference with a device's operation. The botnet also features a worm-like spreading mechanism that randomly generates a list of IP addresses to get potential targets.\n\nHide \u2018N Seek is the second known botnet to date, after Hajime, that has a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture. Bitdefender Senior E-threat Analyst Bogdan Botezatu said the virulence of the Hide \u2018N Seek botnet shows how easy it is for cyber-criminals to take over IoT devices. \n\n\u201cIt also shows that cybercriminals are looking into (or experimenting with) decentralized botnet architectures to prevent possible takedowns,\u201d Botezatu said. \u201cLast but not least, it also shows that botmasters are looking at changing the consecrated business model of IoT botnets, moving them away from DDoS and into cyber-espionage.\u201d\n\nBotezatu added that it is interesting that while most IoT botnet have a DDoS component, HNS overcompensates for the lack of the feature with file theft. In addition to the botnets exploits, HNS employs a large dictionary attack which Botezatu described as possibly the largest dictionary attack he has seen in the IoT space to date.\n\nAshley Stephenson, chief executive officer of Corero Network Security, told SC Media the botnet seems to be targeting devices running a particular distribution of Linux called \u201cbuildroot\u201d since it's looking for a login prompt that includes that string (\"buildroot login\u201d). She added that the botnet seems to spread from one botnet to another. \n\n\u201cIt's interesting that it will try TFTP or WEB downloads (the bot acting as the server to load the virus into the victim) based on whether the bot is on the same LAN as the victim,\u201d Stephenson said.\u00a0\u201cThis suggests that the author knows that TFTP is likely to be available on this Linux distribution.\u201d\n\nFurthermore the botnet digitally signs all its communications so that it can't be neutralized that way. Stephenson said the botnets features are worth noting as they are thought out and practical. She said the criminals behind the botnet borrowed from academics of distributed search theory and applied the methods to the dark side, some which could also come straight from Peer to Peer networking.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting components is collaborative/community nature of some of the commands, e.g. asking your neighboring bots (6 degrees of Kevin Bacon \u2013 5 hops away) to help search for something and also have them recruit/ask other bots to join the search (each within their own '6 degrees of Kevin Bacon'),\u201d Stephenson said.\n\nThe evolution of the botnet demonstrates how much threat actors are willing to invest in time and effort to develop more sophisticated and self-preserving botnets and both Stephenson and Botezatu expect to see more efforts like this with future botnets in the foreseeable future.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/iot/topic/47241/", "topic_name": "IoT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "North Korea-linked trojan switches targets from banks to cryptocurrency enthusiasts", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/north-korea-linked-trojan-switches-targets-from-banks-to-cryptocurrency-enthusiasts/article/739294/", "title": "North Korea-linked trojan switches targets from banks to cryptocurrency enthusiasts", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 24, 2018", "body": "Originally used by reputed North Korean hackers to attack the global banking sector, the Ratankba\u00a0downloader trojan has been repurposed into a PowerShell-based variant that appears to be targeting small, non-financial organizations and individuals with an interest in cryptocurrency, an analysis shows.\n\nIn a Jan. 24 blog post, Trend Micro researchers\u00a0CH Lei, Fyodor Yarochkin, Lenart Bermejo, Philippe Z. Lin, and Razor Huang report that the North Korea-linked APT group Lazarus has been infecting victims with the evolved version of\u00a0Ratankba since June 2017, via phishing documents with cryptocurrency-themed lures.\n\nThe Trend Micro report strongly echoes a white paper published in December 2017 by Proofpoint researchers, which refers to the PowerShell-based variant as PowerRatankba (which technically is two subvariants). \"We believe that PowerRatankba was likely developed as a replacement in Lazarus Group's strictly financially motivated team's arsenal to fill the hole left by Ratankba's discovery and very public documentation earlier this year,\" the white paper explains.\n\nIn that paper, Proofpoint notes that the phishing campaign enticed readers to download malicious documents or visit fake web pages that supposedly provided downloads or updates for cryptocurrency applications. Either way, the victims would end up infected with the reconnaissance tool.\n\nBy analyzing\u00a0servers that Lazarus used as a back-end system for temporarily holding stolen data, Trend Micro determined that 55 percent of this campaign's victims were located in India and neighboring countries, which \"implies that the Lazarus group could be... either collecting intelligence about targets in this region, or is at an early stage of planning,\" the researchers state. \"They could have also been performing exercises in preparation for an attack against similar targets.\"\n\nAmong the victims in India are individuals whom Trend Micro believes to likely be employees of three web software development companies. A South Korean web software development company was similarly targeted, the report continues. Meanwhile, the Proofpoint report states that one spear phishing attack specifically targeted at least one executive at a cryptocurrency organization.\n\nMoreover, Trend Micro found that only five percent of victims were using Microsoft Windows Enterprise, which suggests that larger organizations were not targeted.\n\nA technical analysis of\u00a0PowerRatankba is available in both the Trend Micro and Proofpoint reports.\n\nIn related news, South Korea, whose cryptocurrency exchanges and users have been a repeated target of North Korean hackers, announced this week via its Financial Services Commission that as of Jan. 30, it is eliminating anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts. As reported by CoinDesk, investors will have use the same name on their crypto exchanges as they do on their bank accounts if they wish to continue trading.\n\nSome reports attributed another drop in Bitcoin's price to South Korea's regulatory announcement.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/finance/topic/47209/", "topic_name": "Finance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Twitter spam app plaguing accounts", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/twitter-spam-app-plaguing-accounts/article/739272/", "title": "Twitter spam app plaguing accounts", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "January 24, 2018", "body": "Cybercrimals attempting to take advantage of Twitter users curiosity over who visits their page are using a new form of bait that advertises the ability to track such visits.\n\nThe malware is being spread by spamming Twitter accounts with an ad that states their app, labeled 100 percent safe!, will track who visits your profile, according to Malwarebytes researcher Christopher Boyd.

In a somewhat unusual twist, however, the actors are demanding payment not in Bitcoin, but in Monero, a cryptocurrency gaining in popularity among cybercriminals because its wallet addresses remain anonymous.\n\nEven if victims pay the 0.3 Monero ransom (worth around $90 as of Jan. 23), the SpriteCoin malware doesn't necessarily deliver a working the decryption key \u2013 and worse, it downloads a secondary malware program, identified as\u00a0W32/Generic!tr, capable of harvesting certificates, parsing keys, and surreptitiously activating web cameras.\n\n\u201cThis sample, while not highly sophisticated, is unique that it targets victims interested in cryptocurrency, and then providing a secondary malicious component instead of just asking for the ransom,\u201d\u00a0said Tony Giandomenico, senior security strategist and researcher with Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, in an email interview with SC Media. \u201cThreat actors are doing their homework when targeting end users, and we can safely predict more of the same to come in the future.\u201d\n\nBased on unconfirmed reports, Fortinet believes the primary attack vector for SpriteCoin ransomware is online forums, using cryptocurrency-themed spam to entice viewers into downloading the malicious SpriteCoin wallet app package via a link.\n\nFortinet further reports that the apparent SpriteCoin homepage describes the fraudulent virtual currency as: \u201ca new cryptocurrency written entirely in JavaScript (with C for the mining module).

However, the same URL is shared between Struts and DotNetuke:\n\nWindows \u2013 hxxp://eeme7j[.]win/scv[.]ps1 leading to the download of a miner from hxxp://eeme7j[.]win/mule[.]exe (detected as TROJ_BITMIN.JU)\n\nLinux \u2013 hxxp://eeme7j[.]win/larva[.]sh leading to the download of a miner from hxxp://eeme7j[.]win/mule (detected as ELF_BITMIN.AK)\n\nThe number of attacks have declined lately, but Lin noted that they have not halted. In part due to the refusal of system administrators to recognize the danger posed by Apache Struts and DotNetNuke and patching their systems. Patches for both issues have been available since March and August 2017, respectively.\n\n", "topics": []}, {"news_name": "Dridex campaign carries scent of Necurs with a hint of FTP", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/new-dridex-campaign-uses-ftp-sites-instead-of-http/article/738636/", "title": "Dridex campaign carries scent of Necurs with a hint of FTP", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "January 22, 2018", "body": "Forcepoint researchers spotted a malware laden spam campaign, similar to Necurs, using compromised FTP sites instead of the usual HTTP link as download locations for malicious documents.\n\nThe campaign also exposed the credentials of the compromised sites in the process as the malicious emails were distributed just before 12:00 UTC on Jan. 17, 2018, and remained active for approximately seven hours, according to a Jan. 18 blog post. \n\nResearchers speculate the FTP sites were used in an attempt to prevent being detected by email gateways and network policies that may consider FTPs trusted locations. \n\n\u201cChanges to distribution URLs and their formats are often used to 'buy time' for attackers: systems which cannot dynamically detect payloads will potentially have a period where they are unable to protect against the attacks until signature updates are available,\u201d Luke Somerville, head of special investigations at Forcepoint, told SC Media. \n\n\u00a0\u201cEqually, Dridex is often targeted at home users who are far less likely to have scanning or blocking in place looking for 'unusual' protocols such as this.\u201d\n\nThe spam was primarily sent to .COM top level domains (TLDs) with the second, third and fourth top affected TLDs suggesting that major regional targets were France, the U.K., and Australia respectively, researchers said. \n\nThreat actors rotated domain names such as: gov.au, com.tr, fr, with sender names such as admin@, billing@, help@ and info@ to make the malicious emails look more convincing to unsuspecting users.\n\nThe campaign used two types of documents including a DOC that abuses DDE to execute shell commands to download malware and a XLS file with a Macro that downloads Dridex. Researchers also noted that the perpetrators of the campaign didn't appear to be worried about exposing the credentials of the FTP sites they abused which could potentially expose the already-compromised sites to further abuse by other groups.\n\n\u201cThis may suggest that the attackers have an abundant supply of compromised accounts and therefore view these assets as disposable,\u201d the post said. \u201cEqually, if a compromised site is used by multiple actors it also makes attribution harder for security professionals and law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe campaign shares features with high profile malware campaigns. \n\nThe campaign displays traits of the Necurs botnet such as domains used for distribution were already in the researcher's records\u00a0as compromised domains used by Necurs, which is historically known to spread Dridex. In addition, the\u00a0document downloaders are also similar to those used by Necurs in the past and the download locations of the XLS file also follows the traditional Necurs format.\u00a0\n\nSomerville said the biggest question raised given the patterns associating this campaign with previous Necurs activity is the reason for the small scale of the campaign. \n\n\u201cThere are several possible explanations for this (e.g. Necurs is generally understood to sell its malicious email services: the end-attackers in this case may simply have bought a low tier of the service) but we're unable to give a hard and fast answer to this at present,\u201d Somerville said. \u201cFundamentally, Dridex is intended to steal bank login information.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that while there may be some questions about the scale and URLs used in the attack, the end goal of any Dridex campaign is ultimately the acquisition of banking credentials.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybersecurity/topic/47223/", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Russian man arrested for gas stealing malware", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/russian-authorities-bust-up-gas-stealing-malware-scam/article/738609/", "title": "Russian man arrested for gas stealing malware", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "January 22, 2018", "body": "Russian authorities Sunday arrested Denis Zayev in Stavropol, Russia, on charges stemming from a widespread scam that swindled gas station customers into paying for more gas than they actually pumped into their tank.\n\nZayev allegedly designed malware used in a scam that netted hundreds of millions of rubles by skimming between 3-to-7 percent of every gallon sold into a separate tank as it was being pumped, according to Russian media outlet Rosbalt.\n\nThe stolen gasoline was automatically sent to a separate onsite tank that had intentionally been left empty while the malware erased any information related to the rerouting of fuel.

The report said the GDGS is known to gather cyber intelligence to bolster its offensive cyber capabilities.\n\nThe group is believed to be currently running six distinct and concurrently operating campaigns some of which have been in operation since 2012.\n\nDark Caracal has ties to a previous operation uncovered by the EFF during its Operation Manul campaign which targeted journalists, lawyers, and dissidents critical of the Kazakhstan government.\n\nThe malicious group usual modus operandi is to use trojanized Android apps to install an APT normally utilizing social media, phishing and sometimes physical access to compromise a targeted system. The malware employed by Dark Caracal ranges from a custom-developed mobile spy tool called Pallas along with the more commonly used found FinFisher, Bandook RAT and other tools that are bought or rented off the Dark Web.\n\nA standard Dark Caracal attack starts with a lure placed on a Facebook group and WhatsApp messages. These normally included political messages or links to Facebook groups that Dark Caracal believes would interest the victim. Successful WhatsApp phishing attacks then lead the victim to a watering hole server, while those hooked via Facebook were sent to a specially constructed malicious website using a fake Google, Facebook or Twitter domain. In some cases the Facebook targets would go to the watering hole server.\n\nNo matter which server the victims landed on the target would be served a series of trojanized Android Apps, which after installation would begin communicating with a command and control server found at adobeair[.] net. \n\nThe EFF and Lookout's investigation was able to identify four \u201cpersonas\u201d, two phone numbers and two domains associated with Dark Caracal, all of which are somehow connected to the email address op13@mail[.]com. \n\n\u201cAliases associated with op13@mail[.]com include Nancy Razzouk, Hadi Mazeh, and Rami Jabbour. All of the physical addresses listed in the WHOIS domain registrations associated with op13@mail[.]com tend to cluster around the SSID: Bld3F6 Wi-Fi locations. This is near the General Security building in Beirut,\u201d the report stated.\n\nOnce inside a victim's device it would spread to encompass both desktop and mobile platforms gathering stored images, texts and even using a phone to snap photos of what the owner was doing. The report noted that largest amount of data came via six Android campaigns that eventually delivered 48GB of information to the adobeair[.] net. This server also had an additional 33GB of information harvested through Windows campaigns.\n\nThe countries hit included the United States, China, France, India, South Korea and several Middle Eastern nations.\n\nThe type of data exfiltrated is almost as diverse as the victimized countries. In its Androd campaigns the report noted that Dark Caracal was interested in SMS text messages were particularly popular and included the users two-factor authentication and one-time password pins, (some still valid) receipts and airline reservations, and company communications. Mobile contact lists, call logs, Wi-Fi network details and audio recordings were also snatched.\n\nThe Windows malware grabbed screenshots, corporate and legal documentation and even iPhone back up logs.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/social-media/topic/47245/", "topic_name": "Social Media"}]}, {"news_name": "Not-so-super Sonic?

The file contains the malware called Trisis or Triton. It is believed that the malware has already been used to shut down an an oil and gas facility in the Middle East last December.\n\nAccording to Josh Mayfield, director at FireMon, by controlling the safety systems, Trisis will most likely be used to command the industrial control systems (ICS) to perform actions that could overwhelm a nuclear plant, oil and gas operation, or utility grid with Schneider Electric equipment.\n\n\u201cNot only does Trisis take over the ICS, but can give the cyber-security teams a false sense of security. \u00a0Trisis will be destroying the ICS, but controlling communication outward to lead someone to believe everything is alright,\u201d he told SC Media UK.\n\nThe report by Cyberscoop said that while the upload of Library.zip was removed from VirusTotal in less than 24 hours, many copies of the file have made.\n\nA Schneider Electric spokesperson told CyberScoop that \"In line with industry protocol, a Schneider Electric employee posted a file to VirusTotal in the interest of enabling its security vendor members to analyse and respond to the new malware. Shortly afterwards, Schneider Electric received a request from a third party to take the file down, and promptly complied with that request\u201d.\n\nSam Curry, chief security officer at Cybereason, told SC Media UK that researchers and practitioners alike need to be able to share files and material to advance their work and protect against new attacks, but sharing is a lot like opening Pandora's box.\n\n\u201cOnce open, it's very hard to put things back into the box. Trisis is another example, really, of the new options available to nation states (and other actors) for \u2018continuation of politics by other means,' to paraphrase Clauswitz on war,\u201d he said.\n\nPascal Geenens, Radware EMEA security evangelist, told SC Media UK that Trisis is not a highly scalable attack as it cannot easily be replicated across victims without significant victim knowledge and additional work.\n\n\u201cThe malware targets Schneider Electric's Triconex safety instrumented system (SIS) specifically. Each SIS is unique and to attack other SIS systems would require knowledge of those processes. The framework however allows attackers to leverage it to quickly create new attacks that target safety functions of an industrial process,\u201d he said.\n\nGeenens added that the risk he sees in making this public is that less versed and opportunistic hackers might try to take advantage of the information and code to create new attack and ransom campaigns. \u201cHowever given the specific attack vector and need for considerable knowledge and investment to adapt the code to attack the specifics of the safety systems lower the risk and sensitivity of the information and the public knowledge for security researchers and engineers in ICS does outweigh the risk in my opinion,\u201d he said.\n\nMayfield added that the \u00a0primary lesson they can learn from this mistake is to centrally manage the way you publish malware.\n\n\u201cYou can unknowingly publish something that is the final piece of a cyber-criminal's puzzle; not intentionally, but still, you just helped them complete the last mile. \u00a0In short, don't do the following: Fire, Ready, Aim,\u201d he said.\n\nChris Wysopal, CTO and co-founder, CA Veracode, commenting on the issue in an email to SC adds: \u201cUnfortunately, breaches like this are becoming common place and part of the reason is businesses have viewed security as a detached from the development process. This results in a high prevalence of vulnerabilities, which in turn are used by hackers to exploit companies and steal data. Fixing this problem will require a major mind shift regarding the way we build software. \u00a0And I can give you a great analogy. Even the fastest, most impressive cars today come with safety features like seatbelts, ABS, traction control and advanced features like break assist and lane departure warning systems. It wasn't always this way. For a long time cars didn't have any safety features and people got hurt.

The malware automatically detects and decrypts the license/serial keys of more than 200 popular pieces of software, including Office, SQL Server, Adobe, and Nero, according to a Jan. 17 Trend Micro blog post. \n\nThe malware is publically available and has been observed in the wild since early 2016 providing threat actors sophisticated capabilities such as a full-featured backdoor capable of keylogging, the ability to execute additional plugins like cryptocurrency miners, conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, self-update and self-removal.\n\nZyklon is spread via malicious spam attachments in a ZIP file containing a DOC file that exploits at least three known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office including CVE-2017-8759 and CVE-2017-11882. The malware communicates with its command and control (C2) server over the Onion Router (Tor) network and provides a very efficient mechanism to monitor the malware's spread and impact.\n\n\u201cWhat stands out the most to me is that the Zyklon malware is being packaged with pricing tiers based on features,\u201d Chris Morales,\u00a0Vectra's head of security analytics, told SC Media.\n\nThreat actors could purchase the normal build of the malware for $75 or the Tor-enabled build for $125 as well as updates for $15 all of which is payable on Bitcoin. \n\nMorales said the malware is a very capable piece of code, yet it exhibits a sequence of common attacker behaviors similar to any other attack with the intent to infect, spy, spread, and steal information and that he has seen many attacks now leveraging TOR for outbound communication and PowerShell for malware updates.\n\nHe added that the Windows vulnerabilities used for Zyklon appear to have first been observed in the wild through the detection of another piece of malware, meaning we have no idea how long attackers have known about the vulnerability or when they developed an exploit. \n\n\u201cThis is true of every vulnerability \u2018discovered and published' by a threat researcher or security company. Attackers are not keen to publish or share any type of information they already have, and they could sit on this information for a very long time before leveraging an exploit for a vulnerability in a new piece of malware,\u201d Morales said.\n\nExperts agreed. Meni Farjon, co-founder and chief technology officer of SoleBIT Labs, told SC Media the vulnerabilities picked by the threat actors behind the malware are unique as they all share the common characteristic of being 100 percent reliable across almost all Windows versions. \n\n\u201cNormally, code execution exploits combine memory based corruptions, which can lead to unreliable situations on some victims PC's, and failing to infect,\u201d Farjon said \u201cThese vulnerabilities do not corrupt the memory and are almost fully 'logical.'\u201d\n\nFarjon added that the bugs will even work on a 10 year-old Windows system ensuring extremely high reliability over infections and demonstrates that the actors behind Zyklon are preparing for a massive campaign at one point or another. Lenny Zeltser, vice president of products at\u00a0Minerva Labs, told SC Media, the approach used in the malware campaign demonstrates some of the ways that adversaries bypass information security defenses and that using Microsoft Office documents together with PowerShell, as well as employing memory injection, is often effective against detection-based anti-malware tools.\n\n\u201cDon't get me wrong: There is clearly a need for some form of baseline anti-virus protection,\u201d Zeltser said. \u201cHowever, enterprises should consider ways of augmenting such defenses, for instance by employing technology that makes it harder for the attacker to evade detection.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "New Mirai botnet variants target ARC processors, cryptomining hosts", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/new-mirai-botnet-variants-target-arc-processors-cryptomining-hosts/article/737968/", "title": "New Mirai botnet variants target ARC processors, cryptomining hosts", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 18, 2018", "body": "A newly discovered variant of the Mirai Internet of Things botnet is specifically designed to attack the ubiquitous 32-bit embedded Argonaut RISC Core processor from ARC International, which can be found in well over a billion storage, home, mobile, automotive, and\u00a0IoT devices.\n\nWord of this troublesome development surfaced just days before researchers revealed that another Mirai botnet descendant, Satori, is now being used by a threat actor to steal Ethereum cryptocurrency by hacking into online mining hosts and secretly replacing their wallets.\n\nNews of Okiru (which translates to \"get up\" in English) appears to have first arrived via a Jan. 14 tweet from independent security researcher \"Odisseus,\" who credited fellow researcher \"UnixFreaxj\" from security workgroup Malware Must Die with finding the ARC-targeting botnet malware.\n\n\u201cFrom this day, the landscape of #Linux #IoT infection will change. #ARC cpu has produced #IoT devices more than 1 billion per year,\u201d Odisseus tweeted. \u201cSo these devices are what the hackers want to aim to infect #ELF #malware with their #DDoS cannons. It's a serious threat\u2026\u201d\n\nQuoting Malware Must Die researchers, a report from The Register\u00a0further warns that an analysis of Okiru revealed that its operators have been \u201cpreparing ARC binary specifically to target one particular Linux environment.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, is it possible that an Okiru-fueled DDoS assault against ARC-based machines could rival the size and scope of the infamous Mirai attack that disrupted Dyn?\n\n\u201cDue to there being over a billion likely ARC devices out there, there is definitely potential for us to see dramatically raised botnet numbers due to this development,\u201d said Daniel Miessler, director of advisory services at IOActive, in an interview with SC Media. \u201cBut it's not always a straight line from potential to reality, as there are many variables such as percentage of devices exposed, patch levels, malware robustness, speed of security response, etc. So it's pretty hard to know if this will actually lead to a Dyn-level or greater situation, but the potential attack surface of ARC devices does make it a possibility.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Okiru's cousin Satori is busy causing its own brand of mischief. (Reportedly, Satori malware has at times been previously referred to as Okiru, but the Okiru malware targeting ARC processors is markedly different, and not to be used interchangeably with Satori.)\n\nDespite a largely successful effort to sinkhole Satori botnet after it was uncovered late last year, researchers from Qihoo 360's Netlab team discovered on Jan. 8 that a new variant named Satori.Coin.Robber was starting to rebuild its own version of the malicious network. \n\nAccording to a Jan. 17 Qihoo blog post, the botnet targets devices primarily Windows-based machines running Claymore Dual GPU miner\u00a0software, hacking them by exploiting a vulnerability affecting Port 3333. \u201cIt works primarily on the Claymore Mining equipment that allows management actions on 3333 ports with no password authentication enabled (which is the default config),\u201d Qihoo reported, withholding additional details for security reasons. (Qihoo also warned that Claymore v.10.1 users are vulnerable to an exploit that leverages CVE-2017-16929, an authenticated directory traversal vulnerability.)\n\nThe researchers also determined that as of Jan. 11, \"Satori.Coin.Robber has got the first ETH coin paid... with another 0.76 coin in the balance. Although this total amounts to a relatively paltry sum \u2013 as of Jan. 18, one Ethereum is worth just over $1,000 \u2013 the implications of using an IoT botnet to target cryptocurrency enthusiasts is nonetheless an intriguing development.\n\nOddly, Qihoo also reported that\u00a0the author of Satori.Coin.Robber is publicly claiming his code is not malicious, even providing an email at which he or she purportedly can be contacted.\u00a0\n\nMirai-inspired botnet malware like Satori and Okiru were made possible after one of Mirai's original developers, Paras Jha, from Fanwood, N.J., released its code to the public shortly after performing an attack on security researcher Brian Krebs on Sept. 20, 2016. On Dec. 13, 2017, Jha pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from Mirai's creation, along with Josiah White, of\u00a0Washington, Penn. and Dalton Norman of\u00a0Metairie, La.\n\n\u201cOnce malware becomes public, it is very common for other malware creators or sometimes the originators to create variations to both foil detection systems and specifically target new systems,\u201d said Mike Ahmadi, global director of IoT Security at DigiCert, in emailed comments. \u201cIt is important to understand that the development community for malware is just as active and often more driven to create \u2018improved' versions as the conventional software industry is.

Researchers also spotted several related spyware tools for Windows that form an implant for exfiltrating sensitive data on a targeted machine. \n\nResearchers said the code and functionality of the malware has changed numerous times from simple unobfuscated malware to sophisticated multi-stage spyware that gives attackers full remote control of the infected device.\u00a0\n\nOnce infected, threat actors have the ability to control the malware via HTTP, XMPP, binary SMS and\u00a0FirebaseCloudMessaging\u00a0(or GoogleCloudMessaging in older versions) protocols. \n\nSkygofree also features a reverse shell which is an external ELF file compiled by the attackers to run on Android, an exploit payload which looks to exploit several known vulnerabilities and escalate privileges, a Busybox Payload, a social payload, and a parser payload. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWith a long history of governments trying to eavesdrop through\u00a0WhatsApp or break its encryption, the sophistication of\u00a0this malware is far above common criminal-level,\u201d Rod Soto, director of security research at JASK told SC Media. \u201cThe app allows for true end-to-end encryption \u2013 making it a good tool for private communications.

The threat actors then use the phone's root privileges to read and extract messages and content that is encrypted. \n\n\u201cThese indicators lead me to believe that this is the work of professional criminals \u2013 possibly state-sponsored \u2013 or some actor that has skills above the average criminal,\u201d Soto added. \n\nKaspersky researchers said given the malware's infrastructure analysis they are pretty confident the developer is following in the footsteps of the infamous Hacker Team.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}]}, {"news_name": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apparent-korean-actor-group123-linked-to-six-phishing-campaigns-including-evil-new-year-scam/article/737293/", "title": "Apparent Korean actor 'Group123' linked to six phishing campaigns, including 'Evil New Year' scam", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 16, 2018", "body": "Researchers have attributed six separate phishing campaigns targeting South Koreans in either 2017 or 2018 to a single threat actor called \"Group123,\" including multiple operations designed to infect victims with the remote administration tool ROKRAT.\n\nThe six campaigns -- Golden Time, Evil New Year, Are You Happy?, FreeMilk, North Korea Human Rights, and Evil New Year 2018 -- have been linked through shared code and tactics, according to researchers with Cisco Systems' Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group.\n\nCommonalities include not just ROKRAT, but also the use of Korean Hangul Word Processor (HWP) documents, similar Program DataBase patterns and reconnaissance codes, and the presence of a browser stealer in certain payloads. Also, many of the campaigns have used email lures that reference the longstanding North Korea-South Korea reunification movement.\n\nDue to the phishing emails' use of Hangul -- a product of\u00a0South Korean\u00a0company\u00a0Hancom Inc. -- and their strong command of the Korean language, Talos believes it is likely that \"the origin of this group is from the Korean peninsula\" and that\u00a0\"we are dealing with a new Korean actor.\" However, while state-sponsored North Korea hackers have a history of launching attacks on South Korea, Talos does not outright state if the threat specifically comes from the north.\n\nThe most recent campaign, Evil New Year 2018, is essentially a reboot of the threat actor's original Evil New Year operation that ran from November 2016 through January 2017, explains Talos in a Jan. 16 blog post authored by researchers Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres (with contributions from Jungsoo An).\n\nThe newer campaign, which launched on Jan. 2, 2018, lures victims in with a malicious HWP decoy document, supposedly written by South Korea's Ministry of Reunification. The doc\u00a0claims to offer an analysis of a New Year's speech made by the leader of North Korea (presumably Kim Jong-un, although Talos doesn't specifically name him in its analysis).\n\nThe document exploits a vulnerability in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format in order to download and execute shellcode hidden in a fake image on a previously compromised website. In this case, the shellcode downloads and decodes a fileless variant of ROKRAT from memory as the final payload. Much like the ROKRAT samples distributed in previous Group123 campaigns, this variant leverages cloud providers, including Yandex, pCloud, Dropbox, and Box, to exfiltrate documents and communicate with the attackers.\n\nAccording to Talos, the 2017 Evil New Year campaign similarly involved spear phishing emails that appeared to come from the\u00a0Korean Ministry of Unification and used malicious\u00a0Hangul attachments to drop ROKRAT. \"The document claimed to discuss the New Year's activities of North Korea and this would have been something that the victims in South Korea would be very interested in. This would have been particularly true for Government targets, who we believe to be Group123's target of choice,\" the Talos blog post states.\n\nThe malicious documents in the earlier campaign featured two links that opened up additional decoy documents containing malicious OLE objects used to drop binaries, which\u00a0 in turn injected shellcode that unpacked and executed reconnaissance malware designed to communicate with the C&C server.\n\nThe Talos report detailed four additional phishing campaigns from Group123:\n\nGolden Time, August 2016 - March 2017: This campaign infected targets with ROKRAT via spear phishing emails that lauded recipients for joining a panel at a phony Korean reunification conference. Other phishing emails purported to be a help request from a resident of the South Korean city Munchon.\n\nAre You Happy?, March 2017: This campaign dropped a ROKRAT module called named ERSP.enc that acts as a disk wiper, capable of\u00a0opening an infected system's drive and writing data to the Master Boot Record. After the malware reboots the affected machine, the MBR displays a string that reads \"Are you Happy?\"\n\nFreeMilk, May 2017: Because this campaign targeted non-Korean financial institutions, the attackers used Microsoft Office documents instead of HWP docs. \"The attackers exploited CVE-2017-0199 [a flaw in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface]\u00a0in order to download and execute a malicious HTA document inside of Microsoft Office,\" Talos explains. This scheme resulted in two payloads: The first, PoohMilk, creates persistence and checks specific files on an infected machines, paving the way for the second malware, Freenki, which collects information on the infected system and can download a third executable.\n\nNorth Korean Human Rights, November 2017: This campaign served another version of ROKRAT, via a malicious HWP document authored by a representative from the Citizens' Alliance For North Korean Human Rights And Reunification Of Korean Peninsula. Purportedly, \"the main purpose of this document was an attempt to arrange a meeting to discuss items related to \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and \"Enactment of a Law,\" which was passed in 2016 in South Korea. Of course, the document's true purpose was to infect unwitting victims.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/apt/topic/47229/", "topic_name": "APT"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-espionage/topic/47234/", "topic_name": "Cyber Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}]}, {"news_name": "KillDisk wiper malware sets sights on Latin American financial organizations", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/new-killdisk-variant-targets-financial-organizations-in-latin-america/article/737284/", "title": "KillDisk wiper malware sets sights on Latin American financial organizations", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "January 16, 2018", "body": "A new variant of the disk wiping malware KillDisk is targeting financial firms in Latin America to wreak havoc without leaving so much as a note.\n\nTrend Micro researchers are still analyzing TROJ_KILLDISK.IUB, the latest version of the malware used in cyberattacks launched in late December 2015 against Ukraine's\u00a0energy, banking, rail, and\u00a0mining\u00a0industries, according to a Monday\u00a0blog post.\n\nResearchers noted the version has a \u201cself-destruct\u201d feature which doesn't really delete itself, but renames its file while running.

The malicious extensions, named \"Change HTTP Request Header,\" \"Nyoogle - Custom Logo for Google,\" \"LiteBookmarks,\" and \"Stickies - Chrome's Post-it Notes,\" have been\u00a0removed by Google from the Chrome Web Store, the researchers noted.\n\nThe malicious extensions were uncovered during an analysis of unusually highly outbound traffic flowing from a ICEBRG customer's workstation to a European virtual private server provider. Further analysis revealed that while the extensions don't contain any overtly malicious code, they do have two items that, when combined, enable the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code whenever the update server receives a permission request for retrieving JSON from an external source. The researchers observed that this malicious, obfuscated JavaScript even checks for native Chrome debugging tools to prevent detection and subsequent analysis by security professionals.\n\nICEBRG report that after successful injection, the malicious code next establishes a WebSocket tunnel with its command-and-control server so that it can proxy browsing traffic using the victim's browser in order to visit advertising-related domains, presumably for click-fraud purposes. \"The same capability could also be used by the threat actor to browse internal sites of victim networks, effectively bypassing perimeter controls that are meant to protect internal assets from external parties,\" the blog post adds.\n\nAlthough the report states that more than 500,000 users were collectively impacted, some of these victims may be non-unique.

But ironically, \u201cthese advertised SMS management capabilities are turned against the victim. The malware intercepts SMS in a scheme to steal funds from infected users through their mobile banking systems,\u201d explains Trend Micro in a Jan. 10\u00a0blog post\u00a0detailing the threat.\n\nAmong FakeBank's targets are customers of Russian financial institutions Sberbank, Leto Bank, and VTB24 Bank, although a smaller number of samples were also detected in China (17 percent of samples), Ukraine (2%), Romania (1%), Germany (1%), and other nations.\n\nTrend Micro further reports that FakeBank, once enacted on a mobile device, replaces the default SMS management program with its own and then hides its icon to hamper efforts to interfere with its malicious operations. At this point, the mobile malware can upload and analyze any received SMS message and delete them locally, including those banks send with sensitive account information and security codes. The malware can also call an assigned phone number, send an SMS, and steal call logs and contact lists.\n\nAdditionally, Trend Micro found that FakeBank steals data including user phone numbers, installed banking apps, balances on linked bank cards, and location information, and transmits that information to a command-and-control server.\n\nTo prevent victims from uninstalling the app, Fake Bank prevents users from opening device settings. The malware also impedes victims from opening the targeted bank's legitimate app, thereby stopping users from modifying links between their bank card numbers and phone numbers.\n\nFakeBank also hides its payload three layers of obfuscation, and evades detection by exiting a device if it detects anti-virus software.\n\nAccording to Trend Micro, most of FakeBank's C&C domains have IP addresses located in Poland's Warmia-Masuria province and Russia, and most are registered by a company that has previously been connected to other fraudulent domains.

The fake app purports to perform such helpful tasks as system and cache cleaning and memory optimization, but in truth it is capable of malicious remote command execution, information theft, unauthorized SMS sending and URL forwarding, and click/ad fraud. It also signs up unwitting users for premium SMS subscription services, without permission.\n\nLorin Wu, a mobile threats analyst with Trend Micro, reports in the blog post that Google was notified of the threat, and responded by verifying that Google Play Protect has safeguards in place to protect users from the malware family in question. The offending app was also removed, Trend Micro told SC Media.\n\nIn May 2017, Google essentially endorsed Kotlin for Android development purposes by\u00a0announcing first-class support for the programming language. The official Kotlin website describes Kotlin as a statically typed programming language that is fully compatible with Java and Android and can be used to build apps for across multiple platforms. Its advantages, according to the site, include the reduction of boilerplate code, minimization of errors, interoperability across existing libraries, and its tool-friendly nature. However, Wu says it is unclear how these features might benefit a bad actor when developing new malware.\n\n\u201cThe discovery of a first Kotlin-developed malicious app is significant in a way that Google and other publications consider it as the next big thing when it comes to programming languages,\u201d a Trend Micro research spokesperson explained to SC Media.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that a malware was developed using it shows that no programming language, whatever their features are, can be immune to cybercriminal abuse.\u201d\n\nWhen launched, the Swift Cleaner malware sends the infected device's information to a remote command-and-control server. The C&C server sends back various tasks requests, as well as a specific number to which the malware sends an unauthorized SMS message. At this point URL forwarding and click/ad fraud is enabled.\n\nWu continues: \u201cIn its [click/ad] fraud routine, the malware receives a remote command that executes the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) task...\u00a0After that, the injection of the malicious Javascript code will take place, followed by the replacement of regular expressions... This will allow the malicious actor to parse the ads' HTML code in a specific search string. Subsequently, it will silently open the device's mobile data, parse the image base64 code, crack the CAPTCHA, and send the finished task to the remote server.\u201d\n\nThe blog post further reports that the malware can upload users' service provider information, login information and CAPTCHA images to the C&C server, which uses this data to create an unauthorized premium SMS service subscription.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}]}, {"news_name": "LockPoS malware adopts injection technique to evade detection", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/lockpos-malware-adopts-injection-technique-to-evade-detection/article/735425/", "title": "LockPoS malware adopts injection technique to evade detection", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 08, 2018", "body": "LockPoS, a point-of-sale malware program discovered in 2017 stealing payment card data from computers' memory, is now using a new malware injection technique designed to\u00a0bypass antivirus hooks and evade detection.\n\nHod Gabriel, malware analyst at Cyberbit, reported in a company\u00a0blog post\u00a0last week that LockPoS uses three main routines \u2013 all of which are exported from ntdll.dll, a core Windows dynamic link library file \u2013 in order to inject malicious code into a remote process.\u00a0The three routines used are: NtCreateSection, NtMapViewOfSection, and NtCreateThreadEx.\n\nThe technique is reportedly similar to that used by Flokibot POS malware, which shares the same botnet used for distribution \u2013 except LockPoS uses different API calls for the injection.\n\nGabriel said that one technique \"involves creating a section object in the kernel using NtCreateSection, calling NtMapViewOfSection to map a view of that section into another process, copying code into that section and creating a remote thread using NtCreateThreadEx or CreateRemoteThread to execute the mapped code.\"\n\n\u201cThis new malware injection technique suggests a new trend could be developing of using old sequences in a new way that makes detection difficult,\u201d Gabriel continued. \u201cMost EDR [Endpoint Detection and Response]\u00a0and next-gen antivirus products already monitor the Windows functions in user mode.

Carbon Black reported that the number of attacks hitting individual computers protected by its software went from 0.7 per month earlier in the year to more than three times per month as the year closed out.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Forever 21 blames POS malware, lapses in encryption, for payment card data compromise", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/forever-21-blames-pos-malware-lapses-in-encryption-for-payment-card-data-compromise/article/734241/", "title": "Forever 21 blames POS malware, lapses in encryption, for payment card data compromise", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 02, 2018", "body": "A point-of-sale malware infection was responsible for compromising payment card data collected at certain Forever 21 stores last year \u2013 an attack that was exacerbated by a lack of encryption on some devices, the apparel retailer stated last week in its\u00a0update\u00a0to a\u00a0previous incident disclosure.\n\nA Dec. 28 news release published by the $4 billion Los Angeles-based company confirmed that a malicious party accessed data from some customers' payment cards between Apr. 3 and Nov. 18, 2017 \u2013 an act that was made possible through a combination of a malicious attack and a lapse in proper POS security.\n\nAn investigation spearheaded by the retailer determined that encryption technology in a number of POS devices was not always turned on during the time period of the attack. The unprotected data recorded by these devices were then subsequently stored on devices designed to log payment transaction authorizations. Unfortunately, the attackers had gained unauthorized access to the retailer's network, allowing them to infect some of these devices with malware capable of reading payment card magstripe track data, including card numbers, expiration dates, internal verification codes, and occasionally even cardholders' names.\n\n\u201cSo if encryption was off on a POS device prior to April 3, 2017 and that data was still present in the log file at one of these stores, the malware could have found that data,\u201d Forever 21 stated in its disclosure. \u201cIn some stores, this scenario occurred for only a few days or several\u00a0weeks, and in some stores this scenario occurred for most or all of the timeframe,\u201d the retailer warned.\n\nIn most cases, only one or a few POS devices in an affected location were infected, the company added.\n\nForever 21 also said that it is actively collaborating with its payment processors, its POS device provider, and third-party experts \u201cto address the operation of encryption on the POS devices in all Forever 21 stores,\u201d and that it is striving to enhance its security measures. Moreover, the company said it was still trying to ascertain of any of its 21 stores outside the U.S., which have different payment processing systems, were impacted by the incident.\n\nThe retailer initially reported the incident in a news release posted on Nov. 15, but at the time referenced only the lack of encryption and not the malware infection.\n\n\u201cWith its endless POS endpoints, the retail industry has always been a desirable target for cybercriminals. They know that if they can introduce malware into POS networks, they can make a decent amount of cash by selling credit card numbers on the dark web,\u201d said\u00a0Mark Cline, a VP at\u00a0managed security services provider\u00a0Netsurion, in emailed comments. \u201cWith their millions of customers, large retailers, like Forever 21, have typically been the hardest hit. Companies must pay up to $172 per stolen record in clean-up costs.\u201d\n\nForever 21 has set up a toll-free help line for customers at\u00a0855-560-4992.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/data-breach/topic/47235/", "topic_name": "Data Breach"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/retail/topic/47210/", "topic_name": "Retail"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/encryption/topic/47214/", "topic_name": "Encryption"}]}]}]
