Regarding GDPR the Directive aligns itself with the deadline for the implementation.\n\nIt is important to notice that there are two major and distinct bodies inspecting the compliance of the NIS Directive, the Competent Authorities, and NCSC. NCSC stands for National Cyber Security Centre a part of GCHQ, while Competent Authority stands for Regulator Body defined in NIS Directive scope for different critical sectors. This division aims to allow NCSC to carry out its function in providing expert advice and incident response capability to cyber attacks.\n\nThe NIS Directive is established in a layered fashion with a mandatory security outcome to be achieved with each principle like the NIST Security Framework. This assures that the NIS Directive can be implemented throughout the whole industry regardless their sectors. The layered approach takes into account the implementation of the principles without discarding the actual infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe NIS Directive is composed of 14 principles that can be divided into four major objectives: Management of security risks (Governance, Risk Management, Asset Management, Supply chain), Protection of cyber attacks (Service protection policies and processes, Identity and access control, Data Security, System security, Resilient Networks & Systems, Staff Awareness & Training), Detection of cyber security events (Security Monitoring, Anomaly Detection) and reduction of the impact of cyber security events (Response and Recovery Planning, Improvements).\n\nThe directive sets the scope for the identification of operators of essential services and significant disruptive effects that that may pose a threat to national security, the potential threat to public safety and the possibility of significant adverse social or economic impact. The NIS Directive lay the ground for a national framework where Government ensures that the Competent Authorities have the necessary legislative provision to accomplish their duties and the necessary resources to conduct their activities.\n\nThe penalty will only be applied once the operator of essential service fails to comply with the directive tacking into account these following criteria listed in article 14, Security requirements and incident notification: the number of users affected by the disruption of the essential service, duration of the incident and the geographical spread with regard to the area affected by the incident. The fine will be judged and decided upon the accordance with the proper measures that were not taken and nor implemented, with a maximum value of \u20ac17 million. There are some uncertainties if essential services providers can accomplish the implementation requirements of NIS Directive until May 2018.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42861676\nhttp://www.securityweek.com/uk-warns-critical-industries-boost-cyber-defense-or-face-hefty-fines\nhttp://www.itpro.co.uk/cyber-warfare/30405/uk-energy-companies-face-17m-fines-for-poor-cybersecurity\nhttps://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/uk-government-warns-of-17m/\nhttp://www.itpro.co.uk/cyber-warfare/30405/uk-energy-companies-face-17m-fines-for-poor-cybersecurity\nhttp://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20180129/STORY/912318798/UK-to-fine-firms-up-to-%2424-million-for-lax-cybersecurity\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-acts-to-protect-essential-services-from-cyber-attack\nhttps://www.scmagazineuk.com/uk-companies-warned-to-boost-cyber-security-or-face-fines/article/740029/\nhttps://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3025464/critical-infrastructure-firms-could-be-fined-up-to-gbp17m-for-lacklustre-cyber-security\nhttp://www.computerweekly.com/news/252433946/Hefty-fines-confirmed-for-CNI-providers-with-poor-cyber-security\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/677065/NIS_Consultation_Response_-_Government_Policy_Response.pdf\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/nis-directive-top-level-objectives\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/nis-guidance-collection\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-security-of-network-and-information-systems-directive\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC\n\n \n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and an enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

The man, who was using two different pseudo names, contacted an undercover FBI agent on a darknet marketplace.\n\n\n\nLater on, the man decided to acquire a mail bomb from the undercover officer. The agent agreed to sell the explosive to the suspect who paid $550 in digital currency, likely Bitcoin or Monero.\n\n\u201cHe was keen, at first, to buy a car bomb that would explode as soon as the vehicle\u2019s door was opened or closed. But he then decided he wanted a mail bomb, which would go off on being opened.\u201d reported Thomas Fox-Brewster from Forbes.\n\n\u201cThe undercover agent agreed to sell him a bomb, which was in fact inert and delivered to an address provided by one of Bass\u2019 monikers, who paid $550 in virtual currency for the service. Hidden in the fake explosive, however, was a location tracker.\u201d\n\nThe police sent an inert device to the address provided by the suspect, they have also hidden a location tracker in the pack.\n\nThe location tracker allowed the agents to discover the real Bass\u2019s target, they tracked the pack discovering that is was sent to someone in Hahira, Georgia on the morning of April 27, then Feds arrested the man.\n\nBass used an email address at the temporary mail provider Guerilla Mail while communicating with the undercover agent. The defendant used the email address to receive instructions from the vendor on how to use the mail bomb.\n\nThe FBI sent a phishing message to the Guerilla Mail address used by Bass in an attempt to locate him (i.e. tracking his IP address). The message included a weaponized attached document, which, once opened, would send target information to the FBI\u2019s server. The FBI used the Network Investigative Technique (NIT), a method used by Feds in many other cases and that was questioned by privacy advocates that consider it a tool for dragnet surveillance.\n\n\u201cThe message included a document, which, once opened, would send that identifying data to an FBI server, somehow overcoming the IP-masking provided by Tor. A separate document indicated the government also installed what\u2019s known as a pen-trap tool to record all the information coming from the hack.\u201d continues Fox Brewster.\n\nAn executed warrant document reported that the FBI retrieved 19 different IP addresses in the investigation by using the NIT, likely because the suspect was using a VPN service and the Tor network to mask his IP address. It is not clear is the NIT was useful to track the man.\n\nExperts and privacy advocated consider legitimate the NIT usage in the specific case, it was a targeted attack that not impacted other individuals, such as the case of a watering hole attack.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it is, the FBI has to do something to catch criminals, and at least in this case they didn\u2019t resort to draconian methods such as mass surveillance without a warrant,\u201d Flashmob, the administrator of Guerilla Mail, told the media. \u201cInstead, they used a simple procedure with a warrant that doesn\u2019t need much technical ability,\u201d \n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) security researcher Cooper Quintin also confirmed that the FBI\u2019s phishing in the current case was legitimate.\n\nBut what makes this hack unique is that it appears to be the first public example of the FBI legally using a controversial update to the Rule 41 , that allows searches on users of anonymizing services, including the Tor network.\n\nAnyway, there is an element of concern about the Bass case, authorities used \u201cStingray\u201d technology to spy on the suspect and track his movements,\n\nBass pleaded guilty in April to charges of attempting to receive and transport explosive materials with the intent to kill, injure or intimidate.

We are less than one year until the impact of the GDPR is realized, no one is certain what will happen, and everyone is taking a different approach to mitigation.\n\nIn April 2016, the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and it goes into effect in May 2018. The GDPR aims to \u201ccreate more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across EU nations.\u201d (https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-gdpr-general-data-protection-regulation-understanding-and-complying-gdpr-data-protection) One way to summarize the requirements is to say that companies that have operations or do business with EU citizens must know where EU citizens\u2019 data in their care is located, ensure it is being handled appropriately, remove the data when requested and notify citizens\u2019 promptly when their data has been compromised. As an individual, this seems an obvious expectation, but working in a company you learn information has a way of spreading among people and systems and trying to control it is very difficult.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most worrying about the findings,\u201d comments Matt Lock, director of sales engineers at Varonis, \u201cis that one in four organizations doesn\u2019t have a handle on where its sensitive data resides. These companies are likely to have a nasty wake-up call in one year\u2019s time. If they don\u2019t have this fundamental insight into where sensitive data sits within their organizations and who can and is accessing it, then their chances of getting to first base with the regulations are miniscule and they are putting themselves firmly at the front of the queue for fines.\u201d (http://www.securityweek.com/survey-shows-disparity-gdpr-preparedness-and-concerns)\n\nAny company found to be in violation of the regulation, faces fines and penalties up to 4% of their global annual revenue. It is this penalty that has companies taking note and working hard to ensure compliance. But not everyone is taking it seriously, or at least not everyone has started.\n\n\n\nA recent survey conducted on behalf of Varonis highlights a disparity between the priorities of company executives and those responsible for ensuring compliance. Among the 500 IT decision makers surveyed, 75% \u201cface serious challenges in being compliant with the EU GDPR\u201d by the deadline. (http://www.securityweek.com/survey-shows-disparity-gdpr-preparedness-and-concerns) Not surprising when you learn 42% of company executives do not view compliance by the deadline as a priority. Where does this disparity come from?\n\nThe survey included companies from the UK, Germany, France and the US. These companies undoubtedly have different experiences with regulators based on their geographic locations and their operating industries. Some regulators tend to be collaborative in finding a resolution while others tend towards punitive actions. We don\u2019t yet know how EU regulators will apply the GDPR penalties. 92% of respondents expect that a specific industry \u201cwill be singled out as an example in the event of a breach\u201d (http://www.securityweek.com/survey-shows-disparity-gdpr-preparedness-and-concerns) with 52% of UK respondents predicting banking, while France and Germany overwhelmingly predict a breach in technology and telecommunications to be the example.\n\nRegardless of who is first, the scale of the first penalty will be the signal to company executives on how much they should devote to compliance. And as with all business decisions, it is one of the minimizing costs to maximize profitability.\n\n56% of UK respondents believe the GDPR will increase complexity for IT teams and result in higher prices for customers with 22% seeing no benefit to their business. (https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/uk-it-leaders-gdpr-will-drive-up/) With these kinds of numbers, it will be difficult to get executive support for compliance efforts. However, 35% of companies surveyed believe GDPR compliance will be beneficial with better protections for personal data being the biggest improvement. While the GDPR only addresses personal information, the exercise will help companies understand the effort required to manage data better and some may see unexpected benefits.\n\nLeading up to January 1, 2000 there were many similar stories about companies taking different approaches to Y2K remediation. Some had enormous, expensive projects running for years, others scrambled at the end of 1999 while a few focused on response planning and hoped for the best. The requirements of the GDPR are well documented, but the likelihood and size of penalties are still unknown. Different companies take different approaches based on industry, geography, and individual risk tolerances. The only certainty is that everyone is watching for the first big consumer data breach in the EU in 2018 and hoping it isn\u2019t theirs.\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 GDPR, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gdpr", "topic_name": "GDPR"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/regulation", "topic_name": "regulation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ue", "topic_name": "UE"}]}, {"news_name": "Austrian parties SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP want Whatsapp monitoring", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59521/laws-and-regulations/austria-whatsapp-monitoring.html", "title": "Austrian parties SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP want Whatsapp monitoring\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 29, 2017", "body": "Both the Austrian Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP\u00d6) and the Austrian People\u2019s Party (\u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei; \u00d6VP) are fighting for instant messaging monitoring such as WhatsApp.\n\nThe experts believe that the Government will end anonymous mobile phone SIM cards after the election.\n\nThe recent terrorist attack at the Manchester Arena is fueling the discussion about state surveillance measures adopted in Austria to fight terrorism in the country.\n\nAccording to the director of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism, Peter Gridling, there is the concrete risk for an imminent attack.\n\n\u201cConcrete suspicious moments\u201d for an imminent terrorist attack in Austria so far.\u201d said Gridling on Friday evening in \u201cZiB2.\n\n\u201cThe BAT director described it as an \u201cillusion to believe that one succeeds in keeping 300 people around the clock under observation\u201d \u201cPriorities should be set.

effect, internet users across the country are frantically searching for a way to dodge government surveillance and ISP tracking. But how does the law actually affect the average Australian internet user? What is metadata anyway? And what can you do to protect your metadata?\n\nRead on to get the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions following Australia\u2019s Data Retention Law.\n\nWhat Metadata Is?\n\nIn layman terms, Metadata is data about data. To put it more eloquently, Metadata describes a set of data, explaining how and when it was collected and by whom. It summarizes basic information about data, making it easier to find and work with particular instances of data.\n\nWhat\u2019s Included In The Metadata?\n\nMetadata isn\u2019t as much related to what you type on a handheld device or utter on the phone. Rather it is the trail of footprints you leave behind when you visit sites, download files, are online. Understandably, it can give ISPs, telecom companies, snoopers and government agencies everything about your internet activity.\n\nWhat People Says About Metadata Retention?\n\nIt is safe to say that when it comes to online privacy, the average internet user in Australian still doesn\u2019t grasp the implications of the new Data Retention law. In an interview with News.com.au, Dr Jake Goldenfein from Swinburne University of Technology explained,\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to your online data and the privacy protections afforded to it, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know. Unfortunately we just don\u2019t really know what ISPs are doing with data really. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being anonymised and sold, or the degree to which the data they collect is being regulated by privacy law because evidently it depends on the structure of the data bases through which it\u2019s retained.\u201d\n\nWhile the average internet user in Australia would identify freedom as a constitutional right, many are unable to relate the concept with online freedom and privacy.\n\nHowever, Digital Rights advocacy groups across Australia have proactively rallied against the law. They recently called for a \u201cNational Get A VPN Day\u201d to emphasize upon internet users the importance of protecting their personal data, and online privacy and freedom.\n\n\n\nHow To Protect Your Data From Metadata Retention Law?\n\nNow that you know the importance of Metadata in tracking your trail digital footprints, you should have also realized how easy it is for your ISP, Telecom Company or the Government to keep a tab on your online activity.\n\nHowever, there are many ways you can actually wipe out this digital trail and avoid any awkward encounters with the authorities. To completely avoid metadata retention, VPN is the most effective and the cheapest way to prevent your data from ISPs, telecom companies and Govt. Agencies. You can protect your data by getting the most secure VPN service such as IVACY VPN, which is considered the best VPN for Australia to stop Metadata Retention.\n\nHow VPN Helps You In Protecting Your Personal Information?\n\nSince all your data is encrypted during the data transfer process, there is no way it can be tracked or cracked by ISPs, telecom companies, government agencies or any other third-party for that matter.\n\nOnce you\u2019re connected to a VPN, the only information about you that your ISP will be able to see is that you\u2019re connected to a VPN server. All other personal information is encrypted with advanced security protocols of the VPN, making it impossible for your ISP to crack it.\n\nIt is understandable, therefore, why digital right groups in Australia promptly called for National Get A VPN Day right after the Data Retention law was passed.\n\nAbout Author: Anas Baig\n\nAnas Baig is a Cyber Security Expert, a computer science graduate specializing in internet security, science and technology.

Authorities arrested the Russian expert in the Maldives in 2014, they seized his laptop containing more than 1.7 million credit card numbers.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry judged the extradition to the US as a \u201ckidnapping\u201d and against all norms of international law.\n\nThe stolen credit card data were offered for sale on multiple \u201ccarding\u201d websites.\n\nAfter an August 2016 trial, Seleznev was convicted on 38 counts:\n\n\u201cA 32-year-old Vladivostok, Russia, man was sentenced today to 27 years in prison for his computer hacking crimes that caused more than $169 million in damage to small businesses and financial institutions, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes of the Western District of Washington. \u201c\n\n\u201cRoman Valeryevich Seleznev, aka Track2, was convicted in August 2016, of 38 counts related to his scheme to hack into point-of-sale computers to steal credit card numbers and sell them on dark market websites.  U.S. District Judge Richard A. Jones of the Western District of Washington imposed the sentence.\u201d reads the press release published by the DoJ.\n\nIn federal court in Seattle, prosecutors asked for a 30-year prison term because Roman Seleznev \u201cbecame one of the most revered point-of-sale [POS] hackers in the criminal underworld.\u201d\n\nRoman Seleznev was the mastermind behind a profitable hacking scheme that implemented automated techniques to hack into POS systems and deliver malware to steal credit card data.\n\nAccording to the prosecutors said his hacking campaign hit more than 3,700 businesses.\n\n\u201cMany of the businesses targeted by Seleznev were small businesses, and included restaurants and pizza parlors in Western Washington, including Broadway Grill in Seattle, which was forced into bankruptcy following the cyber assault.  Testimony at trial revealed that Seleznev\u2019s scheme caused approximately 3,700 financial institutions more than $169 million in losses.\u201d continues the press release.\n\nRoman Seleznev asked US District Court Judge Richard Jones for clemency due to his medical issues, the man explained he was injured in 2011 terrorist bombing in Morocco.\n\nJones rejected the Seleznev\u2019s argumentation and told the man that the Morocco bombing \u201cwas an invitation to right your wrongs and recognize you were given a second chance in life,\u201d but instead, he \u201camassed a fortune\u201d at the expense of thousands of small business.\n\n\u201cToday is a bad day for hackers around the world,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. \u201cAs Mr. Seleznev has now learned, and others should take note \u2013 we are working closely with our law enforcement partners around the world to find, apprehend, and bring to justice those who use the internet to steal and destroy our peace of mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether the victims are multi-national banks or small pizza joints, we are all victims when our day-to-day transactions result in millions of dollars ending up in the wrong hands,\u201d Hayes added.\n\nAccording to the Russian MP Valery Seleznev, the sentence was \u201cpassed by man-eaters\u201d and that his son was \u201cabducted.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy son was tortured because being in jail in a foreign country after abduction is torture in itself.

The NIST CyberSecurity Framework proposes a guide, which can adapt to each enterprise e for different needs.\n\n\n\nThe framework gives enterprises and businesses the possibility of applying the principles and the best practices of risk management to upgrade security and resilience of critical infrastructure. It provides organization and structure for the different insights of our time, with the best practices already adopted across the industry.\n\nThe Framework is an approach based on risk to manage cyber security risks and is composed of three parts: Framework Core, Framework Implementation Tiers, and Framework Profiles. Each part of the component of the Framework enforces the connection between business owners and the activities of cyber security.\n\nIn its composition, the Framework Core has five concurrent functions and continuous: Identity, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover.\n\n\n\nWhen placed together these functions give a strategic approach to the high level of the life cycle of risk management for cyber security of an organization. The Framework Implementation Tiers gives the context in which an organization understands the risk of cyber security and the processes established to manage that risk.\n\nThe Framework Profile can be defined as an alignment of patterns, guides, and practices of the Framework Core in a particular scenario of implementation. The Framework Profile can be used to identify opportunities for improving cyber security posture by comparing the actual Profile (\u201chow it is\u201d) with the target Profile (\u201chow it will be\u201d).\n\nBy being adaptive, the NIST CyberSecurity Framework can detect and respond to the new threats that appear from out of the thin air. This includes ransomware, IoT hacking and other new types of malware.  The Risk Management is treated as an ongoing process to identify, assess and respond to risk. To manage risk it is proposed that organizations must understand the probability of occurrence of an event and the impact resulting from it.\n\nThis information gives organizations the capability of determining the acceptable risk level for delivering services, which is expressed by its risk tolerance. This understanding gives organizations the capacity of prioritizing the cyber security activities.  It is important to adapt so organizations can respond. The NIST CyberSecurity Framework is available for small business, critical infrastructure services and organizations.\n\nAs cloud, big data and analytics reach a new level so does the possibility of damages for the health care, power grid, IoT and businesses. The Framework is elaborated in the form of Tier to cover all aspects of information security covering assets and employees best practices. This approach gives organizations the ability to isolate threats, in such way that detection and mitigation do not affect other assets of the organization.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://gcn.com/articles/2017/03/31/cybersecurity-framework-revisions.aspx\n\nnvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf\n\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/sp800-53r5_pre-draft.html\n\nhttp://www.govinfosecurity.com/groups-say-nist-must-better-address-healthcares-cyber-needs-a-9841\n\nhttp://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2017/04/bill-improve-small-business-cybersecurity-advances/136750/\n\nhttp://blog.executivebiz.com/2017/04/tech-firms-urge-nist-to-include-vulnerability-disclosure-processes-in-cybersecurity-framework/\n\nhttp://www.govinfosecurity.com/groups-say-nist-must-better-address-healthcares-cyber-needs-a-9841\n\nhttps://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2014/10/nist-releases-final-version-smart-grid-framework-update-30\n\nhttps://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/systems-interoperability-group/health-it-testing-infrastructure\n\nAbout the author Luis Nakamoto\n\nLuis Nakamoto is a Computer Science student of Cryptology and a enthusiastic of information security having participated in groups like Comiss\u00e3o Especial de Direito Digital e Compliance (OAB/SP) and CCBS (Consci\u00eancia Cibern\u00e9tica Brasil) as a researcher in new technologies related to ethical hacking, forensics and reverse engineering.

The range of threats and the challenges they present for law enforcement expand just as rapidly as technology evolves.\u201d\n\n\n\nCyberstalking\n\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) released a report in 2016 which stated that, \u201cunder the federal cyberstalking statute, \u2018cyberstalking\u2019 includes any course of conduct or series of acts taken by the perpetrator on the Internet that place the victim in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury, or causes, attempts to cause, or would be reasonably expected to cause substantial emotional distress to the victim or the victim\u2019s immediate family. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A (2015). However, there are a number of federal statutes that may apply in cyberstalking situations.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s Office of Victims of Crime cites the following common elements of  cyberstalking:\n\nMichigan was the first state to charge someone with online stalking. There are laws at both the state and federal levels that can be applied to cyberstalking.\n\n\u201cStalking, threats, and harassment offenses used to to be primarily local law enforcement matters. But with the increased use of technology and the multi-jurisdictional nature of many of these offenses, federal law enforcement and prosecutors can offer additional resources to effectively pursue these cases that may exceed the capacity of local law enforcement.\u201d\n\nZane D. Memeger, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania wrote that, \u201ca very important tool in our effort to combat stalking and threats via the Internet is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c), which makes it a federal crime, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, to transmit any communication in interstate or foreign commerce containing a threat to injure the person of another.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, there were several federal cyberstalking convictions.\n\nA cyberstalking conviction can have a significant impact\u2013on your finances, reputation, ability to get a job and your freedom. Even if you are not incarcerated, a conviction can have negative impact on your parental rights and can disqualify you from employment in certain settings, such as hospitals and schools.\n\nDoxing\n\nDoxing is the process of gathering identifiable information about an individual or group of people, with the objective to shame, scare, blackmail, defame, bully or endanger the target.\n\nWhile some individuals perform doxing out of general curiosity about a person or company, others have less honorable motives. The motives may include revenge, extortion, or embarrassment. But, publicly posting an individual\u2019s personal details is often done with the knowledge that it could potentially put the targeted individual in danger, particularly if the person is a law enforcement officer, an undercover agent or a high profile individual.\n\nFurther, a dox is likely to drag the families and sometimes friends of the target into the fray. Sadly, this sometimes includes children.\n\nOccasionally, doxing sets the target up for further cybercrimes including identity theft, credit card and/or debit card fraud, phishing, hacking or other cyber crimes.\n\nPosting personal information publicly with the intent to shame, defame, harass or endanger is illegal. It places the doxed individual in a potentially dangerous situation. The federal law often utilized to address doxing is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A:\n\n\u201cTitle 18, United States Code, Section 2261A is the federal stalking statute. Section\n\n2261A(1) covers in-person stalking and Section 2261A(2) covers cyberstalking\u2014 stalking that occurs using Internet or telephones\u2014as well as stalking that occurs using the mail. Section 2261(2), originally enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, has two main provisions\u2014Subsections (A) and (B):\n\nAlso, if you dox someone using a service such as Facebook, Twitter or WordPress you may be in violation of the service\u2019s Terms of Service.\n\nIn the case of a group of individuals involved in the gathering of information, publicly posting it, sharing it or using it to harass the victim, under certain circumstances the act of one conspirator may be treated, by law, as an act of all involved. This means that all the conspirators may be held accountable for the acts committed by any one or more of them even though they did not all personally participate in that act themselves.  This is particularly important in cases in which cyberstalking, including doxing, leads to the murder of the targeted individual:\n\n\u201cIn the case of a jointly undertaken activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that was both:\n\nIt has been argued that it is reasonably foreseeable that publicly posting someone\u2019s personal information could endanger that individual and/or members of their family.\n\nCertain individuals have additional protection from doxing, under the law. This would include jurors, witnesses, court officers, informants and some state and local officers:\n\n\u201c(a)In General.\u2014Whoever knowingly makes restricted personal information about a covered person, or a member of the immediate family of that covered person, publicly available\u2014\n\nshall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n\n(b) Definitions.\u2014In this section\u2014\n\n(1) the term \u201crestricted personal information\u201d means, with respect to an individual, the Social Security number, the home address, home phone number, mobile phone number, personal email, or home fax number of, and identifiable to, that individual;\n\n(2) the term \u201ccovered person\u201d means\u2014\n\n(A) an individual designated in section 1114;\n\n(B) a grand or petit juror, witness, or other officer in or of, any court of the United States, or an officer who may be, or was, serving at any examination or other proceeding before any United States magistrate judge or other committing magistrate;\n\n(C) an informant or witness in a Federal criminal investigation or prosecution; or\n\n(D) a State or local officer or employee whose restricted personal information is made publicly available because of the participation in, or assistance provided to, a Federal criminal investigation by that officer or employee\u201d\n\nDisclosing the identity of an individual working undercover is also often against the law. Anyone who doxes someone who is working undercover for the federal government is in violation of federal law. Those who are protected by this law include intelligence officers, agents, informants, and sources.\n\n\u201cWhoever, in the course of a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents and with reason to believe that such activities would impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States, discloses any information that identifies an individual as a covert agent to any individual not authorized to receive classified information, knowing that the information disclosed so identifies such individual and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such individual\u2019s classified intelligence relationship to the United States, shall be fined not more than $15,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u201d\n\nIt is also a bad idea to tip someone off that they are the focus of a federal investigation:\n\n\u201cObstruction of Justice by \u2018Tip-Off\u2019\n\nAlthough an individual who obstructs a federal investigation by tipping off the targets of the investigation is likely to incur liability either as a principal under 18 U.S.C. 2 or as an accessory after the fact under 18 U.S.C. 3, there are several federal anti-tip-off statutes like \u00a71510, which prohibits bank officials from notifying suspects that they are under investigation, and which imposes a similar restriction on insurance company officers and employees.\n\n(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who \u2026 (e) (i) intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, intercepted by means authorized by subsections 2511(2)(a)(ii), 2511(2)(b) to (c), 2511(2)(e), 2516, and 2518 of this chapter, (ii) knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of such a communication in connection with a criminal investigation, (iii) having obtained or received the information in connection with a criminal investigation, and (iv) with intent to improperly obstruct, impede, or interfere with a duly authorized criminal investigation \u2026 (4)(a) \u2026 shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both,\u201d 18 U.S.C.2511(1)(e), (4)(a).\u201d\n\nThis includes social media posts that would provide warning to a suspect or suspects that they are being investigated by the federal government.\n\nCyberstalking & Doxing Cases\n\nThe Psychology of Trolls & Cyberstalkers\n\nResearchers from Winnipeg found clear evidence that trolling is associated specifically with sadism and to a lesser degree with Machiavellianism. The researchers also found that trolls who admit to being sadistic report that they tend to troll because they find it to be pleasurable.\n\nCyberstalkers, however, are often propelled by the presence of personality disorders, poor emotional control, and antisocial tendencies.\n\nWhile trolls take pleasure in their behavior, cyberstalkers are more likely to be \u201chighly distressed and angry with the victim. While they may get secondary pleasure from it, stalkers who intimidate or threaten usually have the very specific purpose of expressing their negative feelings and making the victim feel as bad as they do.\u201d\n\nTrolls are in it for fun but a cyberstalker tends to be more emotionally invested in pursuing the victim. Ignoring a troll will generally make them go away, but ignoring a cyberstalker can produce an escalation in the stalking behavior. If it gets to that point, it\u2019s time to consider involving law enforcement.\n\nHelp for Victims\n\nThe DOJ has issued recommendations for people who believe they are victims of cyberstalking. The first step should be to demand the stalker to cease all contact and stop the harassing actions. Additionally, in order to facilitate prosecution of the perpetrator, the victim should:\n\nAdditionally, the LookingGlass Special Investigations Unit recommends:\n\nPay close attention to messages containing attachments or links to other websites; they may be infected\n\nWritten by: CandiceLanier\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\n \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 doxing, law)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberstalking", "topic_name": "Cyberstalking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/doxing", "topic_name": "doxing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trolling", "topic_name": "Trolling"}]}, {"news_name": "Prisons and Courts Bill allows mobile networks to deploy IMSI catchers outside of prisons", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/56730/laws-and-regulations/imsi-catchers-prisons.html", "title": "Prisons and Courts Bill allows mobile networks to deploy IMSI catchers outside of prisons\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 27, 2017", "body": "The Prisons and Courts Bill, introduced to Parliament last week, will let mobile networks to deploy IMSI catchers outside of prisons to snoop on mobile phone users.\n\nThe IMSI catchers are surveillance equipment used for intercepting mobile phone traffic, calls, tracking movements of mobile phone users block phones from operating.\n\nAn IMSI catcher runs a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack acting as a bogus mobile cell tower that sits between the target mobile phone and the service provider\u2019s real towers.\n\nThe deployment of IMSI catchers aims to prevent, detect or investigate the use of mobile phones in prisons.\n\n\n\nThe measure is a novelty because in the past the use of IMSI catchers under the legal provisions in the Prisons (Interference with Wireless Telegraphy) Act 2012 was restricted within prison walls.\n\nThe decision represents a threat to the privacy of citizens, privacy advocates pointed out the IMSI catchers allow a dragnet surveillance.\n\nThe Clause 21 of the bill, along with its schedule 2, will amend the Prisons (Interference with Wireless Telegraphy) Act 2012 to allow the Justice Secretary to authorize \u201cinterference with wireless telegraphy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of State may authorise a public communications provider to interfere with wireless telegraphy.\n\nAn interference with wireless telegraphy authorised under subsection may be carried out only for the purpose \n\nThe measure will allow detecting illegal use of mobile devices by prisoners illicitly communicating with people outside.\n\nIn October 2016, it was publicly disclosed the news that UK police has purchased police this mobile phone snooping technology to track suspects\u2019 devices and intercept their communications as part of their investigations.\n\nAccording to the Bristol Cable the UK police is using the Stingray equipment for its operations.

At the time of the article, the cellular surveillance system was costing as much as $400,000 in the basic configuration, and its price varied with add-ons ordered by the agency.\n\nThe IMSI-catcher is a surveillance solution used by military and intelligence agencies for telephone eavesdropping. It allows for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking movements of mobile phone users. Essentially, an IMSI catcher operates as a bogus mobile cell tower that sits between the target mobile phone and the service provider\u2019s real towers. The IMSI catcher runs a Man In the Middle (MITM) attack that could not be detected by the users without using specific products that secure communication on mobile devices.\n\nThe use of the IMSI-catcher is raising a heated debate in the United States because devices like StingRay and other similar cellphone tracking solutions are being widely adopted by law enforcement agencies across the country.\n\nStingRay allows law enforcement to intercept calls and Internet traffic, send fake texts, inject malware on a mobile device, and to locate the targets.\n\nNow Curtis Waltman from Motherboard published an interesting blog post which provided further details on the cost of the StingRay phone surveillance tool.\n\nWaltman published data provided by the Rochester Police Department in New York that responded to the Cell Site Simulator Census, an initiative that census the cellphone surveillance equipment use and policy.\n\n\u201cA mapping of police departments and agencies nationwide that are using IMSI catcher (Stingray) technology. Included in this mapping is a focus on the policies, procedure and contractual agreements that department\u2019s are formulating as they adopt the controversial surveillance device.\u201d states the description for the census.\n\nData shared by Motherboard are very interesting and provides useful insights about their surveillance systems, their components, and prices. It a \u201ccompletely unredacted quote list of Harris Corporation products\u201d.\n\nDocuments shared by the Rochester Police Department show clearly how Harris sells the Stingray equipment to law enforcement.\n\nAccording to the documents, devices are often sold in packages, like the StingRay II Vehicular System that is offered for sale with devices (i.e. Three different kinds of Harris\u2019 Harpoon signal amplifiers) that allow its use for a patrol vehicle.\n\nHow much cost a StingRay II Vehicular System?\n\nThe package includes a laptop, three kinds of software for accessing different types of cellular networks, and an AmberJack cellphone tracker goes for a grand total of $148,000.\n\n\u201cThe Amberjack is an important accessory for the surveillance systems like Stingray, Gossamer, and Kingfish. It is a direction-finding system antenna that is used for cellular device tracking. It costs nearly $35,015\u2033 I wrote in a blog post published early this year.\n\nThe prices for the AmberJack is quite similar I published early this year.\n\n\n\nAccording to documents published by Motherboard, The KingFish package, Harris Corporations smaller, mobile version of the StingRay, is sold for $157,000.\n\nThe single KingFish device is not so expensive as I have reported early this year.\n\n\u201cKingfish is a surveillance transceiver that is used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies to track cellular devices and exfiltrate information from mobile devices over a targeted area. It could be concealed in a briefcase and allows gathering of unique identity codes and shows connections between phones and numbers being dialed. Its cost is slightly higher than $25,000.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe Rochester PD expressed its interest for the entire KingFish, except the laptop.\n\n\n\nThe company is including in the surveillance packages also training activities that go for $12,000.\n\n\u201cThese packages also come with the option of a training package, costing $12,000, and a one year maintenance package that will cost $169,000 if your department decided to splurge for the whole line of Harris\u2019 products (this was 2011 so the 4G network cell site simulator the HailStorm wasn\u2019t released yet.) Training isn\u2019t included interestingly enough, so police departments are more or less forced to pay for training on these complicated and powerful devices.\u201d states the post published by Motherboard.\n\nThe note at the end of the document provides also further details of the surveillance technology, including the specifications required to use the equipment in a real scenario.\n\n\u201cThe StingRay and Kingfish can be run out of a car\u2019s cigarette lighter, while the StingRay II requires a 2000W power inverter. That is hungrier for power than almost any household appliance, save a dryer or oven.\u201d continues the post.\n\nIf you are interested in StingRay surveillance technology, give a look at the article \u201cStingRay Technology: How Government Tracks Cellular Devices\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Surveillance, Law enforcement) \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/imsi-catcher", "topic_name": "IMSI catcher"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-devices", "topic_name": "mobile devices"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stingray", "topic_name": "StingRay"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "UK National Security Strategy, Cyber Security is a top priority", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/54289/reports/uk-national-security-strategy.html", "title": "UK National Security Strategy, Cyber Security is a top priority\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 11, 2016", "body": "The strategy considers cyber security a top priority alongside the resurgence of state-based threats (Russia\u2019s actions in Syria and Ukraine) and the terrorism (extremism and instability).\n\nWhen dealing with the impact of technology, especially cyber threats the report states:\n\n\u201cThe range of cyber threats and cyber actors threatening the UK has grown significantly \u2013 both from state and non-state actors.

Hammond explained that hack back is the unique alternative to a conflict.\n\n\u201cSpeaking before the launch, Hammond said Britain must \u201ckeep up with the scale and pace of the threats we face\u201d and insisted that the new funding will \u201callow us to take even greater steps to defend ourselves in cyberspace and to strike back when we are attacked\u201d.\u201d reported The Guardian\n\n\u201cThe money \u2013 which almost doubles the amount set out for a similar strategy in 2011 \u2013 will be used to improve automated defences to safeguard citizens and businesses, support the cybersecurity industry and deter attacks from criminals and \u201chostile actors\u201d.\u201d\n\nHammond announced a new posture of the UK against the cyber threats, with a specific focus on the protection of the nation\u2019s critical national infrastructure and business.\n\n\u201cWe will deter those who seek to steal from us, or harm our interests,\u201d Hammond told at the Microsoft\u2019s Future Decoded conference in London on Tuesday. \u201cWe will strengthen law enforcement to raise cost and reduce rewards,\u201d he said of criminal attackers.\n\nThis is just first step ahead in cyber security matter, he promised the UK would \u201ccontinue to invest in cyber defense capabilities,\u201d in particular in the technology that could allow the British cyber army to trace and hack back the state-sponsored hackers.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have the ability to respond in cyberspace to attack that takes down power networks or air traffic control systems we would be left with the impossible choice of turning the other cheek or resorting to a military response \u2013 that\u2019s a choice we don\u2019t want to face.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt the precursor to any state-on-state conflict would be a campaign of escalating cyber attack. We will not only defend ourselves in cyberspace but will strike back in kind when attacked.\u201d\n\nIn the same day, Hammond, who chairs the Cabinet\u2019s cross-department cyber-security committee, had listed high-profile cyber attacks against British critical infrastructure.\n\nThe active defence model implemented by the UK Government includes a new generation software to detect and repel cyber attacks and also the creation of dedicated cyber units.\n\nHammond pointed to the recent deployment of an application that was able to zero incidence of 50,000 fraudulent emails from crooks that pretend to be sent from Government offices.\n\nHammond also referenced the TalkTalk data breach that exposed details of 156,959 customers and that lead the Information Commissioner to fine the company \u00a3400,000.\n\n\u201cCEOs and boards must recognise they have responsibility to manage cybersecurity,\u201d Hammond said.\n\nHammond stressed the adoption of a proper security posture also for private businesses that are a privileged target of hackers.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, technology companies must take responsibility for incorporating the best possible security measures into the technology of their products. Getting this right will be crucial to keeping Britain at the forefront of digital security technology.\u201d \n\nNo doubts, the active defence is the new approach of many governments in response to the growing cyber threats.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Active Defence , UK)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/active-defence", "topic_name": "Active defence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking-back", "topic_name": "hacking back"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nation-state-hackers", "topic_name": "nation-state hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/philip-hammond", "topic_name": "Philip Hammond"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uk", "topic_name": "UK"}]}, {"news_name": "Hacking back the Mirai botnet, technical and legal issues", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52821/hacking/mirai-botnet-2.html", "title": "Hacking back the Mirai botnet, technical and legal issues\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 29, 2016", "body": "The Mirai botnet, this name is familiar to security experts due to the massive DDoS attack that it powered against the Dyn DNS service a few days ago.\n\nThe Mirai malware was first spotted by the researcher MalwareMustDie that confirmed it was designed to hack into poorly configured and vulnerable IoT devices. Its source code was leaked on the popular criminal hacker forum Hackforum by a user with moniker \u201cAnna-senpai\u201d giving the opportunity to anyone to compile and customize its own version of the threat.\n\nExperts who reviewed the code have discovered a weakness that could be exploited to shut down the botnet stopping it from flooding the targets with HTTP requests, this means that it is possible to hack back the threat. The experts from Invincea discovered three vulnerabilities in the Mirai code, one of them, a stack buffer overflow, could be exploited to halt the DDoS attack powered by the botnet. The buffer overflow vulnerability affects the way Mirai parses responses from HTTP packets.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most significant finding is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP flood attack code. When exploited it will cause a segmentation fault (i.e. SIGSEV) to occur, crash the process, and therefore terminate the attack from that bot. The vulnerable code has to do with how Mirai processes the HTTP location header that may be part of the HTTP response sent from an HTTP flood request.\u201d reported the analysis published by the security firm Invincea.\n\n\n\nThe researchers highlighted that their attack would not have helped in the DNS-based DDoS attack against provider Dyn, but it would halt the Layer 7 attack capabilities of the Mirai botnet implemented in the coded leaked online.\n\nThe researchers at Invincea successfully tested a proof-of-concept exploit in a virtual environment setting up a debug instance of the Mirai bot, a command and control server and a target machine.\n\n\u201cThis simple \u201cexploit\u201d is an example of active defense against an IoT botnet that could be used by any DDoS mitigation service to defend against a Mirai-based HTTP flood attack in real-time. While it can\u2019t be used to remove the bot from the IoT device, it can be used to halt the attack originating from that particular device. Unfortunately, it\u2019s specific to the HTTP flood attack, so it would not help mitigate the recent DNS-based DDoS attack that rendered many websites inaccessible.\u201d explained the Scott Tenaglia, Research Director in the cyber capabilities team at Invincea Labs.\n\nTenaglia remarked that the method proposed by the company doesn\u2019t clean the compromised devices, instead it could be effective against HTTP flooding powered by the Mirai Botnet.\n\nThe method proposed by the researchers is a form of active defense that has important legal implications because anyway, who is defending its system from the attack power a response attack against the attacker\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nHacking back is illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nHacking a bot means to make an unauthorized access to a computer system and such kind of operations have to be authorized by a court order.\n\nInvincea has made an excellent work and isn\u2019t suggesting the hacking back, but limited its analysis on the technical aspect of the Mirai botnet and its vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the gray space of active defense,\u201d Tenaglia told to ThreatPost. \u201cIn the defense world, this is a hotly contested issue. Say if your IoT is already compromised and bad code is already running, if I do something to the bad guy\u2019s code, am I breaking law?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never comment on the legality of this,\u201d Tenaglia said. \u201cI think this gives us another point to discuss with regard to active defense. Is this something we think is ok? I don\u2019t think it would hurt the system; it might help it. If a bot is degrading performance of the Internet connection because of the packets it\u2019s sending out, and if this attack kills the process and the connection gets better, have we helped you?

Among the victims, there was also the German Government and its politicians, including the chancellor Angela Merkel. The German Government was shocked at the time and expressly manifest his dissent to President Obama.\n\nThe BND supported espionage operations against various targets, including the European companies EADS (the manufacturer of Airbus planes) and Eurocopter, and European politicians, including German ones.\n\nIn August, the German weekly Die Zeit disclosed documents that reveal how the German Intelligence did a deal with the NSA to get the access to the surveillance platform XKeyscore.\n\nInternal documents show that Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), received the software program XKeyscore from the NSA in return of data from Germany.\n\nBack in 2o11, the NSA demonstrated the capabilities of the XKeyscore platform of the BfV agency. After two years of negotiation, the BfV signed an agreement to receive the NSA spyware software and install it for analyzing metadata collected on German citizens. In return, the German Agency promised to share metadata collected.\n\nThe NSA tool collects \u2018nearly everything a user does on the internet\u2019, XKeyscore gives \u2018widest-reaching\u2019 collection of online data analyzing the content of emails, social media, and browsing history.\n\nIn 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden explained that a tool named DNI Presenter allows the NSA to read the content of stored emails and it also enables the intelligence analysts to track the user\u2019s activities on Facebook through a system dubbed XKeyscore. \n\nAccording to Die Zeit, the document \u201cTerms of Reference\u201d stated: \u201cThe BfV will: To the maximum extent possible share all data relevant to NSA\u2019s mission\u201d.\n\nThe BfV didn\u2019t provide the details of the agreement to Germany\u2019s data protection commissioner, nor it informed the Parliamentary Control Panel.\n\nIn January, the BND has resumed its internet surveillance with the support of the NSA, the activities were suspended following the revelation on the mutual espionage activities. In July 2015 Wikileaks revealed an extended economic espionage activity conducted by the NSA in Germany, the spies were particularly interested in the Greek debt crisis.\n\nBack to the new German surveillance law, it bans the Intelligence from spying on EU countries and its citizens, as well as EU institutions, except in the case of investigation of terrorist activity.\n\n\u201cIt also requires the BND to submit requests for cooperation with other spy agencies with a parliamentary committee and bans the agency from carrying out industrial espionage.\u201d states the Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt requires the head of the BND, the chancellor\u2019s office and an independent panel of judges to approve strategic foreign espionage activities.\u201d\n\nStay Tuned!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 German surveillance law, espionage)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "UK Police purchased IMSI-catcher technology for mobile surveillance", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/52365/laws-and-regulations/imsi-catcher-uk.html", "title": "UK Police purchased IMSI-catcher technology for mobile surveillance\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 17, 2016", "body": "Privacy advocates and rights groups are in revolt against the UK law enforcement that has purchased mobile phone snooping technology.\n\nThe rights groups are protesting against the adoption of the IMSI-catcher technology that could be used for dragnet surveillance.\n\nThe IMSI-catcher is a surveillance solution used for intercepting mobile phone traffic, calls, tracking movements of mobile phone users block phones from operating.\n\nAn IMSI catcher runs a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack acting as a bogus mobile cell tower that sits between the target mobile phone and the service provider\u2019s real towers.\n\nThe UK police has purchased police this mobile phone snooping technology to track suspects\u2019 devices and intercept their communications as part of their investigations.\n\nThe problem is that devices such as the IMSI-catcher monitor indiscriminately monitor mobile devices in an area of up to 8km, representing a serious threat to users\u2019 privacy.\n\nRights groups are demanding for transparency from the police about the use of surveillance technology.\n\nAccording to the Bristol Cable the UK police is using the Stingray equipment for its operations.

The process does not require any expensive and sophisticated equipment. All needed parts are low cost and were obtained from local electronics distributors. By using the described and successful hardware mirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry attempts. \u201d reads the paper.\n\nThe NAND Mirroring technique was one of the methods proposed to the FBI that rejected it, but Skorobogatov  demonstrated the Bureau was wrong.\n\n\u201cIt does not work,\u201d explained the FBI Director James Comey.\n\nSkorobogatov used off-the-shelf equipment to hack into an iPhone 5C running iOS 9.3. He removed the NAND memory chip from the iPhone circuit board and copied the data to a test board many times over.\n\n\n\nThen the researcher tried to brute force the image of the data extracted from the NAND memory. According to the researchers, he found the correct code in around 20 hours, the time necessary to brute-force a four-digit passcode, and in a few weeks, he was able to discover a six-digit one.\n\n\u201cThe mirroring solution presented in this paper was achieved using off-the-shelf components bought from an electronics distributor with a budget of under 100 dollars. The same approach could be applied to the newer models of iPhone. .\u201d reads the paper.\n\nThe researcher demonstrated that the NAND mirroring technique also works on iPhone 5S as well as iPhone 6 devices, that use the name type of NAND Flash memory.

The expensive solutions proposed by the surveillance firms allows to spy on computers and smartphones, unfortunately, their abuses in the wild are very common. Many governments used them in the past to track dissidents and oppositions, in many cases the use of surveillance solutions represented a severe violation of human rights.\n\nDespite we can read thousands of good posts on the topic, it isn\u2019t so easy to see a live demo of surveillance systems, but the popular journalist Lorenzo Bicchierai has published an interesting post on Motherboard with the intent to show us how government spyware infects a computer.\n\n\u201cMotherboard has obtained a never-before-seen 10-minute video showing a live demo for a spyware solution made by a little known Italian surveillance contractor called RCS Lab. Unlike Hacking Team, RCS Lab has been able to fly under the radar for years, and very little is known about its products, or its customers.\u201d wrote Bicchierai.\n\nMotherboard published a video related to a live demo presented by an expert from the Italian surveillance firm RCS Lab. The video shows how the company\u2019s spyware Mito3 could be used to spy on an unaware suspect.\n\n\u201cMito3 allows customers to listen in on the target, intercept voice calls, text messages, video calls, social media activities, and chats, apparently both on computer and mobile platforms.

Meanwhile, at the international level, they also called for the signing and ratification of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.\n\nThese propositions by the two ministers were issued based on the incidents of terrorist attacks happened in their countries, and the attackers were said to be using the highly encrypted communications apps.\n\nThat being said, there is already a directive in practice for national security pointed out by Commission spokesperson Natasha Bertaud. In an email statement to the Fortune she said,\n\n\u201cThe current data protection directive (which also applies to the so-called over-the-top service providers) allows member states to restrict the scope of certain data protection rights where necessary and proportionate to, for instance, safeguard national security, and the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences,\u201d she further added that \u201cThe new general data protection regulation (which will apply as from 25 May 2018) maintains these restrictions.\u201d\n\nIn an opinion based statement on encryption, the German minister talked about \u201cgood practices\u201d and \u201cinnovative ideas\u201d to tackle encryption. Whereas, his fellow French minister stepped the press conference up by specifically naming the Telegram app and criticizing it.\n\nWhatsapp and Telegram took their stance by stating that they cannot decrypt the data because of the encryption mechanism where only users have the access to their conversations. Even though a data protection directive is in practice, the explicit agenda upon access to encryption may be to have control over such apps internationally and EU-wide.\n\n\n\nGiving her opinion on the matter of encryption, in a French editorial Le Monde, Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, President of the National Commission on Informatics and Liberties, France\u2019s data protection authority.\n\n\u201cIt is through encryption that we can make a bank transfer safely. It is through encryption that we can store our health data in a shared medical file (DMP) online. It is also thanks to this tool that investigations on \u201cPanama Papers \u201d were possible. For companies, encryption is now the best protection against economic espionage,\u201d she wrote.\n\nEarlier this year in the U.S., over the debate in FBI-Apple encryption suit we saw telecommunication providers backing up Apple and the anti-encryption hardliners such as Senator Lindsey Graham, switching sides in favor of Apple after realizing the technical reality of the case.\n\n\u201cI was all with you until I actually started getting briefed by the people in the intel community,\u201d Graham told Attorney General Loretta Lynch during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. \u201cI will say that I\u2019m a person that\u2019s been moved by the arguments about the precedent we set and the damage we might be doing to our own national security.\u201d\n\nThe strong of the anti-backdoor and pro-encryption opinion came from European Commission Vice-President, Andrus Ansip who supported Apple\u2019s decision for refusing to unblock the iPhone of the terrorist.\n\n\u201cIdentification systems are based on encryption. I am strongly against having any kind of backdoor to these systems.\n\nIn Estonia, for example, we have an e-voting system. If people trust an e-banking system, they can also trust an e-voting system. This trust is based on a strong single digital identity guaranteed by the government, which is based on encryption. The question is who will trust this e-voting system if there are some back doors and someone has the keys to manipulate the results. The same goes for the e-banking system.\u201d\n\nEuropean Parliament resolution on September 2015 on \u201chuman rights and technology\u201d turns out to be in favor of strong encryption.\n\nAs the debate is heating up, the next step could be the revision of \u201ce-privacy\u201d directive of European Union. Refreshing the memory of may 2016, the EU executive body set out new e-privacy proposal, that would significantly change the telecommunication regulation, to create a \u201clevel playing field\u201d  between traditional and online telecommunications services like Skype and Whatsapp.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times quoted documents, the European Commission will further proceed the e-privacy revision and bring Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp to same regulatory fold as traditional telecommunication operators and may explicitly ask for decryption orders. That would affect Google, Netflix, Amazon and Apple as well in the EU.\n\nThere are also some news of possible opinion that French and German governments are running into elections next year, and are using this tactics to strong arm them.

Is it possible that the FBI hosts a porn website? The first thing that I have is that the FBI might run a similar website for its investigation, its agents could launch a sort of watering hole attack in order to track a specific category of suspects (i.e. see PlayPen investigation and NIT tool).\n\nOk, sounds realistic, but why the notorious Megaupload.org website that was seized by law enforcement now is hosting porn and adult content?\n\nMegaupload.org, the popular website operated by the notorious Kim Dotcom and seized by feds 5 years ago, and other domains currently managed by the FBI are serving adult content.\n\nMegastuff.co, Megaworld.mobi, Megaclicks.org, Megaupload.com, and Megavideo.com are some sample of the domains seized to Kim Dotcom.\n\n\u201cThis week we discovered that Megaupload.org is now hosting a site dedicated to soft porn advertisements. Other seized domains are also filled with ads, including Megastuff.co, Megaclicks.org, and Megaworld.mobi.\u201d reported TorrentFreak.\n\nThe site initially was displaying explicit messages informing visitors that the FBI had seized it as part of a criminal investigation, but now things are changed and visitors can see adult content.\n\n\u201cRegular readers may recall that something similar happened to the mainMegaupload.com domain last year. At the time we traced this back to an expired domain the FBI used for their nameservers, Cirfu.net.\u201d continues torrentfreak.com\u201cAfter Cirfu.net expired, someone else took over the domain name and linked Megaupload.com to scammy ads. The U.S. authorities eventually fixed this by removing the nameservers altogether, but it turns out that they didn\u2019t do this for all seized domains.\n\nA few weeks ago the Cirfu.net domain expired once more and again it was picked up by an outsider. This unknown person or organization parked it at Rook Media, to generate some cash from the FBI-controlled domains.\u201d\n\nBelow the Tweet sent by Kim Dotcom one year ago.\n\nBREAKING: US Govt has lost control of seized Megaupload domain. It\u2019s now linking to porn, drugs, malware & scam ads! http://t.co/OgmiqVsE2Y\n\n\u2014 Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) 28 maggio 2015\n\n\n\nThe WHOIS data related to the Megaupload domain still reports the old Cirfu.net nameservers.\n\n\u201cTheir handling of the Megaupload domain is a reflection of the entire case: Unprofessional,\u201d commented Dotcom.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Kim Dotcom, Megaupload)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/kim-dotcom", "topic_name": "Kim Dotcom"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/megaupload", "topic_name": "Megaupload"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/piracy", "topic_name": "piracy"}]}, {"news_name": "Australian Police obtained access to the Love Zone Child Porn Site and Got 30 IPs from US", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/50437/cyber-crime/australian-police-love-zone.html", "title": "Australian Police obtained access to the Love Zone Child Porn Site and Got 30 IPs from US\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 20, 2016", "body": "Apart from FBI, there are other organizations that have tried to identify the participants of child porn websites, so that they could get their hands on them and make them pay. In fact, recently the Australian police managed to access a website called The Love Zone.\n\nThis is where they got to 30 US IPs at least. So, instead of Americans revealing IPs overseas and prosecuting them, it is the other way around here.\n\nThe website was in the dark web and used Tor. It was based in the US, which means that the Australian police (Queensland Police Service\u2019s Task Force Argos, to be specific) had to hack them and access their sensitive data. At some point, over 29,000 members had already subscribed to the site, which is shocking news!\n\nIn order to lure the members of the site, the police sent a video file. The members wanted to open it, of course; it was relevant to their own preferences, after all!\n\nMore analytically:\n\n\u201cWhen a user clicked on that hyperlink, the user was advised that the user was attempting to open a video file from an external website. If the user chose to open the file, a video file containing images of child pornography began to play, and the [foreign law enforcement agency] captured and recorded the IP address of the user accessing the file. FLA configured the video file to open an Internet connection outside of the Network software, thereby allowing FLA to capture the user\u2019s actual IP address, as well as a session identifier to tie the IP address to the activity of a particular user account.\u201d\n\nThe whole investigation is not the same as that of the FBI and its 135 US cases. Yet, the Aussies handed over the evidence they had collected to the FBI. In this way, justice would finally emerge. It is worth pointing out that the owner of the Love Zone, Shannon McCoole, is serving a 35-year sentence for child sexual abuse.\n\nIt remains unclear whether or not the investigation of the Australian police was just against US targets.\n\nAs for the FBI, the only comments about the operation of the Love Zone were the following: \u201cThe FBI, led by its Legal Attaches in numerous countries around the world, seeks to foster strategic partnerships with foreign law enforcement, intelligence, and security services as well as with other US government agencies by sharing knowledge, experience, capabilities and by exploring joint operational opportunities.\u201d\n\nWritten by Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at Cyberogism.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is a tech and security enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

The operation conducted by the FBI is code named \u2018Operation Pacifier,\u2019 the web child porn website under investigation was Playpen hosted on the Tor Network.\n\nThe Feds used the network investigative technique (NIT) to discover the suspects\u2019 real IP address, their MAC address and other pieces of information.\n\nAccording to the court documents, the FBI monitored a bulletin board hidden service launched in August 2014, named Playpen, mainly used for \u201cthe advertisement and distribution of child pornography.\u201d The FBI was able to harvest around 1300 IPs, and until the moment 137 people have been charged. The network investigative technique used by the FBI included computers in the UK, Chilem and Greece.\n\nIn January, a report published by the Washington Post confirmed that in the summer of 2013 Feds hacked the TorMail service by injecting the NIT code in the mail page in the attempt to track its users.\n\nPrivacy advocates highlighted that the FBI used only one warrant to hack computers of unknown suspects all over the world. The defense also argues that the FBI left the child pornography site running in order to be able to do the network investigative technique.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s expanding extraterritorial raising a heated debate on the case. In April 2016, the US Supreme Court has approved amendments to Rule 41, which now let U.S. judges issue search warrants for hacking into computers located also outside their jurisdiction.\n\nUnder the original Rule 41, a judge can only authorize the FBI to hack into computers in the same jurisdiction. The rule change was approved despite the opposition from civil liberties groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Access Now, it is curious that the U.S. Justice Department has described the modification as a minor change.\n\nNew revelations in the case confirm that the FBI also compromised 50 computers based in Austria.\n\nAccording to Joseph Cox from MotherBoard, the Austrian MPs asked to the Parliament for more details on child pornography. In response, the politician Johanna Mikl-Leitner confirmed that Austrian law enforcement supported the FBI in the Operation Pacifier, admitting for the first time that the computers in the country were compromised by the NIT. In reality, the Austrian authorities\n\nIn a letter sent by Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the FBI investigated on 50 Austrian IP addresses belonging to suspects alleged involved in possession and distribution of child pornography. The investigation allowed the FBI and the Austrian police to track the IP addresses of machines containing \u201ccountless child pornography files,\u201d.\n\nThe letter also confirmed that the authorities were still investigating the case, the unique certainty is that the 50 IPs were tracked under the Operation Pacifier.\n\nMotherboard cites a presentation of the Europol that refers the Operation Pacifier and its results. The Operation Pacifier generated 3239 cases, including the Austrian ones.\n\n\n\nBoth Europol and the FBI agencies declined to comment the case.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Operation Pacifier, FBI )\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/europol", "topic_name": "Europol"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-pacifier", "topic_name": "Operation Pacifier"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pedo", "topic_name": "pedo"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}]}, {"news_name": "A Nigerian man behind the $60m online fraud network arrested by the Interpol", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49912/cyber-crime/nigerian-man-interpol.html", "title": "A Nigerian man behind the $60m online fraud network arrested by the Interpol\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "August 2, 2016", "body": "The Interpol announced the arrest of a 40-year-old Nigerian national that the mastermind behind an online fraud network which made illegal profits worth more than $60 million (54 million euros).

Without an easy button, state and local agencies have to weigh the costs of breaking encryption and the likelihood of a conviction if a wiretap unsuccessfully produces incriminating evidence.\n\nThe Court\u2019s report also runs counter to warnings by John Brennan, director the US\u2019s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nWhen asked why recent terrorist attacks in Pairs went undetected by the intelligence community he warned there were, \u201ca lot of technological capabilities that are available right now that make it exceptionally difficult, both technically as well as legally, for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need.\u201d\n\nMaking it even more difficult on the intelligence community, the Obama administration in November of last year suggested that \u201cthe time was not right\u201d for legislation forcing technology companies to provide the government with methods of breaking encryption.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the CIA raising concerns. National Security Agency (NSA) director James Clapper testified to Congress that the Islamic State is \u201cvery security conscious\u201d and a \u201cprolific user of strong encryption technology, posing a major challenge\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to clapper ISIL commonly makes use of end-to-end encryption creating a major obstacle for the intelligence community discerning the various plots by the terrorist groups.  Clapper supports strong encryption for businesses such as Apple and Google, but called that support into question by stating U.S. officials are trying to \u201cthreat the needle so that we ensure privacy and security.\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s report also reveals that 94 percent of wiretaps in 2015 involved intercepts of voice communications being made through the use of cellular phones. It is widely known that US intelligence snoops have access to those calls and is likely pushing many criminals to use other methods of communication outside of the telephone networks.\n\n\n\nRevelations made public by Edward Snowden about the NSA is likely a key factor in the tech-savvy nature of criminals using modern technologies. According to Clapper, Snowden pushed encryption usage seven years forward as many searched for ways to circumvent the NSA\u2019s wide-reaching espionage program.\n\nAs government\u2019s around the world continue to struggle with the privacy versus security equation, it is likely those adoption encryption are only going to increase and this could be even more problematic for law enforcement that the intelligence agencies.  According to the Court\u2019s report, a majority of wiretaps have been used in thwarting the illegal narcotics trade.\n\nIn 2015, wiretaps were responsible for about a 19 percent conviction rate of those arrested as the result of a wiretap.  The Eastern District of Virginia reported a somewhat better result of about 25 percent.  With results this low and costs being so high, the thought of encryption getting in the way all but indicates a need for selectivity in choosing who to wiretap.\n\nIt is clear that the debate between privacy and security will continue well into the future.  Like the old saying, security does not exist in nature and we can\u2019t avoid danger if we don\u2019t see it coming.  It\u2019s a tough choice with no clear answer.  Civil liberties groups and the federal government are likely to spar endlessly on the debate that will likely not be settled until public sentiment settles and politicians are forced to take a final stand on the matter.  Perhaps, the biggest driver in swaying the debate one way or another is public safety and the threat of terrorism as James Clapper has warned.\n\nThe past few weeks the world has been rocked by a series of deadly terrorist attacks in Orlando, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iraq.  This is likely to push the debate forward as investigations may reveal that the ability to tap ISIL communications could have prevented the attacks.\n\nWritten by: Rick Gamache\n\nRick Gamache is a freelance writer with 25 years\u2019 experience in the cyber security field.

Lionel Barbar editor of the Financial Times predicts that the first two quarters could face recession due to the post economic financial stress.\n\nThe cyber aspect of needed security in this realm is adamant in light of the new break from the union.  Cyber security has always been a major test but some are worried that cybercrime will expand as a result of this action. For example it could affect information sharing laws that were already in existence and halt the current practices if the laws are not re-enacted in a timely manner.\n\nThe breakaway could put a strain on the ability of the agencies to protect the citizens from cyber-attacks. The expectations are that cybercrime will be on the rise and information sharing will be reduced.  It\u2019s also likely to affect the recruitment of talented technical professionals and wreak havoc in the regulatory compliance divisions.\n\n\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation \u201cGDPR\u201d is scheduled to update their regulations which unify and strengthen existing laws for EU citizens.  The new regulations are likely to be strict on 3rd party monitoring of data.   In addition, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office \u201cICO\u201d will force the UK to adopt the GDPR.\n\nThe Network and Security Directive \u201cNISD\u201d plays a timely role as well: It is not a regulation; therefore each Member State will have to craft legislation in order for it to become a law. Member states will have a total of 21 months to implement the directives into laws and an additional 6 months to identify essential services to mitigate cyber risks.\n\nThe first known offense happened on Monday where an online petition for second EU referendum was hijacked and more than 77,000 votes were added.  There is also huge amount of uncertainty, as to the impact on work visas for non-UK residents as this is likely to dampen the appeal.\n\nThe other potential concern is for organized crime to run rapid in this slack environment.  The EU Cybersecurity Strategy coupled with the creation the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) is focused on protecting the European Union.  The UK could foresee new challenges since its isolation from the European Union.  It is highly likely that the EU and UK will need to collaborate to create new cybersecurity legislative policy with high priority on information and asset sharing structures.\n\nAbout the Author Theresa Frush:\n\nTheresa Frush is a former AmeriCorps Vista Fellow who served as a Special Projects Coordinator amongst various federal agencies.

Modern Terrorism is technological, it makes a large use of the Internet and cyber terrorists represent a concrete threat for every country.\n\nMany governments are discussing \u201canti-terrorism\u201d legislations to contrast the threat, of course, privacy advocates are worried about the evolution of such kind of legal framework that could open the door to a massive surveillance and censorship. bill is now on its way to becoming law in Russia.\n\nIn these days a new anti-terrorism bill is becoming law in Russia, it includes a large number of issues related to internet monitoring that will have a severe impact also on IT companies and ISPs that operate in the country. Telecom and internet companies have to record and store all customer communications for six months, potentially at a multitrillion-dollar cost.\n\nThe internet firms will have to store all communications metadata for a year while telecom companies will have to store them for three years.\n\nThe bill that is sustained by the United Russia party passed last Friday in the Duma, a landslide victory if we consider that it obtained 277 votes for, 148 against, and only one abstaining. It now moves to Russia\u2019s Federal Council and the Kremlin, where it\u2019s expected to pass into law.\n\nThe next step is the final approval of the anti-terrorism bill by the Russia\u2019s Federal Council and the Kremlin, but we have no doubts that it will be soon a Russian law..\n\nTelecom operators and internet companies, for example, will have to record and store all customer communications for six months. This means that the companies will have to face multitrillion-dollar additional costs to be compliant with the new anti-terrorism law.\n\nThe new law is being called an anti-terrorism bill, but it could be considered as the formal legalization of already ongoing surveillance activities.\n\nYes, in Russia, like elsewhere, the Government already has the technology to conduct a massive network surveillance. In August 2014, the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has signed a decree that will extend the use of SORM-2 to social network surveillance.\n\nIt\u2019s known that the Russian Government is applying a strict surveillance on the Internet within the country, the Kremlin has developed a system code-named \u201cSORM-2\u201d to monitor Russian citizens.\n\nThe Russian Government has obliged national ISPs to purchase and install the probes used by SORM-2 system that allows the Federal Security Service (FSB) to monitor Internet traffic including online communications.\n\nSORM-2 is a mass surveillance system that allows the Government of Moscow to track online activities of single individuals thanks to the support of Russian ISP.\n\n\n\nThe new anti-terrorism bill obliges all internet firms into providing mandatory backdoor access into encrypted communications for the Russian intelligence Agency (FSB).\n\nAccording to the news shared with the media, the law will have no impact on instant messaging services implementing end-to-end encryption, this means that popular applications like Telegram, WhatsApp, Viber, and Signal will be out of the scope of the law. The bad news is that the law will extend to all the ISP operating in the country that will have to provide the Russian Intelligence the access to the entire traffic.\n\nThe companies that will not be compliant with the anti-terrorism bill will face fines that can reach 1 million rubles ($15,000), but I think that financial sanctions are the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe government stiffens penalties for those who make online propaganda or who encourage discussion concerning terrorism. They risk imprisonment up to seven years.\n\nThe anti-terrorism law also cover the omission of informing authorities about activities related to terrorism, it will be considered a crime too and authorities will punish the culprits with up to one year in prison.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Anti-terrorism bill, Russia)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Tech coalition asked to roll back changes to Rule 41 that allows FBI mass hacking", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48604/laws-and-regulations/changes-rule-41.html", "title": "Tech coalition asked to roll back changes to Rule 41 that allows FBI mass hacking\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 22, 2016", "body": "Congress should block the changes to the rules for the regulation of US law enforcement investigations.

This release features important security updates to Firefox.\u201d states the announcement published by the Tor Project.\n\nA group of researchers from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), composed of Mauro Conti, Stephen Crane, Tommaso Frassetto, Andrei Homescu, Georg Koppen, Per Larsen, Christopher Liebchen, Mike Perry, and Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi published an interesting paper entitled \u201cSelfrando: Securing the Tor Browser against De-anonymization Exploits\u201d that presents the recently introduced Selfrando feature.\n\nThe team also shared the Selfrando project on GitHub.\n\nSelfrando is an enhanced and practical load-time randomization technique implemented for the Tor Browser that aims to defend Tor users against exploits.\n\nThe Selfrando will prevent intelligence agencies from de-anonymizing users through exploits. In the past, we discussed many cases where the FBI and law enforcement used exploits to unmask Tor users, including the case of the Playpen child pornography portal.\n\nIn the Playpen case, the FBI arrested Jay Michaud, a Vancouver public schools administration worker right after the law enforcement closed the popular child pornography site that was hosted on the dark web. The authorities used a specific exploit, known as network investigative technique (NIT), to track visitors of the Playpen bulletin board hidden service.\n\nThe FBI was able to harvest around 1300 IPs, and until the moment 137 people have been charged. The network investigative technique used by the FBI included computers in the UK, Chile, and Greece.\n\nWhat is Selfrando?\n\nSelfrando is a solution developed by the experts to significantly improve security over standard address space layout randomization (ASLR) techniques. The ASLR techniques are today used by Firefox and the most popular browsers, they were involved in protection from exploits leveraging buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\nThe team of researchers worked with the experts at the Tor Project to ensure that the Selfrando feature is fully compatible with AddressSanitizer (ASan), a compiler feature to detect memory corruption. The ASan technique is implemented in a hardened version of Tor Browser for test purposes, so the Tor Project decided to include Selfrando in the hardened releases of the Tor Browser.\n\n\n\nThe researchers demonstrated that the startup and performance overheads resulting from the implementation of the Selfrando technique are negligible (less than 1% overhead to running times).\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the feature is that it doesn\u2019t need further development efforts, it doesn\u2019t need too many changes to existing code.\n\nLet me suggest to give a look to the report \u2026 it is simply amazing.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013 (Tor Browser, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/code-randomization", "topic_name": "code randomization"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-web", "topic_name": "Dark Web"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/de-anonymization-exploits", "topic_name": "De-anonymization exploits"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/selfrando", "topic_name": "Selfrando"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor-browser", "topic_name": "Tor Browser"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI has a facial recognition system that can access 411 million photos", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48503/laws-and-regulations/facial-recognition-system.html", "title": "FBI has a facial recognition system that can access 411 million photos\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 18, 2016", "body": "When we talk about technology, privacy and security are concepts that are often at odds.\n\nLet\u2019s think for example of a facial recognition system, this technology could be used in many contexts for security reason, but often raises serious concerns for the users\u2019 privacy.\n\nLet\u2019s think for example of FBI\u2019s Next Generation Identification (NGI) facial recognition system, it was initially estimated that it has access to 70 million photos, but recently the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has discovered that the bureau has access to 411.9 million pictures of Americans and foreigners alike.\n\nIt is worrisome that the US law enforcement has access to photos of individuals that have no criminal records.\n\nAccording to the GAO, the FBI\u2019s Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation (FACE) Services unit has access to an impressive amount of data from various sources.

The fraudsters will use the method most commonly associated with their victim\u2019s normal business practices.\u201d\n\nScammers use to pretend to be executives that send emails to employees that tricked into thinking the messages are legit, hand over sensitive information to the attackers.\n\n\n\nThe impact of such kind of scams could be dramatic, the Austrian engineering firm FACC which designs Airbus, Boeing aero parts lost about 50 million euros ($55 million) due to a BEC scam.\n\nIn May, the FBI issued the annual Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report that indicates 7,838 victims reported the loss of more than $263 million.\n\nNow the FBI has updated its data reporting 22,143 worldwide BEC victims representing $3.1 billion in losses since January 2015. In the US the FBI counted 14,032 U.S. BEC victims representing $961 million dollars in losses between October 2013 and May 2016.\n\nThe data is alarming for the US authorities, 88 percent of all worldwide victims being U.S.-based and 90 percent of losses coming from US businesses.\n\n\u201cThe BEC scam continues to grow, evolve, and target businesses of all sizes. Since January 2015, there has been a 1,300% increase in identified exposed losses. The scam has been reported by victims in all 50 states and in 100 countries. Reports indicate that fraudulent transfers have been sent to 79 countries with the majority going to Asian banks located within China and Hong Kong.\u201c continues the PSA.\n\nIn order to avoid such kind of scams, the FBI recommends companies control the attack surface, carefully manage every corporate information is shared online, especially hierarchical information, job descriptions, and out of office details. Be suspicious of requests for secrecy or pressure to take action quickly. Consider additional IT and financial security procedures, including the implementation of\n\nLet me close with statistics included in the PSA:\n\nDomestic and International victims: 22,143\nCombined exposed dollar loss: $3,086,250,090\n\nThe following BEC statistics were reported in victim complaints to the IC3 from October 2013 to May 2016: \n\nDomestic and International victims: 15,668\nCombined exposed dollar loss: $1,053,849,635\nTotal U.S. victims: 14,032\nTotal U.S. exposed dollar loss: $960,708,616\nTotal non-U.S. victims: 1,636\nTotal non-U.S. exposed dollar loss: $93,141,019\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Business e-mail compromise BEC , FBI)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Jacob Appelbaum leaves the Tor Project after accusation of sexual misconduct", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/48065/breaking-news/jacob-appelbaum-leaves-tor-project.html", "title": "Jacob Appelbaum leaves the Tor Project after accusation of sexual misconduct\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 5, 2016", "body": "Appelbaum is recognized as one of the most active and influential digital advocates and security researchers.

Business Email Compromise (BEC), Email Account Compromise (EAC), and Ransomware are the hottest topics of 2015 report.\n\n\n\nThe annual report aims to promote the public awareness by aggregating and highlighting the data provided by the general public. IC3 has received 3,463,620 complaints since its establishment in May 2000. Over the last five years, 300,000 complaints have been received per year reporting millions of dollars\u2019 losses.\n\n\n\nBEC also called wire transfer phishing is a sophisticated scam that targets long-established relationship between businesses and foreign suppliers with regular wire transfer payments. Fraudsters compromise legitimate email accounts to instruct victims to redirect invoice remittance payments and conduct unauthorised fund transfer. The scam was first reported to the IC3 in 2010 but it has evolved and become more sophisticated since 2013. The report indicates 7,838 victims reported the loss of more than $263 million. EAC has a similar approach with BEC but targets individuals or individual professionals and 281 victims of this scam lost over $11 million.\n\nRansomware targets individuals and organisations and costs 2,453 victims reported to the IC3 over $1.6 million. Ryan Kalember, SVP, Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint stated ransomware is the biggest difference he has seen in cybercrime trends after 2015. Ransomware has been seen in 3 percent of sample emails in 2015 but a surprising increase of 27 percent in the first five months of 2016 has been observed in comparison with previous year.\n\nIt is worth noting that these statistics address those victims who went to the authorities, but the scope of ransomware attack is more serious. David Emm, a principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab said: \u201cIn 2015, 753,684 ransomware attacks were blocked on computers belonging to Kaspersky Lab customers\u201d.\n\nThe report indicates that the highest number of victims belongs to the age group of 50-59 in the male population and the age group of over 60 in female people.

Anyway, Facebook is accused of using the data resulting from the scan for advertising and to target its offer.\n\nThe company defends itself against accusations, claiming that its systems scan users\u2019 private messages in bulk, and keeps any extracted data in an anonymized way.\n\nThe plaintiffs sustain that Facebook is currently maintaining a database, dubbed Titan, it includes all the URL-related message alongside with metadata that could be used to track a specific user. Each record includes, for example, the date and time the message was sent, and the user IDs of both the sender and the recipient.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Facebook is accused of threatening users\u2019 privacy with its practices.\n\nThe CNET news portal reached the company for a comment on the case and below is reported the reply of a company spokesperson who confirmed they stopped any practice that exposes user\u2019s privacy to serious risk.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the court\u2019s finding that the alleged conduct did not result in any actual harm and that it would be inappropriate to allow plaintiffs to seek damages on a class-wide basis,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told CNET. \u201cThe remaining claims relate to historical practices that are entirely lawful, and we look forward to resolving those claims on the merits.\u201d\n\nThe position of the company is in contrast with the claims of the plaintiffs that sustain Facebook is still scanning private messages for commercial purposes violating users\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s source code not only reveals that Facebook continues to acquire URL content from private messages, but that it also continues to make use of the content it acquires.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2012 and still have to be proceeded, the plaintiffs have until June 8 to file any amended complaints.\n\nIf you appreciate my effort in spreading cyber security awareness, please vote for Security Affairs as best European Security Blog.

There was, however, a significant increase in requests that were modified by the court before they were approved: 80 applications were revised in 2015, as opposed to 19 in 2014.\n\nAdditionally, according to the report, the FBI sent out 48,642 national security letters (NSL) in 2015. NSLs are demands for information which include gag orders forbidding the recipient from disclosing the request.\n\nThe FISA Court is responsible for approving or denying electronic spying requests for use in foreign intelligence activities.

Included in the requests were personal data and messaging content from Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\n\n\n\nSixty percent of those requests for access to the data of Facebook users in the U.S. came with a non-disclosure order preventing Facebook from alerting the user to the fact that their personal data had been accessed and their communications were being monitored.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is one step closer to being authorized to remotely access computers anywhere in the world.

It is often viewed as an invasion of privacy and employer overstepping their authority.\n\nFrom an employer perspective, employee monitoring is a very useful tool, allowing them to solve a number of issues and challenges, and raise the general health and effectiveness of an organization. It is something that employers used for a very long time. A couple of decades ago they tapped corporate phones, checked mail and conducted video surveillance. Nowadays they monitor employee PCs, social networks, and e-mails. Most of the time such monitoring is not conducted out of maliciousness toward employees, but rather to serve a specific business-related purpose.\n\nThe question then is \u2013 can the compromise on employee monitoring be found? How to monitor employee internet usage while getting him or her on your side and ensuring cooperation? Practice shows that it is possible, and in this article we will try to give you some tips on how to monitor employee PC use ethically and without overstepping your boundaries.\n\n\n\nFirst, it is important to understand the reason why it can be very useful and often even necessary to monitor what employees are doing. Such reasons often differs from one organization to the other. However, they all can be generalized into three main categories:\n\nEmployee monitoring can solve these crucial issues to the benefit of an organization. However, your employees most likely will not be happy with your decision to monitor their PCs.\n\nMost employees viewing monitoring negatively and usually meet it with hostility. It is rarely considered to be a useful business or security tool, but rather an oppressive practice by the overly zealous boss.\n\nThis negative opinion is usually based on a number of legitimate concerns that can be summarized as follows:\n\nInvasive monitoring often leads to lower general work satisfaction. As a result, such monitoring will produce an opposite effect to the one intended: instead of improving employee productivity, it will reduce it. However, there are certain ways and best practices to change the situation and conduct employee monitoring that satisfies all involved parties.\n\nOne of the best tips to employee computer monitoring, is to approach the issue ethically and fairly, with respect for the privacy of your employees in mind. First, you need to make sure that employee monitoring is prompted by a very serious business need that can be clearly formulated and easily communicated to your employees. You should not monitor your employees beyond your direct business needs, and should not collect data, that is not necessary for business purposes.\n\nIt is important to create a clear formal monitoring policy based on your needs and stick to it. Make sure that your employees are familiar with it and understand it. You need to clearly communicate what employee actions are being monitored and in what way, and how this information will be used to help your organization.\n\nOne of the best practices on how to monitor employees computer usage is to notify them when they are being monitored. While it is not required by federal law, it will show your concern for the privacy of your employees and will help to facilitate the relationship of trust between you.\n\nAnother important point that can help you make employee monitoring more effective is the right software selection. It is very important to use the right tools for the right job. You need to clearly define what type of information you want to collect and why, and choose the tool that will allow you to do just that.\n\nThere are a lot of different simple solutions for recording certain types of user activity, such as keystrokes recording, network monitoring, and employee tracking software, etc. These solutions are easily available and not expensive, often even free. They can be used to control employee productivity, monitor their internet and social network usage, and as a basic security precautions.\n\nHowever, if your goal is to organize centralized monitoring at a number of endpoints, monitor compliance, or you want a way to actually reliably detect and prevent insider threats, then you need to employ a more sophisticated professional software. Such solution needs to be heavily protected, configurable, and capable of collecting a large amount of important data regarding network and application usage.\n\nAgent-based user monitoring software, are able to create video recording of everything employee sees on their screen coupled with large amounts of relevant metadata. Such solutions allow you to comply with regulations, thoroughly protect your organization from insider threats and provide you with all the necessary data for employee performance evaluation. They can be configured to record either the whole user session, or only specific data, allowing you to collect only information that is needed.\n\nThe downside is that most of these business solutions are very expensive and can be cost-prohibitive for small companies, although there are some offers with flexible licensing.

Smith to develop and deploy the exploit that allowed law enforcement to identify Tor users.\n\nEdman joined the Tor Project in 2008, he worked on the as a developer to work on Vidalia that is a cross-platform GUI for controlling Tor.

He worked with the FBI to dismantle a ring of child pornography in the Dark Web and to shut down the popular black market Silk Road. The operation allowed the FBI to identify and arrest the creator and owner of Silk Road, Mr. Ross Ulbricht.\n\nThe DailyDot, citing a testimony, reported that Edman was a key figure in the Ulbricht\u2019s arrest. He traced $13.4 million in bitcoins from Silk Road to Ulbricht\u2019s laptop.\n\n\u201cAccording to testimony, it was Edman who did the lion\u2019s share of the job tracing $13.4 million in bitcoins from Silk Road to Ulbricht\u2019s laptop, which played a key role in Ulbricht being convicted and sentenced to two life terms in federal prison. Edman worked as a senior director at FTI Consulting at the time.\u201d continues the DailyDot.\n\nThe law enforcement deployed the Cornhusker on three servers that were hosting several anonymous child pornography websites. The Torsploit was designed to trigger flaws in the Flash component inside the Tor Browser.\n\nAccording to the documents obtained by the DailyDot, Cornhusker is no longer in use, it was replaced by the \u201cNetwork Investigative Technique\u201d (NIT) to obtain IP and MAC addresses of Tor users.\n\nUnfortunately, the NIT usage was not considered legitimate by the court during a hearing on the shut down of the world\u2019s largest dark web child pornography site, PlayPen.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cornhusker, Tor Hacking, Torsploit)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "Dutch police seize the Ennetcom encrypted communication network", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/46626/cyber-crime/ennetcom-sized.html", "title": "Dutch police seize the Ennetcom encrypted communication network\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 24, 2016", "body": "Another success of the Dutch law enforcement against the cybercrime.

This guide also provides recommendations and guidance for email digital signatures and encryption (via S/MIME), recommendations for protecting against spam messages.\n\nSecurity email needs a multidisciplinary approach that involves secure solutions, effective configurations and trained personnel.\n\n\u201cEmail communications cannot be made trustworthy with a single package or application. It involves incremental additions to basic subsystems, with each technology adapted to a particular task.\u201d states the NIST guide on secure email. \n\n\n\nEncryption is essential to secure email systems, the guide urge administrators to build out a cryptographic key management system (CKMS) and use keys to protect email sessions.\n\n\u201cAs with any cryptographic keying material, enterprises should use a Cryptographic Key Management System (CKMS) to manage the generation, distribution, and lifecycle of DKIM keys. Federal agencies are encouraged to consult NIST SP 800-130 [SP800-130] and NIST SP 800-152 [SP800-152] for guidance on how to design and implement a CKMS within an agency.\u201d\n\nDespite the numerous incidents occurred in the last years, the NIST still considers trustable the DNS due to the numerous security enhancements, including the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), which is a set of extensions to DNS that provide to DNS clients origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity.\n\nThe NIST guide highlights the importance of the S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) for secure email messages.\n\n\u201cSecure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is the recommended protocol for email end-to-end authentication and confidentiality. S/MIME is particularly useful for authenticating mass email mailings originating from mailboxes that are not monitored, since the protocol uses PKI to authenticate digitally signed messages, avoiding the necessity of distributing the sender\u2019s public key certificate in advance. This usage of S/MIME is not common at the present time, but is recommended.\u201d states the guide.\n\nThe guide included a warning to the organizations that rely on cloud services for their email, in particular on services offered by a third party.\n\nOrganizations need to make sure any email sent by third parties will pass SPF checks, the verification is simple because the enterprise administrator should include the IP addresses of third-party senders in the enterprise SPF policy statement RR.\n\nThe NIST guide is out for public comment until May 1st, I suggest you to read it.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 NIST, secure email)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptographic-key-management-system", "topic_name": "Cryptographic Key Management System"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nist-guide", "topic_name": "NIST Guide"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/secure-email", "topic_name": "secure email"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Could hackers have hacked election to make Pe\u00f1a Nieto President?", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45865/hacking/hackers-helped-pena-nieto-president.html", "title": "Could hackers have hacked election to make Pe\u00f1a Nieto President?\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 1, 2016", "body": "Until now we have seen something of similar only in the TV series, but the reality could overwhelm the fiction because a Columbian hacker claims he helped Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in winning Mexican presidential election.\n\nThe hacker named Andr\u00e9s Sep\u00falveda revealed to have operated in a team with peers to install a malware to monitor opponents during the 2012 campaign as part of a hacking campaign codenamed \u2018black propaganda.\u2019\n\nThe hackers helped Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto win Mexico\u2019s 2012 presidential election, they manipulated the event it in nine countries across Latin America.

The man, Su Bin (also known as Stephen Su and Stephen Subin), 50, had been charged in a 2014 indictment with hacking into the computer networks of US defense contractors, including the Boing. The hackers aimed to steal blueprints and intellectual property for the F-22 and F-35 fighter jets and C-17 transport aircraft. In January 2015, Edward Snowden revealed China stole designs for the US-built F-35 Fighter jet hacking computer systems at US Defense contractors, and provides details also a counter-intelligence operation run by the NSA.\n\nAccording to Snowden, the US Intelligence was aware that Chinese cyber spies have stolen \u201cmany terabytes of data\u201d about the design of Australia\u2019s Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II JSF. The details of the operation are described in a set of top secret documents published by the Der Spiegel magazine.\n\nChinese hackers have allegedly stolen as much as 50 terabytes of data from the US Defense contractors, including the details of the fighter\u2019s radar systems, engine schematics, \u201caft deck heating contour maps,\u201d designs to cool exhaust gasses and the method the jet uses to track targets.\n\nThe purpose of the Chinese Government is to acquire intellectual property on advanced technologies, benefiting Chinese companies on the market and narrowed the gap in the research of advanced technological solution. Military experts speculated that the stolen blueprints  could help the country to develop a new generation of advanced aircraft fighter, so-called \u201cfifth-generation\u201d fighters.\n\nIn 2014, according to a US criminal complaint, computers of Boeing and other military contractors have been hacked to steal intellectual property and trade secrets on transport aircraft. The initial attacks against Boeing likely occurred between Jan 14th and March 20th, 2010. The complaint is dated June 27th and was disclosed on July 2015, it describes how the attackers have spied on Boeing computer networks for a year, and then have compromised systems of the principal US Defense contractors to steal intellectual property. According to the information disclosed, the hackers were mainly interested in the C-17 military transport.\n\nThe US law enforcement agencies accused Su Bin, a Chinese businessman residing in Canada, of supporting two countrymen in the organization of cyber attacks on Boeing systems to collect information about the C-17 and other military programs.\n\n\n\nThe criminal complaint revealed that Su Bin with two unnamed co-conspirators, identified as UC1 and UC2, were collecting technical information related to components and performance of the C-17 transport and Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-22 and F-35 fighter jets. During the period related the first attacks against Boeing, Su Bin was operating in the United States, as confirmed by FBI Special Agent Noel Neeman in the complaint.\n\nSu Bin was arrested on June 2014 month in Canada, Neeman revealed that an email attachment sent by UC1 claims the Chinese hackers exfiltrated 65 gigabytes of data over a couple of years, including information on the C-17 transport from Boeing systems. The FBI agent collected evidence of data theft from Boeing systems, but there is no proof that the data that the stolen information was classified. The email provides also information related to the huge effort spent by hackers to compromise the Boeing system, the document details the architecture of the internal network of Boeing, which includes 18 domains, 10,000 PC and a \u201chuge quantities\u201d of defense appliances.\n\n\u201cThrough painstaking labor and slow groping, we finally discovered C-17 strategic transport aircraft-related materials stored in the secret network,\u201d the document says.\n\nHe was sent to the United States in February 2016.\n\nThe hackers described the difficulties to breach the system avoid detection system deployed by Boeing.\n\n\u201cFrom breaking into its internal network to obtaining intelligence, we repeatedly skipped around in its internal network to make it harder to detect reconnaissance, and we also skipped around at suitable times in countries outside the U.S. In the process of skipping, we were supported by a prodigious quantity of tools, routes and servers, which also ensured the smooth landing of intelligence data.\u201d states the report.\n\nThe complaint did not provide any description on how hackers have stolen information about the Lockheed Martin jet fighters.\n\nAnother document issued by the FBI described the communications between UC1 and UC2, which states that the Chinese hackers successfully acquired information about US military project by establishing hot points in the U.S., France, Japan and Hong Kong. This last document, according to the complaint, reveals that the subjects have received about $1 million to build a team and infrastructure outside of China, the investigators are working to understand who has funded the entire operation.\n\nNow in a plea agreement filed in a California federal court, Su admitted to conspiring with two unnamed persons in China from October 2008 to March 2014 to hack network of US contractors and steal \u201csensitive military information and to export that information illegally from the United States to China.\u201d\n\nThe Court documents did not provide details on who operated the cyber espionage campaign, but security and intelligence experts believe that Su was working for the Chinese Government.\n\n\u201cSu Bin admitted to playing an important role in a conspiracy, originating in China, to illegally access sensitive military data, including data relating to military aircraft that are indispensable in keeping our military personnel safe,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin.\n\n\u201cThis plea sends a strong message that stealing from the United States and our companies has a significant cost; we can and will find these criminals and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nSentencing was set for July 13, when Su faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a monetary fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain from the offense.\n\nThe US government will issue a final ruling on the case on July 13.

The idea to introduce a backdoor into its system is not feasible because could open the users to many other threat actors.\n\n\u201cThe United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers.

But now the US government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create.

Apple has ensured that its assistance is necessary by requiring its electronic signature to run any program on the iPhone. Even if the Court ordered Apple to provide the government with Apple\u2019s cryptographic keys and source code, Apple itself has implied that the government could not disable the requisite features because it \u201cwould have insufficient knowledge of Apple\u2019s software and design protocols to be effective.\u201d\u201d states the document. \n\n\u201cFor the reasons discussed above, the FBI cannot itself modify the software on Farook\u2019s iPhone without access to the source code and Apple\u2019s private electronic signature. The government did not seek to compel Apple to turn those over because it believed such a request would be less palatable to Apple. If Apple would prefer that course, however, that may provide an alternative that requires less labor by Apple programmers.\u201d\n\nThe situation is paradoxical if we read the statement of the Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, which told journalists that he would have arrested Tim Cook for not helping the FBI to unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone.\n\nThe Apple\u2019s lawyer Bruce Sewell expressed his position on the filling that contains requests not acceptable and defame the company.\n\n\u201cWe help when we\u2019re asked to.

The FBI is demanding that Apple disables the iPhone\u2019s \u201cauto-erase\u201d security feature that wipes the Apple mobile device after 10 failed passcode attempts.\n\nOn the other hand, the company of Cupertino is refusing to unlock the device, announcing a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.\n\nSnowden in a video call at Blueprint for a Great Democracy conference on Tuesday accuses the FBI of lying defining its declaration defining its claims as absurd, in reality, he used a more colorful expression.\n\n\u201cThe FBI says Apple has the \u2018exclusive technical means\u2019 to unlock the phone,\u201d said Snowden in video conference \u201cRespectfully, that\u2019s horse sh*t.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same day, Snowden shared via Twitter a link to an American Civil Liberties Union blog post titled \u201cOne of the FBI\u2019s Major Claims in the iPhone Case Is Fraudulent,\u201d which explains that the FBI has the ability to bypass iPhone protection mechanism.\n\nThe global technological consensus is against the FBI.

I\u2019ll go into the technical details (which the FBI surely already knows) below.\u201d states the post.\n\nThe post explains that FBI can simply make a copy of the content of the Effaceable Storage while trying to guess the passcode.\n\n\u201cSo the file system key (which the FBI claims it is scared will be destroyed by the phone\u2019s auto-erase security protection) is stored in the Effaceable Storage on the iPhone in the \u201cNAND\u201d flash memory. All the FBI needs to do to avoid any irreversible auto erase is simple to copy that flash memory (which includes the Effaceable Storage) before it tries 10 passcode attempts. It can then re-try indefinitely, because it can restore the NAND flash memory from its backup copy.\u201d continues the post.\n\n\u201cThe FBI can simply remove this chip from the circuit board (\u201cdesolder\u201d it), connect it to a device capable of reading and writing NAND flash, and copy all of its data. It can then replace the chip, and start testing passcodes. If it turns out that the auto-erase feature is on, and the Effaceable Storage gets erased, they can remove the chip, copy the original information back in, and replace it. If they plan to do this many times, they can attach a \u201ctest socket\u201d to the circuit board that makes it easy and fast to do this kind of chip swapping.\u201d\n\n\n\nImage credit: http://www.mobpart.com/iphone-5c-c-61_63\n\nSnowden expressed his solidarity to IT giants that are working to provide new solutions, and improve the existing ones, to protect the users\u2019 privacy through the implementation of strong encryption.\n\n\u201cWe should support vendors who are willing to [say], \u2018You know, just because it\u2019s popular to collect everybody\u2019s information and resell it to advertisers and whatever, it\u2019s going to serve our reputation, it\u2019s going to serve our relationship with our customers, and it\u2019s going to serve society better.

From voice encryption tools to free and premium VPNs, this business sector extends a long ways past the fringes of the United States. Today, the encryption economy incorporates no less than 55 distinctive nations crosswise over Europe, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe sprawling environment of programming improvement makes a conspicuous issue for governments and security organizations trying to screen or contain the privacy software. Free programs and other dispersed undertakings commonly exist \u201con numerous servers, in different nations, all the while,\u201d and organizations offering anonymous tools can relocate the borders over outskirts without breaking a sweat.\n\nTo those focusing already, none of this is news. Numerous onlookers likewise concur that authoritative regulation of encryption would be a dangerous endeavor. In any case, when in doubt, maybe we shouldn\u2019t rush to accept that the Internet will dependably and definitely discover a route around the stumbling country state.\n\nIn the setting of the present talk, it merits remembering that administrations have numerous different choices available to them with regards to controlling the utilization of protection tools. While these choices are once in a while completely powerful as a regulation measure, they can have some impact with regards to dissuading new clients from taking up specific advancements.\n\nWe should take the instance of VPNs as a sample. Once a business organizing apparatus, the VPN has lately transformed into a membership based individual administration for online privacy, security and remote server access \u2013 getting to be a standout amongst the most easy to use appearances of protection tools. Governments around the globe are currently scrambling to stay aware of the quick take-up of VPNs and their assorted applications for customers, nationals, and crooks alike.\n\nAs a major aspect of a project having international research, a group of the digital media analysts have been following and looking at universal patterns in VPN use, society, and regulation. Throughout the most recent year, researchers have been concentrating how VPNs (and other security weapons) are being utilized for stimulation, legislative issues, and correspondence in various nations. The outcomes have been enlightening.\n\nOne of the rising subjects is that distinctive governments take diverse ways to deal with managing VPNs. In nations with solid Internet oversight, a typical technique is a blend of authoritative bans and system level squares. In China, home of the world\u2019s most advanced Internet oversight framework, various VPN sites have been blocked from the net under the appearance of a crackdown on unlicensed telecoms administrations. VPN movement has been upset through profound bundle review and port blocking, as well. Comparable boycott and block-systems are set up in a few Gulf States, including Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia, and in Pakistan. Reports recommend that Russia has been considering such a move.\n\nOn the other hand, elsewhere technical-blocks are being joined with more vindictive measures. The Freedom House reports that Syrian powers \u201chave created fake Skype encryption devices and a fake VPN application, both containing hurtful Trojans.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, another turn on the story was as of late found in Iran, where the state has had a go at entering the VPN industry itself. As indicated by Small Media advocacy group, Iranian powers tested in 2013 with setting up their own \u201cauthority\u201d VPNs. These VPNs were hyped to have connection with government yet worked superbly well to check Facebook or YouTube, inasmuch as clients were not put off by government reconnaissance.\n\n\n\nAt that point obviously we have the entire issue of private regulation as stage level VPN blocking. Video administrations, for example, Netflix, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer\u2014with variable levels of adequacy and eagerness\u2014have all been utilizing outsider business programming for blocking access from IP addresses associated with being utilized by the VPNs.\n\nWhat does this mean for the eventual fate of privacy software like VPNs? \n\nThe signs are blended. Tech liberationists are most likely right to demand that the circulated way of cryptography and encryption imply that tech groups will more often than not discover a path around top-down regulation. What\u2019s more, administration suppliers have numerous alternatives in the progressing session of whack-a-mole, for example, exchanging locales, changing server runs, and imagining new workarounds.\n\nIn the meantime, we ought to be mindful so as not to accept that VPNs, voice scramblers, email encryption, or whatever other innovation items are totally past the limits of regulation at the purpose of utilization and in addition generation. Security organizations are a long way from weak in this diversion, particularly when the fundamental point is to dishearten uptake no matter how you look at it as opposed to stamp out use among techies.\n\nAt the end of the day, the country state still has a couple traps up its sleeve. The stakes of this verbal confrontation will just increment in the coming years as anonymization and security innovations enter further into the standard of tech society.\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the FBI decided to request the judgment of the court to obtain an order requiring Apple to unlock the device.\n\nThe law enforcement agencies invoked the \u201cthe authority of the All Writs Act of 1789,\u201d an old law that states US authorities could bypass the iPhone\u2019s security measures.\n\nOrenstein rejected the request and argued that the government can not misuse the All Writs Act to force private companies to help access data stored in a locked device.\n\n\u201cAs set forth below, I conclude that in the circumstances of this case, the government\u2019s application does not fully satisfy the statute\u2019s threshold requirements: although the government easily satisfies the statute\u2019s first two elements, the extraordinary relief it seeks cannot be considered \u201cagreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d In arguing to the contrary, the government posits a reading of the latter phrase so expansive \u2013 and in particular, in such tension with the doctrine of separation of powers \u2013 as to cast doubt on the AWA\u2019s constitutionality if adopted.\u201d wrote Orenstein.\n\n\u201cMoreover, I further conclude that even if the statute does apply, all three discretionary factors weigh against issuance of the requested writ, and that the Application should therefore be denied as a matter of discretion even if it is available as a matter of law\u201d\n\nThe All Writs Act isn\u2019t the unique law invoked in this case, another important law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) forbids any interference by government.\n\nWaiting for a final rule for the San Bernardino, Apple is going on in its personal fight in defense of the users\u2019 privacy.

At the last days of 2015, an agreement was found with the European Parliament and the Council, following final negotiations between the three institutions. This reform consists of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that governs the use and privacy of EU citizens\u2019 data, and the Data Protection Directive, that governs the use of EU citizens\u2019 data by law enforcement.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as one of the instruments of this reform has finally been agreed after three years of discussion at many levels. It will replace the current Directive and will be directly applicable in all Member States without the need for implementing national legislation. According to European Commission:\n\n\u201cThe General Data Protection Regulation will enable people to better control their personal data. At the same time modernised and unified rules will allow businesses to make the most of the opportunities of the Digital Single Market by cutting red tape and benefiting from reinforced consumer trust.\u201d\n\nThe new rules will come into force most likely in the first half of 2018. During the two-year transition phase, the Commission will inform citizens about their rights and companies about their obligations.\n\nTherefore, companies have the opportunity to comply with the new legislation in two years transition time. It is suggested to take on the GDPR readiness initiative before the deadline approaches.\n\n\n\nGDPR has considered a hefty fine for some infringements of up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover. The financial impact of the GDPR enforcement on businesses makes it clear why data protection issues must be considered more deeply in executive level of organizations unless this issue has been addressed earlier and there is an allocated budget for compliance with GDPR, buy-in from top management, and a designated roadmap, processes, and people that ensure the organization will meet the regulation in two-year\u2019s time frame.\n\nThere are two building blocks for compliance with GDPR. Firstly, a map of data flow that visualize where data comes entered the organization and where it leaves the corporate perimeter. An independent privacy analyst, Chiara Rustici emphasizes that mapping data flow is not just mapping data storage, but data in transit, too.\n\n\u201cGDPR meaning of \u201cdata processing\u201d also includes retrieving, consulting, organizing, structuring, aligning, combining, disseminating, disclosing by transmission or soft-deleting data as well as collecting, storing and destroying it,\u201d She said.\n\nSecondly, organization-wide awareness of data protection principles is an important necessity that can happen with the help of the HR or T&D department. It might require a year of campaigning to get everyone realize their role as \u201cdata processors\u201d and \u201cdata controllers\u201d. In addition, it takes considerable time to embed new data architecture into business and get everyone familiarized with it.\n\nWhile two years seem a long time away, but organizations should move towards the compliance and start implementing required changes without undue delay.\n\nLet\u2019s close with the timeline of the EU Data Protection Regulation\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAli Taherian (@ali_taherian) is an enthusiastic information security Officer.

A new filing in Farrell\u2019s case states that a \u201cuniversity-based research institute\u201d supported the investigation and helped the feds to de-anonymize Farrell.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Homeland Security search warrant, between January 2014 and July 2014 a \u201csource of information\u201d provided law enforcement \u201cwith particular IP addresses\u201d that had accessed the vendor side of Silk Road 2.\n\nThe Farrell\u2019s advocates filed a motion asking the prosecution to provide further information on the involvement of the Carnegie Mellon researchers in the investigation and the hacking technique used to de-anonymize suspects.\n\nThe response of a federal judge was negative, the magistrate denied the motion this week explaining that authorities had not violated the Fourth Amendment rights identifying the suspects via their IP addresses.\n\n\u201cSEI\u2019s identification of the defendant\u2019s IP address because of his use of the Tor network did not constitute a search subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny. \u201c\n\nThe judge confirmed that the identity of the suspects was identified by exploiting security vulnerabilities in the Tor network.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon University always denied having received money for their research.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (Tor Network, Tor hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/carnegie-mellon", "topic_name": "Carnegie Mellon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-market", "topic_name": "Dark market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deepweb", "topic_name": "DeepWeb"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dod", "topic_name": "DoD"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/silk-road-2-0", "topic_name": "Silk Road 2.0"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Use of acid and lasers to access data stored on iPhones", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44761/hacking/acid-lasers-hack-iphones.html", "title": "Use of acid and lasers to access data stored on iPhones\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 24, 2016", "body": "Over the last days, there is a huge discussion between Apple and FBI in relation to the access to San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone. FBI demand to hack the phone so the agency obtains full access to the Farook\u2019s iPhone data with Apple\u2019s assistance; however Apple rejects the demand backing it up by the idea of protection of the privacy of all iPhone users. Moreover, Apple publicly announced  its dismiss of the court order since the provision of such access would generate a backdoor into Apple products which in turns would provide unrestricted access to experts and criminals to Apple customer data, thus open opportunity of spying on Apple users in terms of intercepting phone calls, text messages and tracking their location through GPS.\n\nThe current debate has merged into an argument regarding the Apple digital rights and protection of privacy of its clients against the FBI argument concerning Farook\u2019s possible links to terrorist networks as well as future prevention of terrorist plots declaring that security and justice are more significant concerns in comparison to privacy (Ghosh, 2016).\n\nIn accordance with FBI statements the access to the San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook\u2019s iPhone 5c data is only possible through the Apple assistance in terms of creating a backdoor due to the fact that FBI had already tried other methods such as returning the iPhone to its home Wi-Fi network aiming at backing up automatically San Bernardino perpetrator\u2019s data to the iCloud but unsuccessfully because Farook seemed to have disabled the automatic update function. Another FBI\u2019s unsuccessful technique is associated with the attempt to access Farook\u2019s iCloud account through resetting his Apple ID; however the resetting provoked Apple Security Measure which averted the backup of the iPhone data.\n\nBut Edward Snowden, former NSA whistleblower thinks otherwise. According to him FBI is not limited only to this way to access Farook\u2019s iPhone 5c content, but instead, FBI can rely on the use of acid and lasers to access the iPhone data with no need of Apple to hack the iPhone.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, the FBI has other means\u2026 They told the courts they didn\u2019t, but they do. The FBI does not want to do this,\u201d said Snowden\u201c\n\nThe mechanism proposed by Snowden is well-known as \u201echip decapping\u201d (Ghosh, 2016).\n\nProcess of chip decapping \n\nChip decapping is a method during which the main processor chip is physically processed to extract its contents. The first step is the use of acid to get rid of the chip\u2019s encapsulation followed by a laser drill down into the chip with the purpose of displaying the share of the memory which comprises the iPhone\u2019s distinctive ID so-called UDID data.\n\nThe next step involves the placement of tiny probes on the spot where the data is, in order to display gradually the UDID and the algorithm utilized to resolve it. After the extraction of the information, the FBI is enabled to transfer it to a super computer so the missing passcodes can be recovered through trying all probable combinations whereas one unlocks the phone data. Furthermore, due to the fact that the mechanism is implemented outside the iOS the danger that the data will be wiped out or self-destruct is limited. Of course, this method also has weaknesses, and the most significant one is the occurrence of a minor mistake during the implementation of the method can lead to chip destruction which in turns means that all access to the phone\u2019s data will be permanently lost (Goodin, 2016).\n\n\n\nInfrared laser glitching\n\nDuring an interview with an independent researcher conducted by the media (ABC News), the decapping technique was discussed so the interviewee shared his/her opinion that this method will have doubtful success against an iPhone and it\u2019s likely to result in permanent loss of the content.\n\nIn addition, the interviewee suggested that the use of infrared laser glitching would be a better option because the chance to lose the data is slightly reduced. The method is associated with the slight piercing of the chip followed by getting access to UID data through an infrared laser (Goodin, 2016).\n\nFurthermore, this particular method proved to be effective in the past by the hardware hacker Chris Tarnovsky who conducted an attack which led to damage on the microcontroller disabling the lockdown of Xbox 360 game console. To perform his attack, Tarnovsky used an electron microscope, well-known as ion beam workstation which enabled him to examine the chip in terms of nanometer scale. As a result, he had the ability to manipulate and control its individual wires utilizing microscopic needles. Therefore, such methods are technically doable against an iPhone but these methods lack the practicality due to the fact that the degree of destroying forever the hardware is significantly high and the use of these mechanisms is immensely high (Goodin, 2016).\n\nThe federal magistrate judge has ordered Apple to produce software which will be able to work against all older iPhones which lack modifications. This new software will provide the possibility of updating even when an iPhone has used \u201csecure enclave\u201d protections, in other words the software will have functions to bypass secure enclave protections. The only thing that Apple is required to do is to change the digital signature on very little cost thus the software will be able to run on different devices (Goodin, 2016).\n\nReferences\n\nGhosh, A.

One of those methods would have involved connecting the iPhone to a known Wi-Fi network and triggering an iCloud backup that might provide the FBI with information stored to  the device between the October 19th and the date of the incident.\u201d states Buzzfeed.\n\n\u201cApple sent trusted engineers to try that method, the executives said, but they were unable to do it. It was then that they discovered that the Apple ID password associated with the iPhone had been changed. (The FBI claimed earlier Friday that this was done by someone at the San Bernardino Health Department.)\u201d\n\nJust after the dramatic event, an unnamed San Bernardino police official has executed a procedure to reset the Apple ID Passcode associated with Farook\u2019s iPhone.\n\nBy default, resetting the Apple ID passcode creates a new device ID linked to the iCloud account that will not automatically sync device data online. The synchronization must be manually configured by the user after he generated the new Apple ID password.\n\nIn the case of the terrorist\u2019s iPhone the change of the settings was not possible because already locked and feds were not able to force the sync with Cloud even if they take the device to the known Wi-Fi range.\n\nNow the unique possibility to access the iPhone data consists in pushing an iOS software update that forces the auto-backup of the iPhone to a third party server.\n\nThe executives explained that creating a backdoor access to Apple iOS devices represents a serious risk for the privacy of millions of users. It could be used to virtually target any Apple device and open the door to massive surveillance.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Apple, iPhone)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iphone", "topic_name": "iPhone"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/project", "topic_name": "Project"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-2", "topic_name": "security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "US Judge requests Apple to unlock San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/44544/laws-and-regulations/unlock-san-bernardino-shooter-iphone.html", "title": "US Judge requests Apple to unlock San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 17, 2016", "body": "We discussed very often of the difficulties of the law enforcement in conducting investigations when suspects used devices that make use of encryption, the case that we are going to analyze is emblematic.\n\nApple must assist the FBI in unlocking the passcode-protected encrypted iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters in California.\n\nThe smartphone belonged to Syed Farook, who with his wife Tashfeen Malik  killed 14 coworkers on December 2, 2015.

The company admitted the presence of the \u201cunauthorized code\u201d that could allow an attacker to decrypt VPN traffic.\n\nThe presence of the unauthorized code could date back to 2008, the experts referred a 2008 notice issued by Juniper\u2019s about a security issued that impacts ScreenOS 6.2.0r15 through 6.2.0r18 and 6.3.0r12 through 6.3.0r20.

The US law enforcement agency seized the TorMail database during in concomitants of the seizure of Freedom Hosting, the most popular Tor hidden service operator company. Early 2014, Wired reported that the database was seized due to a completely unrelated investigation aiming to identify cyber criminal organization operating principal black markets in the Tor network.\n\nThe IT security industry speculated Feds had used a hacking tool, the network investigative technique (NIT), to de-anonymize users on the Tor network. The use of the NIT was also confirmed earlier this year when according to court documents reviewed by Motherboard, the FBI had used it to identify the suspects while surfing on the Tor network.\n\nIn July, at least two individuals from New York have been charged with online child pornography crimes after visiting a hidden service on the Tor network.\n\nAccording to the court documents, the FBI monitored a bulletin board hidden service launched in August 2014, named Playpen, mainly used for \u201cthe advertisement and distribution of child pornography.\u201d The law enforcement discovered nearly 1300 IP addresses belonging to the visitors.\n\nNow a report published by the Washington Post confirms that in the summer of 2013 Feds hacked the TorMail service by injecting the NIT code in the mail page in the attempt to track its users. Obviously the US Government would not confirm the circumstance, but it seems that only a limited number of accounts belonging to suspects were hackers. This version doesn\u2019t convict many security experts and privacy advocates that believe the FBI managed a dragnet surveillance against TorMail users.\n\nThe attack against Freedom Hosting took advantage of a Firefox Zero-day to identify some users of the Tor anonymity network. The FBI had control of the Freedom Hosting company to investigate on child pornography activities, Freedom Hosting was considered by US law enforcement the largest child porn facilitator on the planet.\n\n\u201cFBI for its analysis exploited a Firefox Zero-day for Firefox 17 version that allowed it to track Tor users, it exploited a flaw in the Tor browser to implant a tracking cookie which fingerprinted suspects through a specific external server. \n\nThe exploit was based on a Javascript that is a tiny Windows executable hidden in a variable dubbed \u201cMagneto\u201d. Magneto code looks up the victim\u2019s Windows hostname and MAC address and sends the information back to the FBI Virginia server exposing the victims\u2019s real IP address. The script sends back the data with a standard HTTP web request outside the Tor Network.\n\nTorMail was one of the web services hosted by Freedom Hosting, so it was subject to investigation by FBI too.\n\n\u201cThis week, people familiar with the investigation confirmed that the FBI had used an NIT on TorMail. But, they said, the bureau obtained a warrant that listed specific email accounts within TorMail for which there was probable cause to think that the true user was engaged in illicit child-pornography activities. In that way, the sources said, only suspects whose accounts had in some way been linked to involvement in child porn would have their computers infected.\u201d states the Washington Post report.\n\n\u201cAn FBI official who spoke under a similar condition on anonymity said the bureau recognizes that the use of an NIT is \u201cintrusive\u201d and should only be deployed \u201cin the most serious cases.\u201d He said the FBI uses the tool only against offenders who are \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d\n\n\n\n \n\nI can report my experience with the TorMail service that I used for research purpose, when I was trying or access the TorMail service it was returning an error page.

President Obama already anticipated the use of economic sanctions as a deterrent against cyber attacks in the Sony Pictures case. in January 2015, Obama announced economic sanctions against North Korea in the wake of the hacks against Sony Pictures.\n\nThe regulation posted to the Federal Register will be integrated with a further set of regulations that will likely cover \u201cadditional interpretive and definitional guidance, including regarding \u2018cyber-enabled\u2019 activities, and additional general licenses and statements of licensing policy,\u201d said the notice.\n\nIt it important to highlight that there isn\u2019t a public comment period, which is usually required before the issuance of a final rule, a circumstance that demonstrates the approach and intention of the US Government.\n\nThe members of the US Government were urging an action against the increasing cyber threats that hit the national systems,\n\nIn November, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee John McCain (R-Ariz.) sent letters to several representatives of the Obama\u2019s administration urging the adoption of economic sanctions against the Chinese government.\n\nMcCain said \u201cmost would agree\u201d that sanctions are a \u201cmore powerful tool than the symbolic steps this administration has taken to date,\u201d to deter cyber espionage and hacking campaigns.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Executive Order 13694, Information Warfare)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/economic-sanctions", "topic_name": "economic sanctions"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/executive-order-13694", "topic_name": "Executive Order 13694"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/information-warfare", "topic_name": "Information Warfare"}]}, {"news_name": "DHS: Drug Traffickers are hacking surveillance drones on the border", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/43168/laws-and-regulations/surveillance-drones-hacking.html", "title": "DHS: Drug Traffickers are hacking surveillance drones on the border\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 30, 2015", "body": "Small drones are another powerful tool used by the US Department of Homeland Security to monitor its borders, but drug traffickers already adopting countermeasures.

And what they are putting money into is spoofing and jamming of GPSs, so we are doing funding to look at small UAS that we can counter this,\u201d Bennett said during a panel at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.\n\n\n\nThe principle behind the GPS spoofing attack is that sending to control system of the drone fake geographic coordinates it is possible to deceive the onboard system hijacking the vehicle in a different place for which it is commanded. Non-military GPS signals are not encrypted, this makes drones vulnerable to this kind of attacks.\n\nUsing jamming techniques against drones, it is possible to interrupt the GPS receiving transmitted to the UAVs. In this scenario the aircraft could potentially lose the capability to monitor its route and to calculate its location, altitude, and the direction in which it is traveling.\n\nBoth attack techniques are adopted by drug traffickers that belong to well-funded organizations that has access to modern advanced hacking technology.\n\nDHS hasn\u2019t provided further details on the attacks, but Bennett confirmed that the attacks are interfering with the operations conduced by members of the law enforcement.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re out there looking, trying to find out this path [they\u2019re] going through with drugs, and we can\u2019t get good coordinate systems on it because we\u2019re getting spoofed.

The law enforcement is difficult to track suspects and terrorists who use public wi-fi networks.\n\nThe most controversial part of the piece of legislation is related to the ban of the Tor network, the legislation could be presented as early as January 2016.\n\nIt Tor the evil\u2019s instrument?\n\nThe Tor is the most popular anonymizing network, it is currently maintained by volunteers. The anonymity of its users is ensured by routing the user\u2019s traffic through unpredictable routes within the network of servers it includes, obfuscating the sources of data and masquerading the IP address.\n\nTor network is accused to be the kingdom of the evil, it hosts darkmarket places where it is possible to acquire any king of illegal product and service, including drugs, child pornography, weapons, and malware.\n\nBut we cannot ignore the importance of Tor, it allows journalists, whistleblowers and people who just want to protect their privacy online to avoid the censorship.\n\nThe Tor Project, the team that actually maintains the Tor network, did not immediately commented the news.\n\nThe Chinese authorities actively blocks connections to the Tor network preventing users from accessing the anonymizing network.

It this a good solution to prevent terrorist actions?\n\nLet give a look to the Tor usage in the France in 2015 analyzing the number of direct connected users.\n\n\n\nFocusing the analysis in the period before the Paris attacks, it is possible to note an increment of the connection in October.\n\n\n\nThere could be a number of causes responsible for the increment, including a botnet that used the Tor network to hide its C&C infrastructure. Anyway, in the days just before and after the attacks, there was nothing of strange.\n\nIt\u2019s my personal opinion that ban the Tor network is a bad choice, there several options to stay online anonymously, recently we have discussed also the use of applications that could allow terrorists to exchange message hiding their identities.\n\nRegarding the public WiFi, it could be a reasonable measure, but it is quite easy to find a poorly protected WiFi network to abuse. I made an experiment walking in my city, Napoli. I noticed an impressive amount of WiFi network apparently protected, but that use the default setting for their routers.

The principal problem related to the use of the automatic number plate recognition systems is the absence of a legal framework that regulate its usage.\n\n\n\nDuring a speech at Stirling University, the UK\u2019s surveillance camera commissioner Tony Porter raised the issue related to usage of the automatic number plate recognition systems in the UK.\n\nIn the UK there are currently 8,300 ANPR cameras that every day collect the data related to 25-35 million \u2018read.\u2019 These records are sent to the National ANPR Data Centre, but there isn\u2019t any legal framework governing this process, that clearly represent a mass data collection.\n\n\u201cANPR in the UK must surely be one of the largest data gatherers of its citizens in the world,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI would like to put forward that the use of ANPR cameras has an extremely unsteady legal framework,\u201d\n\nThe UK Government considers the automatic number plate recognition systems just one of the data source available to the law enforcement and, for this reason, they don\u2019t need to be regulated.\n\nI sincerely don\u2019t this so, the ANPR systems of the country belong to one of the powerful \u201cnon-military\u201d surveillance network and need to be clearly regulated. Aspect related to data management, data access and their protection have to be shared with the UK citizens.\n\n\u201cI am not 100 percent clear on this and when I\u2019ve spoken to the Home Office they\u2019ve informed me that ANPR is just another tool in the policing toolkit and does not require a statutory authority,\u201d added Porter.\n\n\u201cSo, as long as National ANPR Standards and Procedures offers sufficient safeguards to protect against the article 8 right against intrusion into privacy any legal challenge is set to fail. Or is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who gave their consent to this? Where is the legislation, and where was the debate in parliament? So I argue that some forms of surveillance have no legislative framework whatsoever,\u201d he added.\n\nTo support Porter it arrives the statements of Daniel Nesbitt, research director of Big Brother Watch, who argues the need to open a debate on the usage of number plate recognition systems.\n\n\u201cAlthough ANPR was first installed to tackle specific issues with 350 images now being captured every second it is impossible for motorists to travel without having their details captured and stored, regardless of whether or not they are doing anything wrong,\u201d explained Daniel Nesbitt.\n\n\u201cAn open and honest debate about how this technology is being used as well as how far it invades the privacy of ordinary motorists is now long overdue. For starters we need to see regular reports being published on how the system is being run and exactly what safeguards can be put in place to protect the public.\u201d\n\nWhen dealing with surveillance systems, especially civil ones, I\u2019m always worried about the effective level of security they implement. A persistent attacker could breach them accessing an impressive amount of data that could be used to harm the Homeland security. I believe that also the security of these systems must be regulated in a legal framework to protect citizens.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 ANPR systems , Surveillance)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "RCMP Cybercrime Strategy to fight online crimes", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42530/cyber-crime/rcmp-cybercrime-strategy.html", "title": "RCMP Cybercrime Strategy to fight online crimes\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 5, 2015", "body": "Canadian Authorities consider online crimes serious threats to the Homeland security.

The data breach suffered by the JPMorgan Chase is considered the largest ever hacking case in financial history.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the cyber thieves have stolen details of \u201cover 100 Million customers,\u201d meanwhile the spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase Patricia Wexler confirmed the number of affected customers was around 80 Million. The US Court of the Southern District of New York has charged three men, Gery Shalon, Ziv Orenstein, and Joshua Samuel Aaron, accusing them of hacking into a number of financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase.\n\nThe Victim #12 is the G2 Web Services LLC based on many sources such as KrebsonSecurity and has the expertise in helping banks and financial institutions detect websites that are fraudulent or sell contraband.\n\n\u201cOne of them, identified in the indictments only as \u201cVictim #12,\u201d is an entity that helps banks block transactions for dodgy goods advertised in spam. Turns out, the hackers targeted this company so that they could more easily push through payments for spam-advertised prescription drugs and fake antivirus schemes.\u201d reported Brian Krebs.\n\nMost probably, these hackers targeted the aforementioned victim to prevent blocking of the payments for the illegal transactions for fake anti-virus or pharmaceutical products. The gang that hacked also the JPMorgan has managed to monitor the detection processes of the victim and read staff emails that eventually enabled them arrange their steps to evade detection.\n\n\u201cProsecutors say the ringleader of the cybercrime gang accused of breaking into JPMC,Scottrade, E-Trade and others is 31-year-old Gery Shalon, a resident of Tel Aviv and Moscow. Investigators allege Shalon and his co-conspirators monitored credit card transactions processed through their payment processing business to attempt to discern which, if any, were undercover transactions made on behalf of credit card companies attempting to identify unlawful merchants. The government also charges that beginning in or about 2012, Shalon and his co-conspirators hacked into the computer networks of Victim-12 (G2 Web Services).\u201d continues Krebs.\n\nIn short, the hackers have blacklisted list of credit and debit cards belonging to employees of the Victim #12 used for detection of unlawful merchants and rejects all the transactions from the blacklist and as a consequence evade the detection.\n\n\u201cIn particular, through their unlawful intrusion into Victim-12\u2019s network, Shalon and his co-conspirators determined which credit and debit card numbers Victim-12 employees were using the make undercover purchases of illicit goods in the course of their effort to detect unlawful merchants,\u201d reports the Shalon\u2019s indictment. \u201cUpon identifying those credit and debit card numbers, Shalon and his co-conspirators blacklisted the numbers from their payment processing business, automatically declining any transaction for which payment was offered through one of those credit or debit card numbers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe moral of this story is the depth of organized cybercrimes and how cybercriminals are trying to keep their activities and business model in a covert manner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cat-and-mouse game. They go from one business into another.\u201d said Alan Krumholz, principal data scientist at G2. \n\nIn conclusion, the above news helps us understand that all the companies co-operating are chained and lack of attention to security practices and standards of one of the parties may influence others even more traumatically.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAli Taherian (@ali_taherian) is an enthusiastic information security Officer.

The FBI has paid at least $1 million track Tor users and to reveal their IP addresses as part of a large criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cApparently these researchers were paid by the FBI to attack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift through their data to find people whom they could accuse of crimes. We publicized the attack last year, along with the steps we took to slow down or stop such an attack in the future:\nhttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack/\n\nHere is the link to their (since withdrawn) submission to the Black Hat conference:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140705114447/http://blackhat.com/us-14/briefings.html#you-dont-have-to-be-the-nsa-to-break-tor-deanonymizing-users-on-a-budget\nalong with Ed Felten\u2019s analysis at the time:\nhttps://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/why-were-cert-researchers-attacking-tor/\n\nWe have been told that the payment to CMU was at least $1 million.\u201d reads a blog post published by the Tor Project.\n\nIn 2014, researchers  from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s computer emergency response team (Cert), Alexander Volynkin and Michael McCord, announced that they were able to de-anonymise Tor users and planned to reveal their discovery during the next Black Hat Conference in August.\n\nA few weeks later the organization of the BlackHat had been contacted by the university\u2019s lawyers which informed it that the researchers will not participate in the event.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Mr Volynkin will not be able to speak at the conference since the materials that he would be speaking about have not yet [been] approved by Carnegie Mellon University/Software Engineering Institute for public release,\u201d states the message posted on the official website of the event.\n\nThe experts at the Tor Project are accusing the FBI of an attack on a large scale, the researchers confirmed that the offensive launched by the experts at the Carnegie Mellow University was not narrowly tailored to target specific individuals charged of criminal activity.\n\nThe attack represented a clear violation of trust and basic guidelines for ethical research.\n\n\u201cWe strongly support independent research on our software and network, but this attack crosses the crucial line between research and endangering innocent users.\u201d continues the post.\n\nNeither the FBI not Carnegie Mellon representatives commented the accusation, Ed Desautels, a spokesman for Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Software Engineering Institute only told Wired that he was not aware of any research activity commissioned to his institute.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the substantiation for their claim,\u201d said Ed Desautels. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any payment.\u201d\n\nThe evidence of the collaborations between the FBI and the Carnegie Mellon University has emerged also in a stand trial in federal court in Seattle later this month. The court was discussing the case of Brian Farrell, an alleged Silk Road 2 lieutenant, the law enforcement discovered the IP addresses belong to the suspect. A new filing in Farrell\u2019s case states that a \u201cuniversity-based research institute\u201d supported the investigation and helped the feds to de-anonymize Farrell.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Homeland Security search warrant, between January 2014 and July 2014 a \u201csource of information\u201d provided law enforcement \u201cwith particular IP addresses\u201d that had accessed the vendor side of Silk Road 2.\n\nIn July, the researchers at the Tor Project discovered a sustained attack against the Tor Network based on the technique described by the team of Carnegie Mellon University researchers.\n\n \n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s unlikely they could have gotten a valid warrant for CMU\u2019s attack as conducted, since it was not narrowly tailored to target criminals or criminal activity, but instead appears to have indiscriminately targeted many users at once. Such action is a violation of our trust and basic guidelines for ethical research. We strongly support independent research on our software and network, but this attack crosses the crucial line between research and endangering innocent users. This attack also sets a troubling precedent: Civil liberties are under attack if law enforcement believes it can circumvent the rules of evidence by outsourcing police work to universities. If academia uses \u201cresearch\u201d as a stalking horse for privacy invasion, the entire enterprise of security research will fall into disrepute. Legitimate privacy researchers study many online systems, including social networks \u2014 If this kind of FBI attack by university proxy is accepted, no one will have meaningful 4th Amendment protections online and everyone is at risk.\u201dcontinues the post.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSecurity Affairs \u2013  (Tor Network, hacking)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/carnegie-mellon", "topic_name": "Carnegie Mellon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/dark-market", "topic_name": "Dark market"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/deepweb", "topic_name": "DeepWeb"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/silk-road-2-0", "topic_name": "Silk Road 2.0"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/zero-day", "topic_name": "zero-Day"}]}, {"news_name": "Drone regulation \u2013 Keeping the skies safe from commercial drones", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41905/laws-and-regulations/faa-regulation-drones.html", "title": "Drone regulation \u2013 Keeping the skies safe from commercial drones\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 11, 2015", "body": "Q1 First of all, the Federal Aviation Administration gave a very compressed timeline. They\u2019re asking a expert panel task force to make registration guideline recommendations by November 20 and these recommendations implemented by mid-December, so that 1 million done sold during this year\u2019s holiday season would all be registered. Do you think it\u2019s feasible? And if achieved, do you feel like it\u2019s done in too much of a hurry?\n\nIt is a great challenge for the US administrations, I think it is difficult to meet deadlines, but the most important thing is the message that the government wants to launch. Any abuse of unmanned vehicles could represent a serious threat to the privacy and the security of citizens. \n\n \n\nQ2 These new regulations set new records: there is no precedent for the federal government requiring the registration of consumer electronics; even guns and cars are done at a state level. Some drone hobbyists argue the vast majority of drones are used responsibly and that the few clowns who make the news aren\u2019t representative of the whole. Do you feel like these guidelines are necessary?\n\nI understand the position of hobbyists, but we have to consider a number of threat actors (cyber criminals, state-sponsored hackers, hacktivists) could use them. The law enforcement and Intelligence agencies fear that the drones could be intentionally and unintentionally used for illegal activities or cause problems to the collectivity (interference with operations conducted by the law enforcement, public services and so on).\n\n \n\nQ3 Let\u2019s talk about some details. In your opinion, if implemented, when within the timeline for assemblage to sale should the drones be registered? And how about those Do-It-Yourself drones or 3-D printed drones\u2014both of which are rapidly growing in numbers, should they be registered too?\n\nDo-It-Yourself drones represent a serious problem for law enforcement. It is easy today find online blueprints to manufacture your own drone, well, in this case, these vehicles are out of law. Authorities cannot control them. It is likely that authorities will recognize some best practices and specific path to follow to allow hobbyists to manufacture their DIY drone. \n\n \n\nQ4 Some believe these new policies may be the best-case scenario for consumers and manufacturers. Without the current regulations, the drone industry may receive a far more stringent treatment in Congress. How is the business community responding to these changes?\n\nFor sure, the policies will have an impact on the business community. Users are empowered to use these tools, they have the legal responsibility for any abuse of the system drone. Surely many hobbyists could be deterred with inevitable repercussions on retail sales.\n\n\n\nQ5 In your opinion, will this registration process be enough to deal with current risks? Researchers in Singapore have demonstrated how attackers using a drone plus a mobile phone could easily intercept documents sent to a seemingly inaccessible Wi-Fi printer. What are some other unknown security risks drones bringing?\n\nAbsolutely no. threat actors will continue to drones for sabotage, espionage and so on. You mentioned 3D printed drones, it could be very easy to manufacture a drone and use it to spy on targets, for surveillance activities, for reconnaissance in a terrorist attack. \n\nDrones could be equipped with chemical weapons, sensors to spy on targets, hacking tools that could allow breaching the Wireless Lan of an organization by simply landing the drone on the roof of a building. The concept of physical security is changing and has to take in count the threat represented by the drones.\n\nYou have also to consider that drone, especially commercial ones could be easily hacked. They could be hacked, infected by malware or jammed causing incidents and data leakage.\n\n\n\nQ6 Do you feel like some negative examples soured the public on the UAV sector and encourage legislators to pass reactionary laws and policies that might inhibit drone innovation?\n\nI don\u2019t think legislators are interested hamper the drone innovation. Their use will continue to increase in civil and military environment. I have no doubt. First of all we have to keep in mind that we have protect humans from the abuses of such class of vehicles. It is important to regulate the use of these vehicles for the reason we have explained. \n\n \n\nQ7 On a global level, countries are dealing with similar situations. China has established some no-fly zones, and in Japan, the government and the ruling coalition are moving quickly to regulate drones following the discovery of a small remote-controlled aerial vehicle on the roof of the prime minister\u2019s office in late April.  How can the world learn from the FAA\u2019s recent move, and come up with a universal solution to the current problem?\n\nI think that all the major organizations and governments will converge to a single legal framework that will address legislative, security and privacy issues related to the use of drones.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 drone regulations, US Government)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/drones", "topic_name": "Drones"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/faa", "topic_name": "FAA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hijacking", "topic_name": "Hijacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/jamming", "topic_name": "jamming"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/regulation", "topic_name": "regulation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/uav", "topic_name": "UAV"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Three men charged for the attack on the JPMorgan Chase", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/41884/cyber-crime/3-men-arrested-jpmorgan-chase.html", "title": "Three men charged for the attack on the JPMorgan Chase\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 10, 2015", "body": "The US authorities have charged three individuals over the hack of the JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions.

EFF will continue to fight against the bill by urging the conference committee to incorporate pro-privacy language.\u201d\n\nCISA requests sharing of \u201ccyber threat indicators,\u201d but doesn\u2019t address privacy issues.\n\nThe Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore) is one of the opponents of the CISA bill that he considers \u201cflawed\u201d and just \u201cfeel-good legislation.\u201dHe warned about the abuses that could result from the application of the CISA.\n\n\u201cThe fight to secure Americans\u2019 private, personal data has just begun,\u201d said Wyden. \u201cToday\u2019s vote is simply an early, flawed step in what is sure to be a long debate over how the U.S. can best defend itself against cyber threats.\u201d\n\nPrior to the final vote, the principal IT companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, also expressed their privacy concerns over the CISA and its request to share sensitive customer data to the US Agencies.\n\n \u201cWe don\u2019t support the current CISA proposal.

It is probably one of the most common requests US law enforcement makes to Apple, but it seems that the IT giant is trying to explain that it is technically not possible.\n\nLast case occurred in a court filing on Monday, when, according to Apple, the company provided a negative response to the U.S. Federal magistrate judge. The Justice Department tried to force the company to provide the necessary support to allow investigators extract data from a seized Apple iPhone.\n\nApple confirmed to be able to unlock only iPhone running older iOS versions, nearly 90 percent of iOS devices are running newer versions that make impossible the operation.\n\n\u201cIn most cases now and in the future, the government\u2019s requested order would be substantially burdensome, as it would be impossible to perform. For devices running iOS 8 or higher, [the company] wouldn\u2019t have the technical ability to do what the government requests \u2013 take possession of a password protected device from the government and extract unencrypted user data from that device for the government. Among the security features in iOS 8 is a feature that prevents anyone without the device\u2019s passcode from accessing the device\u2019s encrypted data. This includes Apple.\u201d Apple has said.\n\nNext Friday there will be a hearing regarding this specific case, it will be established is Apple is obligated by law to provide the required support to access the data on the locked iPhone on a search warrant.\n\nLast year, the security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski published a blog post showing how data on Apple devices could be accessed by the Government.\n\nThe Zdziarski conducted different studies on the architecture of iOS discovering that different services are unnecessary for users and could be used to bypass security defenses.  The expert has designed many of the initial methods for acquiring forensic data from Apple iOS mobile devices.\n\nOnce year ago Zdziarski presented his discoveries in a speech at the HOPE X conference, the scientist highlighted the presence of the mobile file_relay (com.apple.mobile.file_relay) services on iOS that can be accessed remotely or via USB to bypass the backup encryption, exploiting the feature an attacker can access all of the data encrypted via the data protection if the device has not been rebooted since the last time the user entered the PIN.\n\n\n\nThe file_relay tool can be used to steal user\u2019s information from iOS device, including email, location, social media accounts, the address book and the user cache folder, all the necessary to conduct an investigation.\n\n\u201cBetween this tool and other services, you can get almost the same information you could get from a complete backup,\u201d \u201cWhat concerns me the most is that this all bypasses the consumer backup encryption. When you click that button to encrypt the backup, Apple has made a promise that the data that comes off the device will be encrypted.\u201d Zdziarski said in an interview. \n\nZdziarski explained that different hidden services running on the iPhone bypass the encrypted backup protection and don\u2019t require the use of developer mode, he also confirmed the presence on the mobile iOS of a packet capture tool which could be used to dump all of the inbound and outbound HTTP data and runs in stealthy mode.\n\nThe fact that some versions of Apple iOS included such functionalities is not surprising, in one of the document leaked by Edward Snowden it is described  DROPOUTJEEP as a spyware developed by ANT (Advanced or Access Network Technology) division of the NSA that is used to gain backdoor access to the mobile.\n\nZdziarski has always high\u00f2ighted that his study hasn\u2019t the purpose to demonstrate that the above features were designed for surveillance purposes, but he believes that Intelligence agencies are exploiting them.\n\nApple has always denied any support to the US surveillance program, as explained by the CEO Tim Cook, the company respect and protect the privacy of its users\n\n\u201cWe have never worked with any government agency from any country to create a backdoor in any of our products or services.

Without confidentiality and privacy, the system of law can break down from the lack of trust. Thus, the institution of law protects the privacy of the client relationship in order to promote the integrity and legitimacy of the legal system, which in turn, bolsters the good order and efficiency of other societal institutions.\n\nHow does this privacy apply to cybersecurity? Cybersecurity services between vendor and customer, especially the transfer of data, can be protected much like the delivery of other legal services underneath unique legal system privileges.  There is also the added dimension of cyberlaw risk advisory, to correlate technical details with meaningful exposure and compliance analysis. \n\nThe US market is especially sensitive to litigation exposure. This risk would apply to any organization with data exposure in the US.  As we have seen with recent cases in US courts, this exposure risk extends through a company\u2019s supply chain irrespective of a company\u2019s direct data exposure in the US market.\n\nIn light of the cyberlaw advantage, why would a customer of cybersecurity services, especially after suffering a cyberattack, leave open to litigation or regulatory risks all its errors and omissions when there are structural protections available from cyberlaw counsel?\n\n\n\nMore and more, Security Affairs is seeing interdisciplinary approaches to cyber defense, including economics, insurance, risk management, and emergency preparedness.  Adding the problem-solving dimensions of cyberlaw is a welcome addition.\n\nA cyberlaw leader, Doug DePeppe of eosedge Legal, offered an analogy: \n\n\u201cUnder the InfoSec \u2018CIA Triad\u2019, the objectives of confidentiality and integrity are protected by privacy-wrapping tools like encryption and network security technologies. With these technologies, we seek to maintain the privacy of data. Think of cyberlaw as another privacy wrapper enabled by an institution rather than a technology.\u201d\n\nThe cyberlaw model is best introduced up-front during incident response planning and risk assessments.  Trusted advisory, a staple of the institution of law, is another benefit.  Additionally, the cyberlaw model is not limited simply to the delivery side of vendor services.  The entire cyber domain ecosystem can benefit, including in the production of cyber intelligence.\n\n\u201cCyberlaw differentiation from the standard practice of law has generated interest from White Hats. For one, they often need legal guidance; but additionally, confidentiality enables trust building, legal landscape navigation, and prudent, law-abiding cyber operations. With so much uncertainty surrounding cyber intelligence, we have found that the institution of law is a trust-enabling institution that aids information sharing.\u201d  said Doug DePeppe.\n\nSecurity Affairs continues to monitor and bring news about emerging interdisciplinary approaches to cybersecurity.  A structural and privacy-enhancing dimension from cyberlaw seems to add an important Best Practice perspective to reduce cyber risk exposure.  \n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyberlaw, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-vendor-services", "topic_name": "CYBER VENDOR SERVICES"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberlaw", "topic_name": "CYBERLAW"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/eosedge", "topic_name": "eosedge"}]}, {"news_name": "National Encryption Policy draft, everyone is under strict surveillance", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40388/laws-and-regulations/indian-national-encryption-policy.html", "title": "National Encryption Policy draft, everyone is under strict surveillance\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 23, 2015", "body": "A new problem is worrying the Indian friends, the Government plans to release a new policy, National Encryption Policy\u2019 that seems to presage disappointments for users.\n\nAmong ugly and questionable issues of the policy,  there is the will to criminalize cancellation of WhatsApp Messages or Emails received or sent before 90 days, and the punishment might be the imprisonment\n\nThe Indian colleagues at THEHACKERNEWS explain that with the aim to \u2018provide confidentiality of information\u2019 and ensure \u2018protection of sensitive or proprietary information,\u2019 the draft policy, proposed by a so-called \u2018expert panel\u2019 from the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY), requires:\n\n\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Information Ravi Shankar Prasad tried to explain that the draft law that aim to regulate cryptography would be rewritten.\n\n\u201cSome of the expressions used in the draft are giving rise to uncalled-for misgivings,\u201d said Prasad. \u201cI have noted some of the concerns.\u201d\n\nThis means that the National Encryption Policy will require those foreign companies who offer services in India to give the government access to the user data.\n\n\u201cEncryption algorithms and key sizes will be prescribed by the Government,\u201d states the Policy.\n\nEveryone can express its opinion about the National Encryption Policy by sending comments to akrishnan@deity.gov.in by October 16, 2015.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 National Encryption Policy, India)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/national-encryption-policy", "topic_name": "National Encryption Policy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/whatsapp", "topic_name": "WhatsApp"}]}, {"news_name": "China spies on airline passengers with IMSI-catchers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40380/cyber-crime/airline-passengers-imsi-catchers.html", "title": "China spies on airline passengers with IMSI-catchers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 23, 2015", "body": "The former owner of McAfee security firm, John McAfee was always known to have made some controversial comments in the IT industry, but also to have good sources that let him get precious information at first hand. This time in his most recent article, he talks about the ability of the Chinese government to spy on four highly renowned airlines costumers.\n\nJohn McAfee has never revealed the names of the airlines and never explained how he got this information, but he provided details on the tactic behind the cyber espionage campaign.\n\n\n\nFirst, he got an Android software that had the capability to detect \u201cman in the middle attacks by devices that emulate legitimate cell phone towers, to hundreds of international travelers flying with four highly renowned airlines\u201d.\n\nThe software tries to detect anomalies in the IMSI-catchers (International Mobile Subscriber Identity), something that manufacturers can\u2019t hide.\n\nThe next question is, but what is an IMSI-catcher? \n\n\u201cIMSI-catchers are devices that emulate cell phone towers. They trick our smartphones into believing a cell tower suddenly appeared in close range and entices our phones to connect through it.\u201d\n\nIf your mobile is caught by any IMSI-catchers, you are in trouble. Once you are connected to the fake cell tower a man-in-the-middle attack is performed, \u201cthe IMSI-catcher analyses our configuration and \u201cpushes\u201d the necessary software into our smartphones in order for some third party related to the IMSI catcher to take control.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in more details on this technology give a look to the post \u201cStingRay Technology: How Government Tracks Cellular Devices\u201d where I provided detailed information on IMSI-catchers and similar devices.\n\nThe use of IMSI-catchers is well-known and documented, but it\u2019s alarming that is being used by airlines controlled by the Chinese government.\n\nThe method used by the airlines to control the passengers is simple as effective as reported by the Internationa Business Times, the airlines use the IMSI-catcher to compromise traveler\u2019s devices when it is attempting to connect to the onboard Internet.\n\n\u201cIn every case where an international traveler with these four airlines attempted to connect to the onboard internet, a module was pushed to the connecting smartphone that surreptitiously turned on the 3G or 4G communications (without displaying the corresponding icon). From that point, an onboard IMSI-catcher attempted to connect to the phone. There was a 100% success rate.\u201d\n\nAfter this step, it will be determined if your mobile have already installed an Android APP called \u201d Silent Logging\u201c, if not the application will be pushed to your device.\n\n\u201cSilent Logging\u201d has the purpose of spying on you and uses the following permissions:\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter Silent Logging is activated, a spyware app is downloaded to the users\u2019 smartphone that utilises the Silent Logging app, unless the phone is \u201cphysically wiped\u201d by the manufacturer, this software remains forever.\u201d\n\nIf you try to do a factory reset by your own be aware that the spyware will detect it and emulate that you are doing a factory reset.\n\nOnce you have this spyware installed your device will available for the government to check on you, reading emails, SMS, recording videos, voice,etc etc, and all is sent to China.\n\nThe alleged espionage activity operated by the Chinese Government through the IMSI-catcher technology is alarming, and should be taken seriously.\n\nAbout the Author Elsio Pinto\n\nEdited by Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 IMSI-catchers, cyber espionage)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "AVG will sell user\u2019s personal data to third-parties", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40281/digital-id/avg-sells-personal-data.html", "title": "AVG will sell user\u2019s personal data to third-parties\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 20, 2015", "body": "Pierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 AVG, privacy)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/avg", "topic_name": "AVG"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/meta-data", "topic_name": "meta data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/personal-data", "topic_name": "personal data"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "Microsoft joint force with NATO to improve EU Cybersecurity", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/40160/cyber-crime/microsoft-nato-joint-cybersecurity.html", "title": "Microsoft joint force with NATO to improve EU Cybersecurity\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 15, 2015", "body": "At NATO\u2019s annual cyber conference early this week, Microsoft announced the signing of an agreement with the NATO Communications and Information Agency that aims to improve cyber security in the EU.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe see this signing as another step forward in the NATO -Industry Cyber Partnership, building a stronger cyber defense network today with Microsoft, but also with other Industry partners across the world\u201d explained the Ambassador Sorin Ducaru, Assistant Secretary General of NATO\u2019s Emerging Security Challenges Division.\n\nThe Government Security Program was promoted by Microsoft to help governments in protecting their assets and maintain a proper security posture to mitigate cyber threats.

Similar to other computing devices, like computers or Smartphones, IoT devices also pose security risks to consumers. The FBI is warning companies and the general public to be aware of IoT vulnerabilities cybercriminals could exploit, and offers some tips on mitigating those cyber threats.\u201d states the announcement.\n\n\n\nThe announcement has raised a heated discussion on the responsibility for the exploitation of such kind of devices, it seems that the FBI attributes the responsibility for the security of these devices on the consumer.\n\n\u201cConsumers should be aware of the capabilities of the devices and appliances installed in their homes and businesses. If a device comes with a default password or an open Wi-Fi connection, consumers should change the password and only allow it operate on a home network with a secured Wi-Fi router\u201d states the announcement.\n\nRecently we have discussed several flaws that could be exploited by attackers to conduct illegal activities. Crooks are able to exploit home routers, fridges and baby monitors to carry on illegal activities, crimes that could impact million of users worldwide. I wrote an interesting analysis, titled \u201cHow Hackers Violate Privacy and Security of the Smart Home\u201d to explain how Internet of Things could be exploited to hack modern smart home.\n\nSmart objects could be hacked in different ways and for different reasons, they could be affected by vulnerabilities such as the \u201cUPnP vulnerabilities\u201d recently discovered, or they could be simply poorly configured (e.g. adoption of unchanged default passwords)\n\nEvery Internet of Things devices is insecure if it is not properly deployed and configured, for this reason the FBI invites end-customers to get smart objects away from the Internet.\n\n\u201cIsolate IoT devices on their own protected networks\u201d states the announcement in the section dedicated to the Consumer Protection and Defense Recommendations.\n\nI personally consider very important the advisory issued by the FBI, but probably is is not so clear when dealing with attribution of responsibility. It is clear that we cannot pretend that every final customer becomes a Tech savvy, so we must improve the security by design making Internet of Things more reliable and resilient to cyber attacks.\n\nLet me close with the recommendations for the customer\u2019s securtiy included in the announcement:\n\nThere is no time to waste, Internet of Things devices are already surrounding us, we must improve their security before hackers exploit them.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Internet of Things, cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "DoJ defines new rules for spying with the Stingray technology", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39904/cyber-crime/doj-stingray-policy.html", "title": "DoJ defines new rules for spying with the Stingray technology\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 6, 2015", "body": "Do you know what is a StingRay? If you want further details give a look to a post I wrote for the Infosec Institute on the StingRay Technology:\n\n\u201cStingRay is an IMSI-catcher (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) designed and commercialized by the Harris Corporation. The cellular-surveillance system costs as much as $400,000 in the basic configuration, and its price varies with add-ons ordered by the agency.\n\nThe IMSI-catcher is a surveillance solution used by military and intelligence agencies for telephone eavesdropping. It allows for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking movements of mobile phone users. Essentially, an IMSI catcher operates as a bogus mobile cell tower that sits between the target mobile phone and the service provider\u2019s real towers. The IMSI catcher runs a Man In the Middle (MITM) attack that could not be detected by the users without using specific products that secure communication on mobile devices.\n\nThe use of the IMSI-catcher is raising a heated debate in the United States because devices like StingRay and other similar cellphone tracking solutions are being widely adopted by law enforcement agencies across the country.\u201d I wrote in a blog post\n\n\n\nThe Stingray devices are used by law enforcement to track criminals, in the majority of cases without obtaining court orders.\n\nBut things are changing, the Federal law agencies will have to be more transparent about the use of Stingray devices for their investigations. The US Department of Justice has issued a new policy this week on the use of Stingray to spy on the cell phone of suspects, track and record their locations, and in some cases even intercept Internet traffic and phone calls or serve a spyware on mobile phones.\n\nThe new policy requires law enforcement and intelligence agencies to obtain a court authorization or warrant to use the StingRay technology in their operations to ensure the respectful of individual\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cThis new policy ensures our protocols for this technology are consistent, well-managed and respectful of individuals\u2019 privacy and civil liberties,\u201d explained the Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates in an official statement.\n\nAnother novelty introduced by the policy is the duty for the Feds to completely destroy the data acquired by the Stingray during the investigations.\n\n\u201cTo enhance privacy protections, the new policy establishes a set of required practices with respect to the treatment of information collected through the use of cell-site simulators.  This includes data handling requirements and an agency-level implementation of an auditing program to ensure that data is deleted consistent with this policy.  For example, when the equipment is used to locate a known cellular device, all data must be deleted as soon as that device is located, and no less than once daily.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the agencies will have to present an annual report on the use of the StingRay Technology.\n\n\u201cWhile the department has, in the past, obtained appropriate legal authorizations to use cell-site simulators, law enforcement agents must now obtain a search warrant supported by probable cause before using a cell-site simulator.  There are limited exceptions in the policy for exigent circumstances or exceptional circumstances where the law does not require a search warrant and circumstances make obtaining a search warrant impracticable. \u201c\n\nThe new policy is a great step forward in the defense of the citizen privacy and transparency as explained by the Staff Attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, Nate Freed Wessler.\n\n\u201cThe new policy is a step forward in the \u201cright direction\u201d as well as \u201ca win for privacy and transparency.\u201d\u201d said Wessler.\n\nWessler highlighted that the policy still has a gray parts when dealing with local and regional authorities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department must close these loopholes, and Congress should act to pass more comprehensive legislation to ensure that Americans\u2019 privacy is protected from these devices and other location tracking technologies.\u201d  states the ACLU.\n\nLocal and regional law enforcement also use Stingray devices to track suspects, but the new policy doesn\u2019t cover their activities. \u201c\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 StingRay, law enforcement)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/doj", "topic_name": "DoJ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stingray", "topic_name": "StingRay"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "US weighs sanctioning China and Russia in response to recent cyber attacks", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/39768/cyber-crime/us-sanctioning-china-russia.html", "title": "US weighs sanctioning China and Russia in response to recent cyber attacks\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 2, 2015", "body": "The US Government is considering sanctions against both Russian and Chinese hackers in response to the hacking campaign targeting US entities.\n\nThe news was reported by several U.S. officials yesterday who spoke on condition of anonymity.

However, this is the first time that US official explicitly refer the Russia.\n\n\u201cDone in tandem with other diplomatic pressure, law enforcement, military, intelligence, then you can actually start to impose costs and indicate that there are costs to the bilateral relationship,\u201d an official told the Washington Post.\n\nThe U.S. government has not yet decided whether to issue these sanctions, but it seems a question of time despite the White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to confirm the United States was near to apply the sanctions against Chinese entities.\n\n\u201cIt would be strategically unwise for us to discuss potential sanctions targets because that would only give the potential targets of sanctions the opportunity to take steps that would allow them to evade those sanctions,\u201d he told.\n\n\u201cThe United States, as we all know, has sharp disagreements with China over its actions in cyber space,\u201d State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe have remained deeply concerned about Chinese government-sponsored cyber-enabled theft of confidential business information and proprietary technology from U.S. companies,\u201d he added at his daily briefing.\n\nThe US government suffered several major cyber attacks recently, including the recent hack of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the network at the White House. In August, the New York Times published an article saying that the president of the United States, Barack Obama took the decision to retaliate against China, after the famous hack of the OPM, leaving in the wild over 20 million personal records.\n\nIn April, the President Barack Obama has signed an executive order that uses economic restrictions to \u201ccontrol\u201d anyone that is trying to attack any American interests.\n\nThis means that if the US authorities identify an entity (person or group) that is threatening the US infrastructure and which is responsible for a security breach, then all its assets can be frozen, including bank accounts, if these assets are located in the US soil.\n\n\u201cStarting today, we\u2019re giving notice to those who pose significant threats to our security or economy by damaging our critical infrastructure, disrupting or hijacking our computer networks, or stealing the trade secrets of American companies or the personal information of American citizens for profit,\u201d said the president Obama. \u201cFrom now on, we have the power to freeze their assets, make it harder for them to do business with U.S. companies, and limit their ability to profit from their misdeeds.\u201d\n\nThe executive order explicitly refers the following case regarding possible activities that represent a threat for the Homeland security:\n\nThe executive order is efficient only if the alleged attackers have assets in America, or do business with American companies.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government staunchly upholds cyber security, firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks in accordance with law,\u201d Chinese Embassy spokesman Zhu Haiquan said in an official statement.\n\nAccording to the spokesman the Chinese Government is spending a significant effort to combat cyber attacks against the US systems and it want to establish an effective cooperation to reach the target.\n\nThe Russian Government still hasn\u2019t commented the news.\n\nThe US officials speculate that the recent attacks were coordinated by Chinese state-sponsored APT groups, the sanctions Washington is defining will hit foreign citizens and companies believed responsible for intrusions in commercial enterprises, the officials declined to name any potential target.\n\n\u201cOne U.S. official said that sanctions imposed on individuals or companies would effectively cut them off from using the U.S. financial system, which could be a death-sentence for a serious business venture.

Law enforcement has used tattoos as a means of criminals and victim identification for many years. It is believed that as criminals have more body ink than general, matching the tattoos into a computer system, could help to catch more offenders. It\u2019s not robust enough to be used as a primary biometric like a fingerprint, but it could be quite helpful in cases where that evidence is not available.\n\nHistorically, the keyword labeling approach based on the ANSI-NIST-ITL 1-2011 standard was followed by law enforcement agencies to collect and assign keyword labels to tattoos. This approach has some drawbacks including the limitation of class labels to describe the growing types of new tattoo designs, the need for multiple keywords, and the probability of labeling the same tattoo differently between examiners that has led to a vital need for automated image-based tattoo recognition capabilities.\n\nSince 2012, Government researchers have been working on developing an automated tattoo recognition technology. Meanwhile, Biometric Center of Excellence (BCOE) issued a request for information regarding any current databases containing tattoo/symbol images, their possible meanings, gang affiliations, terrorist groups or other criminal organizations.  Last year, the National Institute of Standards and Technology invited interested commercial and academic community to participate in the Tattoo Recognition Technology \u2013 Challenge (Tatt-C) to advance research and development into automated image-based tattoo recognition technology.\n\n\n\nThe following operational use-cases were the five different topics of research\n\nOn June 8, 2015, the FBI sponsored Tatt \u2013 C workshop was hosted at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD and the results from six participating organizations and their image-recognition software were assessed. All of the participants used the same dataset of thousands of images from government databases provided by the FBI\u2019s Biometric Center of Excellence.\n\n\u201cThe state-of-the-art algorithms performed very well in detecting tattoos, finding different instances of the same tattoo from the same subject over time, and finding a small part of a tattoo within a larger tattoo, however, detecting visually similar tattoos on different people and recognizing a tattoo image from a sketch or sources other than a photo could use further research\u201d, said NIST computer scientist Mei Ngan, who organized the challenge.\n\nTattoo Recognition Technology \u2013 Challenge (Tatt-C) was a great step to use academic and industry efforts in parallel with the government acts.

The interesting part of the news is that law enforcement exploited end-to-end encryption gaps in WhatsApp to intercept WhatsApp messages exchanged between members of a Chechen jihadist group operating in Belgium. The cell tied to the al-Nusra Front in Syria and the Islamic Caucasus Emirate, one of the suspects detained had recently returned to Belgium after being injured in a fight in Syria.\n\nAccording to Gaspard Sebag from Bloomberg, the European law enforcement in a joint effort with the FBI are monitoring the use of the popular messaging platform WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cInvestigators said earlier they had detained 16 people in the anti-terror raids after working with U.S. authorities to monitor suspects\u2019 communications on WhatsApp Inc.\u2019s messaging service.\u201d  states Sebag.\n\nThe Belgian law enforcement raided two separate groups operating in Ostend and Louvain, and according various sources the messages exchanged on WhatsApp allowed the investigators to trace the group.\n\nAt the time I\u2019m writing, Facebook who acquired WhatsApp, declined to comment the events, but security experts speculate that there is something wrong in the implementation of WhatsApp end-to-end (E2E) encryption started in November.\n\nThe new feature was added after the incorporation of the encryption protocol TextSecure designed by the popular security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and developed by the WhisperSystems.\n\nTextSecure is a free Android mobile app developed by Open WhisperSystems, its code is open-source and it implements end-to-end encryption to protect text messages sent by the users. The TextSecure app was downloaded by nearly 500,000 users from the official Google\u2019s Play Store.\n\nTextSecure is considered one of most efficient text messaging application for mobile devices and its popularity increased after the Facebook bought WhatsApp, due to the fear of users that Intelligence agencies could have imposed to the company to give them the access to the servers.\n\nIn November 2014, a group of researchers from Ruhr University Bochum that audited the popular TextSecure Private Messenger app discovered that it was vulnerable to Unknown Key-Share attacks.\n\n\u201cSince Facebook bought WhatsApp, instant messaging apps with security guarantees became more and more popular,\u201d \u201cWe are the first to completely and precisely document and analyze TEXTSECURE\u2019s secure push messaging protocol\u201d states the author of the audit in a paper titled, \u201cHow Secure is TextSecure?\u201c.\n\nThe research team published a document that resume the analysis of the TextSecure\u2019s secure push messaging protocol. According to the group of expert, TextSecure works on a the cryptographic protocol that is implemented in the CYANOGENMOD firmware, and the researchers discovered a way compromise it with a an Unknown Key-Share Attack (UKS) against the protocol.\n\nNow security experts explained that TextSecure is probably used by terrorist groups, but it\u2019s uncertain that the end-to-end encryption works on Apple iOS devices, they also explained that group messages and images are still not supported by WhatsApp for Android.\n\nIt seems that even is the messages are protected by the encryption implemented, the FBI or NSA are able to gather metadata on the server side that could be used to link WhatsApp users. The analysis of metadata allowed law enforcement to identify the network of the alleged suspects.\n\nAccording to the editor Fabian A. Scherschel, authorities are able to intercept and collect messages that could be decrypted since the key seeds could be more easily guessed reduced the number of possible keys.\n\n\u201cAs other researchers have documented, WhatsApp uses a proprietary encryption in transit that is based on the problematic RC4 algorithm. This means it can be successfully attacked as RC4 has to be considered broken. In addition to this, the app seems to use the same key \u2013 derived from a user password \u2013 for both incoming and outgoing communication which enlarges the attack surface further. This means that while the encryption in transit can in principle be broken, it prevents mass data collection, say on Internet backbones.\u201d said Scherschel.\n\n\n\nMoxie Marlinspike responded to Scherschel via Reddit:\n\n\u201cThis article should be retitled \u2018Breaking News: WhatsApp E2E Deployment Process Exactly As Advertised.\u2019  We announced a partnership, not a finished deployment. In the blog post announcing that partnership, we publicly outlined the WhatsApp E2E deployment process, and it describes exactly what has been \u2018discovered\u2019 here. As I said in the blog post, deploying across this many users (hundreds of millions) and this many platforms (seven, of which they checked two) takes time, and is being done incrementally.

In fact, those legal instruments have a different orientation from privacy perspective.\n\nCyber Risk is persisting with the materialization of terror attacks. Therefore, the importance to provide the best legal conditions to the NSA and security offices means a compromise to transform surveillance practices into a good example of accountability and transparency of government surveillance activities. Legal aspects of three parts of the Patriot Act expired, including Section 215.\n\nNow, there is an example of controversy and conflict between political parties, private sector and civil society to find out a solution, considering critical factors to guarantee individual privacy rights upon government\u2019s surveillance activities.\n\nCurrently, privacy is extremely important for governments in terms of geopolitics and cyber-politics. There are several examples where governments are taking \u201cprivacy extremely seriously\u201d.\n\nThe Germans within their Federal Intelligence Service the BND has started several investigations to detect cyber-espionage activities. Brazil and its new internet freedom law is impelling best conditions to guarantee security and liberty in cyberspace.\n\nFrance approved a bill for intrusive surveillance after January\u2019s Charlie Hebdo attacks. In Canada, the government has tried to insert back doors into encryption. Last year, Australian legislation gave sweeping powers to monitor any device \u201cconnected\u201d to a particular device with just a single warrant.\n\nHowever, government surveillance powers require a prompt consensus to place substantive limits on legal aspects of Executive Order 12333 and the 2008 FISA Amendments Act. In this direction, Senate must reconsider the importance of accountability and oversight to government\u2019s surveillance activities.

You would have difficulty finding any other area of crime with similar statistics,\u201d  explained Adrian Leppard, the Commissioner of the City of London Police. \u201cBut we estimate that as much as 80 per cent of this sort of crime is not reported, so while we know there is a big problem, we can\u2019t put a scale on it and that is one of our biggest challenges,\u201d .\n\nThe data confirms concerns expressed by the Director of the Europol Rob Wainwright early this year, he also added that the cybercrime is a dangerous and attractive lifestyle for young cyber talents.\n\nMr. Wainwright said that kingpins behind principal cyber criminal syndicates are protected by the lack of an official law framework that is written with the intent to persecute online crimes, for this reason cybercrime is considered by crooks as a \u201clow-risk, high yield\u201d offense.\n\n\u201cOrganised crime is motivated by money. Whichever criminal activity delivers the most money that is where they will go\u201d Adrian Leppard told to The Telegraph. \u201cWe estimate that around 25 per cent of the organised crime groups in this country are now involved in financial crime in one shape or another, but that intelligence only relates to this country. We can\u2019t tell what the picture is internationally.\u201d\n\nAs a direct consequence, more than half of digital thieves have a criminal record in \u2018real world,\u2019 according to data provided by the law enforcement.\n\n\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe study shows those traditional offenders are changing their behaviour and moving to the Internet.\u201d It added that criminals who were often technical amateurs perceived cybercrime as a \u201clow-risk, high-reward type of offending\u201d. explained Jon Boutcher, deputy chief constable of Bedfordshire Police.\n\nThe majority of cybercriminals has a background in more traditional violent offending, more than 60% of them committed crimes not related to online activities, including theft, burglary, and shoplifting.\n\n\u201cThe research by Bedfordshire police found those convicted of cyber crimes also had a history of offences such as theft, burglary, shop lifting in the \u201creal world.\u201d A number were violent criminals with convictions for battery and assault.\u201d continues The Telegraph. \u201cResearchers at Cambridge University who drew on the police data said the evidence suggested that the nation\u2019s analogue crooks are going digital.\u201d\n\nThis drift of crime is difficult to counter with a traditional approach due to the nature of the electronic means used for committing the crimes.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to attack this in a traditional way, to gather intelligence, identify the core problem and then address it through enforcement and prosecution.\u201d said Mr Leppard.\n\nCyber crime could become more lucrative than drugs and the perception of the offense is minor respect of traditional crimes, for this reason, the number of online crimes will continue to increase also thanks to model of sale as crime-as-a service that allow traditional criminals to buy anything they need to operate illegal activities in the cyberspace.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  cybercrime, traditional crime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/crime-as-a-service", "topic_name": "Crime-as-a-Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/pierluigi-paganini", "topic_name": "Pierluigi Paganini"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-affairs", "topic_name": "Security Affairs"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/traditional-crime", "topic_name": "traditional crime"}]}, {"news_name": "USBKill used to wipe clean criminal\u2019s PCs", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/36554/cyber-crime/usbkill-wipe-clean-criminals-pcs.html", "title": "USBKill used to wipe clean criminal\u2019s PCs\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "May 5, 2015", "body": "The best way to protect data from prying eyes is to destroy them, this is the thought of criminals when law enforcement is investigating on them.\n\nThe best option for crooks it to completely wipe their electronic equipment, or make them not accessible, before law enforcement seize them to conduct a forensic analysis.

Specifically, the amendment would permit the department to seek an injunction to prevent ongoing hacking violations in cases where 100 or more victim computers have been hacked.\u201d Leslie R. Caldwell, assistant attorney general in the criminal division at the Department of Justice, wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe amendment would give Obama Administrator a more power to take over the dangerous botnets. In the recent years, law enforcement have conducted several operation against operators of principal botnets, including the GameOver Zeus and Ramnit.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the law enforcement dismantled the entire control infrastructure, in other cases they hit only a part of the overall infrastructure, seizing its servers or arrested a number of its operators.\n\n\u201cOne powerful tool that the department has used to disrupt botnets and free victim computers from criminal malware is the civil injunction process.  Current law gives federal courts the authority to issue injunctions to stop the ongoing commission of specified fraud crimes or illegal wiretapping, by authorizing actions that prevent a continuing and substantial injury.  This authority played a crucial role in the department\u2019s successful disruption of the Coreflood botnet in 2011 and the Gameover Zeus botnet in 2014,\u201d continues Leslie R. Caldwell.\n\nAccording to Cladwell, the principal problem is represented by the limits imposed by current law that allows authorities to issue injunctions to contrast only specific crimes.\n\n\u201cCurrent law gives federal courts the authority to issue injunctions to stop the ongoing commission of specified fraud crimes or illegal wiretapping, by authorizing actions that prevent a continuing and substantial injury,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that current law only permits courts to consider injunctions for limited crimes, including certain frauds and illegal wiretapping,\u201d she added. \u201cBotnets, however, can be used for many different types of illegal activity. They can be used to steal sensitive corporate information, to harvest email account addresses, to hack other computers, or to execute DDoS attacks against web sites or other computers. Yet \u2014 depending on the facts of any given case \u2014 these crimes may not constitute fraud or illegal wiretapping. In those cases, courts may lack the statutory authority to consider an application by prosecutors for an injunction to disrupt the botnets in the same way that injunctions were successfully used to incapacitate the Coreflood and Gameover Zeus botnets.\u201d\n\nResuming the federal authorities request more in granting injunctions to fight botnets and take down malicious infrastructures.\n\n\u201cIn sum, this proposal would provide the government with an effective tool to shut down illegal botnets or certain widespread malicious software to better match the ways that criminals are using these technologies,\u201d she wrote.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  botnets, US Government)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/gameover-zeus-botnet", "topic_name": "Gameover Zeus botnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law-enforcement", "topic_name": "law enforcement"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ramnit", "topic_name": "Ramnit"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us-government", "topic_name": "US Government"}]}, {"news_name": "Twitter locked down Tor by requiring a phone number for sign-up", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/34421/social-networks/twitter-locked-down-tor.html", "title": "Twitter locked down Tor by requiring a phone number for sign-up\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 4, 2015", "body": "A few days ago, Twitter announced plans to begin tracking users via their mobile phone number, a measure that the company consider necessary in order to fight the trolls.

In order to be kept up to date with the latest version of Facebook\u2019s policies, the report was issued raising awareness to everyone, even in a provisional manner.\n\n\n\nIn response to the revisions announced last December and performed a month later, the report is in accordance to what seems to be the case legally with Facebook to this date. According to the professionals, what has led them to proceed with the report was the following: \u201cIn December 2014, Facebook announced that it would revise\n\n\u201cIn December 2014, Facebook announced that it would revise its Data Use Policy and Terms of Service. At the request of the Belgian Privacy Commission, ICRI/CIR (KU Leuven), in cooperation with iMinds-SMIT (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) conducted an extensive analysis of Facebook\u2019s revised policies and terms.\u201d So, you can see that there is great concern on behalf of some European governments and their commissions , the Belgian Privacy Commission) to shed light to the privacy and freedom concerns of Facebook.\n\nWhat seems to raise suspicions and a great deal of concern about the rights of Facebook and its extensive data process is the fact that there are some policies that are of questionable legality within the European Union (EU) and the respective legislation. To be more specific:\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s data processing capabilities have increased both horizontally and vertically. By horizontal we refer to the increase of data gathered from different sources. Vertical refers to the deeper and more detailed view Facebook has on its users.\u201d\n\nThis has been a result of the cooperation of Facebook with some other companies and services, such as Instagram or Whatsapp. Due to the purchase of these services by Facebook and due to the acknowledgement that a lot of plugins are used by them, it makes total sense why Facebook feels that it is high time it backed its legal rights up properly.\n\nAccording to the report, there are problems and potential red flags with the Unfair Contract Terms Directive. This Directive \u201cintroduces a notion of \u201cgood faith\u201d in order to prevent significant imbalances in the rights and obligations of consumers on the one hand and sellers and suppliers on the other hand.\u201d\n\nSo, you can see that there are several points that need to be discussed further towards outlining the vulnerabilities of the privacy policy of Facebook. It is crucial that all the users are thoroughly informed on what they agree to upon subscribing to Facebook.\n\nThis can result in a much better handling of their privacy as a whole.

The NSA director reported as an example the continuous attacks against Department of Defense contractors that are exposing also the military secret to risks of theft. The US Intelligence needs the cooperation of private companies to protect its citizens.\n\n\u201cWe have shown in other areas that through both technology and a legal framework and a social compact that we can take on tough issues, and I hope we can do the same thing here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe document disclosed by Edward Snowden raised the indignation of many Governments worldwide for the \u201caggressive\u201d surveillance programs of the US intelligence, the leakage of the secret documents has a significant impact on the US intelligence and its activities.\n\n\u201cSnowden has had a material impact on our ability to perform counterterror operations,\u201d Rogers argued. \u201cAnyone who says otherwise doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\u201d\n\nThe NSA director didn\u2019t comment on the latest revelations made by Snowden related to the malware secretly spread by the Agency to compromise the hard drives of computers worldwide and the hack of the SIM cards manufacturer Germalto.\n\nDuring the discussion, the cryptographer Bruce Schneier explained that it is not possible to prevent the threat actors from accessing encrypted communications while allowing U.S. authorities to do so.\n\nSchneier also asked to Rogers how to assure Americans that U.S. tech products are safe, and the NSA provided the following reply:\n\n\u201cThats why we need a framework,\u201d said the NSA Director Rogers  \u201cThis is a legitimate question. \u2018What is the economic impact?\u2019 With policy and laws we can get to a better place.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  NSA Director Rogers, Intelligence)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/edward-snowden", "topic_name": "Edward Snowden"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/encryption", "topic_name": "encryption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa-director-rogers", "topic_name": "NSA Director Rogers"}]}, {"news_name": "Rule 41 \u2013 Google against the expansion of FBI hacking powers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33964/cyber-crime/rule-41-fbi-hacking.html", "title": "Rule 41 \u2013 Google against the expansion of FBI hacking powers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 22, 2015", "body": "The amendment to the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 (Rule 41) would expand jurisdiction for judges to issue warrants to investigate technologically concealed locations. It was first proposed to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules (ACCR) in September 2014. Since then, there has been a public consultation which resulted in Google strongly urging the ACCR to consider the residual effects this may have globally.\n\nGoogle stressed that the amendment to Rule 41 is an extensive increase in government power and should be handled by Congress on a larger scale.\n\nGoogle explained that currently under Rule 41, \u201cfederal prosecutors must generally seek a warrant in the judicial district to search for and seize a person or property located within the district. This territorial limitation is subject to limited exceptions\u201d. \n\nWhereas, the  requested amendment generalizes broad situations in which warrants could be issued to locations outside their district given that it was purposely concealed, or where technology has been damaged and also located in more than five districts in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).\n\n\u201cRemote searches of media or information that have been \u2018concealed through technological means\u2019 may take place anywhere in the world. This concern is not theoretical\u201d.\n\nAccording to Google, the US has been fairly successful at maintaining proper arrangements with other countries when conducting investigations, pointing out Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs).\n\n\u201cGoogle and many other service providers, have long encouraged and supported the efforts of the Administration and Congress to improve these processes, but the proposed amendment undermines those efforts\u201d.\n\nAnother point made by Google was the violation of the Rules Enabling Act, as well as alteration of US constitutional rights. The Rules Enabling Act allowed for adaptation of practical, procedural an evidentiary rules, as long as the updates did not interfere with any substantive right.\n\n\n\nContrary to government claims, Google suggested, \u201cit invariably expands the scope of law enforcement searches, weakens the Fourth Amendment\u2018s particularity and notice requirements, opens the door to potentially unreasonable searches and seizures, and expands the practice of covert entry warrants\u201d.\n\nThe  specifications of what may be searched and how it may be obtained are not clear in the amendment. Remote access is mentioned in the means of searching, seizing or copying digitally stored data, however, this term can be interpreted in many ways. Google declared that remote access could be used to expose a target device\u2019s IP address through the installation of software used to report pertinent information back to law enforcement. Another example of a remote access investigation technique is redirecting user information that is entered into specific websites of interest so that law enforcement can collect data from a target. Google mentioned the large potential for innocent parties\u2019 information to be taken through an investigative technique such as this, as well as the increased exposure to possible malware. The proposed amendment also puts those who use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) at higher risk to be searched because it would seem that their intentional use of encryption meant they were concealing their location.\n\nThe broad statement of damage to a computer in violation of the CFAA would encompass millions of American computers alone. Google reported that in order for the government to search more than five districts at a time, the use of botnets would be needed. These botnet searches, by default, would infiltrate the computers of law abiding Americans by the definition of their damaged computer. Google explained that around thirty percent of American computers contain malware and would be considered damaged. The searches seem to have no restrictions with the broad language that was used.\n\nWhat is Google\u2019s overall warning about Rule 41?\n\nThis amendment is bigger than the ACCR and could potentially become bigger than Congress. Google is the only major tech company that has spoke out against the private data search expansion. The proposed amendment should be rejected by the ACCR with the understanding that \u201cthe proposed amendment substantively expands the government\u2019s current authority under Rule 41 and raises a number of monumental and highly complex constitutional, legal, and geopolitical concerns that should be left to Congress to decide\u201d.\n\nAbout the Author Kerri Heitner: \n\nKerri Heitner is a recent graduate of Utica College in New York where she completed her Master of Science (M.S.) in Cybersecurity this past December.

Memex seeks to develop the next generation of search technologies and revolutionize the discovery, organization and presentation of search results. The goal is for users to be able to extend the reach of current search capabilities and quickly and thoroughly organize subsets of information based on individual interests. Memex also aims to produce search results that are more immediately useful to specific domains and tasks, and to improve the ability of military, government and commercial enterprises to find and organize mission-critical publically available information on the Internet\u201d states the official page of the project.\n\nA few days ago, for the first time, the  security community has the opportunity to give a look to the MEMEX system, DARPA opened the doors of its laboratories to the journalists of the Scientific American. The Agency provided a preview of the powerful search engine and explained its use in the fight against the cybercrime.\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s research agency gave Scientific American a preview of the software and 60 Minutes exclusive looks at the technology. The researchers explained that there is an impressive amount of data that is not considered useful for ordinary web users, but that represents a crucial source of information for law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cThat leaves untouched a multitude of information that may not be valuable to the average Web surfer but could provide crucial information to investigators.\u201d states the article published by the Scientific American.\n\nThe majority of information in the Deep Web is unstructured data which are gathered from multiple sources that could not be crawled by ordinary search engines. The most popular subset of the Deep Web is the Tor network, an anonymizing network that is accessible only by using specific software.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re envisioning a new paradigm for search that would tailor indexed content, search results and interface tools to individual users and specific subject areas, and not the other way around,\u201d said Chris White, DARPA program manager. \u201cBy inventing better methods for interacting with and sharing information, we want to improve search for everybody and individualize access to information. Ease of use for non-programmers is essential.\u201d\n\nThe DARPA involved 17 different teams of researchers, composed of representatives of the academic world and private industry, to develop most advanced technologies to include in the MEMEX program. The ambitious projects aim to revolutionize the way so search and present information from a larger pool of sources, including the content on the Deep Web.\n\nIn many circumstances, we have explained that the Deep Web is often abused by criminals that manage a multitude of illegal activities, including child pornography, human trafficking, drug deals and any other cyber criminal activities.\n\nAccording to several reports, including one published by researchers at the Carnegie Mellon University, the NYDA\u2019s Office is one of several bureaus and agencies that have already used earlier versions of the Memex system to collect information on human trafficking cases and prosecute criminals.\n\nIn a video interview released by Chris White, the inventor of the Memex search engine, the expert explained how this amazing platform works and which kind of information is able to access.\n\n\n\n \u201cThe internet is much, much bigger than people think,\u201d White said. \u201cBy some estimates Google, Microsoft Bing, and Yahoo only give us access to around 5% of the content on the Web.\u201d said White, highlighting that the Deep Web represents a privileged environment for bad actors and their illegal affairs.\n\nVery eloquent was the intervention of another researcher involved in the project MEMEX, the DARPA innovation head Dan Kaufman. who says, \u201d\n\n\u201cthe easiest way to think about Memex is: How can I make the unseen seen?\u201d commented Kaufman. \u201cMost people on the internet are doing benign and good things,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cBut there are parasites that live on there, and we take away their ability to use the internet against us\u2013 and make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, different Intelligence Agencies are testing the Memex, including two district attorneys\u2019 offices, a law enforcement agency, and a nongovernmental organization. In the next phase the access to the platform will be extended to a greater number of beta testers to stress the capabilities of the application.\n\n\u201cThe next set of testing begins in a few weeks and will include federal and district prosecutors, regional and national law enforcement and multiple NGOs. One of the main objectives of this round is to test new image search capabilities that can analyze photos even when portions that might aid investigators\u2014including traffickers\u2019 faces or a television screen in the background \u2014 are obfuscated,\u201d Scientific American reports. \u201cAnother goal is to try out different user interfaces and to experiment with streaming architectures that assess time-sensitive data.\u201d\n\nWhite remarked the potentiality of a set of tools like MEMEX and that improvements they bring to searches conducted by law enforcement for their investigation and to prevent crimes, the experts also explained that its system will never hack any service on the Internet in order to retrieve information-\n\n\u201cWhite made several key decisions about the type of data Memex could access in an effort to steer clear of the controversy around government access to private citizen information and communications, a particularly touchy subject since Edward Snowden\u2019s National Security Agency revelations beginning in June 2013. If something is password protected, it is not public content and Memex does not search it, according to White.\u201d reported the Scientific American.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do hacking,\u201d White added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to cloud this work unnecessarily by dragging in the specter of snooping and surveillance.\u201d \n\nAs usual happen for special projects born in the Intelligence, one day we would all benefit of the services offered by MEMEX and its searches, we are drowning in a sea of information.\n\n\u201cMemex would ultimately apply to any public domain content; initially, DARPA intends to develop Memex to address a key Defense Department mission: fighting human trafficking. Human trafficking is a factor in many types of military, law enforcement and intelligence investigations and has a significant web presence to attract customers. The use of forums, chats, advertisements, job postings, hidden services, etc., continues to enable a growing industry of modern slavery. An index curated for the counter-trafficking domain, along with configurable interfaces for search and analysis, would enable new opportunities to uncover and defeat trafficking enterprises. Memex plans to explore three technical areas of interest: domain-specific indexing, domain-specific search, and DoD-specified applications.\u201d\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  MEMEX project, DARPA)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "GCHQ mass internet surveillance was unlawful, IPT rules", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/33188/intelligence/gchq-mass-internet-unlawful.html", "title": "GCHQ mass internet surveillance was unlawful, IPT rules\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 6, 2015", "body": "The British intelligence GCHQ acted illegally in accessing millions of personal communications collected by the NSA, this is the judgment of The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) that ruled against the national intelligence agency and security services.\n\nThe court established that \u201cthe soliciting, receiving, storing and transmitting by UK authorities of the private communications of individuals located in the UK, which have been obtained by US authorities\u201d is unlawful and violated the articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which refer to the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression.\n\nThe \u201corder\u201d published on the IPT\u2019s website early on Friday declared:\n\n\u201cThe regime governing the soliciting, receiving, storing and transmitting by UK authorities of private communications of individuals located in the UK, which have been obtained by US authorities \u2026 contravened Articles 8 or 10\u201d of the European convention on human rights.\u201d\n\nHuman rights organizations expressed doubts about the legality of intelligence operations run by the UK and the US intelligence agencies.

The uncomfortable truth was revealed last month during a court hearing in Denver.\n\nThe equipment used by law enforcement is the Range-R, a device that uses radio waves to detect the slightest movements, including breathing, from as much as 50 feet away.\n\n\u201cRANGE-R is a highly sensitive handheld radar system designed to detect and measure the distance to moving and near-stationary personnel through walls constructed of common building materials.\u201d reports the official website of the company that commercialize it.\n\nThe news was confirmed by a police officer during the court hearing, the officials described the Range-R as a \u201chand-held Doppler radar device.

The complainant has as a result of the breach suffered significant anxiety and distress including I believe a well-founded fear for his physical safety and that of his partner,\u201d ruled the privacy commissioner Timothy Pilgrim.\n\nA suspicious litigant affected by the Judge\u2019s ruling was reported seen loitering around the Judge\u2019s property. \u201cAs my details and those of my partner are suppressed on every public register, I infer his knowledge of our address is the White Pages site,\u201d confirmed the judge, whose identity was not disclosed due to security concerns. The Sidney judge has since applied for an Interstate transfer due to safety concerns\n\nIn a rather weak argument, Telstra blamed the Sydney judge for failure to notify the company against listing his details of the white pages. According to the Telco, details of its fixed line customers are listed on its white pages by default unless the client specifically asked for a silent number.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Telstra evoked a loophole in the privacy act that allowed the company to publish the judge details because directory listing was allowed on its license under the Telecommunication Act.\n\nPilgrim rejected the argument, saying a license condition only outline the activities the company could engage in, but did not constitute a legal obligation on Telstra. In addition, the commissioner noted that a simple non-voice service offered to the Judge did not have to end up on Telstra white pages.\n\n\u201cThere is no information before me to suggest that individuals who apply for a phone line for the purposes of an alarm system are aware or made aware that this service falls within the definition of a \u2018standard telephone service\u2019 and their information will therefore be handled in the same way as a phone line for a functioning handset,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTelstra in not new to privacy controversies. Earlier in March the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the ACMA) found Telstra guilty of breaking privacy Laws for failure to protect clients\u2019 private data from misuse and unauthorized access. Thousands of Telstra client data was easily accessible on the internet including customers with silent numbers.\n\nAuthor: Ali Qamar, Founder/Chief Editor at SecurityGladiators.com\n\nAuthor Bio:\nAli Qamar is an Internet security research enthusiast who enjoys \u201cdeep\u201d research to dig out modern discoveries in the security industry.

It isn\u2019t a science movie trailer, but the finding that cyber criminals increasingly targeting victims with internet technology that could cause \u201cinjury and possible deaths\u201d by hacking critical safety equipment.\n\nAccording to the European Police Office (Europol) the rapid diffusion of the paradigm of the \u2018Internet of Everything\u2019 (IoE) is stressing the dependency of human activities from a large number of devices always connected to the Internet and with significant computational capability.\n\n\u201cThe IoE represents a whole new attack vector that we believe criminals will already be looking for ways to exploit,\u201d according to the Europol threat assessment. \u201cThe IoE is inevitable. We must expect a rapidly growing number of devices to be rendered \u2018smart\u2019 and thence to become interconnected. Unfortunately, we feel that it is equally inevitable that many of these devices will leave vulnerabilities via which access to networks can be gained by criminals.\u201d\n\nOur homes, our cars, the workplaces are places crowded of intelligent devices that improve our perception of the reality, the Internet of Everything collects for us an impressive volume of information and that are used in many technological components that surround us. Soon a dozen of billion of devices will interact with us with increasing frequency enlarging our surface of attack.\n\nCiting a December 2013 report by US security firm IID, the Europol threat assessment warned of the first murder via \u201chacked internet-connected device\u201d by the end of 2014.\u201d\n\nIoE are invading our lives, let\u2019s think, for example, to the family of wearable devices or medical equipment like pacemakers, hacking them it is possible to cause serious damages to the victim.\n\nThe popular hacker Barnaby Jack, before his untimely death, succeeded to hack an insulin pump, altering the administration of the quantity of insulin that the device delivers. Barnaby Jack explained that today the majority of medical devices uses a radio transmission to let the medical staff to maintain it. The attack exploited a vulnerability in the insulin pump\u2019s radio control and its vibrating alert safety feature, similar incidents could have lethal consequences for patients. The \u201chacks\u201d worked with different models of insulin pumps produced by Medtronic firm.\n\nA cyber attacks could kill a man, unfortunately it is a reality and for this reason we must start to approach security in a different way, no matter if we hare designing a pacemaker of a remote control for our oven.\n\n\n\nOne of the most debated cases of an alleged \u201ccyber murder\u201d, is the car incident occurred to the Rolling Stone and Buzzfeed journalist Michael Hastings, the man died in a high-speed car crash on June 18th, 2013 and the rumors of a possible cyber attack on his car were fueled by the declaration of the Former US National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard Clarke, which revealed that the crash was \u201cconsistent with a car cyber-attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers \u2013 including the United States \u2013 know how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber-attack on [Hastings\u2019] car \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it.\u201d said Richard Clarke.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is within the agencies more careful with security of Internet-connected devices, it is stressing vendors to ensure security by design for medical devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps, \u201cwhich could be hacked to send out lethal jolts of electricity, or insulin pumps, which can be reprogrammed to administer overdoses,\u201d.\n\nAs discussed in the last 2015 Europol-INTERPOL cybercrime conference, which was attended by 230 specialists from law enforcement, the private sector and academia \u201cto review current trends and new modus operandi used by organized crime networks.\u201d, IoE is a paradigm that most of all could be exploited by a cybercrime syndicate in the next future.\n\nThe experts highlighted the fight to the cybercrime needs the improvement of information sharing and a joint effort on a global scale of principal law enforcement agencies.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 IoE, hacking, Internet of Everything)\n\n", "topics": ""}, {"news_name": "FBI opens its Malware Investigator portal to the private industry", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28782/cyber-crime/fbi-malware-investigator-portal.html", "title": "FBI opens its Malware Investigator portal to the private industry\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "October 1, 2014", "body": "The FBI has opened its Malware Investigator portal to industry in order to information sharing on this type of cyber threat and to improve incident response in case  of attacks against.

Initially, it will work for Windows malware and it would be expanded to collect also other families of malicious code. This kind of analysis has an immense value for malware analysts that could be able to track the evolution of malicious code in time, and track capabilities of APT and hackers behind the malicious campaign.\n\n\n\nRecently I introduced you the excellent work done by the independent researcher Brandon Dixon which has analyzed for years the metadata on submissions to VisusTotal service identifying patterns related to many bad actors.\n\n\u201cThe analysis conducted by Dixon on has an immense value, from the observation of VirusTotal submission over the time it is possible to understand how hackers work, which improvement they have made for their code and which is their cyber capabilities.

Last year the FBI dismantled the Tor hosting service Freedom Hosting in a large scale investigation on child pornography. FBI used a malicious code able to exploit a Firefox Zero-day for Firefox 17 version that allowed it to track Tor users. The malware implants a tracking cookie which fingerprinted suspects through a specific external server. The exploit is based on a Javascript that is a tiny Windows executable hidden in a variable dubbed \u201cMagneto\u201d. Magneto code looks up the victim\u2019s Windows hostname and MAC address and sends the information back to the FBI Virginia server exposing the victims\u2019s real IP address. The script sends back the data with a standard HTTP web request outside the Tor Network.    \n\nA few days ago, operators at Tor Project revealed that an unknown entity has managed a series of relay servers to conduct a confirmation attack against the Tor network and de-anonymize its users.\n\n\u201cThe security advisory explains that bad actors were leveraging a critical flaw in Tor to modify protocol headers in order to perform a traffic confirmation attack and inject a special code into the protocol header used by attackers to compare certain metrics from relays to de-anonymize users. The advisory reports that 115 malicious fast non-exit relays (6.4% of whole Tor network) were involved in the attack, the servers were actively monitoring the relays on both ends of a Tor circuit in an effort to de-anonymizeusers. \u201d I\u2019ve reported in a previous post on the attack.\n\nA new report disclosed by Wired suggests that agents of FBI are using a malware to identify Tor users by infecting their machines, it seems that the law enforcement agency is infecting computers as part of a large scale campaign dubbed Operation Torpedo.

However, they have been put even more on the front page of newspapers after both the recent acquisition by Facebook of WhatsApp and the declarations from Edward Snowden as to lobbies against the introduction in Europe of stricter privacy protections.\n\nFacebook\u2019s acquisition will add 450 million monthly WhatsApp users to 1.3 bn monthly Facebook users also potentially enabling the monitoring of real time exchanges of messages. Additionally if Facebook confirms the rumors about the plan to add voice communications to WhatApp, even such kind of information might be gathered and used for marketing purposes and given the more relaxed privacy regulations in the US such data might be used also for other purposes.\n\nIndeed, both WhatsApp and Facebook had privacy-related troubles in 2013 since the former had been questioned by the Italian, the Dutch and the Canadian data protection authority about the types of data collected, their modalities of usage and storage as well as the measures implemented to prevent third parties to access to them following revelations as to the access by WhatsApp to the users\u2019 data in their users\u2019 phone directory. The status of such investigations is not public, but it shows that European data protection authorities are trying to extend their reach in order to oblige also foreign entities to comply with European data protection standards if they process personal data of European users.\n\n\n\nBut much more expensive data protection issues were faced by Facebook that was obliged to pay $20 million to settle a dispute in California. In such case it was challenged to Facebook the fact that they were putting users\u2019 names and faces in \u201cSponsored Story\u201d ads without their permission and without paying them.\n\nAnd even higher risks for people\u2019s privacy might come if Snowden\u2019s statements are confirmed. Indeed, apparently not only the US government, but also the UK government is performing more invasive surveillance activities followed by other countries like Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden that have modified their laws to enable surveillance activities.\n\nThis occurs during a crucial timing since today 12 March 2014 the European Parliament will vote on the new European data protection regulations and on a resolution that, among other things, calls for the suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Program which is a program enabling the free transfer of personal data from the European Union to US companies that joined the program.\n\nThe new data protection regulations had been discussed for the last 2 years and provide, among others, fines up to EUR 10 million or up to 5% of the annual worldwide turnover whichever is greater. Their clear purpose is about ensuring that privacy protections have complied with by all the actors involved and indeed for the first time also international companies offering their services in the European Union from wherever they are located shall comply with European standards of privacy leading to an historical change which however might now be deemed necessary by politicians given the recent events.\n\nWe will see the future developments of the matter, but certainly this is an issue that is creating considerable concerns in the public opinion.\n\nGiulio Coraggio\n\nis a Senior Counsel working in the Intellectual Property Media and Technology and Commercial department of DLA Piper Italy and heading the Italian gambling practice.

Is this the next surveillance frontiers?\n\nInstead to exploit consolidated techniques like phishing and watering hole, intelligence agencies and law enforcement could use application updates to deliver malware on victims\u2019 systems.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is in the hacking business. The FBI is in the malware business,\u201d \u201cThe FBI may need more than these two tools to deliver malware. They may need something else and this is where my concern is. This is where we are going and why I\u2019m so worried about trust.\u201d Soghoian said. \n\nSoghoian remarked that there are a couple of crucial issues to consider, governments could potentially use update service offered by almost every software provider for its products, but a serious side effect could be the loss of the trust users have in the services.\n\n\n\nWithout installing updates users will be vulnerable to cyber attacks, identity theft and other criminal activities.\n\n\u201cThere are really sound security reasons why we want automatic security updates. If consumers have to do work to get updates, they won\u2019t, and they will stay vulnerable,\u201d \u201cWhat that means though is giving companies root on our computers\u2014and we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the code after fact. This is a point of leverage the government can use. We have no evidence they are using it right now, but these companies have a position of power over our devices that is unparalleled.\u201d Soghoian said. \n\nThe update process for Microsoft applications was already exploited for state-sponsored attacks, for example, in the case of Flame spyware when attackers used a sophisticated \u201ccollision attack\u201d to forge a Microsoft digital certificate.\n\nCryptographic hash algorithms theoretically provide a unique result for each input, but attackers succeeded to generate the same hash as outputs for two different inputs (collision). MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable to collisions, this means that \u201cSSL certificates, like the one that the Flame attackers forged to sign the malware, use digital signatures, which can be vulnerable to hash collisions.\u201d as reported by Microsoft.\n\n\u201cThe Flame malware used a cryptographic collision attack in combination with the terminal server licensing service certificates to sign code as if it came from Microsoft. However, code-signing without performing a collision is also possible. This is an avenue for compromise that may be used by additional attackers on customers not originally the focus of the Flame malware. In all cases, Windows Update can only be spoofed with an unauthorized certificate combined with a man-in-the-middle attack,\u201d Mike Reavey of the Microsoft Security Response Center, said.\n\nSoghoian fears the historical relationship between law enforcement with telecommunications providers, it must be also considered that principal service providers like Facebook, Google and Microsoft have always supported government investigations.\n\nSoghoian cautioned that the government could take advantage of existing features in large consume solutions, he mentioned a rescue feature implemented for Google Android phone locks where if a user fails on their pattern to unlock their phone, Android anyway give the possibility to unlock the device. Soghoian confirmed that the US Government has requested to Google the password resets for specific handsets in order to access their accounts or devices.\n\nSoghoian also proposed the case of FBI general counsel Valerie Caproni that in 2010 warned Congress of the \u201cGoing Dark\u201d problem, illustrating how the wiretapping capabilities were being reduced with the progress of technology.  Caproni singled out \u201cWeb-based e-mail, social-networking sites, and peer-to-peer communications\u201d as problems that have left the FBI \u201cincreasingly unable\u201d to conduct the same kind of wiretapping it could in the past.\n\n\u201cGoing Dark\u201d is the FBI\u2019s codename for its project to extend its ability to real time wiretap communications, it is born inside the bureau, employing 107 full-time expert starting from 2009.\n\nBut it is considered more serious the introduction of intentional flaws in products to allow wiretapping, let\u2019s remind the revelation made by Snowden on the case of RSA product, the whistleblower described the presence of allegedly encryption backdoor inserted by RSA in the BSafe software.\n\nIn similar way Skype served with a directive from the Attorney General to modify its end-to-end encryption capabilities in order to give the FBI the capability to snoop encrypted communication, and Apple allowed the access to the user\u2019s handset.\n\nThe unique actors that could prevent surveillance through product updates are the same service providers, let\u2019s hope the companies refuse government interferences and requests.\n\n\u201cI would hope Google would fight that type of order all the way to the Supreme Court. The same goes for Apple and Microsoft and others,\u201d  \u201cI hope the companies we depend on and trust would fight.\u201d said Soghoian\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Surveillance, Soghoian)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/bullrun", "topic_name": "Bullrun"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/flame", "topic_name": "Flame"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/phishing", "topic_name": "phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/prism", "topic_name": "PRISM"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/rsa", "topic_name": "RSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/snowden", "topic_name": "Snowden"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/soghoian", "topic_name": "Soghoian"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/watering-hole", "topic_name": "watering hole"}]}, {"news_name": "CDM MAGAZINE \u2013 CYBER WARNINGS DECEMBER 2013 ED. for free", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/20854/cyber-crime/cdm-magazine-dec-2013.html", "title": "CDM MAGAZINE \u2013 CYBER WARNINGS DECEMBER 2013 ED. for free\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 31, 2013", "body": " \n\nSPONSORED BY RSA CONFERENCE 2014\n\n\n\nCYBER WARNINGS E-MAGAZINE:  DECEMBER 2013\n\nCYBER DEFENSE MAGAZINE: ANNUAL EDITION FOR 2013\n\nCYBER WARNINGS E-MAGAZINE: DECEMBER 2013\n\nCYBER DEFENSE MAGAZINE: ANNUAL EDITION FOR 2013\n\nCYBER WARNINGS E-MAGAZINE: DECEMBER 2013\n\nCYBER DEFENSE MAGAZINE:  ANNUAL EDITION FOR 2013\n\nWe hope you enjoy this month\u2019s edition\u2026\n\nSincerely,\n\nTEAM CDM\n\nCyber Defense Magazine\n\nP.S.

To explain the effect of acts of cyber war, security experts use to mention the cyber attack against the Estonia\u2019s government networks in 2007, an offense occurred in a period of intense political contrasts with Russia.\n\nBut the recent years have been characterized by an intense activity of governments in the cyberspace considered the fifth domain of the warfare, we assisted to the mutual network intrusions of Korean cyber armies the disputes between US and Israel against countries like China, Iran and Syria.\n\nAlmost every government in investing to improve its cyber capabilities, New Zeland and Russia for example have started important initiatives recently, the definition and the implementation of an efficient cyber strategy is a must for everyone. In many cases we discussed about the repercussions of a cyber attack on the reality, Stuxnet is a good example of the potential effect of a cyber weapon, a malicious code could in fact be used to harm an industrial process and cause loss of human life.\n\nThe absence of global accepted rules in the cyberspace, let\u2019s think the concept itself of cyber weapon is ambiguous, is causing a fragmentation of the power, information warfare is significantly influencing the defense strategies of every governments requesting a review of decisional processes.\n\nIt is mandatory to establish a global collaboration interstate to prevent the escalation of cyber conflicts, the cyber warfare scenario is rapidly evolving and governments must align their strategies working to the definition of a set of cyber rules globally recognized and accepted.\n\nEarly 2013 an International Group of Experts tried to define this set of rules, formalizing their effort in an handbook titled \u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d, a document that provides a study on how extant international law norms could be applied to cyber warfare.\n\n\n\nNATO Cooperative Cyber \u200b\u200bDefense Center of Excellence has sustained the drafting of the document to clarify the rules of the governments in the cyberspace, and their conduct, defining jurisdiction, control and legal responsibilities.\n\n\u00abA State bears international legal responsibility for cyber operation attributable to it and which constitutes a breach of an international obligation.\u00bb\n\nThe experts provided a legal definition for a concept such as a cyber attack and a cyber weapon, following an abstract from the first draft release:\n\n\u00abA cyber attack is cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects\u00bb\n\nThe NATO group isn\u2019t the unique one,  the EastWest Institute has created the Cyber 40, with delegates from 40 digitally advanced countries, the purpose is to involve government organizations, industry groups and think tanks to define practical \u201chumanitarian agreements for cyber conflicts\u201d in cyber warfare.\n\nWithin principal goals the definition of  the duty of care in case of cyber attacks against a country that have to define which targets have to be preserved due the possible damage on the population. Dam, dykes and Nuclear Electrical Generating Stations could not represent a primary target for a cyber attack, another question is to operate in a \u201ccontext\u201d that needs to preserve children, journalists, medical and religious personnel. In cyber warfare, the context is fundamental to introduce the concept of cyber weapons, and experts have approached it defining the \u2018Means\u2019 of cyber warfare that are cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems.\n\n\u201cCyber weapons are cyber means of warfare that are by design, use, or intended use, capable of causing either injury to, or death of, persons. The \u2018Methods\u2019 of cyber warfare are the cyber tactics, techniques and procedures, by which hostilities are conducted.\u201d\n\nAs highlighted by many cyber experts it is necessary to contextualize the principles proposed by the Geneva and Hague conventions, to the information warfare facing with difficulties specific in the use of cyber tools.\n\nWhat could be considered an act of cyber war? Which are the rules of engages? When is a cyber attack justified? Which is the limitation of an \u201coffensive\u201d approach to cyber security?\n\nThese are just a few of questions to approach, it is necessary to define a \u201cmodel of cyber conflict\u201d, defining roles and responsibilities (e.g. Attackers, targets) .\n\nWithin the various urgencies there is the need to be able to distinguish humanitarian interests in cyberspace to avoid that a cyber attack could impact them, but it is a hard task.\n\nAnother serious issue to address is the attribution of responsibility for the cyber war acts, in the majority of cases it is quite impossible to discover the origin of the attack and to identify the attacker.

The Policy places at the base of the reform process the following three strategic principles:\n\nAll security reports released by principal security firms reveal the increase in the number of cyber attacks against private companies and critical infrastructures, last May Congress released a survey that claimed power utilities in the U.S. are under \u201cdaily\u201d cyber attacks.  It is necessary a strong response from the governments which must also be responsible for the definition of security guidelines.\n\nThe NIST has proposed its preliminary cybersecurity framework  with specific intent to respond to the executive order 13636 and create guidelines to improve security for Critical Infrastructure. The adopting of the cybersecurity framework would be voluntary for companies and could help companies mitigate the numerous cyber threats.\n\nThe cybersecurity framework draft proposed by NIST was written with the involvement of roughly 3,000 industry and academic experts, it suggests best practices for networks and asset protection to the companies. Another crucial aspect approached by the draft is the guidance on how companies could respond to and recover from breaches. The document also examines how the companies could do all that while protecting privacy and civil liberties.\n\n\u201cUltimately what we want to do is we want to turn today\u2019s best practices into common and expected practices,\u201d said NIST Director Patrick Gallagher. He also defined the framework \u201ca living document\u201d that is expected to be flexible.\n\n\u201cThe framework can be used to help identify and prioritize actions for reducing cybersecurity risk and is a tool for aligning policy, business, and technological approaches to managing that risk.\u201d The draft reads. \n\nGiving a look to the index of NIST cybersecurity framework it is possible to distinguish the following sections:\n\nFramework Introduction \u2013 In this section is provided an overview of the cybersecurity framework that is a risk-based approach composed of three parts:\n\n\n\nFramework Basics \u2013 this section describes the following NIST Framework Core elements:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Use the Framework \u2013 the section has been written to propose a basic overview of cybersecurity practices to describe how an organization could use the NIST Framework to create a new cybersecurity program or improve an existing cybersecurity program.\n\nThe US government has been offering a series of incentives, including cybersecurity insurance and priority consideration for grants, to reward companies that adopt the framework.\n\nNIST will now take public comments for 45 days while the final cybersecurity framework is planned for February 2014.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  NIST, cyber security framework)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructure", "topic_name": "critical infrastructure"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybersecurity-framework", "topic_name": "cybersecurity framework"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/executive-order", "topic_name": "executive order"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nist", "topic_name": "NIST"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/power-utilities", "topic_name": "power utilities"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}]}, {"news_name": "Proxy.sh \u2013 Can you trust your VPN provider?

According a Michael Horowitz post published on Computer Word it is engough that an Android device has ever logged onto a WiFi network.\n\nConsidering the capillary diffusion for the Android OS, that accounted for 79,3% market share at Q2 2013 according International Data Corporation, it is likely that Google can access most WiFi passwords worldwide. According privacy advocates and security experts Android OS has a built-in feature for backup mobile data including WiFi passwords.\n\nUsers that have experience with change of devices have noted the possibility to import passwords, personal data, application and device settings and login data, this is possible if they have set up Gmail address and password on their mobile. The data is encrypted and sent to Google data servers, it is accessible only when the user has an authenticated connection to Google.\n\n \u201cAndroid devices have defaulted to coughing up WIFi passwords since version 2.2. And, since the feature is presented as a good thing, most people wouldn\u2019t change it.\u201d wrote Horowitz.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe \u2018back up my data\u2019 option in Android is very convenient.

This information is vulnerable to government requests for data,\u201d wrote Micah Lee, staff technologist at privacy warrior outfit the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nObviously users can switch off backup feature but the functionality according to many privacy experts is not properly advertised. In particular a post published on The Register highlighted the leak of information on WiFi password management for backup functionality.\n\n\u201cThe list of Wi-Fi networks and passwords stored on a device is likely to extend far beyond a user\u2019s home, and include hotels, shops, libraries, friends\u2019 houses, offices and all manner of other places. Adding this information to the extensive maps of Wi-Fi access points built up over years by Google and others, and suddenly fandroids face a greater risk to their privacy if this data is scrutinised by outside agents.\u201d\n\nRecent revelations about the PRISM surveillance program and on the collaboration \u201crequested\u201d by US authorities to IT giants like Google increase the the concerns of users on their privacy, the interference of governments on online user\u2019s experience has reached levels never touched before.\n\n\u201cEven if Google deletes every copy of your backed up data, they may already have been compelled to share it with others. And, Google will continue to have a copy of the password until every Android device that has ever connected to the network turns off the backing up of settings/data. \u201d states the post on ComputerWorld with explicit reference to surveillance activities operated by intelligence agencies.\n\nThe news on the WiFi password \u201cacquired\u201d by Google came after the recent discovery made by news agency Der Spiegel on the capability of NSA to access to data stored on Smartphone, mobile devices are a powerful instruments considered an appendix our digital and therefore preserves valuable information on our digital experience and real.\n\nWe are in the digital era, surveillance and monitoring operated by governments and private companies are becoming environmental practice to be resisted, meaningful the words of Eric Schmidt, Google CEO,on government spying: is the \u201cnature of our society.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Privacy, Google, Mobile)  \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/nsa", "topic_name": "NSA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wifi-password", "topic_name": "WiFi password"}]}, {"news_name": "FBI admitted attack against the Freedom Hosting", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/17767/cyber-crime/fbi-admitted-attack-freedom-hosting.html", "title": "FBI admitted attack against the Freedom Hosting\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 16, 2013", "body": "FBI admitted publicly that the Bureau had compromised the Freedom Hosting, probably the most popular Tor hidden service operator company.\n\nThe news confirms the suspects raised after that a group of  Security researchers found a malicious script that takes advantage of a Firefox Zero-day to identify some users of the Tor anonymity network.\n\nMozilla confirmed the presence of the security vulnerability in Firefox 17 (MFSA 2013-53) , which is currently the extended support release (ESR) version of Firefox.\n\n\u201cSecurity researcher Nils reported that specially crafted web content using the onreadystatechange event and reloading of pages could sometimes cause a crash when unmapped memory is executed.

Of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica that was shut down by US law enforcement with a deep impact on cybercriminal underground. The popular money transfer service is used mainly by cyber criminals, it is the most adopted payment services in the Russian underground considered most active criminal community in the cyber space. Liberty Reserve, founded by Arthur Budovsky, is considered a secure payment channel by criminals due the anonymity of the transactions, it is considered the official currency schema for cybercrime. Let\u2019s step back, from 1999 to 2006 was operating the digital currency exchange known as Gold Age, a legal corporate entity registered in Panama, that was closed by regulators in 2006. Following a note from an interesting blog post on the closure of Liberty Reserve published by Idan Aharoni, head of cyber intelligence at RSA:\n\n\u201cThe original e-currency that fraudsters adopted \u2013 e-gold \u2013 was not much different in concept than Liberty Reserve. The company was US-based and offered electronic currency backed by real gold. When prices of gold fluctuated, so did the value of an e-gold. At the time, e-gold reigned supreme in the cybercriminal circles, to the point that fraudsters were trying to defraud funds from one another.\u201d\n\nFollowing a resume proposed by Wikipedia on the end of Gold Age:\n\n\u201cOn July 27, 2006 the New York County District Attorney\u2019s office announced the indictment of Arthur Budovsky and Vladimir Kats for allegedly violating Article 13-B of New York State Banking Law, after a six month sting operation that began in January 2006. Budovsky and Kats declared their innocence saying \u201cWe believe this is a legitimate business practice, which does not require a state license.\u201d Represented by Igor Niman, they were found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. The sentence reduced to five years probation. \n\nBudovsky left the country for Costa Rica and founded Liberty Reserve renouncing to U.S. Citizenship and became a Costa Rican citizen in 2011 so that Liberty Reserve could remain undetected by law enforcement. On May 27th, 2013 Budovsky was arrested in Spain on charges of money laundering following an investigation which also involved the US, the company website, LibertyReserve.com, only features a message saying it\u2019s been seized by U.S. law enforcement. The service was allegedly favored by cybercriminals and mules who took part in the recent Bank robbery of $45 million considered the biggest theft realized by a gang of hackers, the activities laundered cash that was drained from banks via ATMs around the world.\n\n\n\n  The figures related to Liberty Reserve activities are frightening, it had more than one million users and since 2006 until its suspension it processed around 55 million transactions, according to an indictment in U.S. District Court in New York. The indictment states that Liberty is accused of having laundered money for a total amount of $6 billion in criminal earnings, Budovsky and six other individuals ate the defendants. Liberty Reserve allegedly facilitated numerous illegal activities including credit card fraud, drug trafficking, investment fraud and child pornography.\n\n\u201clying to anti-money laundering authorities in Costa Rica, pretending to shut down LIBERTY RESERVE after learning the company was being investigated by U.S. law enforcement, and moving tens of millions of dollars through shell-company accounts maintained in Cyprus, Russia, Hong Kong, China, Morocco, Spain, and Australia among other places.\u201d\n\nThe suspension of the payment service has a dramatic impact on the underground considering that majority of sale use the current schema, but according security experts the effect will have a limited impact in the time, a black market in fact is very dynamic and many vendors are also already accepting many other payment methods such as the Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be devastating for the underground economy, but it\u2019s only going to be devastating for a short period of time,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been around for a long time and it\u2019s become a bit of a mainstay of the underground economy.\u201d said Steve Santorelli, director of security research nonprofit Team Cymru, to SCMagazine. \n\nThe use of Liberty Reserve was easy, users can open accounts and operate secure and rapid transactions, the indictment defines it as \u201cbank of choice for the criminal underground,\u201d. Liberty Reserve allowed the user\u2019s registration without any verification of information provided, it was enough to provide a name, dates of birth and the email address. The service provided  instantaneous payment transfers and charged them with a maximum of $2.99 (\u00a31.98) for each transaction, it also offered a private messaging facility much more private and secure than \u201cemail or instant messenger services\u201c. Idan Aharoni, head of cyber intelligence at RSA highlighted the that fraudsters will explore other channels as they have already done in the past. Cyber criminals may brush up old virtual currency schema such as WebMoney despite it doesn\u2019t offer a friendly services such like Liberty Reserve. Another possibility is the migration to Bitcoin currency due its maturity and reliability of its transactions and of course this will cause a further intensification of criminal activities that try to exploit any system to circumvent Bitcoin Users. A serious problem for Bitcoin is the instability of the currency\u2019s value, recently its Bitcoin went from $260 to as low as $105 and this is a not auspicable for long period business as declared by Alphonse Pascual, analyst for Javelin Strategy and Research:\n\n\u201cBig time criminals are businessmen, so they want to protect their investments, protect their profits, and Bitcoin is too unstable to do that,\u201d.\n\nFollowing the price related to Bitcoin, an event like the closure of Liberty Reserve could influence Bitcoin final prices, influence not yet evident.\n\n\n\nThe shut down of Liberty Reserve has alerted anyway the Bitcoin world, Mt.

This is the question.\n\nOfficially the company contacted by law enforced always denied to give the access to their device security features, also for investigation by law enforcement, but something is changing. To respond to numerous requests police demands to decrypt seized iPhones Apple created a waiting list to handle the deluge of requests and this represent an historical change, because the waiting list had grown so long there would be at least a 7-week delay to have a response from Apple.\n\nIn a documented case reported by court documents, an agent at the ATF, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u201ccontacted Apple to obtain assistance in unlocking the device,\u201d U.S. District Judge Karen Caldwell wrote in a recent opinion. She also wrote, that the ATF was \u201cplaced on a waiting list by the company.\u201d\n\nATF agent Rob Maynard declared that, for nearly three months last summer, he \u201cattempted to locate a local, state, or federal law enforcement agency with the forensic capabilities to unlock\u201d an iPhone 4S, the mobile is a property of a man in Kentucky who was charged for supplying crack cocaine.\n\nThe problem is that according the agent each police agency responded by saying they \u201cdid not have the forensic capability,\u201d, that\u2019s why the agent decided to contact directly Apple requesting support.\n\n\n\nApple is the unique entity able to bypass the security lock to extract data from iPhone despite there are a few software packages that claim to be able to extract some or all information stored on encrypted iOS devices such as  like Elcomsoft\u2019s iOS Forensic Toolkit and Oxygen Forensics Suite 2013.\n\nAnother case has been reported, in Nevada agents weren\u2019t able to bypass the encryption mechanisms of the iPhone and iPad for investigation, also The Drug enforcement Administration has also faced a similar problem to decrypt message sent with iMessage chat service as per an internal document.\n\nIn all these cases Apple seems to have provided a meaningful contribute despite it isn\u2019t clear if the company used a specific built in backdoor or has access to encrypted data using custom tools.\n\nApple specifically states in its privacy policy that it may disclose personal information \u201cby law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence\u201c.\n\nA CNET post revealed law enforcement can count on the support provided by companies such as Google and Apple, following a part of the interesting article:\n\n\u201cLast year, leaked training materials prepared by the Sacramento sheriff\u2019s office included a form that would require Apple to \u201cassist law enforcement agents\u201d with \u201cbypassing the cell phone user\u2019s passcode so that the agents may search the iPhone.\u201d Google takes a more privacy-protective approach: it \u201cresets the password and further provides the reset password to law enforcement,\u201d the materials say, which has the side effect of notifying the user that his or her cell phone has been compromised.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that companies such as Google and Apple, but also other manufacturer are able to access to user\u2019s data on mobile device even if they are on an encrypted device, at least in some circumstances.\n\nChristopher Soghoian, principal technologist with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project declared:\n\n\u201cThat is something that I don\u2019t think most people realize,\u201d \u201cEven if you turn on disk encryption with a password, these firms can and will provide the government with a way to get your data.\u201d\n\nPrivacy probably is the biggest utopia of our time.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cybercrime)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple",

come true, last Thursday The United States House of Representatives approved the debated cyber security bill,  the act will force any company to give away all the user\u2019s data it collects if asked by the government, trampling all claims of privacy of the people on the Internet in the name of security.\n\nThe Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) passed with 288-127 vote also receiving support from 92 Democrats, now the bill is submitted to the Senate and then to the President Office.\n\nIt\u2019s second time that The United States House of Representatives passed the challenged bill, the US Senate already rejected the first draft if the bill, that appears not different to this second one, due the lack of protection on user\u2019s privacy. Probably the bill has been set in the wrong way, we all agree on the needs to reinforce security also in the cyberspace and of course to do this US government request greater power of action.\n\nDuring the last months worldwide internet community expressed great concern at the possibility of a reintroduction of  The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection act (CISPA)  before the US House by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and ranking member Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.).\n\nRecent events have conditioned the decision to repeat the bill, many Americans are starting to be aware of the risks related to the improper use of the Internet, they understood that we can protect sea, land, sky and space but leave uncontrolled the Internet is compared to leave the door open in a fortress.\n\nPart of the bill are necessary to improve the security of the US against cyber attacks, let\u2019s remind that the it establishes a strict collaboration between central governments and private companies to protect their infrastructure, \u201cinformation sharing\u201d is the watchword. US Government and private business need to share information of cyber attacks they suffered to allow the authorities to activate its alert network, although the concept may seem obvious today does not happen so often hacked companies do not disclose the news to avoid any negative impact on the reputation of the corporate and the consequences can be disastrous.\n\nFollowing the statements used by Rogers to sustain the bill:\n\n \u201cThis is clearly not a theoretical threat \u2013 the recent spike in advanced cyber attacks against the banks and newspapers makes that crystal clear,\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican businesses are under siege,\u201d  \u201cWe need to provide American companies the information they need to better protect their networks from these dangerous cyber threats.  It is time to stop admiring this problem and deal with it immediately,\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about exchanging packets of information, zeroes and ones, if you will, one hundred million times a second. So some notion that this is a horrible invasion of content reading is wrong. It is not even close to that.\u201d, \n\nThe other co-author of the bill, Dutch Ruppersberger, declared during debate on the issue that $400bn worth of American trade secrets are being stolen by US companies every year.\n\n\u201cIf your house is being robbed, you call 911 and the police department comes. That\u2019s the same scenario we are looking at here,\u201d he said.\n\nVarious companies, included the giant of social networks Facebook, confirmed their support to the cyber security bill, following the declaration of Joel Kaplan, FB Vice President:\n\n\u201cOne challenge we and other companies have had is in our ability to share information with each other about cyber attacks. When one company detects an attack, sharing information about that attack promptly with other companies can help protect those other companies and their users from being victimized by the same attack,\u201d \u201cSimilarly, if the government learns of an intrusion or other attack, the more it can share about that attack with private companies (and the faster it can share the information), the better the protection for users and our systems.\u201d\n\nBut in the same time Reuters agency confirmed the opposition of Microsoft and Facebook to the bill.\n\nWeb companies, including Google and Wikipedia and Twitter expressed disappointment  on the debated bill warning on possible violations of digital freedoms and the user\u2019s privacy.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, one of 34 groups that wrote to lawmakers this week urging them to oppose the bill, Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel at the ACLU\u2019s Washington Legislative Office commented the act with following words:\n\n\u201cCISPA is an extreme proposal that allows companies that hold our very sensitive information to share it with any company or government entity they choose, even directly with military agencies like the NSA, without first stripping out personally identifiable information,\u201d\n\nOf course there is a side effect far from negligible, private companies daily manage user\u2019s data ensuring non-disclosure to protect the privacy, Privacy advocates and groups of hacktivists such as Anonymous are mobilizing to protest against the bill considered poorly drafted and that represents a serious menace to freedom of expression and to civil liberties.\n\nAnonymous collective is invited to publish a page to explain the bill and the way it could violate our privacy,  meanwhile The House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi expressed great concerns on CISPA  that represent the failure between  security and privacy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that we did not address some of the concerns mentioned by the White House about personal information,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cUnfortunately, it offers no policies and did not allow any amendments or real solution that upholds Americans\u2019 right to privacy.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology states that CISPA would allow Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to \u201cfunnel private communications and related information back to the government without adequate privacy protections and controls. The bill does not specify which agencies ISPs could disclose customer data to, but the structure and incentives in the bill raise a very real possibility that the National Security Agency or the DOD\u2019s Cybercommand would be the primary recipient.\u201d \n\nThe Bill will in fact allow the government to obtain complete control over the internet censoring every suspect content that could represent a threat to national security.\n\nDo we need to sacrifice our privacy in the name of security? Is it really necessary?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 CISPA)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cispa", "topic_name": "Cispa"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "The Legislation of Privacy: New Laws That Will Change Your Life", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/13191/laws-and-regulations/the-legislation-of-privacy-new-laws-that-will-change-your-life.html", "title": "The Legislation of Privacy: New Laws That Will Change Your Life\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 26, 2013", "body": "Today I desire to present the excellent work produced by freelance writer Gillian Holmes and the team of BackgroundCheck.org, as well know my readers I daily public only my posts, but I think that this work deserves a careful reading and I am sure will be of your benefit as it was for me \u2026 good read!\n\n \n\nTechnology is changing how we do everything, from connecting with friends to investigating our family history. While most of these changes are for the better, the reality is that many of these new technologies expose us to serious privacy risks, especially as legislation has struggled to keep up. Yet both here in the U.S. and around the world, that could soon change. There are numerous new and pending laws that are starting to seriously tackle the challenges posed by modern technology, helping close gaps in legislation and enforcement that open you up to online stalking, medical data breaches, and disclosure of your online data. Even if you don\u2019t realize it, many of these laws can have a major impact on your life, from how you buy insurance to which bits of personal information are gathered while you shop online, go to the bank, or talk on the phone. What follows is a brief guide to many of the newer and upcoming laws regarding privacy in the United States. You\u2019ll learn what the bills propose, how they\u2019ll affect your life, and when they\u2019ll go into effect, if they haven\u2019t already.\n\nThese laws and proposals are designed to protect your privacy in the online and mobile spheres, ensuring that you and those you care about aren\u2019t tracked, subject to data seizures, or the victims of online predators. The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011Proposed by Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, this bill is designed to increase the enforcement of laws related to child pornography and child sexual exploitation, specifically by requiring Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide data about subscribers to law enforcement officials. While still on the table for debate, the law has attracted a lot of attention from those who believe it has serious implications with regard to consumer privacy.\n\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act The Electronic Communications Privacy Act is almost 30 years old, so why does it appear on this list? Because it\u2019s likely going to see somemajor revisions to reflect the increased variety and prevalence of electronic communications. The original act was designed to help expand federal wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping provisions, as well as protect communications that occur via wire, oral, and electronic means and to balance the right to privacy of citizens with the needs of law enforcement. In the years since, the law has been under increased scrutiny for being out of date and failing to protect all communications and consumer records. For example, under current law, government agencies can demand ISPs hand over personal consumer data stored on their servers that is more than 180 days old without a warrant. This wasn\u2019t an issue in the past, when most emails were downloaded to individual computers, but with the advent of webmail programs like Gmail and Yahoo, now nearly all consumer email communications are fair game. Major tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Verizon, and Twitter, have advocated for greater privacy and reform of the law.\n\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act COPPA isn\u2019t new, either, but it has seen some significant amendments over the past year that are worth mentioning. COPPA, which went into effect in early 2000, protects children under 13 from the online collection of personal information. As a result, many sites today often disallow children under 13 from using their services or require parental permission for disclosure of any personal information. In September 2011, the FTC announced proposed revisions to COPPAthat expand the definition of what it means to collect data from children. These new rules would include regulations on data retention and deletion and would require any third parties to whom a child\u2019s information is disclosed to have policies in place to protect the information.\n\nThe GPS ActThe GPS Act, proposed by Representative Jason Chaffetz and Senator Ron Wyden, seeks to give government agencies, commercial entities, and private citizens specific guidelines to when and how geolocation information can be accessed and used. At present, there are no U.S. laws that directly address GPS tracking data, and with the proliferation of trackable devices like cell phones and GPS systems, the act is aiming to update regulations and guidelines to reflect modern sources of privacy concerns.\n\nBack to Top \u2191\n\nMuch like your social activities, your consumer habits and activities are also subject toprivacy violations, especially when they occur online or through a mobile device. The following are laws that seek to address a number of major issues related to consumer privacy rights. Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights On April 12, 2011, Senators Kerry and McCain introduced the Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights to establish a baseline code of conduct for how personal information can be used, stored, and distributed. The bill of rights has since been picked up by the Obama administration and adapted in a report titled \u201cConsumer Data Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework for Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the Global Digital Economy.\u201d In both instances, the bill of rights lays out principles that would work to protect personal data and to improve consumer security. It is not a piece of legislation in itself, but a guidelinefor building and enacting future regulations and laws that will impact tech companies and online retailers.\n\nApplication Privacy, Protection, and Security Act of 2013 Congressman Hank Johnson proposed the APPS Act early this year. The act is designed to address concerns with the data collection being done through applications on mobile devicesand would require that app developers provide greater transparency about their data collection practices, ensure reasonable levels of data security, and allow users to opt out of data collection or have the option to delete data that has been collected on them.\n\nLocation Privacy Protection Act of 2011 Worried about the potential risks for stalking posed by cell phones loaded with GPS and apps that gather information about a user\u2019s location, Senator Al Franken, along with several co-sponsors, proposed this bill to fill in loopholes in federal law that allow companies to obtain location-based information on consumers and to share that information with third parties. While some app developers have complained that this hinders location-based advertising, others agreethat privacy needs to be protected and that location-based tracking should only be allowed within apps that consumers have given consent to do so.\n\nCyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA)Proposed by Rep. Michael Rogers and co-sponsored by 111 other House members, CISPA is designed to help the government better investigate cyber threats and ensure that large networks are secure against the threat of cyberattack. To do that, the act would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and certain technology and manufacturing companies. While noble in its intention, the act has been widely criticized for endangering privacy and civil liberties, though some large technology companies (Microsoft and Facebook) favor it as a simple and effective way of sharing important cyber threat information with authorities.\n\nBack to Top \u2191\n\nHere, you can learn more about privacy laws that affect life in the workplace, from how you\u2019re hired to what information is fair game for employers. Social Media Privacy ActIncreasingly, employers have turned to social media as a way to learn more about potential employees. However, this has also meant that in some cases privacy boundaries were crossed, with potential employers requiring applicants to turn over passwords to social media accounts. To help job seekers protect their online privacy, California, Delaware,Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and New Jersey have all passed social media privacy laws. What\u2019s more, 11 other states (including New Mexico and Texas) have legislation of this nature pending.\n\nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) isn\u2019t new legislation. Passed in 2008, it prohibits the use of genetic information in health insurance and employment. That means that employers can\u2019t making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotions decisions based on genetic information, nor can insurers raise premiums or deny coverage to those with a genetic predisposition for a disease. While GINA itself is just five years old, it may soon see some updates. A recent report from the U.S. Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical issues recommended that the law be expanded to include security measures whole-genome sequence data rather than just focusing on issues of discrimination. New regulations would likely update the consent forms individuals sign when they agree to take part in research studies, helping protect their genetic information and preventing misuse of this data. Additionally, under recommendations by the committee, GINA would be expanded to include comprehensive national rules on how genetic privacy is protected.\n\nBack to Top \u2191\n\nThese highly important laws address issues of personal information, including medical data, private phone conversations, and video watching history. FISA Amendments Act of 2008/ FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was passed in 1978 but has undergone some major restructuring in recent years. Originally, FISA, signed into law by Jimmy Carter, proscribed basis procedures for physical and electronic surveillance and the collection of foreign intelligence information. It also provides strict judicial and congressional oversight of any covert surveillance activities. The first changes to the act occured under the Patriot Act, and though they expired in 2008, many of those changes were extended by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Under this act, the government is authorized to get year-long orders to conduct surveillance of Americans\u2019 international communications, including phone calls, emails, and Internet records. Currently, these orders do not need to specify who is being spied on or the reasons for doing so. Why is this important to you today? Originally, the amendment to FISA was only designed to last five years, expiring at the end of 2012. Overwhelmingly, however, the U.S. Senate voted in December 2012 to extend the FISA Amendments Actthrough the end of 2017.\n\nVideo Privacy Protection Act The Video Privacy Protection Act was signed into law in 1988 by President Reagan. It was designed to prevent the wrongful disclosure of video tape rental or sale records or similar audio visual materials. While over two decades old, the law has been in the news regularly over the past five years thanks to streaming technology and online video rental subscription programs, such as Netflix and Blockbuster, who have often integrated with social media sites. This has resulted in some major lawsuits, including one case in 2012 that required Netflix to change its privacy rules so that members who have left the site no longer have records with the company. Yet while the law has been at odds with online media providers in the past, recent changes to the legislation in the form of an amendment make it legal for streaming servicesto share details of the content viewed after consumers have given blanket permission, making it possible for greater integration into social media sites like Facebook.\n\nHealth Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) ActMost Americans are familiar with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), but many may not realize that the protections they enjoy under HIPAA got an update in the form of the HITECH Act. Part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, HITECH contains incentives to expand the adoption of health information technology, including the establishment of a nationwide network of health records. What does this have to do with privacy? HITECH also requires that major security breaches be reported to Health and Human Services as well as the media; it increases enforcement of HIPAA and the resulting penalties; and it ensures that any individual can request a copy of his or her public health record. Most importantly, it expands HIPAA regulations to include any business associates or providers to medical facilities, requiring vendors of any kind of keep private records private.\n\nProtect Our Health Privacy Act of 2012Some don\u2019t think that HITECH went far enough in protecting patient privacy. In June 2012, a bill was proposed that would amend the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The new act would require health providers to encrypt any mobile device containing health information, restrict business associates\u2019 use of protected health information, improve congressional oversight of HIPAA, and provide additional measures that would protect patient privacy and safety when using health information technology.\n\nAs privacy becomes and ever larger concern in an increasingly connected world, new legislation is likely to continually pop up, and there may be many new laws that see proposal and passage in addition to those we\u2019ve listed here in the next few years. The best thing you can do to protect yourself is to stay informed.\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.backgroundcheck.org/the-legislation-of-privacy-new-laws-that-will-change-your-life/\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Human Rights)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-commerce", "topic_name": "Digital Commerce"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-life", "topic_name": "Digital Life"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/personal-information", "topic_name": "Personal Information"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/work-and-employment", "topic_name": "Work and Employment"}]}, {"news_name": "Censorship, governments and corporations enemies of internet", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12822/digital-id/censorship-governments-and-corporations-enemies-of-internet.html", "title": "Censorship, governments and corporations enemies of internet\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 13, 2013", "body": "The use of technologies to support censorship is deplorable and condemnable but it must be considered that is a sad reality that has sustained the growth of a billionaire market.

The list include five private businesses that sell products used by authoritarian governments to commit violations of human rights and freedom of information.\n\nThe companies are Gamma, Trovicor, Hacking Team, Amesys and Blue Coat, the report uses words of condemnation for these businesses that it defines as \u201cdigital era mercenaries\u201d.\n\nThe companies are accused to essentially provide two types of corporate products for monitoring and espionage, architectures for large-scale monitoring of Internet and spyware and other kinds of tools for targeted and invasive surveillance.\n\nSophisticated malware designed and commercialized by Hacking Team and Gamma have been used by governments to spy on journalists and netizens, the malicious code is able to infect multi-platforms (e.g. desktop, mobile) and OSs, gathering remote control of victims machine and stealing documents and user\u2019s credentials.\n\nProducts such as FinSpy(Gamma) and DaVinci Code (Hacking Team) are infamous in the worldwide security community, Mikko Hypponen Chief Research Officer of F-Secure is one of the most popular voice that denounced the abused use of these applications.\n\nAgain, Trovicor\u2019s surveillance products have been deployed by Bahrain\u2019s royal family to spy on bloggers and journalists and arrest them, a quite similar situation is in Syria, Government of Damascus deployed a DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) produced by Blue Coat.\n\nAmesys company provided Eagle products that were found in the offices of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s secret police.\n\nThe report commented the event with following statemens:\n\n\u201cTheir products have been or are being used to commit violations of human rights and freedom of information. If these companies decided to sell to authoritarian regimes, they must have known that their products could be used to spy on journalists, dissidents and netizens. If their digital surveillance products were sold to an authoritarian regime by an intermediary without their knowledge, their failure to keep track of the exports of their own software means they did not care if their technology was misused and did not care about the vulnerability of those who defend human rights.\u201d\n\nReporters Without Borders calls for the introduction of controls on the commercialization of surveillance software and architectures to governments that persecute dissidents violating fundamental rights, it\u2019s necessary a  prompt action of Legislators.\n\n\u201cThe European Union and the United States have already banned the export of surveillance technology to Iran and Syria. This praiseworthy initiative should not be an isolated one. European governments need to take a harmonized approach to controlling the export of surveillance technology. \u201c\n\nDespite many organization are denouncing an intolerable situation under the eyes of all, many democratic countries also increased monitoring and surveillance activities in the name of homeland security, let\u2019s remind for example debated bills such as the US FISAA and CISPA and the Communications Data Bill in Britain.\n\nReporters Without Borders also propose a \u201cdigital survival kit\u201d  to offers practical tools, advice and techniques to censorship and monitoring activities\n\nLet\u2019s close the post with appropriate warning proposed in the report:\n\n\u201cThis is a battle without bombs, prison bars or blank inserts in newspapers, but if care is not taken, the enemies of the truth may sweep the board.\u201d\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Censorship)\n\n\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/great-firewall", "topic_name": "great firewall"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivists", "topic_name": "hacktivists"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/human-rights", "topic_name": "human rights"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/reporters-at-without-borders", "topic_name": "Reporters at Without Borders"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/spyfiles", "topic_name": "spyfiles"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/syria", "topic_name": "Syria"}]}, {"news_name": "US retaliation strategy against hackers", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12685/hacking/us-retaliation-strategy-against-hackers.html", "title": "US retaliation strategy against hackers\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "March 4, 2013", "body": "The year started very difficult for the U.S. government, its networks have been constantly hit by hackers that for different reasons have tried to steal sensitive information and intelligence secrets.\n\nThe principal menaces against US come from state-sponsored hackers and hacktivists, in the last months we have read of many cyber attacks, mainly for cyber espionage purpose,  that involved also US infrastructures and offices.\n\nThe US governments is facing with one of the most aggressive cyber campaign against its cyber resources, and exactly as any other countries is working to definition of a series of countermeasure to mitigate the risks related cyber threats.\n\nAs anticipated the attacks aren\u2019t exclusively political motivated, hacker group Anonymous represents a constant menace to its systems, the collective recently proved that gained access to State Department\u2019s website and its database during Operation Last Resort and probably it will not be the only one.\n\nThe group exposed personal information of State Department consular and staff members to protest against US authorities being allegedly responsible for the suicide of young internet activist Aaron Swartz.\n\nAnonymous has also announced that has possession of key codes to unlock encrypted files named after the nine Supreme Court justices, they were widely distributed January 25 when Anonymous hacked the US Sentencing Commission website , which allegedly contain highly sensitive government information.\n\nIs clear that this type of attacks are a great menace for the government that need to reinforce its cyber security and to find the way to persecute every cyber actors that violate its cyberspace.\n\nWe are in the middle of a cyberwar which is going on between multiple actors, in which the actors are mixed and there aren\u2019t clear rule of engage. Every governments despite global economic crisis is investing in both defense and offense sectors, most active countries are China, U.S., Israel, Iran, North Korea and Russia which are pushing militarization of cyberspace.\n\nThe espionage is become cyber espionage and instead of explicit attacks many countries prefer to explore to cause sensible damage to adversary hitting its critical infrastructures using a cyber weapon.\n\nIn recent weeks  Obama has signed an Executive Order on cyber security to define a set of actions required to contain \u201cgrowing threat from cyber-attacks\u201d. The order extends  the concept of cyber threats including acts such as \u201cwebsite defacement, espionage, theft of intellectual property, denial of service attacks, and destructive malware,\u201d, obviously any operations of hacktivism is also  considered as an attacks against government assets.\n\nDuring RSA conference on Thursday, Feb. 28 by White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel announced that U.S. government is considering other measures such as  visa restrictions and financial sanctions against hackers or governments that might hack national networks.\n\nIt\u2019s first time specific retaliation methods have been mentioned by the White House,  is difficult to imagine how the government can take legal action against hackers operating in the country, but especially for those who attack US from the outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a question that we\u2019re still debating and debating vigorously, and we need to debate within the government and as a society,\u201d \u201cWhat I can say is that once we decide a federal response is warranted though, there\u2019s still a broad spectrum of actions we could take.\u201d\n\nWhile the government studies how to implement its retaliation strategy, one after another U.S. IT giants (Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter) have fallen under cyber attacks of yet unidentified hackers, due this reason US will employ military action to respond to further hacks.\n\nPrincipal security firms consider Chinese state sponsored hackers responsible for the attacks, Chinese cyber units are accused of conduct  \u201cthousands\u201d attacks daily, Governments need to further strengthen its infrastructures and to act also on diplomatic way to hack to foreign governments such us China to monitor hacking activities that offend US.\n\n[this may include the U.S. leveraging its diplomatic powers to] \u201cpush countries to crack down on hacking activities from within their borders.\u201d Daniel said.\n\nDespite US intentions are clear their realization is very hard and delicate under diplomatic point of view with meaningful implications, retaliating against foreign hackers it\u2019s difficult and must be done with due care are as reiterated by Daniels.\n\n\u201cThe risk of missed attribution, missed calculation and escalation in cyberspace are very real,\u201d \u201cAs a government, any action we take in cyberspace must be considered against its possible foreign policy implications and our desire to establish international norms of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\u201d\n\nThe road is steep, full of difficulties and it is interesting to study how the U.S. Government intends to follow it and what will be the repercussions.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013 Cyber security)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chinese-state-sponsored", "topic_name": "Chinese state sponsored"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/executive-order", "topic_name": "executive order"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/operation-last-resort", "topic_name": "Operation Last Resort"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-department", "topic_name": "State Department"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/us", "topic_name": "US"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/white-house", "topic_name": "White House"}]}, {"news_name": "Serious security flaws affect millions of HTC mobile devices", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12569/hacking/serious-security-flaws-affect-millions-of-htc-mobile-devices.html", "title": "Serious security flaws affect millions of HTC mobile devices\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 25, 2013", "body": "The news of those who make a lot of noise, more than 18 million devices commercialized by Taiwanese company HTC had security flaws that could exposes users to serious risks in particular the bugs could allow the theft of information stored on the mobile and the tracking of user\u2019s location.\n\nThe vulnerabilities appear serious according The Federal Trade Commission that published an advisory titled \u201cHTC America Settles FTC Charges It Failed to Secure Millions of Mobile Devices Shipped to Consumers\u201d that charged HTC to have released on the market products that expose user\u2019s privacy to concrete risks. Mobile security is a critical issue, an increasing number of services from banking to entertainment is provided through mobile platforms, due this reason The Federal Trade Commission monitored the activities of the popular manufacturer.\n\n\u201cMobile device manufacturer HTC America has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that the company failed to take reasonable steps to secure the software it developed for its smartphones and tablet computers, introducing security flaws that placed sensitive information about millions of consumers at risk.\n\nThe settlement requires HTC America to develop and release software patches to fix vulnerabilities found in millions of HTC devices. In addition, the settlement requires HTC America to establish a comprehensive security program designed to address security risks during the development of HTC devices and to undergo independent security assessments every other year for the next 20 years.\u201d declared The Federal Trade Commission.\n\nBoth Android and Windows phones that let installation of malicious software that could steal personal information and that allow attackers to get complete control of victim\u2019s device (e.g. send text messages, enable microphone to record the user\u2019s phone calls). The flaws are related to customization of OSs proposed by HTC, the company preinstalled certain apps in a way that, in addition to preventing consumers from removing them, disabled the permission-based model and allowed newly installed apps to have immediate access to personal data.\n\n\u201cTo illustrate the consequences of these alleged failures, the FTC\u2019s complaint details several vulnerabilities found on HTC\u2019s devices, including the insecure implementation of two logging applications \u2013 Carrier IQ and HTC Loggers \u2013 as well as programming flaws that would allow third-party applications to bypass Android\u2019s permission-based security model. Due to these vulnerabilities, the FTC charged, millions of HTC devices compromised sensitive device functionality, potentially permitting malicious applications to send text messages, record audio, and even install additional malware onto a consumer\u2019s device, all without the user\u2019s knowledge or consent. \u201d\n\nWhen I read about Carrier IQ I remembered the clamorous case occurred in December 2011, the company produced an application capable of monitoring the use of the communication device without the user can notice it.\n\nTrevor Eckhart posted a video on YouTube to demonstrate how software from Carrier IQ recorded in real time, every action made on the handset which he had reset to factory settings prior to the test. With a packet sniffer he demonstrated that despite his device was in airplane mode each numeric tap and every text message receive were logged by the software.\n\nHaving found the application, Carrier IQ motivated the discovery citing unconvincing reasons, it declared that the distributed application is being used exclusively for remote maintenance. Officially there was no real spy intent nor the company maintains and analyzes the information gathered.\n\nThe company provided a prompt response issuing a series of patches to fix the vulnerabilities and \u201ccreating a security program that will be monitored by an independent party for the next 20 years\u201d according the revelation of The New York Times.\n\nAn HTC official spokesman announced that the company had taken all the necessary steps for troubleshooting starting to update software of some the affected mobiles.\n\n\u201cWorking with our carrier partners, we have addressed the identified security vulnerabilities on the majority of devices in the U.S. released after December 2010,\u201d Sally Julien, an HTC \u201cWe\u2019re working to roll out the remaining software updates now and recommend customers download them once available.\u201d \u201cPrivacy and security are important,\u201d the statement added, \u201cand we are committed to improving practices that help safeguard our customers\u2019 devices and data.\u201d\n\nThe accusations against the Taiwanese manufacturer are mainly related to the lack of implementation of security requirements, Lesley Fair, a senior lawyer in the commission\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection declared:\n\n \u201cHTC didn\u2019t test the software on its mobile devices for potential security vulnerabilities, didn\u2019t follow commonly accepted secure coding practices and didn\u2019t even respond when warned about the flaws in its devices.\u201d\n\nAnother disturbing question is that the bugs were known since 2011, and HTC developed software patches to fix them.\n\nThe article posted on NYT also added that:\n\n\u201cHTC\u2019s user manuals either said or implied that a user was protected against malware because of the permission-based security\u201d\n\nIn the next 30 days the commission will collect public comments on the proposed remedies after which it will decide whether to formally proceed with the the order.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happen \u2026\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/android", "topic_name": "Android"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/htc", "topic_name": "HTC"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile", "topic_name": "mobile"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mobile-security", "topic_name": "Mobile security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-federal-trade-commission", "topic_name": "The Federal Trade Commission"}]}, {"news_name": "From CISPA to Obama\u2019s executive order on national cybersecurity", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/12375/laws-and-regulations/from-cispa-to-obamas-executive-order-on-national-cybersecurity.html", "title": "From CISPA to Obama\u2019s executive order on national cybersecurity\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "February 15, 2013", "body": "During the last days worldwide internet community expressed great concern on the possibility of a reintroduction of The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection act (CISPA)  before the US House by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and ranking member Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.). The controversial cyber bill raised an heated debate, supporters believe it is an act to ensure the security of the national infrastructures meanwhile opponents sustain that it represents a threat to citizens\u2019 privacy because the act will force any company to give away all the user\u2019s data it collects if asked by the government. The decision to repeat the bill has been conditioned by recent events of cyber espionage campaign against US media agencies such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and by the cyber attacks against many US organizations and agencies such as the Federal Reserve, U.S. banking and Department of Energy. Rogers argued vigorously the necessity to take action to mitigate continuous cyber offensives against  US networks to avoid serious damages for the nation.\n\n \u201cThis is clearly not a theoretical threat \u2013 the recent spike in advanced cyber attacks against the banks and newspapers makes that crystal clear,\u201d  \u201cAmerican businesses are under siege,\u201d  \u201cWe need to provide American companies the information they need to better protect their networks from these dangerous cyber threats.  It is time to stop admiring this problem and deal with it immediately,\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about exchanging packets of information, zeroes and ones, if you will, one hundred millions times a second. So some notion that this is a horrible invasion of content reading is wrong. It is not even close to that.\u201d,  Rogers said.\n\nThe bill has been prepared to respond to needs of intelligence agencies and law enforcement to collect information on cyber attacks and data breaches to allow investigation on cyber threats and to ensure the security of networks. The bill would also allow the government to provide classified data on cyber threats to private firms, and protect them from legal action in the course of sharing private information, this is possible through voluntary sharing of Internet traffic between private companies and the authorities. The bill was supported by corporates such as Intel, Oracle, Symantec, AT&T, Facebook, IBM, Verizon, and many others, CISPA would expire after five years, and requires congressional action to be renewed. The principal concerns are related to the operations conducted by foreign governments and state sponsored hackers that pack a powerful offensive against national networks, in particular US official fear the aggressive behavior of hostile countries such as Iran and North Korea and competitors such as Russia and China. The order has arrived after cybersecurity legislation failed to pass through Congress because it was judged no suitable to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and guarantee at same time the privacy of consumer information that could be shared by companies. Many organizations of private citizens are on the warpath, the Fight for the Future, a non-profit group \u201cworking to extend the Internet\u2019s power for good,\u201d has published an online petition to express opposition to the bill. US Government is trying to sensitize population on the cyber warfare and risks related to a cyber attacks, the fear on an imminent cyber attacks against critical infrastructures is high, national cyber units and security experts have detected an intense probing of national networks by foreign states and according many specialists is just the tip of the iceberg. Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security in January warned that a \u201ccyber 9/11\u201d, which could cripple critical infrastructures such as telecommunication, water, electricity and gas, may be \u201cimminent\u201d. She argued before Congress to pass cyber bill:\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait until there is a 9/11 in the cyber world. There are things we can and should be doing right now that, if not prevent, would mitigate the extent of damage,\u201d  \n\nUnited States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has the same opinion and exposed his perplexities in various public interventions.\n\n\u201cAn aggressor nation or extremist group could gain control of critical switches and derail passenger trains, or trains loaded with lethal chemicals,\u201d  \u201cThey could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.\u201d Panetta declared.\n\nOf course Panetta is in favor of CISPA, he added:  urged that the bill should be passed \u201cto safeguard our national security.\u201d But all the world was waiting for Obama\u2019s decision, he is one of the heads of state that pay more attention to the issue of cyber security, all the worldwide IT community was waiting for a President\u2019s executive order on the matter as announced by Bloomberg\u2019s journalists, and the order was signed. The order has the primary goal to improve the network security of \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d of US, it assigns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology the responsibility of developing a framework of best practices for operators in critical sectors of the country  (e.g. industry, transportation, water and health) in the next 240 days. The Policy places at the base of the reform process the following three strategic principles:\n\nAlso Department of Homeland Security is involved in the process driving voluntary program works with various agencies for the divulgation and adoption of best practices to ensure security of infrastructures. The very nature of an executive order is a demonstration of the urgency to protect the national critical infrastructures and to implement the envisaged retrenchment against the constant attacks that daily affect the US networks. The plan is certainly ambitious and difficult to implement within the time set by the government, but it is a tangible demonstration of its commitment, the strategy needs the active support of intelligence agencies and the effort of every citizen.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cispa", "topic_name": "Cispa"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybersecurity", "topic_name": "Cybersecurity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breaches", "topic_name": "Data-breaches"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/executive-order", "topic_name": "executive order"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/federal-reserve", "topic_name": "Federal Reserve"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/obama", "topic_name": "Obama"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-hackers", "topic_name": "state sponsored hackers"}]}, {"news_name": "Have you been hacked? \u2026 you must disclose it!", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/11248/hacking/have-you-been-hacked-you-must-disclose-it.html", "title": "Have you been hacked? \u2026 you must disclose it!\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 23, 2012", "body": "During 2009 it was revealed that one of the primary defense contractor BAE Systems was hacked causing the exposure of sensible information on F-35 fighter jet. The reserved information were obtained by a group of hackers who accessed to internal server of the contractor, but BAE Systems admitted it only in 2012.\n\nThe attackers were subsequently identified as Chinese hackers, they were interested to steal the plans for the advanced vehicle, probably the stolen data have inspired the project  of Chinese stealth fighter recently presented.\n\nThe first attack occurred in 2007 but only in 2009 it was revealed when a senior U.S. defense official in Washington confirmed that hackers breached F-35 jet fighter program developed for the Pentagon by Lockheed Martin Corp. Chinese government always denied any responsibility.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the delay in divulgation of hacks could have serious consequences, in defense sector for example the lateness of public disclosure could advantage a foreign government that could benefit of information stolen in various ways. The stolen data could be used to reduce technological gap between contendents helping to successfully conduct military operations against the adversary.\n\nThe situation is destined to change, the amendment \u201cH.R. 4310: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013\u201d to the defense budget, introduced by Sen. Carl Levin, obliges defense contractors to disclose any attack suffered. Of course the amendment has attracted considerable stir and indignation of the suppliers of the government who claim to have always worked in this direction.\n\nIn effect The Pentagon\u2019s Defense Security Service already publish regularly a series of reports on the cyber attacks detected but meanwhile today denounce of hacks in the defense industry is voluntary in future it will be an obligation.\n\nUS Government is already inserting a specific clause in contracts that mandates reporting of security data breaches, the collected info could be used to prevent further attacks and to mitigate the effects of cyber threats.\n\nOf course there are also strong supporters of the amendment, many experts sustain that it has to be extended also in private business and not only to defense, the disclosure of the effects of a cyber attack could prevent further damages.\n\nMeanwhile US Government requests this effort to its contractors it has to provide same level of transparence at least within the its agencies and departments.\n\nUS government considers information as a fundamental \u201cnational asset\u201d to ensure security of nation, the sharing of proper information among agencies, departments and defense contractors could improve security level of the country.\n\nToday the sharing of information between companies and governments is very limited due the fear of private businesses to loss of competitiveness caused by the divulgation of wrong data.\n\nThe White House has issued a framework, National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding, to adopt in sharing information, the document explains the importance of data sharing:\n\n\u201cOur national security depends on our ability to share the right information, with the right people, at the right time,\u201d \u201cThis information sharing mandate requires sustained and responsible collaboration between federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and foreign partners.\u201d\n\nMurray Jennex, a cybersecurity expert and associate professor at San Diego State University, said:\n\n\u201cTo be effective, any data-sharing requirements from the government would have to include immunity from lawsuits for the information transferred\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s really what hangs up people from sharing stuff about breaches,\u201d \u201cBecause it does open them up to lawsuits, and without that relief, we won\u2019t get sharing.\u201d\n\nAn option could be the submission of information on cyber attacks and the failure of defensive measures anonymously.\n\nThe latest guidelines establish five goals,  such as the adoption of common processes, development of policies for information sharing by government entities, developing of network interoperability and shared services and data, implementation of safeguards to prevent violations of privacy and civil rights.\n\nI have found on \u201cCSO Security and Risk\u201d web site a statement that I believe crucial to understand the importance of information sharing :\n\n\u201cWhile companies and government struggle over many issues related to data sharing, cybercriminals have established highly effective underground forums and chat rooms for sharing information, experts say. This has left their targets, companies and government agencies, at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, we are obliged to fill in the gaps with the concept of sharing\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/chinese-hackers", "topic_name": "Chinese hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/data-breaches", "topic_name": "Data-breaches"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/national-asset", "topic_name": "national asset"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}]}, {"news_name": "CleanIT project, concerns for a global surveillance project", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/8802/intelligence/cleanit-project-concerns-for-a-global-surveillance-project.html", "title": "CleanIT project, concerns for a global surveillance project\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "September 21, 2012", "body": "I\u2019m just returned from the Cyber Threat Summit in Dublin, one of the most interesting European events in cyber security that gave me the opportunity to share opinion notes with expert professionals of international security context.  The event revealed an alarming scenario on the main cyber threats, no matter if it is cybercrime, hacktivism, cyber terrorism or cyber warfare, all those ambits share a worrying growth of cyber attacks that are influencing our digital lives and not only.\n\nOne of the most debated arguments is the need to protect the digital identity that is daily menaced, highlighting the need to improve cyber counter measures to protect our privacy and at same time grant a sufficient  level of security to network resources.\n\nOf course one of the most effective measures is the increasing of systems for the network monitoring, despite the resistances of internet users that claim their digital rights, many governments are implementing and deploying, in a more or less transparent, technologies for massive surveillances.\n\nNetwork appliances for massive analysis, systems for automated analysis of social networks and powerful systems for facial recognition are only few of the different solutions that many governments are deploying.\n\nToday I read a news regarding a project promoted by the European Commission to fight terrorism online that describe a wide-ranging surveillance.\n\nApparently a leaked document, published by European digital rights group EDRi revealed the possible impact on civil liberties of a project named The CleanIT that was set up to improve the exacerbate the fight against cyber terrorism.\n\nThe impact on internet users and their privacy is dramatic, let\u2019s consider that Internet Service Providers should be held liable for their operate in terms of surveillance on possible use of internet made by terrorists.\n\nIn internet are circulating two different documents that both refer CleanIT, the official one that reports only recommendations provided by the authors and the leaked one \u201cDetailed Recommendations Document.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe \u201cpublic\u201d version of the document appears quite different from the document posted by EDRi, but the project leader of the official proposal, But Klassen, declared that the leaked version was created collecting observations expressed during a debate on the project.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018recommendations\u2019 on the food for discussion document is misleading, we shouldn\u2019t have used that term. These are just ideas that we are collecting. Everything everyone says at the meeting is written down, but the public document contains the points that we have reached a consensus on,\u201d\n\nOne of the main concern is related to the recommendations to improve the monitoring of social media, platforms that are considerable great mines of information that could be aggregate to prepare \u201cany kind\u201d of analysis, just the misuse of the data collected by governments is one of the principal concern for the organizations that defend the rights of internet users.\n\nThe proposed measures are very stringent, the document states that is illegal to divulge and propose \u201cknowingly\u201d references to terrorist contents.\n\nThe proposals have with main objective the avoidance of anonymity access to web services, internet users have to be identified.\n\n\u201cCleanIT wants binding engagements from internet companies to carry out surveillance, to block and to filter (albeit only at \u201cend user\u201d \u2013 meaning local network \u2013 level). It wants a network of trusted online informants and, contrary to everything that they have ever said, they also want new, stricter legislation from Member States.\u201d\n\nThe post of EDRi group reminds that the project is financed by DG Communications Networks of the European Commission that operates without coordination limiting in sensible way the users operations on internet\n\n\u201cCleanIT (terrorism), financed by DG Home Affairs of the European Commission is duplicating much of the work of the CEO Coalition (child protection), which is financed by DG Communications Networks of the European Commission. Both are, independently and without coordination, developing policies on issues such as reporting buttons and flagging of possibly illegal material. Both CleanIT and the CEO Coalition are duplicating each other\u2019s work on creating \u201cvoluntary\u201d rules for notification and removal of possibly illegal content and are jointly duplicating the evidence-based policy work being done by DG Internal Market of the European Commission, which recently completed a consultation on this subject. Both have also been discussing upload filtering, to monitor all content being put online by European citizens.\u201d\n\nBut Klassen refuted allegations by EDRi that the project has overstepped its mandate sustaining that the team of CleanIT has to complete the final design by next March.\n\nOther Key measures being proposed for the project are:\n\nDespite governments today use systems for network monitoring with the aim of preventing criminal activities, particularly in combating terrorism, the project as shown in the leaked document represents a serious threat to freedom of thought and undermines the fundamental principles underlying the genesis of Internet.\n\nIt raises multiple perplexities such as\n\nDo we really want this?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cleanit", "topic_name": "CleanIT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-terrorism", "topic_name": "cyber terrorism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threats", "topic_name": "cyber threats"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-warfare", "topic_name": "cyber warfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-2", "topic_name": "social networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous #op_Australia, data breach and reflections on utopian privacy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/7728/hacking/anonymous-opaustralia-data-breach-and-reflections-on-utopian-privacy.html", "title": "Anonymous #op_Australia, data breach and reflections on utopian privacy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "July 27, 2012", "body": "This time target of attacks of the Anonymous group is the Australian government,  at least 10  websites were taken down to protest proposed changes to privacy laws.\n\nThe government want to force national ISP to spy on users make available their information to law enforcement and security agencies.\n\nThe Anonymous Australia collective in a mail to website news.com.au declared:\n\n\u201cThe Australian Government is attempting to strip away its citizens\u2019 internet rights by forcing them to surrender passwords and internet usage data.\n\n\u201cUnless the Government starts acting in the best interest of its people, [Anonymous] will continue to bring the noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe no longer know about many of the activities of our governments while our governments have the means to accumulate unprecedented vast banks of data about us.\n\n\u201cWhilst our own rights to privacy dwindle, corporate rights to commercial confidentiality and intellectual property skyrocket.\u201d\n\nThe Aussie branch  of the group has announced that the attacks will continue up to the bitter end to a rethinking of the competent authorities, the on line protest has been also accompanied by demonstrations in which masquerade supporters of the group protested against the law.\n\n\n\nThe changes proposed to privacy law open the door to a massive surveillance of user\u2019s profile on social networks and also to the monitoring of private email, all the collected data being stored for up to two years.\n\nIn a first time the Queensland Premier\u2019s office confirmed that attackers had hacked a range of government websites.\n\nAAPT , Australia\u2019s third largest land line telecommunications company,  has admitted that it has been hacked by Anonymous that has penetrated its network stolen 40GB of data (600k+\u201d of customer data) from the internet service provider (ISP).\n\nDespite the confirmation of the breach by AATP CEO Davis Yuile, Anonymous hasn\u2019t yet released the data stolen during an unauthorized access to AAPT\u2019s business customer data stored in the servers of Melbourne IT.\n\nRepresentatives of Anonymous announced the leak of stolen data on next Sunday noting that they will disclose personal data.\n\nThe company has quickly replied to the event starting an investigation to discover how the hackers gained access and shutting down the compromised servers.\n\nOn the first results of investigations Yuile declared:\n\n\u201cPreliminary findings suggest it was two files that were compromised, and the data is historic, with limited personal customer information. Further, the servers on which the files were stored have not been used or connected to AAPT for at least 12 months,\u201d\n\n\u201cAAPT is extremely concerned about this incident, and is treating this matter with the utmost seriousness. AAPT will be contacting any impacted customers as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAccording ZDNet removing personal data from leaked data it\u2019s dimension will be reduced from 40GB to around 35GB.\n\nThe intent of the group is to demonstrate that also the major ISPs of the country is unable to keep its own data secure, it would be unable to keep user\u2019s information secure.\n\nThe group of Anonymous is condemning the changes to privacy law proposed by governments demonstrating the inability of private companies to respond to the responsibilities assigned by new regulations.\n\nAccording ZDNet Australia Anonymous group is planning a new operations against members of parliament, the hypothesis is based on the discovery of a document containing detailed info on the private life of politicians.\n\nThe group is also considering making its own submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security over the committee\u2019s inquiry into a potential reform of Australia\u2019s national security legislation, which contains the data-retention proposal.

Let\u2019s remind the failed attempt of the German police to intercept Skype communications that also tried to catch communication using an end user Trojan commissioned to a private company.\n\n\u201cSkype interception is impossible\u201d,\n\nthat\u2019s the common creed thanks to encryption mechanisms implemented and a distributed peer-to-peer architecture, that\u2019s why  experts have always considered impossible to eavesdrop on a conversation held over Skype.\n\n\n\nLast year Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5 Billion and many experts suspected that something was changing in the architecture of the popular communication system.\n\nOne month after the acquisition Microsoft obtained a patent for \u201clegal intercept\u201d technology specific for VOIP services such as Skype. This is pure randomness? Hard to believe! The second question is:\n\nHas been the technology integrated in Skype platform?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say for sure, but the probability is really high.\n\nIn the hacker communities many voices sustain the Skype architecture has been modified to enable \u201clawful interception\u201d of calls.\n\nOf course Skype refused the charges justifying the modifies as a necessary upgrade, denying any surveillance purpose, anyway Skype PR man Chaim Haas, referring \u201ccompany policy,\u201d and industrial secrets wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny, declaring about  chat service\n\n\u201c[it] co-operates with law enforcement agencies as much as is legally and technically possible.\u201d\n\nAnalyzing Skype\u2019s privacy policy appears clear that the company is able spy on user communications communicating them to authorities under explicit request.\n\n \n\nUnder Section 3 of the privacy policy, it is stated that\n\n\u201cSkype, Skype\u2019s local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or government authority lawfully requesting such information. Skype will provide all reasonable assistance and information to fulfill this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure..\u201d\n\nUnder Section 12 it stated that\n\n\u201cYour instant messaging (IM) communications-content may be stored by Skype (a) to convey and synchronise your messages and (b) to enable you to retrieve the messages and history where possible. IM messages are currently stored for a maximum of 30 days unless otherwise permitted or required by law. Voicemail messages are currently stored for a maximum of 60 days unless otherwise permitted or required by law. Skype will at all times take appropriate technical and security measures to protect your information. By using this product, you consent to the storage of your IM communications as described above.\u201d\n\nWith 663 million registered users, Skype represents a precious mine of information, a great concentrator of communications exposed to interception.\n\nBut meanwhile we are discussing about Skype and user\u2019s privacy, another news catch my attention, Apple has pulled from its App Store an application, named Clueful,  that is able to reveal how the software installed on user\u2019s iPhones is managing his data.\n\n\n\nThe app has been developed by security firm Bitdefender and it\u2019s a valid privacy tool, the reason of the exclusion is a mystery. Bitdefender said\n\n\u201cApple informed our product development team of the removal \u2013 for reasons we are studying \u2013 after it was approved under the same rules\u201d\n\nThe application is really useful because it analyzes all the apps installed on the mobile providing detailed info on the data they manage and the way they transmit them.\n\nOfficial website reports:\n\n\u201cClueful is the only way to really understand iOS apps, how they use your private data and treat your privacy. This one-of-a-kind product identifies intrusive applications and shows you what they do behind your back.\u201d\n\nA study on 60,000 popular apps found that 42.5 per cent do not encrypt users\u2019 sensible information and don\u2019t adopt any protection mechanism for data transmission. Around 40% percent of apps can track a user\u2019s location, and almost 20% percent access the entire address book of the mobile.\n\nThe respect of user\u2019s privacy is one of the most important argument in the technological scenario, we assist to continue violations and it could be necessary the definition of a global recognized ethical code that requiring companies to provide users all information relating to your use of their data, hoping in future to avoid having to read such news.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/backdoor", "topic_name": "backdoor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy-policy", "topic_name": "privacy policy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/skype", "topic_name": "Skype"}]}, {"news_name": "Stratfor refunds clients.Concerns on subcontractors in the security chain", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6870/hacking/stratfor-refunds-clients-the-problem-of-subcontractors-in-the-security-chain.html", "title": "Stratfor refunds clients.Concerns on subcontractors in the security chain\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 29, 2012", "body": "Last Christmas the Stratfor Global Intelligence was hacked by Anonymous who disclosed company website and also the full client list of over 4000 individuals and corporations. The hacker gained access to a subscriber list stored on stratfor.com, and that list contained unencrypted credit card data.\n\nStratfor is an organization that gathers open source intelligence which markets publications for forecasting purposes, due of the confidentiality of information leaked the company will spend around $1.75 million to compensate its customers who have taken revenge with a class action.\n\nThe hacktivists of Anonymous during the attack leaked more over 200 GB of confidential data accessing to the database of the Stratfor.\n\n\n\nAnonymous exposed two lists of credit card details belonging to people who have subscribed to Stratfor services, the first one containing 3956 card details and the second one 13191 card details.\n\nIncluded in this list important names like Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller Foundation and, MF Global.\n\nMost interesting part of leaked data is composed by millions of emails that were published on the Web this year by Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks.\n\nThe data revealed uncomfortable truths, secret relationships between government\u2019s exponents, private companies and a network of informers all around the world.\n\nOf course many analysts have dissected the huge quantity of data searching for news compromising, it was revealed for example that within the stolen emails were communications between Stratfor analysts and law enforcement officers, exposing that the company\u2019s employees had contact the police to share information on the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nThe funny news is that after the hack within data leaked has been found personal datails related to around 4,000 Stratfor clients such as Bank of America, the US Defense Department and others, who had paid an identity protection service from CSID, a leading provider of global identity protection.\n\nUS District Judge Denis Hurley written an order that establish that Stratfor will have to compensate clients who subscribed to the company\u2019s updates prior to the Christmas Eve hack.\n\nStratfor does not have to admit any \u201cwrongdoing, fault, violation of law or liability of any kind,\u201d but will have to provide one month of free service to plaintiffs \u2014 a value of $29.08 \u2014 and offer an electronic copy of its publication The Blue Book, which regularly retails for $12.99. The entire settlement is expected to set the company back around $1.75 million.\n\nIn an order written by US District Judge Denis Hurley earlier this month, Stratfor will have to indemnify its clients damaged by the data breach.\n\nThe order reports that Stratfor does not have to admit any \u201cwrongdoing, fault, violation of law or liability of any kind,\u201d but will have to provide one month of free service to plaintiffs \u2014 a value of $29.08 \u2014 and offer an electronic copy of its publication The Blue Book, which regularly retails for $12.99.\n\nThe entire settlement is expected to set the company back around $1.75 million.\n\nPersonally I think the judgment is too light, there are evident liability of Stratfor, primarily the absence of encryption mechanisms for the storage of the confidential information. Another consideration on the hack, that does not bode well for the company, is the responsibility of having publicly exposed the network resources that contain valuable information, resources that are evidently not been adequately protected.\n\nObviously I think that the judgment has been weighted on the basis of reliable information that I ignore, without doubts the damage caused by the revelation of sensitive information is certainly much higher amounts of compensation.\n\nIs it consider the event as isolated or is there any danger of relapse?\n\nOf course no, government contractors and intelligence agencies are preferential targets for group of hacktivists due the sensible information that manage. The first categories, the government contractors, is characterized by another important factor that make it an excellent target for a cyber attack, usually they manage the same information of their government\u2019s clients but the mechanisms of protection of data are often absent or inadequate.\n\nThe case of HBGary Federal was emblematic, Aaron Barr, CEO of the company declared in 2010 to have collected information regarding Anonymous and its members.\n\nBarr claimed to have used intelligence techniques to infiltrate the group using principal social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter). His intention was to release information on the identities of Anonymous members at the B-Sides conference and to sell it to law enforcement.\n\n\n\nOn February 5-6, 2011, Anonymous attacked the HBGary website stolen tens of thousands of documents from both HBGary Federal and HBGary, Inc., and posted tens of thousands of emails online. The hacktivist also hacked the Barr\u2019s twitter account\n\nOf course the information disclosed was embarrassing such us the support given to the Bank of America against the intention of Wikileaks to publish compromising documents. In the case the HBGary worked with support of others security companies, Palantir and Berico Technologies.\n\nAnother example of the revealed info was the documented service provided to the U.S. Air Force to manipulate social media to spread pro-government propaganda.\n\nIn many cases the contractors make the \u201cdirty works\u201d for companies and governments managing confidential documents, and not always implement the necessary protection to preserve the sensible information. The case of HBGary represents an exception, the major part of subcontractors have no security mechanism in place to defend their data. Since now we have spoken of intelligence companies that the events demonstrated vulnerable to external attacks, but we must take in care that many contractors simply provide logistic services or similar, but in any case they manage sensible information like the references of government employees.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that subcontractors are preferred targets also for foreign governments that intend to conduct cyber espionage operations.\n\nState sponsored attacks are more dangerous because differently from a typical operation of hacktivism, are silent and perpetrated in time with dramatic consequence. A state sponsored attack is quite different also in the mode of attack that uses to adopt also targeted malware.\n\nEvent like the ones exposed must alert on the real security level ensured for the protection of confidential information, the weakest ring of the chain could compromise the overall security chain.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-security", "topic_name": "cyber security"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hbgary", "topic_name": "HBGary"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-chain", "topic_name": "security chain"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/state-sponsored-attacks", "topic_name": "state-sponsored attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stratfor", "topic_name": "Stratfor"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/subcontractors", "topic_name": "subcontractors"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/wikileaks", "topic_name": "Wikileaks"}]}, {"news_name": "#opJapan, Anonymous against Japan and its war to piracy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/6829/hacking/opjapan-anonymous-against-japan-and-its-war-to-piracy.html", "title": "#opJapan, Anonymous against Japan and its war to piracy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "June 27, 2012", "body": "A couple of days ago a read about a new amendment to copyright laws passed in Japan last week.

The Japanese Government,  has declared war to piracy and illegal downloads, the new amendment makes downloading truly punishable, it\u2019s first time that the country decide so severe penalties.\n\nAccording the data provided by the Recording Industry of Japan (RIAJ) there were around 440 million legal music downloads, and around 4400 the illegal ones.\n\nIn Japan the amendment has provoked a heated debate, the political opposition while agreeing on the need to protect the copyright does not share the law passed.\n\nToday I\u2019ve noted several tweets of Anonymous cells invoking the #opJapan, to respond to the approval of the law.\n\n\n\nFollowing some of the message published by the collective:\n\nAnonymous vs Japans copyright laws\n\nAnonymous strongly believes

classified information has been stolen.\n\nAs usually let\u2019s try to analyze the events from an independent perspective, In recent years we have assisted to a dramatic effort in the fight to piracy conducted by governments and strongly desired by content industry.\n\nThe results of this effort are poor, the piracy is still growing, sometimes sustained by the same content industry, but the typical internet users runs the risk of being limited by the execution of draconian laws and by the enforcement of absurd penalties.\n\nIn my opinion the approach is totally amiss, the implementation of surveillance mechanisms is a serious threat to freedom of expression and to the technological development.\n\nThe Japan is recognized as one of the leading countries of the IT landscape, and such a law is a striking contrast to a country that has always proposed an innovative image and whose economy is based on technological growth.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that in a similar situation, after obtained the support of government, the content industry will also ask support to the ISPs to implement these surveillance mechanisms, that is the dead of the utopian privacy.\n\nI always considered the violated privacy the principal cyber threat, it is not possible imprison a person for a download and leave unpunished corrupt politicians who are wrecking the global economy.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about these anachronistic laws, let\u2019s discuss of related approach, but not hide behind inadequate amendments , such decisions are extremely dangerous especially in conjunction with phenomena such as corruption and censorship.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/opjapan", "topic_name": "#opJapan"}, {"topic_link":

storing of massive amounts of personal data in databases in the internet, all these information composes our digital identity, our representation in the cyber space.\n\nUsers are \u201centities\u201d in the cyberspace, the correlation of data with an impressive amount of sources usually escapes the control of the owner, making easy for a bad actors to steal our digital identity.\n\nCertain personal information, even socially harmful, may be available to anyone beyond the time limits dictated by the principle of finality of the data. In the majority of the case, even if such data was deleted, they may still be accessible through storage mechanisms such as \u201ccached\u201d sources.\n\nToday tracking user activities on the Internet represent a primary interest for private companies and Government entities, business and political motivations are pushing on the development of monitoring and surveillance systems. Let\u2019s consider that monitoring implemented by many governments in situation of political dissent have had serious consequences for dissidents that have been tracked and persecuted due to the censorship\n\nThe demand of anonymity services is increased in response to the increase of network monitoring and censorship, but the anonymity is a concept that induces fear in our mind because we tend to associate it to illicit activities and cybercrimes. \n\nThis consideration is profoundly wrong, the anonymity of the user\u2019s participation on internet could be also motivated by noble arguments, such as the fight for human right to liberty of expression, avoidance of censorship, liberal promotion and circulation of the thought.\n\nThe implementation of internet filters and anonymity are closely related, whereas the filters are applied at the network in a stringent and pervasive censorship, the possibility of being able to look out on an anonymous network becomes, first and foremost, a matter exercise of fundamental rights.\n\nAnonymous communications have an important place in our political and social debate, many individuals desire to hide their identities because they are concerned about political or economic repercussion, in many cases they are exposed to concrete risks to their lives.\n\n\n\nAnonymity is derived from the Greek word anonymia, meaning \u201cwithout a name\u201d, in the common usage the term refers to the state of an individual\u2019s personal identity, or personally identifiable information, being publicly unknown.\n\nOn the Internet the anonymity is guaranteed when IP addresses cannot be tracked, due this reason it has been observed a rapid diffusion of the use of Anonymizing services such as I2P and the Tor network. The anonymizing services are based on the concept of distribution of routing information, during a transmission in fact is not known prior the path between source and destination and every node of the network manage minimal information about packet routing.\n\nThe unpredictable routing of the packets and the introduction of encryption algorithms complicate the wiretapping of the information.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has ruled repeatedly that the right to anonymous free speech is protected by the First Amendment. A much-cited 1995 Supreme Court ruling in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission reads:\n\nProtections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse. Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical minority views . . . Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society.\n\nMany institutions and foundations, such as The Electronic Frontier Foundation, are spending a great effort to protect the rights to on line anonymity.  As one court observed in a case handled by EFF along with the ACLU of Washington:\n\n\u201c[T]he free exchange of ideas on the Internet is driven in large part by the ability of Internet users to communicate anonymously.\u201d\n\nThese organizations have challenged many efforts providing financial support to the development and deployment of Internet communications system to preserve anonymous communications, a valid example is the TOR network.\n\nUS First Amendment settled that the right to speak anonymously, the Supreme Court has held,\n\n\u201cAnonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority,\u201d that \u201cexemplifies the purpose\u201d of the First Amendment: \u201cto protect unpopular individuals from retaliation\u2026at the hand of an intolerant society.\u201d\n\nCourt pronunciations establish the duty of the Government to guard against undue hindrances to political conversations and the exchange of ideas, a vigilant review that\n\n\u201cmust be undertaken and analyzed on a case-by-case basis\u201d.\n\nUS laws establish a right to Speak Anonymously on the Internet and also right to Read Anonymously on the Internet, ensuring the principle of free internet ideological confrontation and the right to free movement of information.\n\n \u201cPeople are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law. This ability to speak one\u2019s mind without the burden of the other party knowing all the facts about one\u2019s identity can foster open communication and robust debate.\u201d\n\nThe technological developments of recent years caused high attention to the legal and technological possibility to maintain the online anonymity, especially in the face of the multiplication of resources internet monitoring.\n\nThe right to internet anonymity is also covered by European legislation that recognizes the fundamental right to data protection, freedom of expression, freedom of impression. The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights recognizes in Article. 8 (Title II: \u201cFreedoms\u201d) the right of everyone to protection of personal data concerning him.\n\nThe right to privacy is now essentially the individual\u2019s right to have and to maintain control over information about him.\n\nIt may be helpful to abolish the anonymity? \n\nIn most cases not. The offenses do not become more serious for the mere fact of being committed or planned online, and therefore, there seems no real need to violate the right to anonymity online.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(Security Affairs \u2013  Anonymity, Censorship)\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymity", "topic_name": "anonymity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymizing-services", "topic_name": "anonymizing services"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrimes", "topic_name": "cybercrimes"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberspace", "topic_name": "cyberspace"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/digital-identity", "topic_name": "Digital Identity"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/government", "topic_name": "government"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/network", "topic_name": "network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/the-electronic-frontier-foundation", "topic_name": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/tor", "topic_name": "Tor"}]}, {"news_name": "Anonymous,from OpTrialAtHome to the streets,is time for changing", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/4351/cyber-crime/anonymousfrom-optrialathome-to-the-streetsis-time-for-changing.html", "title": "Anonymous,from OpTrialAtHome to the streets,is time for changing\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "April 15, 2012", "body": "Another Saturday, another round, as announced today the group Anonymous has targeted government sites to protest against British government policy. Nothing new over last week, same goals, same mode of attack, the same result. On internet bounced messages of joy for having staged the second act of the operation called by the group #OpTrialAtHome.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLet\u2019s start making some reflections on the real utility of these operations once the message was passed last week. The operation has certainly achieved its goal in terms of media, on internet the news of the attacks is published everywhere, but in terms of offense they have little effect. The sites attacked were sites of representation and not operating web site in respect of services provided.\n\nTo make further unnecessary these attacks is the choice of days and hours of action, on a Saturday evening When nobody in the Government department concerned that their website is unavailable. Deliberate choice to minimize the impact of the offense or strategy for beginners?  Or another plausible hypothesis is that these operations, that are carried out without causing real side effects, are  organized by members infiltrated the group in order to bring out the actors of the protest in a context of reduced damage.\n\nHow long the group Anonymous will go on with this strategy, unable to cause serious damage to target infrastructures?\n\nThese attacks should lead us to some reflections, I think the group is a time of transition, despite having reached a critical mass of supporters began to split into numerous cells scattered throughout the world. For now, these cells appear to be driven by common goals, but what will happen tomorrow? In a heterogeneous scenario the risk that external agents can infiltrate the group influencing policy is concrete.  New operations can be organized in the name of the group with unpredictable consequences, foreign states or law enforcement may involve masses of people and convinced unaware hacktivist to conduct ideological battles. What guarantees the group can provide to its supporters? Will the group be able to capillary check any communication made globally with its brand? Of course not!\n\nI think for this reason that the group should change its strategy, is obliged to appear in new forms, probably in the future presented itself to the world with their representatives. The time of hiding, in the form of protest could begin to decline. The group is aware that its attacks may begin to serve to a third cause, not only its own.\n\nA few hours before the announced attack time, the default GCHQ (UK Government Communications Headquarters) web page started to be re-directed down a level to:\n\nhttp://www.gchq.gov.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx\n\nAt about 18:40 GMT British Telecom , on whose servers this public website appears to be running, put a temporary 302 redirect to e.g.\n\nhttp://213.121.151.40/TPpRO/c3aba573/43de84c1/www.gchq.gov.uk/\n\ninstead of the previous IP address of http://195.171.165.115 which was advertised in the following recruiting messages of the group\n\n\n\n \n\nAt the beginning of article I had assumed that these operations could be the result of infiltration of the group, event that I believe possible in relation due the escalation promise by Anonymous against the major global companies. The Anonymous hacking collective has promised to bring down the website of Intel in protest at an anti-piracy bill that would permit the US government to strengthen security networks in the name of national security.\n\nDuring last week the collective has started the information campaign on internet promoting the DDoS attacks to propose in a first phase of the Operation called Defense. The Operation will be conduced against all those companies that support US policy involved in the support of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.\n\nOne of illustrious victims of the phase I is the Boeing, and the group has announced that  the phase II will start in a couple of weeks. The element of innovation is that the protest this time will pass from internet also to the streets. A video published on YouTube says:\n\n\u201cAttacks will not be limited to Distributed Denial of Service attacks,\u201d \u201cPhase II will commence on May 1 and will include coordinated physical protests outside locations belonging to the corporations.\u201d\n\n30 private companies have supported Cispa (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act), The bill would give the U.S. government additional options and resources to ensure the security of networks against attacks and enforce copyright and patents, this means that we will assist to a strict collaboration between businesses and government sharing cyber-security information.   Of course the line between monitoring and censorship is thin and many experts claim that the legislation contains also restraints on how and when the government may monitor private information, operating any kind of control he desires, even the shut down of source.\n\nThe list of companies and associations include top names like Intel, Boeing, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Edison Electric, Verizon Wireless, Symantec, AT&T and Comptel and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. In order to prevent the theft of government sensible information and intellectual property the CISPA give to the institutions the ability to block suspected web sites, to monitor web traffic and this is consider a war act against privacy.\n\nGroups like anonymous are obviously contrary to a law so intrusive and are angered by the support offered to the government from private industry, so the collective has already attacked company like Boeing and US Telecom with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assault by the collective. The real problem is that this type of attacks is being unuseful, the risk of addiction is high, Anonymous knows it.\n\nI believe that we must distinguish two phases of Anonymous phenomenon, the first one that I define \u201cHere I am, know me and learn to live with my judgment\u201d is the one we are leaving, in this phase the group He introduced himself to the world, showing their offensive capabilities but also a broad support enjoyed by. The second phase, named \u201cOpenness\u201d, is the one we will live in the next months, in this phase the group will tries to try to talk with institutions, will operate on internet but also in the street. The stage is very delicate because of the heterogeneous nature of the group, many hactivists will not accept the openness to institutions becoming active in a loose, loose cannons in the web that could stage striking and unethical attacks.\n\nThis is the worst scenario, the web may soon reign in the chaos and regulations such as the one under discussion certainly would not be able to govern.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/anonymous", "topic_name": "Anonymous"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cispa", "topic_name": "Cispa"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber", "topic_name": "cyber"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-attacks", "topic_name": "Cyber attacks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-espionage", "topic_name": "cyber espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-threat", "topic_name": "cyber threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cybercrime", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/ddos", "topic_name": "DDoS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/distributed-denial-of-service", "topic_name": "Distributed Denial of Service"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/optrialathome", "topic_name": "OpTrialAtHome"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/security-of-networks", "topic_name": "security of networks"}]}, {"news_name": "India, inadequate laws, wrong policies and the hazard of regression", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1698/laws-and-regulations/india-inadequate-laws-wrong-policies-and-the-hazard-of-regression.html", "title": "India, inadequate laws, wrong policies and the hazard of regression\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 16, 2012", "body": "India, a nation technologically advanced, of which we have so much discussed in recent weeks. We have discussed about the interference of its government obsessed with desire to control private citizens, and every company operating in the domestic market. All is started with the Symantec case, the well-known manufacturer of security systems, victim of an attack to the Indian military systems that guarded the code of some of its products. Why Indian Forces possessed the source code of the Symantec popular products? The answer is simple, the government seems to have imposed an agreement to the company that would provide the opportunity to dispose and to inspect any component of the products, including sources code. The reasons are obviously related to national security requirements. However, as events have shown, to this government request has not been paid with a proper professionalism in the management of valuable information.\n\n\n\nIt is of course only the tip of the iceberg. A few days later, in internet were available some confidential documents of the Indian Government that confirm the invasive behavior against companies which are required to offer every kind of support for surveillance and monitoring activities. It is happened with the project RINOA in which it would seem that the Indian authorities have asked to the three giants RIM, Nokia and Apple to provide a backdoor for remote control of their devices.\nThis triggered some controversy for the uncompromising attitude of a government that seeks to ensure the safety of its citiziens with a fine-grained control of the population. But let\u2019s not forget a crucial aspect, India suffers significantly corruption, and monitoring actions such as those we are discussing pose serious consideration about a possible censorship behaviour.\n\nUnfortunately, those stories are not isolated incidents but a deliberate policy of a government that can hardly be shared. Obviously, the same government came early in the friction with the main suppliers of technological services such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo. Initially they were asked, in the absence of national legislation, to provide all the tools to exercise detailed control of the major social media and search engines, after the indian government has decided to regulate, from a legislative point of view, the work of those companies.\nWhat worries is that recently the Indian government granted its approval to criminally prosecute companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo for publishing objectionable contents.\n\nThe Delhi High Court has decided to procede against these companies, starting the criminal trial for diverse offenses under Indian laws. The indian law will oblige the central management of companies to appear at hearings. Now the Delhi Istitutions can also prosecute these parent companies after the sanction has been received.\n\nIf the rappresentant of the companies do not appear there will be serious repercussions on the final assessment. The information technology amendment act 2008 (IT Act 2008) is the principal cyber law in India, but its inadequacy to legislate on this issues, and it is the basis of all misinterpretations made \u200b\u200bby the government.\n\nThis mode of legislate demonstrates the inadequacy of a nation in addressing important issues such as regulation of social media. These forms of censorship may lead to a regression of the nation itself, the forms of communication are in fact an essential element for the development of the country and this government interference can only harm to social texture.\n\nFrom a strictly economic point of view, in spite of any tax benefits and the availability of highly qualified personnel at competitive costs, a policy so intrusive and oppressive is not an attraction for foreign capital and companies. At the same time just the intellectual heritage of the nation has an incentive to leave the nation in search of countries where freedom of expression is guaranteed.\nIf the Indian government will not change policy soon will face problems that are not prepared to resolve with catastrophic consequences.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/apple", "topic_name": "Apple"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/laws", "topic_name": "Laws"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-media", "topic_name": "social media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/surveillance", "topic_name": "surveillance"}]}, {"news_name": "The strategic importance of censorship in search engines", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/1273/intelligence/the-strategic-importance-of-censorship-in-search-engines.html", "title": "The strategic importance of censorship in search engines\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "January 3, 2012", "body": "Every day, billions of people making an unimaginable number of searches through search engines. Complex algorithms seek to recover in the shortest possible time and with greater sorrowfulness the requested information. We may venture that a good 80% of Internet users interact with the web through these powerful applications. But the engines are much more, they are true and proper systems for the analysis of user behavior, they practically know every thing about us. Forecasting systems and relationships engine have been developed to improve the searches to be able to guide the user during the navigation. Easy to understand how important are search engines in a digital environment, they are an inprescindibile element that accompanies each user in their research.\n\nOf course, as always, we must take in care the compromises that any technology solution offers. In the case of search engines who guarantees that the proposed results are not deliberately manipolated some for reasons that may be the most different?\n\nIn some cases the results of a search are affected by various government related factors, and some specific information can be excluded from them. The suppression may be local to a country, or global to all search enfine results.\n\n\n\nThe exclusion of results has been documented in the past, very interesting is the report Localized Google search result exclusions which investigated certain web material banned in various countries.\n\nIt is contemporary history the practice of a form of censorship through the digital manipulation of search results of major search engines. It \u2018happened for example in China, where the government has imposed filters in online searches made \u200b\u200bthrough the engine Google. Regarding the Chinese situation Schmidt, CEO of Google, has declared:\n\n\u201cWe made a very controversial decision to enter China to Few years ago, and we have to follow by that their law,\u201d\n \u201cTheir law does require a very precise form of omission or censorship around certain things, I know for example the Falun Gong is omitted. But we did something very unusual for China: When we omit something in an answer, we also tell if the Chinese surfer that information was omitted. You can imagine if you\u2019re a Chinese citizen and you see that you\u2019ll be doing what information with that. \u201c\n\n\u201cWe are subject to Chinese law, which effectively obviously we are opposed to,\u201d he says. \u201cThe decision ultimately that we came to China with was that it was better to engage rather than be estranged. The Chinese citizens will eventually rebel over some of these \u2013 in our view \u2013 idiotic restrictions, because they are now aware of them. They now know that information is withheld from being theme by law and those that will be laws overturned from public pressure over time. \u201c\n\nEasy to understand how in the name of the business big companies like Google must bow to the interference of governments in order to continue to operate freely in the host country.  In 2002 all the references to Google in China were even re-routed to Baidu, a China-based search engines, this means that every time a users in China entered Google.com, they would end up on Baidu.cn, who benefited from Google\u2019s marketing and name recognition of it competitor.  The economic impact was devastating for Google, its market share to third risusse is to the benefit of its competitors who reached the 70% point of the internal market and the revenues began to climb the adjacent markets such as Japan. It is impossible to compete with such interference and it is understood as a private company can really little. I understand from a business point of view the response of the serach engine companies in reaction to government law or government pressure but I believe that it must change and to this we need a strong collaboration beetwen governemte and service providers of all the world.\n\nAccording to Smith companies like Google have just to inform the public about the censorship practiced but not openly take sides against any government decision. In countries where human rights are daily violated, these assertions thunder as a fully support to dictatorial policies that use of censorship to stifle dissent in the bud.\n\nThis censorship applied in country like China suppresses any writings and media that express dissent against the central government, hiding related materials in search engine results. We are facing with a serious violation of human rights in the name of the business.  Consider that obscuring operations are used by governments not to enforce copyright restrictions, but to impose a raw censorship of political or religious material that is considered to be offensive.\n\nIt is clear that so far Google has been discussed and cases related to it since the engine is the main player in the world and having a lot of information available for it. The situation is quite common to all major search engines, even in this there is to say that Google is one ofthe same companies that seek to implement policies in the name of transparency.\n\nThe consorship proccess it not so easy for different reason. First of all there is the concrete risk to fail to produce reliable search results. Consider the every time a content is banned all its references have been impacted. Countries with greater censorship might produce lower quality search engines, but primary companies like Google and Microsoft, can avoid this problem accessing to uncensored data and mitigating the indirect effects of censorship. Search engines are of high interest to censors, but cannot sensibly be held responsible the several billions of pages present in Internet.\n\nThe market for search engines is in fact an oligarchy in which the risk of cartel agreements is very high.\n\nWanting to deepen the discussion of censorship by governments point out the two projects,monitoring of the Internet and restrictions imposed:\n\nIn particular I found very interesting results produced by the second of the two portals. It contains data related to the \u201canomalies\u201d in accessing the network. These issues are analyzed using different axes of analysis, such as geographic location and type of intervention performed (eg political, social, conflict / security, Internet tools). The information is produced with detailed reporting that goes along with maps that make it attractive graphical representation of the phenomena.\n\n\n\nAs you can see the situation in countries such as China and beyond, is truly alarming. Internet is used as an instrument of government propaganda and censorship as a gag to everyvoice of dissent.\n\nWe must consider free internet access as a fundamental human right in cyberspace, recently, the United Nations declared \u201cRight to Access\u201d to Internet as Human Right. For instance, right to speech and expression, right to privacy, right to know, etc cannot be violated by any CMS Project. United Nations must expand Human Rights Protection to many more issues considering anyone of this violations.\n\nDon\u2019t forget also that censorship can be placed also for business purpose. Sometimes for example local businesses that fear foreign competition and will work to hide those company web site from search engines results.  It is happened for in China where Google China block searches relating to the French hypermarket chain Carrefour to advantage a local business.  It has no sense to promote human freedom closing the eyes on corruptions events, on the direct correlation that there is between corruption and policy to implement detailed traffic filtering.\n\nIn fact, then how can we combat these forms of censorship?\n\nFirstly it is crucial that global recognition of a single rule before which should not be allowed exceptions. I realize that the road is really difficult but it is the only truly viable. Those who apply censorship must be sanctioned, and particularly affected economically. Any clear violation must be unanimously condemned. Today the situation is too jagged, with sometimes very different approaches.

It was a long discussion on the subject, many theorists and groups of hackers are working on solutions of various kinds, but they really are in the high seas due to the refusal of government support and non-availability of adequate budgets.\n\nLike user we have to make the same pression on those companies.

Winds of war, many swear that the next conflict could involve the much disputed nation. That something has changed in recent weeks is palpable, the Tehran government has used more than one occasion events such as the capture of alleged U.S. drone for propaganda purposes. Are we facing with the usual skirmishes of an unprepared government trying to intimidate opponents or behind so much ostentation, there is a real capacity to fear? We try to put together the pieces of a complex puzzle that can make a realistic and objective picture of threat to Iran.\n\n\n\nCertainly the central government, including the strategic importance of the issue cyber warfare, has allocated huge investment as stated by the newspaper \u201cThe Jerusalem Post\u201c, which suggested a figure of around one billion dollars to offensive and defensive cyber increase both capabilities. The investment in advanced cyber capabilities seem to be proved by an investigative report produced by Univision which contains alarming footage of Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri discussing the use of cyber attacks targeting the FBI, CIA, White House, and nuclear power plant systems in the United States. Fearing cyber attacks from Iran, the Israeli government has arranged a specific cyber group that will be responsible for improving Israeli defenses. Do not forget that the Israeli and U.S. governments are among the main suspects in the case Stuxnet, malware designed to attack SCADA systems present in some plant of Iran, the first real cyber weapon.\n\nIran is changing its cyber defense model, it has been announced by the Head of Iran\u2019s Passive Defense Organization giving high priority to the management of potential potential cyber attacks. Inside the Defence Organizzation it has been established a cyber command center who is responsible to guarantee internal cyber security being able also to produce defense hardware and software.\n\nBrigadier General Gholam-Reza Jalali rejected media and researcher conviction that the computer viruses Stuxnet and Duqu have successfully affected Iranian nuclear plants. It also have declared that Iran IT researchers specialized in malware analysis have studied this malware. Are they trying to reproduce a similar weapon? Considering their investments in cyber warfare I believe that they have the knowledge to reproduce similar malware and I found this really worrysome considering also the level of protection implemented for several critical infrastructures all over the world. I believe that western countries are really not prepared to similar events. It\u2019s really hard to secure delocalized structures exposed to several threats, and the cases of the Water facility in Illinois and the Hospital in Georgia have demonstrated what I\u2019m saying.\n\nAnother important signal provided by Iran in recent days has been the transfer of the hosting sites of more than 90 percent of Iran\u2019s governmental internet sites inside the country according the announcement of Ali Hakim Javadi, Iran\u2019s deputy minister for communications and information technology, to the official IRNA news agency. Consider that more than 30,000 Iranian websites of key organizations had been hosted by foreign-based companies, mainly in North America, the data of which could have been exposed to danger at any moment. This transfer has been judged vital for protecting governmental information preserving data to intentional exposures. This confirm the importance given to preside the cyber space, and this measure is considered very effective to avoid sites hacking from external attacker and also it can restrict physical accessibility to the computers that store sensible data.\n\nFor a complicated situation, characterized by high tension between Iran and the United States added more disturbing elements to take into account:\n\nChairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey says that the US military is ready to launch a military strike against Iran if necessary.\n\nSame opinion has the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta that confirmed that \u201cno options were off the table\u201d regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nGeneral Dempsey also said:\n\u201cMy biggest worry is that it may miscalculate our resolve. Any miscalculation could mean that we are drawn into conflict and that would be a tragedy for the region and the world,\u201d \nand that the United States is collaborating with Israel in its intelligence gathering about Iran.\n\nThe imperative is not to lower our guard, actually investing in the development of a cyber strategy to deal with the threat. We haven\u2019t be involved in an obsessive research of an enemy at all costs. History teaches that every conflict has a cost for the community and the real benefits are for the exclusive advantage of those companies close to governments deliberately aggressive. The conflicts are driven by fierce economic interests.\n\nNews of the day:\n\nBritain, which closed its embassy in Tehran last month after it was ransacked by protesters, said on Thursday that Iranian authorities had blocked its website aimed at Iran.\n\nWhat will happen tomorrow?\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nhttp://securityaffairs.co/wordpress\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/conflict", "topic_name": "conflict"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacktivism", "topic_name": "Hacktivism"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/iran", "topic_name": "Iran"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}]}, {"news_name": "The thin line between monitoring and censorship", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/802/intelligence/the-thin-line-between-monitoring-and-censorship.html", "title": "The thin line between monitoring and censorship\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 20, 2011", "body": "During the last year we have seen the consolidation of the tendency to use social media as a major vector for the exchange of information. The imperative is to be social, no matter if you need to share photos with friends or to express an opinion on a topic of social interest. Over the past year a large number of protests have been conducted through the major social networking platforms from Twitter to Tacebook, because they have an extraordinary power amplifiers media that is able to reach an audience of planetary with a simple click.\n\n\n\nThese considerations are, however, are well known to governments across the world in a more or less declared are confronting these new tools. The approach has been wrong, in my opinion, having raised the issue in too much control, monitoring, instead of listening connentrarsi global sentiment to guide their political choices.\n\nSocial media are designed as new fields of battle, you are thought of as a pawn in a chess board that must be constantly monitored and if necessary excluded from the mediatic circulation when they exceed the exposition of concepts unpopular to governments. Be committing a serious error if we considered only the problem of some realities such as China or Egypt. In various ways and in varying measure all states are equipped to carry out a more or less closely control of the media and of Internet in general. For goodness sake, do not call it censorship looking journalistic bombastic titles, but we must surely reflect on what happening. I will try soon to propose some objective data in order to allow the reader to understand in what direction we are moving forward.\n\nFew days ago I have read a news regarding the Russia approach to the affair. They desire to improve a Chinese-style government regulation of the Internet, a top official said Wednesday, after election protesters organised nationwide rallies through social networking sites.\n\u201cAttempts to stop people communicating are in principle counterproductive and even immoral. But we cannot ignore the use of the Internet by criminals and terrorist groups,\u201d Russia\u2019s Security Council chief Nikolai Patrushev said in an interview with Argumenty i Fakty newspaper.\n\u201cOf course there should be reasonable regulation in Russia, just as it is done in the United States, China and many other countries.\u201d\n\nTranslating Russia intent, they are planning to release a massive monitor system that will be used to control internet usage of a Nations that in September became the European country with the largest number of Internet users, according to Comscore ratings agency, and the use of blogs and social networking sites has boomed in recent years.  Do you not find the news disturbing? Is it correct to operate in this way to ensure national security?\n\nChina as a model to follow, in which the plenum of the Communist Party in October, decided to put under the protection the Republic from \u201cimmoral TV \u2018network and from the mother of the disorders, internet.\nIn a previous post we discussed about the father of all the censorship project, \u201cThe Golden Shield\u201c, a system used to\nobscure sites with objectionable content, filtering every sort of network traffic and with whom he has had to confront even the giant \u201cSina Weibo\u201d, the Chinese version of Twitter, banned in the country since August 2009. \u201cSina Weibo\u201d is a colossus that can post 400 million of views, including those responsible for the boom of the Web in China: more than 500 million Internet users, Internet users the world record in the country that invests more nell\u2019ocuramento the Net.  The \u201cPeople\u2019s Daily\u201d, the official organ of the party has released a document in which the plenum concluded on October 18 launched a plan to control and management of social networks and instant messaging services requesting that all Chinese Internet users must be scheduled to internet access. It is in fact an offensive against the microblog, considered the weapon of the last Mediterranean and revolutions in China to escape state control.\n\nLet give a look to what is happening in India where the Minister Kapil Sibal seeks to censor User-Generated Content Online using humans to screen content and not technology, he said after a meeting with officials from Facebook, Google, YouTube and Yahoo on Monday, 5 December 2011.\nThis is a dangerous scenarios, Internet in India is under threat of censorship and e-surveillance. The Government has increased e-surveillance activities to intolerable limits. In first time the Government proposed central monitoring system (CMS) project of India without any parliamentary oversight, after the development of an Internet kill switch also given by India without public consent.\n\nVarious official reasons, the same intent. The United States joined to the common direction proposing the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) that is seriously undermining the principle of freedom of expression. The SOPA is a bill introduced on October 26, 2011 to the U.S. House of Representatives. If approved as proposed, would allow copyright holders to the U.S. to take direct action to prevent the spread of protected content. Imagine the potential impact of the legislation? To this info add the certainty that Cia and FBI use to monitor social network for any kind of investigation.\n\nThis few examples are enough to cover over half the worldwide internet users and to show how tenuous is the line between control and monitoring for safety and the imposition of a brutal censorship.  Needless to illusions, each surfer is now controlled and we need to take in serious consideration also the actions made by large corporations which are building what I call the \u201cprivate cansorship\u201d asserved to government orders. You can access to social platform, share videos, publish comment on a forum \u2026 but be aware to not violate any rule of conduct otherwise you can have an hugly surprise \u2026 your account could be disabled in the same time on differen social media. Try to believe!\n\nObviously the speech deserves more spacious than a few lines in this blog. Personally, I feel obliged to some reflection. I agree on the need for a cyber strategy that will undoubtedlyalso provide mechanisms for monitoring social media, but this does not justify the actions of censorship that can not be tolerated by a civilized society based on freedom of expression.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/media", "topic_name": "media"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring", "topic_name": "monitoring"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social", "topic_name": "Social"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}]}, {"news_name": "Carrier IQ, the privacy of millions of users has been violated", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/600/cyber-crime/carrier-iq-the-privacy-of-millions-of-users-has-been-violated.html", "title": "Carrier IQ, the privacy of millions of users has been violated\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 14, 2011", "body": "In recent weeks we have learned of a dialer able to track our movements, spy on our communications, read our SMS \u2026 the privacy of millions of users has been violated!  A disturbing application, multi-platform, which had not been reported previously.\nThe news is troubling because it puts into serious consideration the privacy rights of the citizen and the need to inform himself of any tracking operations.\nThe manufacturer that produced the application is the Carrier IQ and its software is capable of monitoring the use of the communication device without the user can notice it.\n\nTrevor Eckhart has posted a video on YouTube to demonstrate how software from Carrier IQ recorded in real time, every action made on the handset which he had reset to factory settings prior to the test. With a packet sniffer while he has demonstrated that his device was in airplane mode each numeric tap and how every text message is logged received by the software.\n\nIt would seem that is the software used to operate able silently for which reason he wassingled out by the developer as a rootkit software that enables continued to privileged access to computers to whilea ctively hiding from ITS presence administrators by subverting standard operating system functionality or other applications.\n\nHaving found the application, Carrier IQ is running for cover the event citing unconvincing and stupid reasons, declaring that the distributed application is being used exclusively for remote maintenance. There is no real spy intent nor the company maintains and analyzes the information gathered.\n\nHere you are the statement made \u200b\u200bby Carrier IQ:\n\nWe measure and summarize performance of the device to assist Operators in delivering better service.\nWhile a few individuals have identified that there is a great deal of information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS messages, email, photographs, audio or video. For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen.\n\nToo late I would say! The credibility of the company is to a minimum.\n\nBut let\u2019s do, from a neutral point of view, some simple reflection:\n\n\u201cToo many doubts and questions rightful us through your head. The shadow of big brother who once again tried to control, spying on citizens going well beyond their means.\u201d This is the thought of those who support the conspiracy theory, the super partis power able to agree to hardware manufacturers and software and to distribute an application silently so dangerous.\n\nSpeaking at a Google-hosted conference on internet freedom in the Hague, Google CEO, Mr Eric Schmidt has condemned Carrier IQ saying: \u201d Google\u2019s smartphone operating system, which runs on the majority of smartphones sold today, is an \u201copen\u201d platform, there was nothing his firm could do to restrict Carrier IQ\u2019s software.\u201d \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t work with them,\u201d said Mr Schmidt, describing the software as a \u201ckeylogger\u201d.\n\nDo you believe him?  As if that was not enough the Privacy issue continues today with a new regarding the FBI position on this case.  Apparently the FBI was aware of what the Carrier IQ technology is able to do, and the Bureau is not willing to reveal anything regarding Carrier IQ. The FBI denies the release of information about their use of Carrier IQ, consider also the position of Government watchdog site MuckRock believes Carrier IQ data is being used by the FBI in an investigation.\n\n \n\nMuckRock sent an Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI, asking for \u201cmanuals, documents or other written guidance used to access or analyze data gathered by programs developed or deployed by Carrier IQ.\u201d That FOIA request was met with what MuckRock called a \u201ctelling denial.\u201d\n\nLet me conclude with a personal account:\nWhat happened is very serious. I think it useless to discuss freedom of expression when I read about this news.\nCompounding my perception of the incident are considerations of a technical nature, having worked in the field of telephony and having a particular experience in the mobile devices. I hope that there are no involvement of governments and of the manufacturers themselves.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/carrier-iq", "topic_name": "Carrier IQ"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/fbi", "topic_name": "FBI"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/privacy", "topic_name": "privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/smartphones", "topic_name": "smartphones"}]}, {"news_name": "India The blurred line between defense and cyber censorship", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/523/cyber-crime/india-the-blurred-line-between-defense-and-cyber-censorship.html", "title": "India The blurred line between defense and cyber censorship\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 11, 2011", "body": "In this article I wish to bring to your attention what I regard as gross contradiction of a nation whose people I admire for their professionalism and dedication to work, India. In my previous article \u201cCyber India\u201d lights and shadows of the country full of contradictions I presented a picture of the nation in terms of cyberwarfare, nation aware of the threat that is fighting against many internal difficulties. It is preparing to adopt measures to strengthen its position in cyber space. Just as I was writing, confirming that which has been described related the potential threat looming, a disturbing news has been published on the web:\n\nChina hacked India\u2019s intel network: Assange\n\nWhat\u2019s happen? China hacked India\u2019s intelligence network and the West intercepted mails and phone calls from India, that\u2019s Wikileaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s stunning disclosures at HT Leadership summit.\n\nJulian Assange said, \u201cTelephone connections and e-mails from India that go through the Pacific (Ocean) can be intercepted and are being intercepted by the West. The information acquired from their intercepts are used as economic intelligence.\u201d\n\nHe also says that:\n\n\u201cChinese intelligence penetrated into the intelligence system of the Indian government including the Indian equivalent of FBI, the Central Bureau of Investigation,\u201d\n\n\u201cInformation on foreign bank accounts held by Indians will come out within the next year,\u201d\n\nThis event, as you can imagine, can be really dangerous for economic stability of India and for its reputation. Of course we are free to believe or not the statements of Assange, always at the center of fierce debate, however, the problem referred is real.\n\nWe are faced with a Nation that is going to play a crucial role in the global economic arena in the coming decades, but that is totally unprepared for events like this before.  To be honest, India is beginning to worry about managing the cyber threat, but probably not in the best way.\n\nThe Information Security and Analysis Center (ISAC) has initiated efforts to enlist the best and brightest among India\u2019s ethical hackers in an effort shore up the nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture. India is also looking to establish itself as a global leader in addressing cyber security issues. In October, Indian Communications & Information Technology Minister Shri Kapil Sibal and the EastWest Institute (EWI) hosted the Third Worldwide Cybersecurity Summit in New Delhi,India.\n\n\u201cTo combat cyber crimes and make the cyberspace secure, there is a need for greater government-to-government collaboration on sharing of information, global vision to deal with hackers, legal framework that addresses the requirements at the global, and wider public-private collaboration,\u201d said Sibal.\n\nThe \u201cNew Delhi Summit Process,\u201d is composed of three high-level working groups comprised of Indian and international experts. To each group is assigned specific cybersecurity issues:\n\nExcellent you say. Fully shared the approach of the Government. But while I\u2019m congratulating with them a news has appalled me.\n\nIndian Minister Kapil Sibal seeks to censor User-Generated Content Online. How he will do it? Using humans to screen content and not technology, he said after a meeting with officials from Facebook, Google, YouTube and Yahoo on Monday, 5 December 2011.\n\n\n\nHe asked them to screen what goes on the sites. Internet censorship in India should not be a norm in a democratic country like India. Censorship of internet is bypassing the constitutional mandates amount to anarchy that should not be the norm in India.\n\nInternet in India is under potential threat of censorship and e-surveillance. Internet censorship and e-surveillance in general in India have increased to intolerable limits.\n\nIn first time the Government proposed central monitoring system (CMS) project of India  without any parliamentary oversight, after the development of an Internet kill switch also given by India without public consent. Hey \u2026 but a Internet kill switch and censorship action are not a solution to cyber threats.  I\u2019m not surprise if what Assange have declared is really happened.\n\nWhat is more worrisome is that e-surveillance and Internet censorship systems in India have increased without any lawful interception law in an unconstitutional manner.  To worsen the situation Internet intermediaries in India have been asked to analyze and monitor contents before they are posted on their platforms. India wants companies like Google and Facebook to censor users\u2019 contents.\n\nThe government seems hasn\u2019t understood where the cyber threat came from and this could lead to unnecessary distractions and a delay in the homogeneous development of the Country.\nGentlemen attention, the threat is elsewhere! In this way you are fighting only the privacy of the citiziens!\n\nThey are watching in the wrong direction!\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/defense", "topic_name": "defense"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/google", "topic_name": "Google"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "The utopian privacy", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/469/digital-id/the-utopian-privacy.html", "title": "The utopian privacy\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 7, 2011", "body": "Are you able to imagine a world in which everybody is free to communicate without being intercepted, spied on, tracked?

Then came Skype with video with this powerful tool we can communicate, share files, chat in the absolute belief of many that it can not be intercepted.\n\nWake up. \u201cThey\u201d control us, \u201cThey\u201d control our children, \u201cThey\u201d listen to our communications and read our mail, \u201cThey\u201d know our movements.The statements may appear strong, paranoid, but \u201cTheir\u201d interference goes beyond the imagination. But who do I mean by \u201cthey\u201d? \u201cThey\u201d are our own Governments that drive the adoption of technological means of which require control. Check the network, censor content, intercept the threats.They continuous try to impose any kind of control using laws and formal Act, inviting ISP to trace our data and Telecom Operator to register our communications.\n\nBut what are the real causes of such interference?\n\nThere are two main reasons,\n\nThis second intent is the most dangerous, and even those two reasons are overlapped. Too often in the name of national security is abused to exercise control, unfortunately for private purposes. It \u2018happened to us in Italy, it is common practice in many industrialized countries.\n\n\n\nCarrierIQ scandal, a company that would have deployed on an unspecified number of mobile phones of different brands and models, a silent app able to spy on customers. After reporting of the researcher Trevor Eckhart we have observer tepid denials from CarrierIQ, and the emergence of an uncomfortable truth. The citizens are being spied on. I would like to believe that the producers were unaware of what the device does, but I am skeptical. Who is behind this, and in situations like these how they mediate the exposure? Government simply denied any reference, any involvement of the majors firms, to impute guilt to a small company to be dismantled and provide a remedy to eliminate the spy agent. But what actually install on the devices when they initiate the removal of the app? who knows. The same app works at a very low level, a sort of backdoor and it is developed to be multi-platform. But how much will cost? It has been argued that the costs are certainly not insignificant, and above the primary business of the same company, so why spy the citiziens?\n\nQuestions to which no response can be provides.\n\nAnother case was related to Skype flaws that can be used to track the final user, localizing its position in a simple way. The news came after that some months ago the \u201cThe Chaos Computer Club\u201d hacker group have discovered that the German Government  is in possibly to intercept Skype call for investigations.\n\nWe Could Go on for hours quoting Chinese censorship technology through the implementation of the \u201cGolden Shield\u201d project, introducing such events as the daily Tender Called by the Russian government to build a network monitoring system.\n\nFinally we discuss the social network platforms used to control people and relationships, and, unfortunately, to try and direct the sentiment of generations on issues of social interest, that I think the more subtle form of interference, and I call \u201cpsychological interference.\u201d\n\nThe situation is complex, impossible to manage, because of the enormous interests at stake. We discuss the control of information, access to information in a privileged way primary, before it can be manipulated.\nFrankly, I have no hope, \u201cThey\u201d will push more and more to have total control over the individual, hacking their minds, and this perhaps simply implanting a chip while we vaccinate against another pandemic created in the laboratory .\nWe are children of the era in the concept of privacy has been alienated. No one is safe from prying eyes.\n\nWhat shall we do?\n\nCarrier IQ Cellular Phone Intelligence Software Training Materials\n\nGerman government\u2019s Skype spying tool has holes, hackers say\n\nCyber-war law would expose customer privates to spies\n\nFacebook Flaw Exposed Private Photos\n\nThe Truth About Facebook Privacy\u2014if Zuckerberg Got Real\n\nSkype Flaw Reveals Users\u2019 Location, File-Downloading Habits\n\nhttp://spyfiles.org/\n\nE-Corruption \u2026 \u201cwho controls the controller?\u201d\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/carrier-iq-data-vacuum/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isp", "topic_name": "ISP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}]}, {"news_name": "\u201cCyber India\u201d lights and shadows of the country full of contradictions", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/405/cyber-crime/%e2%80%9ccyber-india%e2%80%9d-lights-and-shadows-of-the-country-full-of-contradictions.html", "title": "\u201cCyber India\u201d lights and shadows of the country full of contradictions\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 5, 2011", "body": "The Economy of India is the ninth largest in the world by nominal GDP and the fourth largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).\n\nThe country is a part of the G-20 major economies, Goldman Sachs predicts that \u201cfrom 2007 to 2020, India\u2019s GDP per capita in US$ terms will quadruple\u201d, and that the Indian economy will surpass the United States (in US$) by 2043, this are only forecast but give us an idea of the \u201cIndia Power\u201d.\n\nIn a scenario characterized by good auspices some shadows stain the incredible growth that has:\n\nObviously we in the West we have a completely different perception of the India nation and in particular as regards aspects of cyberwarfare we consider India an advanced country that can influence the cyber balances.\n\nBut which is the state of the Cyber Warfare Defense And Security Of India? I\u2019m trying to answer based on my experience and comparing it with the reality described by some by some illustrious colleagues, all of a Priyanka Sharma, Owner, Cyber Laws In India Portal.\n\nIndia is increasingly targeted for cyber espionage, cyber warfare, cyber terrorism, but its response to the same is not so energic. Consider that the India haven\u2019t still formulated a cyber warfare policy and, as usual, the word cyber security, in the Country has no meaning. This is same problem shared with a lot Countrys, awareness and threats perception has low level. There is no cyberspace crisis management plan for a Nation that has been envolved in the main criminal cyber attacks of the last months, from Stuxnet to Duqu.  The scenario is so critical that NATO has requested stronger cooperation with India to counter growing cyber threats,  due the growing attacks are addressing Indian critical infrastructure. Even the cyber law of India needs many suitable amendments as it has become outdated.\n\nIndia, like my dear Italy, need a strong political commitment to approach this critical topic.  The government has to much battle to fight with many objective responsibilities. This is resulted in sidelining of cyber law and cyber security issues and this is not acceptable for a country like India whom cyberspace is actually vulnerable to any kind of attack.\n\nThe Nation isn\u2019t ready to respond to cyber attacks, Indian defense and security against cyber warfare is missing. What puzzles me is that if a major player in the global economy is so far behind on the cyberwafare front, which are the dangers that threaten the economics objectively lame and at default risk such as Greece, Portugal and the same Italy ? Too much High, I reply!\n\nThe good new is that India is that today India have of the most populated workforces of young generation in the world that must be trained providing them ethical hacking skills developments that government must encourage and subsidize. The same goes for law enforcement agencies that must be formed on cyber law issues. Presently cyber law and cyber crimes cases and not taken up by Indian police. In this direction some firms are moving, like Perry4Law that is the First and Exclusive Techno-Legal ICT Law Firm of India and one of the few in the World. It has already open the exclusive techno legal e-learning platform/virtual campus for courses like cyber law, cyber forensics, cyber security, etc for various stakeholders. Other similar initiatives may also be in pipeline.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe importance of the India is such that a must be developed a comprehensive policy to address the cyber threat in cooperation with major countries who have devoted more attention to the problem.\n\nObviously it is impossible to push on this front before being able to stem the problems listed at the beginning of this article, corruption and social inequality.\n\nTo pass this difficulties I think is critical to leverage the combination of:\n\nI close my post with a bitter consideration \u2026 industrialized countries such as Italy, unfortunately, are now back again on the front of cyber security and cyber warfare, and efforts requested to countries like India should be an example \u2026 but I doubt it happens.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nSpecial thanks to Priyanka Sharma (Owner, Cyber Laws In India Portal)\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/18561-Indias-ISAC-to-Recruit-Army-of-White-Hat-Hackers.html\n\nhttp://www.ptlb.in/\n\nhttp://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/11018451-cyber-warfare-defense-and-security-of-india\n\nhttp://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/11018743-cyber-warfare-against-indian-infrastructures\n\nhttp://icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2007/october/1014.pdf\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India#cite_note-IMF_GDP-0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cia", "topic_name": "CIA"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-weapon", "topic_name": "cyber weapon"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyberwarfare", "topic_name": "cyberwarfare"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/duqu", "topic_name": "duqu"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/incident", "topic_name": "Incident"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/india", "topic_name": "India"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-networks-social-network-security-large-scale-infiltration-socialbots-botnets", "topic_name": "Social Networks ; Social Network Security ; Large-scale Infiltration ; Socialbots ; Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/socialbots", "topic_name": "Socialbots"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/stuxnet", "topic_name": "stuxnet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/trojan", "topic_name": "Trojan"}]}, {"news_name": "Assange, Spy Files and uncomfortable truths", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/346/digital-id/assange-spy-files-and-uncomfortable-truths.html", "title": "Assange, Spy Files and uncomfortable truths\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "December 2, 2011", "body": "If we talk about security which could be our worst nightmare?

The documents describe how the police is able to access to Facebook user information or to the services provided by companies such as AOL and Microsoft.\n\nOn Cryptome site are also available some guides that explains to cops how to investigate on a person who has used the Yahoo! Messenger. The manual describe how to recover from the computer all the past conversations, even when the function is disabled which provides for the creation of a chat log.  The Cryptome is a true mine that offer in a single place many forensics analysis guide to explain how retrieve all the information from a smartphone like the iPhone bypassing any protection to access to content like sms and photos and other file stored in its memory even if deleted by the user.\n\nFor this analysis Cryptome has used the latest documents provided by the activists of \u201cAnonymous\u201d group and related to AOL, Microsoft. The information regarding Facebook have been provided by PublicIntelligence.net web site.\n\nReally interesting are the authorization procedures implemented to access to this data. Usually the police may need a search warrant or an instance of the court but sometimes the access is more simple.  When there is an emergency related to a concrete risk for human life or for National security issues, the information can be obtained in real time, even making a phone call to the supplier of services.\n\nSome documents report for example how to retrieve Facebook user\u2019s personal data under investigation. This document are directed to the police officer.  To access to the date it is necessary to provide to the offices of Facebook, via email or fax, user id and all the available information regarding the investigated profile. The user id is reported in the url of the profile. The Facebook company will reply within six weeks providing logs that include IP addresses of the user observed during their sessions. All this date are stored for a period with a duration of 90 days.  Of course Facebook is able to provide  \u2026 addition info like e-mail and phone of the person under investigation, its account creation date, last access date.\n\nAfter the online publication of these guidelines, Facebook has decided to upload \u2013 visible to everyone \u2013 a version of this document, updated to 2011 (but without explaining how long you retain log files with the IP, a company spokesman , asked the Cnet site, declined to answer the question).\n\nAOL, however, claims to preserve the logs with the IP messenger for 90 days, Internet users are kept up to 6 months and e-mail for a variable time. Periods of time that is specified in the document, \u201cmay be subject to change without notice.\u201d For emergencies, there is a dedicated phone line from AOL to the police, who need to obtain information as quickly as possible.\nCryptome have published some information regarding Microsoft and how the company manage profile of its users. Some files with IP addresses of Hotmail accounts are held on the servers for 60 days, no logs are stored for all the conversations in the chat on MSN. The policy is dated to 2005 and maybe it has been changed.\n\nI have always been a profound advocate of freedom of expression and thought, however, can not deny that the disclosure of information such as this topic has left me very interdict. The information disclosed are not new for us but to make this information public can cause several problems. How many investigators will improvise, how many will decide that just reading few pages is the shortest path to become security experts, and with what consequences?\nI find it proper to inform the users of a social network on the way in which their data are managed. How many and which information are managed for each user profile and for how long they will be available on corporate servers? Would not it be correct to inform users of the availability of such information so they can access them every time they desire?\nI have a doubt \u2026 and if these files were the result of a campaign of disinformation?\n\nAnd if the user data were stored on a permanent basis to allow for future investigation and analysis by government agencies?\n\n\u2026 I fear that this might be the inconvenient truth.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://publicintelligence.net/facebook-law-enforcement-subpoena-guides/\n\nhttp://cryptome.org/isp-spy/aol-spy3.pdf\n\nhttp://cryptome.org/isp-spy/cellular-spy3.pdf\n\nhttp://cryptome.org/isp-spy/facebook-spy3.pdf\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloud", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cryptome", "topic_name": "Cryptome"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/facebook", "topic_name": "Facebook"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/networks", "topic_name": "networks"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-network", "topic_name": "Social Network"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/truth", "topic_name": "truth"}]}, {"news_name": "E-Corruption \u2026 \u201cwho controls the controller?\u201d", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/324/cyber-crime/324.html", "title": "E-Corruption \u2026 \u201cwho controls the controller?\u201d\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 27, 2011", "body": "The control of information is the main concern of Governments. More or less declared the major players of a precarious global economy have implemented digital surveillance systems, from India to China, passing Russia and USA.\n\nThe crucial point is the legality of these actions conducted  by Intelligence Agencies in the name of Nations Security abusing the rights of citizens.  To this we must consider another  significant issue , the corruption.  Corruption has no Country and is a cross problem widely diffused.\n\nThe dilemma is always the same \u2026 \u201cwho controls the controller?\u201d Obvious who manage massive e-surveillance systems has a vantage point to gather confidential information and therefore make for a powerful private interests.\n\nEven more dangerous is the phenomenon of corruption, enslaved to the power that can give rise to  intestine current  whose sole purpose is to destabilize the current political Government. Approaching the problem more in detail, we have on the one hand impeccable initiatives undertaken for reasons of National Security , on the other hand there is a pervasive phenomenon of  the human weakness to the money.  During this days in Italy for example we are fighting with a corruption case that involve the Finmeccanica Firm, one of the top euro defense provider.\n\nLets give a look to corruption perception report and related map.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIt\u2019s clear that all those States that are investing in e-Surveillance systems are the same governments that suffers majors corruptions problems. I believe that the combination of this two factors is dangerous at least like the phenomenon you want to fight, the cyber threat. Here you are some sample of monitoring system deployed in Country with high level of corruption:\n\n \n\n \n\nCorruption is a phenomenon that exposes the internal organizations and governments to threats that are really difficult to detect.\n\n\u2026. All this projects are intended to strengthen the e-surveillance capabilities of the government without any constitutional safeguards.\n\nIndian Government for example has forced  telecom and internet service providers (ISPs) to install monitoring equipment for surveillance of internet traffic.\n\nRecently, the United Nations declared \u201cRight to Access\u201d to Internet as Human Right. This would have a positive impact upon many Human Rights in Cyberspace. For instance, Right to Speech and Expression, Right to Privacy, Right to Know, etc cannot be violated by any CMS Project. United Nations must expand Human Rights Protection to many more issues considering anyone of this violations.\n\nIt has no sense to promote human freedom closing the eyes on corruptions events, on the direct correlation that there is between corruption and policy to implement detailed traffic filtering.\n\nLet me conclude with the hope that all the Governments that have introduced monitoring  systems are confident about their actual usage and that they will fight corruption in the same way they have declared war to any cyber threat.\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n \n\nOther References\n\nhttp://hrpic.blogspot.com/2011/11/e-surveillance-in-india.html\n\nhttp://hrpic.blogspot.com/2010/10/protecting-civil-liberties-in-indian.html\n\nhttp://perry4law.com/hr/uid.html\n\nhttp://therussiamonitor.com/2009/04/09/medvedevs-anti-corruption-measures-whitewash-or-real-deal-2/\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/china", "topic_name": "China"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cms", "topic_name": "CMS"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/corruption", "topic_name": "corruption"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/human-rights", "topic_name": "human rights"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/internet", "topic_name": "Internet"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isp", "topic_name": "ISP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/large-scale-infiltration", "topic_name": "Large scale infiltration"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/mac", "topic_name": "Mac"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/monitoring-system", "topic_name": "monitoring system"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/osint", "topic_name": "OSINT"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/russia", "topic_name": "Russia"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/whistleblowing", "topic_name": "Whistleblowing"}]}, {"news_name": "Cloud\u2026a long journey towards a secure paradigm", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/321/laws-and-regulations/cloud-a-long-journey-towards-a-secure-paradigm.html", "title": "Cloud\u2026a long journey towards a secure paradigm\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 26, 2011", "body": "When I discussed with many colleagues regarding cloud paradigm most of them smiled declaring that we face yet another found marketing to sell a methodology, known for at least a decade, under new and more appealing clothes.\n\nIndeed many of the concepts behind the cloud  approach have little innovative, but the evolutionary push to the paradigm last year was really strong. The main brands in the industry have implemented cloud-based services that would seem to be able to materialize any request for an increasingly demanding audience.\n\nBut is it really so? In terms of security is the paradigm mature?\n\nIn my humble opinion, the paradigm is far from to be considered mature in terms of security. Many are lavishing a lot of effort in this direction but we are far from have \u201csecure\u201d model for the implementation of services, processes and information management. Have a secure infrastructure means that cloud, for the heterogeneous nature of its components, have to be able to ensure the protection of its resources, of the the data it manages, and of all the services provided. The distraction of using one of these components could compromise the safety of the entire cloud. Complicating everything is the great attraction that the Cloud has against those who want to have great offensive power from the platforms that they can manage to conduct an attack against a given target.\n\nThink you have found the solution to everything using the \u201cCloud\u201d? My compliments, but I remain skeptical. Which guarantees are offered in terms of security to cloud customers today? None! If you  sign a contract, and I talk about the legal side of it, you will soon realize to acquire a system with the characteristics of computing needed, but without any guarantee in terms of security. What happens if a resource of the cloud, perhaps ours, is violated and used together with other to attacks other components? Who is liable and to what extent? What are the metrics to evaluate the objective responsibility in case cloud attack? It would be possible to identify the machine that has been compromised? Absolutely not! We had noticed that Google hacking tools can be used to make the cloud insecure gathering sensible informations related to the authentications processes \u2026  but the Google Hacking tools have been known for at least five years, but the Amazon Cloud Hack to attack Sony has been discovered on May  \u2026\n\nSome other examples \u2026.\n\nOn August, 29th 2011 has been discovered That exploting some flaws in Google\u2019s servers, malicious attackers were able to launch a DDOS attack on a chosen target .\n\nOn October 2011, Defense contractor Raytheon Declared That it was hit by aa spear phishing, cloud-based attack;\n\n \n\nNever before, as in the case of cloud, technological implementation and legal implementation are so far, in my opinion because once again the drive business, in a moment of great crisis, has in fact outpaced the ability of development a mature solution.\n\nIt\u2019s my opinion that we have a long trip to do \u2026 and this is only the beginning\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/botnets", "topic_name": "Botnets"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cloud", "topic_name": "Cloud"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/critical-infrastructures", "topic_name": "Critical infrastructures"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hackers", "topic_name": "Hackers"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/hacking", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/malware-2", "topic_name": "malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/sabotage", "topic_name": "Sabotage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/social-engineering", "topic_name": "Social Engineering"}]}, {"news_name": "ISP can\u2019t be forced to filter transmissions inherent in copyright-infringing content", "news_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/278/laws-and-regulations/isp-cant-be-forced-to-filter-transmissions-inherent-in-copyright-infringing-content.html", "title": "ISP can\u2019t be forced to filter transmissions inherent in copyright-infringing content\t\t\t\t\t", "author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "author_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/author/paganinip", "date": "November 25, 2011", "body": "In recent months it has had discussions about the possibility of blocking sites that somehow support the distribution of pirated software. How to identify these sites? How to find and block communications to the final users. The role of the ISPs is fundamental because it was asked them to monitor the traffic of their customers blocking any transmission inherent in copyright-infringing content. The request is unacceptable in my opinion because it\u2019s means to ask to ISPs to monitor all communications, violating every right to privacy. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in a landmark decision that the request made \u200b\u200bto the ISP is unlawful.\n\nThe ruling is related to the Scarlet Extended case started in 2004 in the Belgian courts and that has been proposed to the ECJ for the final judgement.\n\nThe ruling is as historic, intended to legislate in the coming years on a topic of great relevance for many actors who are involved, like the content rights holders, ISPs and end users.\n\nThe Belgian group SABAM had asked to keep content for which it has the right connections were not disclosed by the ISP Scarlet to prevent illegal distribution in the Country.\n\nBut the sentence reads:\n\u201cEU law precludes the imposition of an injunction by a national court Which \n\nRequires anInternet service provider to install a filtering system with a \n\nview to Preventing the illegal downloading of files,\u201d \n\nreads the sentence again:\n\n\u201cIt instead places the onus on the copyright owner to identify potential infringements and to notify these to the ISP,\u201d \n\nThe European Court has ruled that the injunction against the Scarlet was too broad and notregulated by imposing a general obligation to monitor all information without anydisciminante.  It is thus triggered a process that inevitably will lead to reform of copyright, which must firsttake into account the sanctity of freedom of citizens.\n\nIt is an historical  defeat for a European Commission that has until now supported the filtering actions requested by the industries that hold content rights.\n\n \n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/censorship", "topic_name": "Censorship"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/content-filtering", "topic_name": "Content filtering"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/copyright", "topic_name": "copyright"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/cyber-crime", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/espionage", "topic_name": "Espionage"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/european-court-of-justice", "topic_name": "European Court of Justice"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/file-sharing", "topic_name": "file sharing"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/intelligence", "topic_name": "Intelligence"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/investigation", "topic_name": "Investigation"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/isp", "topic_name": "ISP"}, {"topic_link": "https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/tag/law", "topic_name": "Law"}]}]}]
