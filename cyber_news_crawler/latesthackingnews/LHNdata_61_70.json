Nevertheless, the attack has alarmed the authorities, as many universities handle research that requires strict confidentiality as well as huge amounts of information regarding intellectual assets.\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that could compromise the reliability of a university,\u201d the education ministry warned the institutions on Jan. 13, while urging them to inspect their websites and bolster security. Police are also investigating the matter.The cyberattacks were concentrated on Dec. 18 and Jan. 7, and around that time some business websites were also hacked.The universities said that they have since implemented stronger security measures, including shutting off network connections to the websites that were tampered with.In the case of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, a prototype bulletin board system made by a research lab was replaced with a page listing an array of online links believed to connect to scam sites offering concert tickets and credit cards.The school said its website \u201cmay have been used as a springboard to guide viewers to malicious websites\u201d and reprimanded the professor and associate professor managing the page.In addition, Keio University, Mie University and other institutions had their online contents changed to display the phrase, \u201cHacked by Team System Dz.\u201dThat hacking group has been accused of involvement in a mass cyberattack in 2015 that altered more than 1,000 websites across the globe.

Dridex emerged as one of most dangerous banking Trojan families present, still its recent activity has subsided compared to the levels seen in 2014 and 2015.Recently observed a small distribution campaign that is targeting the UK financial institutions which was characterized by the use of \u201cpreviously-unobserved\u201d Dridex UAC bypass which leverages recdisc.exe, which is a Windows default recovery disc executable. This malware was also observed while loading malicious code using impersonated SPP.dll, and using spoolsrv and svchost to communicate to peers and then first-layer C&C servers.As usual, Dridex is being distributed through spam emails with attached Word documents that feature malicious macros designed to download and execute the malware. The initially dropped module was designed to download the main Dridex payload. After infection, the Trojan moves itself from the current location to the %TEMP% folder.On the infected machine, Dridex leverages the Windows default recovery disc executable recdisc.exe to load an impersonated SPP.dll and bypass the UAC protection on Windows 7. It does so because the platform automatically elevates the program, along with other applications white-listed for auto-elevation. Dridex leverages this feature to execute two commands on the computer.In order to bypass this UAC, Dridex created a directory in Windows\\System32\\6886, and then copies legitimate binary from Windows\\System32\\recdisc.exe to the Windows\\System32\\6886\\. Next, it copies itself to %APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp as a tmp file, and then moves itself to Windows\\System32\\6886\\SPP.dll. Then the malware deletes wu*.exe and po*.dll from Windows\\System32, after doing which it executes the recdisc.exe and then loads itself as impersonated SPP.dll with admin privileges.

VPNs encrypt data that is shared by you online and hence, provide you full security of the information. But contrary to this popular belief, not all the VPNs are so reliable and secure. Research conducted by the Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and UC Berkley University of South Wales and found that nearly 38% of all the Android VPN apps in the play store are infected with malware; making this blind trust of these apps a not so trustable move.The research teams studied around 234 VPN apps that were uploaded on Google Play Store and a startling one-third were identified to be tracking users via malware. There were apps which carried out malvertising campaigns while 18% of them didn\u2019t encrypt internet data as promised. 8 out of 10 apps requested permission to access sensitive data such as text messages and user account credentials.

It was speculated that this malicious code is active for many years only to be detected now.This malicious code was recently discovered by Malwarebytes after one of the IT administrators in there identified a strange pattern of incoming network traffic from one of the compromised Macs. Reportedly, the malware was designed to compromise the webcam and capture screenshots of Mac machine and simulate mouse clicks and key presses. Apart from all these features, it can also perform the regular malware function of providing the hacker or attacker with the ability to remotely control the machine.According to a blog post from a researcher Thomas Reed at the Malwarebytes, both Apple and Malwarebytes are yet to discovered how this malware is being distributed. What they have managed to find so far is that it is based made using some old-school coding techniques, which are so old that they date back to 2001 when the Mac OS X was launched.The most disturbing aspect is that Fruitfly also contains Linux shell commands and when Reed tried to run the malware on Linux machine, it worked \u201cjust fine\u201d and only the Mac-specific code didn\u2019t run.

A total of 36.6 million records were exposed last year, well below the 169 million records exposed in 2015. Partly the big year-over-year increase is due to better reporting and partly the jump is due to determined efforts by hackers and crooks to steal, or more recently hold for ransom, user data.The leading type of attacks for the eighth consecutive year were hacking/skimming/phishing attacks, accounting for 55.5% of all data breaches. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), much of the increase came from what are known as CEO spear-fishing attacks that fool corporate executives into revealing confidential employee records.ITRC chairman and founder Adam Levin noted:More than half of the breaches reported by the ITRC included the skeleton key to our lives: the Social Security number. This trend, which has accelerated since 2015\u2014 when just four breaches exposed over 120 million Social Security numbers to state-sponsored hackers and cyber criminals\u2014 represents the point of no return for millions of Americans.

The design decision referenced in The Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks. WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design, and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report.\u201dThe Guardian report included the research by Tobias Boelter who is a cryptography and security researcher at University of California, Berkeley.

Tobias Boelter later said The Guardian that the \u201cbackdoor\u201d gave WhatsApp ability to read messages because of the way the company has implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol.

However, WhatsApp has the ability to force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users, unbeknown to the sender and recipient of the messages, and to make the sender re-encrypt messages with new keys and send them again for any messages that have not been marked as delivered.The recipient is not made aware of this change in encryption, while the sender is only notified if they have opted-in to encryption warnings in settings, and only after the messages have been re-sent.

Airtel Zambia had reported to the police on April 8, 2016 that it had lost more than US $24,000 in phone call re-routing between January and March 2016.\nThe ideal situation is that Airtel bills the other mobile service provider making an international call for using its network and part of the charge is paid to the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA).However, the court heard that Chiti had procured more than 1,000 simcards from an Airtel agent and inserted them into the prohibited simbox which is also known as simfarm machine to hide international calls received on Airtel network. This meant that Airtel could not bill the other networks as the international calls were disguised as domestic calls. Police investigations led to the arrest of Mary Mupeta a sales agent who had sold more than 1,000 simcards to Chiti.Officers also recovered one simbox in Mukobeko area which was not operational but all the electronic gadgets including his personal laptop were taken to ZICTA for examination.In mitigation, Chiti, the father of two, begged for the court\u2019s leniency, saying he regretted his action and that he had recently lost his mother.\nMagistrate Mubita said she had taken into consideration the mitigation and sentenced him accordingly.Mupeta, the sales agent who had sold the simcards to Chiti was also recently fined K2,000 after pleading guilty to unauthorized access to interception of or interference with data.Source: times.co.zm", "date": "January 13, 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "Two Men Arrested For Drug Dealing On Dark Web", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "We all know that the Dark Web has become a source for malicious activities and crimes.

In addition, hackers will explore east-west attacks, meaning they will try to jump from machine to machine or between the cloud and a server. Multiple organizations within a cloud service provider will be targeted. In addition, the growth of the Internet of Things devices will cause vulnerability in cloud security models.

In addition, the lack of appropriate security of these devices will likely lead to cyber criminals using IoT devices as a gateway to more comprehensive attacks on intellectual property and infrastructure disruption.Another significant area of concern, are the aggregation points where data is collected within IoT systems. Hackers could get a big payday by attacking the data storage for all of the information derived from a particular company\u2019s IoT device, the report stated.Medical devices continue to be targeted as hackers seek medical data.Despite the risk, IoT adoption will remain high, the report stated, the result of its benefits outweighing its disadvantages.As hackers continue to get creative in obtaining cyber data, security vendors and IoT providers will be working to develop better security controls through new encryption options, device control systems and behavioral monitoring.Source: claimsjournal.com", "date": "January 11, 2017", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "Netflix Users Falling For Credit Card Phishing Scam", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "Daredevil hackers are targeting Netflix users with a new phishing attack that attempts to break bad with their credit card details.

One tool linked from that Reddit community, however, comes with two open-source NES ROMs that are in the legal free-and-clear to upload to your hardware.Once you\u2019ve added your own game files, which should also include custom JPGs that will appear in the NES Classic\u2019s \u201cbox art\u201d GUI, you\u2019ll have to repack the hardware\u2019s kernel, then fully flash the hardware yourself.

Be Careful. -Researchers", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "Researchers have warned that the lack of enough security measures in the travel booking systems exposes the passenger\u2019s personal information and thus allows the attackers to steal tickets and info about the passengers.At the 33rd Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg of Germany, security researchers Nemanja NIkodijevic and Karsten Nohl from Security Research Labs explained in detail about the vulnerability that is affecting the major travel booking systems. He demonstrated them how easy it is to exploit these popular services.His analysis is focused on Global Distribution Systems (GDS), that serve as a central point for service providers (e.g. hotels, airlines, travel agencies) to manage reservations. The records that are stored by these systems, which are called passenger name records (PNR), can include information like name, ticket data, contact information, passport number, itinerary, date of birth and even payment information. The world\u2019s top GDS providers are Sabre, Amadeus and Travelport.One of the main problems, according to Nohl and Nikodijevic, is these airlines, travel agencies and third-party service providers often use to authenticate users is based on passenger\u2019s last name.This code typically contains a 6-digit alphanumeric string. This is embedded in the barcode found on boarding pass and it can also be printed in clear text on the baggage tags. Since some users share pictures of their boarding pass on some social media websites, it is not a difficult task for fraudsters and cybercriminals to obtain these codes.Another problem that is given a lot interest is the fact that these authenticators can also be obtained using brute force as some web services have neglected to implement limiting the rate mechanisms. In some cases, GDS providers exclude certain characters (e.g. \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d might be excluded as they can be confused with \u201cO\u201d and \u201cI\u201d) or they assign booking codes sequentially, making brute-force attacks even more efficient.Once a traveler\u2019s booking code is obtained, an attacker can gain access to personal information and abuse it for various purposes, including phishing and social engineering attacks.

The weakness, exploitable by submitting specially crafted input through contact and registration forms, can allow an attacker to completely take over the targeted web application.PHPMailer developers attempted to patch the vulnerability (CVE-2016-10033) with the release of version 5.2.18.

SwiftMailer developers included a fix for the vulnerability in version 5.4.5, released on December 29, but it may not be complete either.Researcher Paul Buonopane believes that CVE-2016-10033, CVE-2016-10045 and CVE-2016-10074 are just the tips of the iceberg as they are caused by PHP design flaws that could expose many applications.The issues, according to Buonopane, revolve around the lack of proper input sanitization, particularly related to the PHP functions escapeshellarg and escapeshellcmd. escapeshellcmd is designed to escape characters that might be used to trick a shell command into executing arbitrary commands, while escapeshellarg escapes a string that will be used as a shell argument.Buonopane has pointed out that the escapeshellarg function is incomplete and escapeshellcmd was never meant to sanitise user input, which leaves room for abuse. The expert said PHP developers have known about some of the issues surrounding the problematic functions for several years.\u201cThe underlying vulnerability is really a design flaw and will take many years to fix.
