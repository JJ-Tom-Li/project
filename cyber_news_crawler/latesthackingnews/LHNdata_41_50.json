This, however, does not mean that EternalRocks is less complex. According to Stamper, it\u2019s actually the opposite.For starters, EternalRocks is far more sneaky than WannaCry\u2019s SMB worm component. Once it infects a victims, the worm uses a two-stage installation process, with a delayed second stage.During the first stage, EternalRocks gain a foothold on an infected host, downloads the Tor client, and beacons its C&C server, located on a .onion domain, the Dark Web.Additionally, EternalRocks also uses files with identical name to the ones used by WannaCry\u2019s SMB worm, in another attempt to fool security researchers into misclassifying it.But unlike WannaCry, EternalRocks does not include a kill switch domains, the Achille\u2019s heel that security researchers used to stop the WannaCry outbreak.After the initial dormancy period expire and the C&C server responds, EternalRocks goes into the second stage of its installation process procedure and downloads a second stage malwares component in the form of an archive named shadowbrokers.zip.Because of its broader exploit arsenals, the lack of a kill switch domain, and because of its initial dormancy, EternalRocks could pose a serious threat to computer with vulnerable SMB ports exposed to the Internet, if its author would ever decide to weaponize the worms with ransomware, a banking trojan, RATs, or anything else.At first glance, the worm seem to be an experiment, or a malware author performing tests and fine-tuning a future threats.This, however, does not mean EternalRocks is harmless. Computer infected with this worm are controllable via C&C server command and the worm\u2019s owner could leverage this hidden communications channel to send new malwares to the computers previously infected by EternalRocks.Furthermore, DOUBLEPULSAR, an NSA implants with backdoor features, remains running on PCs infected with EternalRocks. Unfortunately, the worm\u2019s authors has not taken any measure to protect the DOUBLEPULSAR implants, which runs in a default unprotected state, meaning other threat actors could use it as a backdoors to machines infected by EternalRocks, by  sending their own malware to those PCs.IOCs and more info on the worm\u2019s infection process are available in a GitHub repos Stampar set up a few days ago.Take your time to comment on this article."}, {"topics": ["Hacking News"], "title": "HSBC Bank new voice recognition security system was fooled!", "authur": "Eslam Medhat", "date": "May 20, 2017", "body": "A BBC Click reporter Dan Simmons set up an HSBC account and signed up for the new voice ID authentication service.

The devices are powered by an embedded operating system and they run a web server.Thousands of these systems are easily accessible from the Internet, allowing attackers to hijack them by replacing their firmware with a malicious version.The attack scenario developed and demonstrated by Applied Risk starts with the attacker scanning the Web for potential targets.

The researcher said most of these systems lack any authentication mechanism, allowing easy access.The expert believes an attacker could identify widely used devices and concentrate on targeting those. Once the target has been identified, the attacker first needs to acquire the device and conduct hardware debugging on it to determine how it works.

Instead, it simply closes some ports to keep the infected devices away from Mirai and similar threats.Called Hajime to keep the naming scheme in line with Mirai (they mean \u201cbeginning\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d in Japanese, respectively), the worm managed to build a peer-to-peer (P2P) botnet, but researchers aren\u2019t sure about its purpose right now. Symantec said recently that a white hat hacker could have created the malware, but suggested that the botnet could be easily repurposed for nefarious operations.What\u2019s certain, however, is that Hajime\u2019s author continues to update the code, as recently made changes were seen in the attack module. At the moment, the worm supports three different attack methods: TR-069 exploitation, Telnet default password attack, and Arris cable modem password of the day attack. The TR-069 exploit was implemented only recently, Kaspersky reveals.TR-069 (Technical Report 069), a standard published by the Broadband Forum, is used by ISPs to manage modems remotely via TCP port 7547 (some devices use port 5555). By abusing the TR-069 NewNTPServer feature, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable devices. Late last year, the TR-069 attack was used to crash nearly 1 million modems from Deutsche Telekom.According to Kaspersky, Hajime attacks any device on the Internet with the exception of several networks, and its author recently improved the architecture detection logic. Thus, after passing the authentication stage, the malware reads the first 52 bytes of the victim\u2019s echo binary (information about architecture and operating system is in the first 20 bytes), and then compares the echo ELF header against a predefined array, so as to fetch the correct Hajime-downloader binary.On the other hand, despite Hajime being able to attack any device, the authors focused on some specific brands/devices, as the worm uses only specific username-password combinations to brute-force its way into vulnerable devices. The threat uses one combination or the other based on words contained in the welcome message when opening a telnet session.source: securityweek"}, {"topics": ["Hacking News", "News"], "title": "Cybersecurity Threat Highlighted in the Wonga breach", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "April 26, 2017", "body": "Recently payday lender Wonga suffered a monumental data breach with personal details from hundreds of thousands of accounts likely to have been illegally accessed.

Shamir along with Ben Nassi and Yuval Elovici have now published a detailed research paper on the attack method.Many experiments conducted by these experts show that attacker can send a bunch of commands to a piece of malware present on an isolated machine just by pointing a light source at a connected flatbed scanner which has its lid open from outside the building which is housing the device.This malware can be programmed to start scans at a specified date and time when attacker starts sending these commands. The researchers have pointed out that only the first scan date should be set as the subsequent dates can be supplied with each attack.These commands are transmitted in the form of pulses from a laser or any other different light source because a 0 bit is sent when it\u2019s off and 1 bit is transmitted when the light source is on. The light source can be an invisible infrared laser or a visible laser, this makes the attack stealthier.The laser attack works if there is a clear line of sight from the outside of the building to the scanner.

The victim, here, told the HackRead website that it happened while they are using Facebook messenger on their own smartphone, and there have not downloaded any app from a third-party nor Google Play Store during the incident or before it. This happened on 18th March, when a \u201cpenalty notice\u201d from the Enforcement Bailiffs Ltd appeared on this smartphone informing that the victim\u2019s device has been blocked due to the presence some Child abuse content. It should be noted that the Enforcement Bailiffs Ltd is a United Kingdom based commercial property enforcement specialists and they have nothing to do with these cyber crime related cases.Furthermore, the notice threatened victims in paying 200 GBP or else the so-called offensive material will be made public, and a case will go on trial. Here are the exclusive screenshots provided by the victim: Moreover, the warning message informed the victim to pay the ransom money through secure online payment platform PaySafeCard.Since these threats are bullshit from the get go, the only reasonable solution for this ransomware infection is a simple factory reset, once the battery died and that is what the victim did to get back his smartphone successfully. But, in some cases; it is almost impossible to get rid of this ransomware infection. For this, cyber security giants and the Europol have launched a \u2018No More Ransom\u2019 Anti-Ransomware Portal which has already decrypted over 2,500 ransomware victims and saved 1.3 Mil Euros from cyber criminals."}, {"topics": ["Hacking News", "News"], "title": "Healthcare Industry Will Face FTP Attacks \u2013 FBI Warns", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "March 27, 2017", "body": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Cyber Division has issued an alert to warn healthcare industry regarding malicious actors who are actively targeting File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers which allow anonymous access.According to law enforcement agency, these attackers have targeted FTP servers of medical and dental facilities to obtain access to protected health information and personally identifiable information (PII), and use it to intimidate, blackmail and harass business owners.\u201cFBI recommends the medical and dental healthcare entities to request their respective IT services personnel and check networks for the FTP servers. If the businesses have any legitimate use for operating FTP server in the anonymous mode, administrators must ensure sensitive PHI or PII is not stored on these servers,\u201d FBI said.The agency cited the research conducted back in 2015 by University of Michigan, which has shown that more than one million of FTP servers are configured for the anonymous access. All these servers allow users to authenticate with only a username, like \u201canonymous\u201d or \u201cftp,\u201d and either a generic password or no password at all.\u201cIn general, any misconfigured or unsecured server operating on a business network on which sensitive data is stored or processed exposes the business to data theft and compromise by cybercriminals who can use the data for criminal purposes such as blackmail, identity theft, or financial fraud,\u201d the FBI warned.In 2015, IBM named healthcare as the most attacked industry, with more than 100 million records compromised, after in the previous year this sector did not even make it to the top five. An IBM report for 2016 showed that the volume of compromised records was smaller, but the number of data breaches increased, causing operational, reputational and financial damage to healthcare organisations.A report published recently by Fortinet showed the top threats targeting healthcare companies in the last quarter of 2016, including ransomware, malware, exploit kits, IPS events and botnets."}, {"topics": ["Hacking News"], "title": "This new fraudster bot spotted in the wild attacks Online stores", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "March 27, 2017", "body": "A new bot named Giftghost is designed by hackers which are being used to defraud many gift card owners. According to the reports, the attacks are first spotted on February 26th by the Distil Networks, a cyber security firm. Ever since then, nearly 1000 websites became the victims of this brutal hack.The crooks are using this bot to generate possible account numbers of consumers automatically and requesting the balance account of each card number. When a card balance is received, rather than an error or zero, that means that attack was successful and credentials could be then sold on Darkweb or can be used to make a purchase.This is what the Distill Networks researcher Anna Westelius said about the Giftghostbot:\u201cFirst, it lies about its identity by rotating the user-agent strings. Then, it is massively distributed across various hosting providers and the data-centers across the world. Then, it is technically sophisticated when it executes the JavaScript, just mimicking a normal browser. Finally, its persistent in that if it is blocked by one technique it adapts and then returns using another attack technique.\u201dAccording to theDistill networks, this bot is capable of sending more than 1.7 million requests per hour and damage caused by this bot is still unknown.Although, this bot is basically designed to steal gift card information of consumers, in many cases it can affect websites as well. In many isolated cases, millions of requests could lead to the slowdown or potential downtime of the website.Rami Essaid, the CEO of Distill networks said that: \u201cLike many sophisticated bot attacks, the GiftGhostBot operators are moving rapidly to evade the detection, and any retailer which offers gift cards can be under attack at this moment. While it is important to understand that retailers are not exposing consumers\u2019 personal information, consumers should remain vigilant. Chef gift card balances, contact retailers and ask for more information.

The infecting agent for this particular tool is saved on modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter.Another project is \u201cDarkSeaSkies,\u201d this is an implant which persists in the EFI firmware of an Apple MacBook Air computer, along with the Triton macOS malware, it has an infector \u201cDark Mallet\u201d and its EFI-persistent version \u201cDerStake.\u201dThe documents in hands of the WikiLeaks include 2013 DesStake 1.4 manual, and other documents which show that, as of 2016, CIA continues to rely on and update these systems and is also working on a second DerStarke version.Another one of the CIA\u2019s tools targets iPhones. By using a \u201cbeacon/loader/implanter tool\u201d called NightSkies, factory-fresh iPhones can become infested. WikiLeaks states that documents in its hold indicate NightSkies had reached version 1.2 by 2008 and was expressly designed to be physically installed onto fresh iPhones alone, which they claim shows the CIA had been infecting the iPhone supply chain ever since.\u201cWhile CIA assets are sometimes used to physically infect systems in the custody of a target it is likely that many CIA physical access attacks have infected the targeted organization\u2019s supply chain including by interdicting mail orders and other shipments (opening, infecting, and resending) leaving the United States or otherwise,\u201d WikiLeaks writes."}, {"topics": ["Hacking News"], "title": "Android Forums Hacked and Issued Password Reset Notice", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "date": "March 24, 2017", "body": "The Android Forums which is the popular platform for the Android users has announced that their servers are accessed by a third-party thus resulting in a data breach.In their security notice, the administrator of the website wrote that 40 members in the forum (which is 2.5 percent) who have registered between registered in 2016 and 2017 got their accounts compromised.
