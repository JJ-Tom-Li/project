It is suggested that if you receive such a request, make sure to contact the friend directly: either face to face or on the phone.Doing so will help you to be sure it truly is the real person making the request or not. No one wants to have their Facebook account compromised for fairly obvious reasons so protecting yourself and your account is pretty important. Another way to avoid this latest Facebook scam is to stay on your game and pay attention. Don\u2019t just blindly go along with a \u201cTrusted Contact\u201d request without being absolutely sure it\u2019s the real deal.So far, the majority of those experiencing these hacks have been located in North Africa and the Middle East.
