Thus in practice there are easier ways to access the private keys than to mount this side-channel attack. However, on boxes with virtual machines this attack may be used by one VM to steal private keys from another VM.\u201dA patch has been released for the Libgcrypt library, Debian users can update the library here and Ubuntu can update the library here."}, {"topics": ["Hacking News", "SPY"], "title": "Wikileaks: OutlawCountry Tool Used to Target Linux Systems", "authur": "Eslam Medhat", "date": "July 3, 2017", "body": "OutlawCountry is one of the tools used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to target computers running the Linux operating system. OutlawCountry allows for the redirection of all outbound network traffic on the target computer to CIA controlled machines for ex- and infiltration purposes.The malware consists of a kernel module that generates a hidden netfilter table on a Linux target; with knowledge of the table name, an operator can create rules that take priority over existing netfilter/iptables rules and are hidden from an user or even system administrator.According to Wikileaks:\n\u201cThe installation and persistence method of the malware is not described in detail in the document; an operator will have to rely on the available CIA exploits and backdoors to inject the kernel module into a target operating system. Outlaw-Country v1.0 contains one kernel module for 64-bit CentOS/RHEL 6.x; this module will only work with default kernels. Also, Outlaw-Country v1.0 only supports adding covert DNAT rules to the PREROUTING chain.\u201dThe new malware details have been leaked and published in the form of a user manual, which describes that OutlawCountry tool consists of a kernel module for Linux 2.6.OutlawCountry is just another leak of the several CIA leaks that WikiLeaks has published out as part of its Vault 7 series of data dumps."}, {"topics": ["Hacking News", "News", "Uncategorized"], "title": "NATO wants to respond to the Petya Ransomware Attack", "authur": "Harikrishna Mekala", "date": "July 3, 2017", "body": "\u201cAs major government operations have been targeted,  in fact, the operation is assigned to a state this could include as a violation of sovereignty,\u201d wrote Tom\u00e1\u0161 Min\u00e1rik, a researcher at the CCD COE law office, in the release. \u201cConsequently, this could be an internationally wrongful act, which might provide the targeted nations several options to return with countermeasures.\u201dThe bill puts the CCD COE, a NATO-sponsored cybersecurity research center based near Estonia, in understanding with researchers opening over the details of the attack. The Petya virus was apparently aimed at central Ukrainian organizations instead of a broad array of Ransom targets, and Ukraine bore the brunt of the attack. That fact, near with the basic errors that make ransom seem like a weak reason for a campaign of this order and complexity, makes it looks like cyber criminals implied not the culprits.\u201cThe development was not too complex, but still complicated and high enough to have been equipped and executed by unaffiliated hackers for the sake of habit,\u201d the Centre wrote in the release. \u201cCyber crooks are not behind this unless, as the method for getting the ransom was so poorly planned that the ransom would apparently not even cover the cost of the operation.\u201dTake your time to comment on this article."}]
