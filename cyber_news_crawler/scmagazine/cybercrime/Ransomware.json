Moreover, certain Dridex and FriedEx samples have the same or nearly synchronous date-of-compilation timestamps, with identical randomly generated constants \u2013 which suggests that they were likely compiled concurrently.\n\nIf that weren't enough proof that the two are related, both malwares are compiled in Visual Studio 2015.\n\n\u201cWith all this evidence, we confidently claim that FriedEx is indeed the work of the Dridex developers,\u201d the blog post concludes. \u201cThis discovery gives us a better picture of the group's activities \u2013 we can see that the group continues to be active and not only consistently updates their banking Trojan\u2026 [but] also follows the latest malware trends, creating their own ransomware.\u201d\n\nAccording to ESET, FriedEx/BitPaymer is focused on high-profile targets and companies, and is typically delivered through an RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) brute force attack. Discovered in July 2017, the ransomware would soon after infected several hospitals operated by Scotland's NHS Lanarkshire health care board.\n\nDridex first debuted in 2014, and it is estimated that the trojan is directly responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over the years.

During the period when the computer network was being rebuilt all transactions had to be completed manually, but Snabe said this only resulted in about a 20 percent fall off in the amount of freight being handled due to the hard work by company employees and their customers being very understanding of the situation.\n\nSnabe also ran down a few lessons Maersk learned from the event. \n\n\u201cWe found we were only average when it comes to cybersecurity.

No? That's because it's a fictional fairy tale cooked up by cybercrooks as a ruse to infect wannabe miners with a particularly devilish ransomware program.\n\nIn a Jan. 22\u00a0blog post, researchers from\u00a0Fortinet's\u00a0FortiGuard Labs team warn that SpriteCoin ransomware not only encrypts computers' files, but also harvests Chrome and Firefox browser credentials, stores them using an embedded SQLite engine, and then transmits them to the malicious actors' Tor website via POST requests.\n\nAlthough SpriteCoin may not exist, the adversaries are certainly taking advantage of genuine digital currency to receive their ransom payments. In a somewhat unusual twist, however, the actors are demanding payment not in Bitcoin, but in Monero, a cryptocurrency gaining in popularity among cybercriminals because its wallet addresses remain anonymous.\n\nEven if victims pay the 0.3 Monero ransom (worth around $90 as of Jan. 23), the SpriteCoin malware doesn't necessarily deliver a working the decryption key \u2013 and worse, it downloads a secondary malware program, identified as\u00a0W32/Generic!tr, capable of harvesting certificates, parsing keys, and surreptitiously activating web cameras.\n\n\u201cThis sample, while not highly sophisticated, is unique that it targets victims interested in cryptocurrency, and then providing a secondary malicious component instead of just asking for the ransom,\u201d\u00a0said Tony Giandomenico, senior security strategist and researcher with Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, in an email interview with SC Media. \u201cThreat actors are doing their homework when targeting end users, and we can safely predict more of the same to come in the future.\u201d\n\nBased on unconfirmed reports, Fortinet believes the primary attack vector for SpriteCoin ransomware is online forums, using cryptocurrency-themed spam to entice viewers into downloading the malicious SpriteCoin wallet app package via a link.\n\nFortinet further reports that the apparent SpriteCoin homepage describes the fraudulent virtual currency as: \u201ca new cryptocurrency written entirely in JavaScript (with C for the mining module). It uses the CryptoNight algorithm but is not cryptonote-based. With a max supply of 1 trillion coins and a block time of 45 seconds, this is sure to be a profitable coin for you (I hope).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe allure of quick wealth through cryptocurrency seems to be enough to trick unsuspecting users to rush toward the wallet app du jour without consideration,\u201d states the FortiGuard Labs blog post.\n\nUsers who download the malware receive a prompt to enter a wallet password, with the option of leaving the input field blank. Upon clicking the \u201cNext Step\u201d button, users next see a progress bar and a corresponding message that the package is downloading the blockchain \u2013 but in reality, the malware is actually encrypting a variety of files.\n\nDiscovered the week of Jan. 15 and observed in the wild as spritecoind[.]exe, the SpriteCoin malware is reportedly UPX-packed for evasion purposes, and connects to the adversaries' anonymous TOR site via an Onion proxy that lets victims communicate with the dark web URL without forcing them to establish a TOR connection first.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Separate ransomware attacks strike New Mexico city, Indiana health care provider", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/separate-ransomware-attacks-strike-new-mexico-city-indiana-health-care-provider/article/738087/", "title": "Separate ransomware attacks strike New Mexico city, Indiana health care provider", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "January 19, 2018", "body": "A New Mexican city of roughly 45,000 people and an Indianan hospital operator have fallen victim to separate ransomware attacks this month.\n\nIn a Jan. 17 press release, the city of Farmington, NM acknowledged via press release that municipal computers running its business operations were infected with SAMSAM ransomware in a Jan. 3 attack.\n\n\"The City apologizes for the temporary inconvenience our customers may have experienced during this time,\" the release states, noting that the city has been working with the FBI. \"Nearly all business systems related to customer service operations have been restored.\"\n\nFarmington claims that employee and city customers information was not breached, and that the city's email systems, public administration system, and public safety services were never affected.\n\nOn Jan. 18, a Farmington Daily Times report cited a text message from City Manager Rob Mayes, which said the city was able to recover the encrypted information without having to pay the ransom of three bitcoins.\n\nMeanwhile, a Jan. 18 report from Fort Wayne-area news outlet wane.com states that Decatur, Ind.-based Adams Health Network, operator of Adams Memorial Hospital, confirmed that its computers servers were impacted by a Jan. 11 ransomware attack.\n\nAnother Indiana-area health care provider, Hancock Regional Hospital in Greenfield, was also infected with ransomware on the same exact date, although it is not clear if the attacks were related.\n\nThe report further states that about 60 to 80 patients were impacted after an outpatient clinic and several physicians were unable to access patient histories and appointment schedules.

Not only is the sensitive information held by healthcare organisations immensely valuable on the dark web, fuelling healthcare fraud in the US, but cyber-criminals are increasingly seeing the value of the ransom over resale e-crime model, due to the immense pressure that hospitals are under to avoid any disruption.\n\n\u201cAs ransomware attacks on hospitals become more common, it is unsurprising that 85 percent of UK healthcare IT professionals and 68 percent of US healthcare IT professionals have a plan in place for this situation. However, as all good healthcare professionals know, prevention is better than treatment. All organisations must ensure that their security measures are up to scratch: from having all software patched and up to date and making sure users observe best practice, to deploying DNS effectively as an enforcement point to block ransomware.\u201d\n\nRaj Samani, chief scientist and Fellow at McAfee commented to SC Media UK: \u201cCyber-criminals are increasingly looking to cause as much public disruption as possible, and as part of this the global health industry has become a prime target. As the healthcare industry races to become more efficient and digitise processes where possible, the industry has become extremely vulnerable to attack.\n\n\u201cTo combat this trend, and reduce the growing numbers of attacks on public services, the cyber-security industry needs to make threat intelligence sharing an absolute priority. Traditionally many companies see their intelligence as a way of gaining a competitive advantage, however as the amount of disruption continues to increase, 2018 needs to be the year where intelligence sharing after a successful attack becomes the norm.\u201d\n\nJoseph Carson, chief security scientist at Thycotic adds in an email to SC Media UK: \u201cSometimes a simple click on a harmless looking email could bring critical systems to a standstill and doctors staring at blank screens. \n\n\u201cHospitals are exposed to ransomware and need to seriously consider the consequences of not prioritising cyber-security effectively. \u00a0Hospital's face the challenge of deciding whether to upgrade systems to the latest version of the patched software or more doctors and nurses, this is the crucial decision that the leaders must decide. When ransomware hits the hospital, it could mean that the doctors and nurses become restricted to what they can actually do as a result from their access to sensitive information not being available. \n\n\u201cHospitals now face the challenge again with recent vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown on whether to patch and expose systems to poor performance or keep the systems operational through exposed to cyber-threats. \u00a0\n\n \u00a0\n\u201cRansom is typically demanded in bitcoin with a 72-hour window to pay before the key is deleted and data is irreversibly lost. The impact this can have on an organisation is: temporary loss of systems and access to sensitive information; downtime of operations; financial impact or loss, and incalculable reputation damage. \u00a0The most recent variants of ransomware have gone into stealth mode. This means they avoid detection by hiding under the radar from traditional anti-malware software that scans the hard drive for malicious software.\n\n\u201cThe destructive nature of Ransomware and the impact it's had on individuals and organisations globally has prompted the US Department of Homeland Security, US-CERT and the FBI to release alerts encouraging organisations to take this threat seriously before it's too late.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cryptocurrency/topic/53434/", "topic_name": "Cryptocurrency"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/health-care/topic/47228/", "topic_name": "Health Care"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Belle Fourche (S.D.) city hall hit with ransomware", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/belle-fourche-sd-city-hall-hit-with-ransomware/article/736278/", "title": "Belle Fourche (S.D.) city hall hit with ransomware", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "January 10, 2018", "body": "The small city of Belle Fourche, S.D. was hit with a ransomware attack late last week with the malware encrypting at least some files and demanding a ransom.\n\nThe Black Hills Pioneer reported that at least two computers were locked up starting on January 4 with city workers eventually losing access and a ransom note appearing demanding payment to regain access to the data.

As power companies deploy these latest innovations for industrial monitoring and detection, they will be able to more quickly respond to block attackers before they can do significant harm.

After recognizing the extent of the problem, the IT team began disconnecting the county's various systems in order to protect them from being encrypted by the ransomware. This effectively knocked the entire county offline while it attempted to address the issue. The attack was enabled through a phishing attack when a county employee opened a malicious attachment which resulted in the ransomware being dropped.\n\nOnce paying the ransom was removed as an option, Gregg said the IT team implemented the county's prepared five phase cyber response plan. This included the force reset of all log-in credentials for county systems and user accounts and tightening the firewall rules.\u00a0\n\nOn December 6 the staff started rebuilding the county database using its back up files and brought in its various cybersecurity partners and law enforcement.

The victim does have to act quickly, as the attackers state the files will be permanently deleted if they are not paid within 96 hours.\n\nAbrams noted that due to the advanced level of encryption, it is not possible to use a free decryptor to save the data and that only implementing smart cybersecurity hygiene can protect a system.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Mecklenberg County restores some systems following ransomware attack", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mecklenberg-county-restores-some-systems-following-ransomware-attack/article/713750/", "title": "Mecklenberg County restores some systems following ransomware attack", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "December 12, 2017", "body": "Mecklenberg County (N.C.) officials reported some progress toward restoring government computer services following a ransomware attack last week and did not do so by paying the ransom demanded by the cybercriminals. \n\nCounty Manager Dena Diorio issued a statement on December 11 saying 16 applications affecting the Department of Social Services, Criminal Justice Services, payroll processing and Public Health had been restored by the county's IT department using back up files.

Malwarebytes believes this means the attacker only intended to run a small campaign.\n\nAn attack follows a pretty straight path. \n\n\u201cFirst, the ransomware checks the privileges with which it runs. If it has sufficient privileges, it deletes shadow copies. Then, it closes processes related to databases\u2014Oracle and SQL Server\u2014so that they will not block access to the database files it wants to encrypt.

At the time of analysis, the ransomware note, written in Portuguese was asking for the equivalent of 1,000 Brazilian real, or just over U.S. $300 (based on Dec. 1 conversion rates).\n\nBugware was coded using Hidden Tear, an open-source ransomware trojan program that was first published on GitHub in 2015. Zscaler researchers found that the malicious payload was using an invalid security certificate that fraudulently purported to be from the company Gas Informatica LTDA.\n\nThe ransomware encrypts several paths, including %Desktop%, %Documents%, %Music%, %Pictures%, and %Videos%, and also searches for\u00a0fixed, network, and removable drives to encrypt as well, while avoiding other whitelisted paths as well as files in directories containing certain strings, Zscaler explains.\n\nFiles are encrypted with an AES 256-bit algorithm, and then the AES key is further encrypted using RSA Public key. The malware then changes the desktop background to display the image of a bug, followed by the words \u201cAll Your files were encrypted!\u201d (in Portuguese), repeated multiple times in successive lines. Below that: an email address where the attackers could be contacted.\n\n At the time of analysis, the ransom note demanded a payment of $100, setting a deadline of four days before the ransom doubled.

But in the Nov. 16 mid-season finale, titled \u201cOut of Nowhere,\u201d Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital itself was on life support after its network became infected with ransomware, causing machines all over the facility to malfunction.\n\n\nThe storyline was no doubt a timely one, following a string of real-life ransomware attacks on hospitals and health-care facilities over the past two years. But how accurate was it in terms of portraying what an actual ransomware attack looks like? SC Media consulted with three leading health care cybersecurity experts to find out what was realistic and what was dramatic license. (Sadly, however, we could not persuade them to weigh in on the McDreamy vs. McSteamy debate.)\n\nOur experts:\n\nIn the first major sign of tech trouble, patients' monitoring systems all begin to flatline at once, even though there is no medical emergency. One doctor even mistakenly shocks a sleeping man with a defibrillator because it falsely appeared as if his heart stopped.\n\nTaylor Lehman (TL): While not impossible, doing this would be counter to the attacker's purpose, which was clearly to make money via ransomware\u2026 Learning how to make that software exhibit those behaviors would take more time than what would typically be expected by someone who is motivated for financial returns exclusively.\n\nElie Nasrallah (EN): Yes, it is possible they could all flatline, but, as Taylor suggests, not likely in the case of a financially motivated threat actor\u2026 [If attackers] get control of a computer, they can show what they choose, but more likely in real life, they will show a ransom note screenshot instead. So there may be some artistic license here.\n\nClyde Hewitt (CH): I think that's dramatic effect. The other thing is\u2026 in many instances, the staff would not know there's a ransomware attack underway until the IT department told them\u2026 IT's going to notice it first when network traffic goes crazy, CPUs start [malfunctioning] \u2013 there are a whole lot of flags on the back end before those [patient] monitors go down.\n\nBut it's not just the monitoring systems that are disabled. So too, are any devices connected to the network, including VOIP phones, CT scanners and scope monitors. According to our experts, it's not unusual to see all of this equipment networked together.\n\nTL: Many organizations rely on openly networked equipment to provide unfettered access to patient information...\u00a0In many cases, these networks are \u201cflat\u201d or unsegmented and not protected by internal firewalls. It's plausible that compromising one device could impact all other devices on the same network.\n\nEN: We live in a connected world. Many organizations have a simplistic network connected to single switches, but many have network segmentation.\n\nCH:\u00a0In my experience, it is one big flat happy family. There are hospitals that are progressive that are starting to isolate these things, but eventually they come back together \u2013 and the reason for that is the data in a lot of these medical devices get fed back into the EHR (Electronic Health Record system). Some hospitals are starting to put biomedical equipment on a separate wireless network... \u00a0[Other exceptions include] certain modalities or certain systems in an operating room \u2013 they have a different router, because everything that's physically inside the operating room is on this little microenvironment, and there's a router or a gateway that then connects that to the main hospital environment. So that's going to act like a firewall potentially.\n\nHowever, one issue that Grey's Anatomy failed to consider, or chose to ignore, is that many of these networked machines run on disparate software and operating systems (or versions of the same OS). This is especially true, noted Hewitt, because device manufacturers often stipulate in their terms of service that users cannot apply updates or patches.\n\nCH: I would anticipate that the average life expectancy of a piece of biomedical equipment in a hospital is probably 15 years. And as a result of that, the underlying operating systems for these things may be Windows 2007, but more than likely Windows XP or Windows 95, maybe Windows 2003 or Windows 2000, or maybe some old Linux or Unix. There's going to be a hodgepodge of stuff out there.\n\nAnd not every piece of equipment has all of its services running, It's overhead, it's not needed. So therefore, vulnerabilities [related to these services can't be exploited].\n\nIf an attacker does get in, they're not going to be successful at everything. It will be sporadic. So maybe it's a piece of a piece of lab equipment, maybe it's a heart monitor, maybe it's an EKG machine, maybe it's an IV pump. but it's not going to be everything, more than likely, because if a hacker gets in, they're going to get in with one, maybe two, vulnerabilities\u2026\n\nIt appeared in the TV show that [almost] everything was compromised. And while we can say the possibility of that happening is greater than zero, the probability of everything in the hospital being compromised is very remote.\u00a0\n\nTL: Of course, differences in software could make it hard for the same attack to work exactly the same on two machines running different software. But that's not how this stuff works: most bad software isn't written so that it works across multiple devices; [rather,] it looks for and finds ways to exploit common vulnerabilities.\u00a0These vulnerabilities may be present in lots of different types of software.\u00a0In many cases, these vulnerabilities exist and can be exploited in new software as well as software from 10-15 years ago.\n\nDuring the episode, the doctors are unable to look up their patients' medical charts. In one case, Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) doesn't know whether or not to administer the blood-thinner Heparin to Frankie, a seven-year-old blood disorder patient, because he can't determine whether a staff nurse already gave him vitamin K, which would cause a fatal drug interaction. This suggests that the doctors at Grey-Sloan Memorial don't keep paper backups in the event of technological difficulties.\n\nCH: I think that that is probably one of the more accurate depictions in the show. As hospitals move more and more into full electronics, paper's going away. So that is what keeps security professionals up at night: Not being able to get into the chart, not being able to find the history. That is a scary thought. Now, some organizations are looking to keep\u2026 an offline copy of the electronic charts, so that they can access it.\n\nTL: Many organizations plan for scenarios just like this and do have procedures to print information on patients under their care as a way of providing backup in case systems go down.\u00a0Most organizations drill on these procedures regularly to be ready for this.\u00a0In addition, most in-patient areas are staffed on 12-hour shifts, allowing the nurses and caretakers to establish an understanding of the treatment history during their time.\u00a0While not a replacement for a medical record, the continuity in nursing staff provides a frame of reference when dealing with specific patients.\u00a0\n\nThe hacker demands a 4,932 bitcoin ransom, which in this episode equates to $20 million \u2013 although in real life, it's actually worth closer to $51.2 million as of Nov. 28. Granted, the hacker chose this figure presumably because the hospital had announced a multimillion-dollar contest, but the experts still found this plot point a little hard to digest.\n\nTL: Bitcoin recently experienced a surge in value, making it very, very, very expensive to trade in.\u00a0This seems like a demand that has not been seen elsewhere.\u00a0If it were to be presented in this day and age, it would likely signal the attacker doesn't actually want to be paid \u2013 why demand an amount no one can afford? \u2013 and has alternative motives (e.g., destruction, extortion, access to specific records, etc.).\n\nEN: Hollywood Presbyterian paid $17,000 in ransom \u2013 at today's value that would be only two bitcoins. However, the outage and recovery costs can be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nLater, a splenectomy surgery requiring a blood transfusion is endangered when an intern is unable to open a door to the blood bank door, because the electronic keypad lock is affected by the attack. To make matters worse, the hospital's power starts fading in and out.\n\nCH: Not a high probability, because the SCADA systems that control the facility power and the access control systems may or may not be connected [to the network]. Now generally, for the physical access control system, there's a central server that downloads the access control codes to the individual doors. If the server goes down\u2026 the keypad doesn't need access to the server because it [the code] is stored locally.\n\nNormally, if a hacker's going to come in, they're going to go for the high-impact systems, like trying to take down the EHR or breaking into the EHR and taking medical records or doing ransomware across all of the desktops and mobile computers because that's going to have the most impact.\n\nWithin hours of the ransomware attack (perhaps even under an hour), the FBI swoops into the hospital, ordering the staff to turn off their computers and even their mobile Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\nTL: Not realistic.\u00a0The FBI's response would be far more measured and would avoid any kneejerk reactions, like shutting systems down.\u00a0Instead, the FBI and IT would be advised to do the basics to prevent proliferation of bad software, but would implement steps and measures to ensure they can figure out who did what, how they're doing it, and what's next.\u00a0You can't do that if you shut the computer systems down as the FBI indicated they should.\n\nEN: The FBI showing up in minutes only works in Hollywood. In most cases they are there to identify the threat actor and only act in an advisory capacity.\n\nCH: In reality if you call them, they're going to leave you alone for days until they call back. I found that to be highly Hollywood.\n\nThe doctors and FBI engage in a feisty ethical debate over whether or not to pay off the hacker \u2013 at act that will spare the hospital and its patients, but could encourage similar attacks in the future. Ultimately, Chief of Surgery Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) resolves to pay the ransom (although this would normally be the decision of an administrator, notes Hewitt).\n\nTL: Every attack is different. Some are destructive, some are looking for financial gain, while others are looking for payback.\u00a0These conclusions matter to determine the right response; attribution is important.\u00a0At this point, many hospitals are maturing their cyber programs to address the technical gaps in controls that could create those ethical dilemmas.\u00a0In many cases, organizations should NOT pay and instead ensure they have appropriate backups of their data and ability to restore easily.\n\nEN: This depends on the organization, since every situation might be handled differently. However, many hospitals have been forced to pay due to lack of good, clean backups and a timely process method to restore. This episode showed how quickly they needed the issue to stop, how they were scrambling under pressure to retain patient safety, and how little the doctors understood the magnitude of the attack. Ultimately, paying doesn't guarantee the systems will be restored.\n\nCH: They\u2026 made the decision to go ahead and pay the ransom, whereas that discussion generally doesn't even come up until it's days into the incident recovery process. Number one, they're going to say, \u2018How good are our backups? Can we recover? What's the timeline? And even then the FBI says \u2013 and we echo that \u2013 don't pay. You're dealing with criminals. You can't trust them. Who's to say they're not going to come back for more money?\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/health-care/topic/47228/", "topic_name": "Health Care"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Two Cryptomix variants spotted in under a week", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/0000-and-xzzx-cryptomix-variants-spotted-in-less-than-a-week/article/708674/", "title": "Two Cryptomix variants spotted in under a week", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "November 20, 2017", "body": "MalwareHunterTeam researchers discovered a second variant this week of the CryptoMix ransomware appending the .0000\u00a0extension to encrypted files.\n\nThe earlier variant was spotted Nov. 13, and appended the .XZZX\u00a0extension to encrypted file names.\u00a0\n\nBoth variants use the same ransom note in the latest variant earlier one but the latest version instructs users to contact different emails for payment information.

An anonymous source notified Bleeping Computer that the malware has been on the market since May 2017. \n\nThe advertisement for the malware said GIBON has the ability to use recursive encryption, leave README.txt files in messages to the users, encryption keys sent to an admin pane, and create decryptor and encryption keys. Once infected, the malware appends the .encrypt\u00a0extension to the encrypted file's name.\n\nThe malware's command and control (C2) server supplies the ransom note as opposed to the normal practice of it being hard coded in the executable allowing the developer to update it on the fly without having to compile a new executable, researchers said. Victims are registered to the C2 server and the ransomware will locally generate an encryption key and send it to the C2 server as a base64 encoded string.\n\nAs soon as the victim is registered the malware encrypts the devices targeting all files regardless of their extensions as long as they aren't in the Windows folder. \n\nIt's unclear how much money the criminals are requesting, but researchers said they left instructions to contact the emails\u00a0bomboms123@mail.ru or\u00a0yourfood20@mail.ru for payment instructions.\n\nThe criminals said the encryption is done with a 2048-bit key and that's it's impossible to decrypt files by standard means. \n\n\u201cAfter completion, a report is sent on how many files and on which disks are encrypted,\" the advertisement said. \u201cThe program does not increase privileges in the system, so it only works with files for which the user has the appropriate rights.\u201d\n\nWhile standard means may not allow decryption, researchers have already found a way to free up seized devices.

Making moves just like any legitimate business.\n\n\u201cAnalyzing the evolution of this actor and their techniques enables us to better understand the increasingly sophisticated techniques employed by crimeware threat actors, and, in particular, the general movement from reliance on automated exploits to the integration of social engineering to carry out infections,\u201d Kafeine wrote.\n\nTo go back to the beginning, before there was Kovter there was Zaccess/SecurityShield, a backdoor trojan used to deliver malvertising campaigns that helped install, among other bits of malicious software, scareware such as SecurityShield. This would be injected into a computer and display a pop up stating the computer was infected and needed to be cleaned, which could be accomplished by just clicking on the ad and paying for the service.\n\n\u201cKovCoreG has been at the forefront of malvertising, exploit kit usage, and, as EKs declined, social engineering, while distributing lucrative malware through multiple vectors. Through their relatively long history, the group has adapted to the shifting popularity of scareware, \u201cpolice locker\u201d ransomware, exploit kits, and, for the last few years, taken advantage of the massive scale and automation of online advertising,\u201d Kaffeine wrote. \n\nKovCoreG carried on happily spreading this malware between 2011 and 2013 using a variety of EKs like Blackhole, Redkit and Sakura.\n\nDuring this period the cybergang began testing malware that would soon be known as Kovter with a few samples being spotted in late 2012 and running into 2013. The first true version of Kovter appeared in March 2013 using Sakura and the group used the same scareware tactics as earlier, but in August of that year the social engineering was altered to indicate the person could face prosecution if they did not pay.\n\nInterestingly, in these basically pre-digital currency days the attackers requested the \u201cfine\u201d be paid via a Greendot MoneyPak that could be bought at retailers like Walmart, 7-11 and Walgreens.\n\nThe next change for Kovter came at the end of 2013 when KovCoreG added filtering and implemented a multistep infection chain to avoid it being spotted by ad agencies and reputation services that had earlier caused the group to restart campaigns.\n\nThe Styx EK was then used to drop Kovter starting in March 2014 and at the same time the gang made the move to morph Kovter from ransomware/scareware to ad fraud malware, the form it continues to use today. Other changes around this time included switching to the Sweet Orange EK, then over to Rig, back to Sweet Orange and finally to Nuclear in 2015 and they also used Angler to infect Internet Explorer users. This change also saw the use of fake Flash Player updates replacing their other social engineering to lure in victims.\n\nAt this point KovCoreG branched out and began using an affiliate model, or RaaS, as Kovter started appearing in other infection chains.\n\n\u201cKovCoreG also provides a window into the ways in which affiliate models can grow, increasing the footprint of a particular threat while spreading the risk for a single threat actor,\u201d Kafeine said.\u00a0\n\nIn April 2016 https was added making it harder for researchers to grab complete chains, Kafeine said.\u00a0\n\nThe following year the gang greatly expanded its malvertising campaigns to include a large number of new brands, including Burberry, Nordstrom and zulily. \u00a0\n\n\u201cKovCoreG demonstrates how a financially motivated actor can adapt, evolve, and innovate over several years, influencing the threat landscape while remaining effective and viable as they fly under the radar of law enforcement, the sites and ad networks they abuse, and end users,\u201d Kaffeine said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/flash/topic/47230/", "topic_name": "Flash"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malvertising/topic/50030/", "topic_name": "Malvertising"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "QtBot downloader discovered in geo-based Locky-Trickbot campaign", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/qtbot-downloader-discovered-in-geo-based-locky-trickbot-campaign/article/705032/", "title": "QtBot downloader discovered in geo-based Locky-Trickbot campaign", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "November 02, 2017", "body": "Researchers from Palo Alto Networks have uncovered a new piece of the puzzle in the case of an ongoing series of malspam campaigns that distribute either\u00a0Locky ransomware or the Trickbot banking trojan, depending on the victim's geographical location.\n\nThis latest discovery comes in the form of QtBot, an intermediate-stage downloader that helps to deliver the final payload, according to a Wednesday blog post from Palo Alto's Unit 42 threat intelligence team. Since Oct. 19, the researchers\u00a0observed more than 4 million \"unique sessions\" with QtBot activity, the report states.\n\nMalspam recipients unknowingly download QtBot upon opening malicious Microsoft Office email attachments that are designed to abuse\u00a0Microsoft Windows' Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. This same DDE technique was also observed in a recent spear phishing campaign impersonating the\u00a0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in order to infect victims with\u00a0DNSMessenger\u00a0malware.\n\nQtBot in this instance is being used as a replacement for malicious VBScripts that had been used in previous Locky-Trickbot distribution campaigns to query websites that provide geo-IP services in order to pinpoint the geographic region of a particular target, thereby determining the final payload.\n\nPalo Alto has likened QtBot to the\u00a0Andromeda\u00a0loader and bot, identifying it as a likely offshoot. Researchers note that both downloader threats exhibit similar\u00a0anti-analysis behaviors; analyze potential hosts' keyboard language identifiers to avoid infecting machines in former Soviet countries; and use Microsoft's Windows Installer program msiexec.exe for code execution.\n\nBlog post authors Brandon Levene,\u00a0Brandon Young\u00a0and\u00a0Dominik Reichel further describe QtBot as \"a Windows executable file that decrypts an importless stub into memory. This payload is later injected into msiexec.exe using common techniques. The payload then decrypts the second stage shellcode and injects it into a newly spawned svchost.exe process. This svchost.exe acts as the handler for the final payload.\"\n\nThe phishing emails serving up QtBot are spawned by the Necurs botnet, and generally trick recipients with generic subject-line lures that suggest the delivery of a financial document or file transfer. After opening a malicious document, users are prompted to click through three dialogue boxes, triggering an HTTP GET request to the command-and-control server, which Unit 42 researchers believe is likely a compromised webhost running a vulnerable version of [the commercial\u00a0web hosting\u00a0platform] PLESK.\" This C&C server then downloads QtBot, which is executed via a PowerShell directive.\n\n\"While geographic location specific malware delivery is not a new phenomenon, the combination of two previously disparate malware family affiliates utilizing unified malspam campaigns and droppers is an interesting shift in tactics,\" concludes the Unit 42 blog post. \"QtBot protects itself and the decision tree by which targeting is established and offers a significantly more robust anti-analysis package to stymie analysts.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "ONI ransomware used to cover track in long-term attacks against Japanese firms", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/oni-ransomware-used-to-cover-track-in-long-term-attacks-against-japanese-firms/article/704874/", "title": "ONI ransomware used to cover track in long-term attacks against Japanese firms", "author": "Rene Millman", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/rene-millman/author/4067/", "date": "November 02, 2017", "body": "In an analysis carried out by IT security company Cybereason, the firm discovered a new bootkit ransomware dubbed \u201cMBR-ONI\u201d used by the same threat actor in conjunction with ONI. This bootkit ransomware is based on\u00a0DiskCryptor, a legitimate disk encryption utility, the very same tool whose code was found in the recently discovered\u00a0Bad Rabbit\u00a0ransomware.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe suspect that the ONI ransomware was used as a wiper to cover up an elaborate hacking operation. These targeted attacks lasted between three to nine months and all ended with an attempt to encrypt hundreds of machines at once. Forensic artefacts found on the compromised machines show that the attackers made a significant attempt to cover their operation,\u201d said researchers in a blog post.\n\nResearchers concluded that both ONI and MBR-ONI stem from the same threat actor since they were used in conjunction in the same targeted attacks and their ransom note contains the same email address.\n\nIn analysis, the attacks on Japanese companies across different industries share a very similar modus operandi, the firm said. Phishing emails are sent to victims that contain a zip attachment with a malicious Word document inside it.\u00a0\n\nWhen the document is opened and macros enabled, a VBScript script is launched that downloads and installs a copy of the Ammyy Admin RAT onto the infected computer. Hackers use this legitimate tool to gain access to the system.\n\nIt then carries out a \u201cscorched earth\u201d policy, according to researchers. There is log deletion and distribution of ONI via rogue Windows group policy. These are pushed out across an organisation.\n\n\u201cUsing autorun persistence, the group policy would fetch a batch script from the DC server, which would wipe Windows' event logs clean in attempt to cover the attackers' tracks and avoid log-based detection. In addition, the ONI binary file was also copied from the DC and executed, encrypting a large array of files,\u201d said researchers.\n\nWhile ONI was used against most of the endpoints, MBR-ONI was used on only a handful of endpoints. \u201cThese endpoints were critical assets such as an AD server and file servers. We suspect that MBR-ONI was used as a wiper to conceal the operation's true motive,\u201d researchers said.\n\nThe attacks on Japanese firms lasted at least nine months between December 2016 (or possibly earlier) and September 2017.\n\n\u201cWhile both ONI and MBR-ONI clearly exhibit all the characteristics of ransomware, we provided arguments that support our suspicion that the attackers might have intended to use them as wipers rather than ransomware. We do not dismiss the possibility that financial gain was the motive behind these attacks. However, given the nature of the attacks and the profile of the targeted companies, other motives should not be dismissed lightly,\u201d said researchers.\n\nChris Doman, security researcher at AlienVault, told SC Media UK that ransomware, and more generally tools to destroy hard disks, have been used to make forensics harder in a number of sophisticated attacks. In particular, there are examples from attackers located out of\u00a0Iran,\u00a0Russia\u00a0and\u00a0North Korea.\n\n\u201cIn this case Cybereason don't provide any evidence for their suggestion that the ransomware was used to cover the tracks of other activity. The fact the attackers appear to have been on the network for some time may indicate that - but it's not unknown for ransomware attackers to do that either,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe usage of DiskCryptor to perform the actual hard-disk encryption is quite amateur - the attackers may not even be able to recover your files due to the way it operates in some circumstances.\u201d\n\nChristopher Littlejohns, EMEA manager at Synopsys, told SC Media UK that Corporate IT departments should make all reasonable efforts to secure their logs for forensic analysis to uncover root causes and potential impacts.\n\n\u201cThis can be achieved by ensuring logs can only be modified and deleted by specific system accounts, but also to secure their logs off the systems to a centralised log indexing and management capability. From an application and system perspective all reasonable efforts should be put in place to reduce the risk of privilege escalation that may allow access to system resources that should be protected,\u201d he said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Shame and confusion lead to employees paying ransoms out of pocket", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/shame-and-confusion-lead-to-employees-paying-ransoms-out-of-pocket/article/704865/", "title": "Shame and confusion lead to employees paying ransoms out of pocket", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "November 02, 2017", "body": "Whether out of shame for being victimized or confusion over what to do more than half of employees who fell victim to a ransomware attack decided to pay the ransom amount themselves, a recent survey found.\n\nThe study of 1,000 workers victimized by a ransomware attack, conducted by Intermedia, found that 59 percent paid the ransom out of pocket with 37 percent passing the cost along to their company.

Meanwhile Locky was found in only 3.9 percent of the attacks with Globeimposter, Petya and Jaff each being used less than 2 percent of the time. Sophos noted that WannaCry's jump to the top was facilitated by the old-school worm it used to propagate itself when it hit in May and June. \n\nCerber, despite being knocked into second place, is a very potent force and remains the most pervasive form of ransomware in use and maintained an even level of use while Wannacy had one huge spike and then more or less faded away.\n\nChester Wisniewski, Sophos' principle research scientist, said the world may be seeing \u201cpeak ransomware\u201d.\n\n\u201cRansomware as a problem is not going away, but it has spread to almost every place it can go,\u201d Wisniewski said, further explaining that the malware has now hit every type of device capable of sustaining a ransomware attack. \n\nThe United States, 17.2 percent, and Great Britain, 11.1 percent, bore the brunt of attacks during this period. \n\n\n\nThere was also a shift in who was victimized by ransomware with healthcare, government, critical infrastructure and education being targeted.\n\nWisniewski told SC Media in a one-on-one interview that the healthcare industry was most likely the most targeted industry because it is the least capable of defending itself and not because cybercriminals singled it out. Noting that most hospitals and similar institutions tend to have weak security they just happened to get hit when the criminals sent out their ransomware attacks.\n\n\u201cThey were not targeting healthcare it's just that hospitals are insecure that is why they are hit,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he also came to the defense of the healthcare industry stating they are often placed in the difficult position of having to choose between taking equipment offline for udpates or having it ready to help patients. In addition, many medical equipment providers do not allow their devices to be patched locally by the hospital staff and those that do so risk having their warranties terminated. \n\nWisniewski believes this situation will only change when the healthcare industry bands together to demand manufacturers offer to guarantee their hardware and software.\n\nHe also pointed out the human factor also has to change in hospitals and other critical infrastructure sectors. In many cases a hospital staff will bypass security settings, such as requiring each staffer to know their password, by simply placing a sticky note with that information on the machine. The thinking here, he said, is that it's better to have the machine ready for use in case of emergency than possibly losing a life while someone searches for the person with the password needed to turn on the machine.\n\n\u201cThey have to socially change to make security better,\u201d he said, but admitted these folks are again faced with a tough choice to make.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/health-care/topic/47228/", "topic_name": "Health Care"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "NSA hacking tool EternalRomance found in BadRabbit", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/nsa-hacking-tool-eternalromance-found-in-badrabbit/article/703488/", "title": "NSA hacking tool EternalRomance found in BadRabbit", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 27, 2017", "body": "BadRabbit evidence is multiplying, like well rabbits, with the latest revelation being the malware used another stolen NSA tool to help it move laterally through networks.\n\nSeveral research firms have named EternalRomance as the tool BadRabbit used to spread through an organization once the ransomware was installed in a host computer.

While we FireEye had not verified other experts' observation of known DPRK tools being used to drop early versions of WannaCry, it says it not observed other groups use the code present in both WannaCry and WHITEOUT and it do not believe it is available in open source. \u201cThis indicates a connection between the two,\u201d concluded Ben Read, Analyst, FireEye, going on to comment in an email to SC Media UK, \u201cOur analysis has found this unique code shared across additional North Korean malware, including NESTEGG and MACKTRUCK. Significantly, while this code is present in the MACKTRUCK malware, it is not used. The shared code likely means that, at a minimum, WannaCry operators share software development resources with North Korean espionage operators.\u201d\n\nHowever, other commentators urge caution in this attribution, such as \u00a0Bharat Mistry, principal security strategist at Trend Micro, who in an Opinion article to be published shortly in SC, noted, \u201cContrary to popular belief, it is actually possible to compromise computers inside the hermit nation. In fact, machines there are just as susceptible to malware as anywhere else. Data from our Smart Protection Network (SPN) shows that spam campaigns originating from the North Korean IP range are actually part of unsolicited email campaigns sent by larger botnets most likely operated from overseas.\u201d He concludes,\u201dThe North Korean internet isn't quite as tightly controlled as many think, meaning that machines inside the country have been compromised from overseas to launch attacks and conduct malicious activity.\u201d\n\nWallace had said: \"This attack, we believe quite strongly, came from a foreign state. North Korea was the state that we believe was involved this worldwide attack.\"\u00a0 He said officials were \"as sure as possible' and 'it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role\".\n\nThere was less information on what response the UK should or would take.\n\nIn contrast to the speculation about attribution, the NAO was based on agreed facts about the impact of the attack, and how it was made possible by poor patching and communication of response plans.\n\nAmyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office\u00a0 said, \u201cThe WannaCry cyber attack had potentially serious implications for the NHS and its ability to provide care to patients. It was a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice. There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks.\u201d\n\nThe report notes how on Friday 12 May 2017 a computer virus, known as WannaCry, which encrypts data on infected computers and demands a ransom payment to allow users access, was released worldwide. WannaCry was the largest cyber attack to affect the NHS in England, although individual trusts had been attacked before 12 May. Key findings of the investigation are:\n\nThe Department was warned about the risks of cyber attacks on the NHS a year before WannaCry and although it had work underway it did not formally respond with a written report until July 2017. It had been advised to migrate away from Windows XP by April 2015. In March and April 2017, NHS Digital had issued critical alerts warning organisations to patch their systems to prevent WannaCry but it was unable to monitor if departments had complied with its advice.\n\nThe attack led to disruption in at least 34 percent of trusts in England. In total at least 81 out of 236 trusts across England were affected. A further 603 primary care and other NHS organisations were infected by WannaCry, including 595 GP practices, but no patient data is believed to have been compromised or stolen. NHS England identified 6,912 appointments had been cancelled, and estimated over 19,000 appointments would have been cancelled in total. \n\nNo NHS organisation paid the ransom, but the Department does not know how much the disruption to services cost the NHS. \n\nThe cyber attack could have caused more disruption if it had not been stopped by Marcus Hutchins activating a \u2018kill switch' so that WannaCry stopped locking devices. \n\nThe Department had developed a plan, which included roles and responsibilities of national and local organisations for responding to an attack, but had not tested the plan at a local level, it was not immediately clear who should lead the response and there were problems with communications. Those involved were reported by the media as saying, no one knew what to do \u2013 and people reverted to using pen and paper and communicating via things such as Snapchat.\n\nAll organisations infected by WannaCry shared the same vulnerability and could have taken relatively simple action to protect themselves. Infected organisations had unpatched, or unsupported Windows operating systems so were susceptible to the ransomware. \n\nA recent report from the\u00a0cyber experts at EfficientIP\u00a0earlier this year found on average UK companies lagged behind other in patching their systems. Almost all (99 percent) of UK Public Sector\u00a0organisations said they did not apply the necessary security patches (compared to 83 percent \u00a0globally) to answer the eleven critical vulnerabilities released by BIND in 2016. \n\nSC Media UK also received email comments from various industry commentators who drew their own lessons from the report (see below):\n\nHerve Dhelin, EfficientIP VP Strategy, said:\u00a0\u201dLeaving noticed and published vulnerabilities unpatched is like leaving an open bar for hackers. We were shocked to find that so many companies with crucial data to protect did not apply available patches, and all took a long time to do it: ...companies need to understand the crucial importance of patching properly. The results can, and have often been devastating.\u201d\n\nThomas Fischer, threat researcher and global security advocate at Digital Guardian emailed SC Media UK saying, \u201cit will be interesting to see how the Government reacts. The fundamental question facing the NHS now is what actions to take. Does it focus on improving patient care, ensuring adequate staffing levels, and maintaining the essential physical infrastructure to meet immediate healthcare needs. Or, does it improve non-essential IT infrastructure that can always be replaced by good old fashioned pen and paper. What's clear from reviewing this report, is that the NHS's approach to IT management will have to change, one way or another. Two obvious areas to start would be improving user training and awareness of cyber-security and ensuring that there is enough available infrastructure to allow systems to be upgraded or patched in a rolling schedule, without negatively impacting productivity.\"\n\nNick Pollard, Security Intelligence & Analytics Director at\u00a0Nuix suggests that, \u201cPrevention needs to be at the forefront of any ransomware strategy. Since the endpoint is ground-zero for ransomware attacks, what the NHS needed was the ability to detect and put a stop to malicious behaviour as early as possible in the kill chain.\n\nNext-generation endpoint security can allow security teams to detect threats that are hidden or obfuscated deep in the system through continuous monitoring of activity straight from the kernel, giving them access to the rawest form of endpoint data available. This lets them detect and block malicious processes the instant they try to invade the organisation.\n\nJavvad Malik, security advocate at AlienVault, \u00a0says that\u00a0perhaps the \u00a0more telling aspect is that while the Department of Health had an incident response plan, it was neither communicated nor tested. \u201cWithout a clearly communicated and tested incident response plan, trying to make one up in the midst of an incident is a recipe for disaster.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMarco Cova, senior security researcher\u00a0at\u00a0Lastline\u00a0 notes how the National Health Service has annual budget in the region of \u00a3116 billion making it a massive target for cyber-attacks yet its poorly defended. \u201cPriorities for all NHS trusts are unsurprisingly targeted at medical needs over and above admin and operational needs, but, as the WannaCry incident demonstrated, IT security is nowadays an essential prerequisite to deliver core business functions, including medical care.\u201d \u00a0He add,\u00a0 \u201cNHS trusts have no choice but to invest in security, both in terms of better processes and better technology, to deal with cyber-threats.\"\n\nAndrew Clarke, EMEA director at One Identity pointed out that in many cases hacked \u00a0organisations do not have an inventory of all operating systems and applications that need to be patched \u2013 which makes the challenging task of patching even harder , saying that a robust patch management system would aid that.\u00a0 Unfortunately some of the specific medical equipment being used was only every designed to run Windows XP \u2013 so in that case the options are limited.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, \u201cWhat could have been done better was the compartmentalisation of environments that were known to be running older software so that if they did get impacted, the damage could be limited.\u00a0 \n\nCsaba Krasznay, security evangelist,\u00a0Balabit\u00a0 suggests that it is possible, and in fact, strongly recommended, to work toward speeding up the patching cycle, and even introduce technology that ensures only machines with the right security posture are allowed to access the organization's information resources.\n\nCommenting on the news, Mark James, security specialist at ESET says\u00a0 \u201cIt does seem like a huge breakdown in communications and would highlight an urgent need to get things right for the time when a\u00a0sophisticated\u00a0attack gets hold- unlike Wannacry, that technically was not sophisticated at all! Hopefully not just the NHS, but many companies around the world, suddenly jumped into action to avoid further outbreaks and have put plans in place to stop the next unnecessary cyber disaster from happening\u2026.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/health-care/topic/47228/", "topic_name": "Health Care"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/network-security/topic/47224/", "topic_name": "Network Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Wise-guy attackers revise Sage ransomware", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/wise-guy-attackers-revise-sage-ransomware/article/703132/", "title": "Wise-guy attackers revise Sage ransomware", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "October 26, 2017", "body": "A evolved version of Sage ransomware has materialized that features a QR code containing the attacker's bitcoin wallet address, to enable easy payment.\n\nAnother recent addition is improved\u00a0anti-analysis capabilities that allow the malicious code to detect and avoid commonly used malware research tools. \"Earlier versions used variation in the delivery tools -- highly variable script applications -- to evade detection and frustrate analysis,\" said\u00a0blog post author Brendan Griffin, in an interview with SC Media. \"This new version focuses on the detection of virtualized environments, including malware sandboxes.

He cited similarities in the code and how the attackers laid the groundwork for BadRabbit with other hacks.\n\n\u201cIt is highly likely that the same group of hackers was behind [the] BadRabbit ransomware attack on October the 25th, 2017 and the epidemic of the NotPetya virus, which attacked the energy, telecommunications and financial sectors in Ukraine in June 2017,\u201d Mirkasymov said in his report. \n\nGroup IB was the first research firm to identify that BadRabbit had hit the wild on October 24.\n\nMirkasymov said the code similarities are close enough to believe that BadRabbit and NotPetya were created by the same person or the author at least had access to NotPetya source\n\n\u201cBased on disassembling and researching the code of BadRabbit we assume that BadRabbit was compiled from NotPetya source code as another project with several additions,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, in both attacks modules are packed with zlib 1.2.8 in resources, with one difference in BadRabbit, which additionally xored them with constant 0xE9.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoreover the way the attackers prepped the battlefield, so to speak, by hacking into several Russian media websites, turning them into watering holes, is similar to how the NotPetya attacks transpired.

The primary delivery method does not use a known exploit, like Petya/NotPetya did with EternalBlue, but instead utilizes watering hole attacks that has a fake Flash update notification appear when a victim visits the site. In many of the original instances Russian media sites were used as the watering holes.\n\nU.S. CERT did not name which firms reported being hit with the malware in its alert only that it had received multiple reports. The organization did say it suspects BadRabbit is a variant of Petya/NotPetya and that it discourages individuals and organizations from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored. \n\nU.S. CERT is not the only organization drawing comparisons between BadRabbit and Petya/NotPetya. There is evidence \u00a0starting with its ability to move laterally through a network, but other similarities also exist, ranging from using similar tactics to more obvious clues such as the lock screen being similar to the earlier malware. \n\nThese have helped fuel the on-going argument over where BadRabbit stands in relation to Petya/NotPetya.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nVyacheslav Zakorzhevsky, head of the anti-malware research team at Kaspersky Lab, told SC Media he sees clear ties between the two malware types and he believes the latest attackers have been preparing for this launch since July 2017.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cThe hashing algorithm used in the Bad Rabbit attack is similar to the one used by ExPetr.\u00a0 Further, experts have found that both attacks use the same domains; and similarities in the respective source codes indicate that the new attack is linked to the creators of ExPetr. Like ExPetr, Bad Rabbit tries to grab credentials from the system memory and spread within the corporate network by WMIC,\u201d he said.\n\nCarbon Black researcher Brian Baskin noted in a blog that while additional analysis is needed he considers BadRabbit to be a Petya/NotPetya variant.\n\n\u201cAnalysis is forthcoming, but initial views show that it is a variant of the NotPetya sample. It is not known yet if there is actual code re-use or if simply the tactics and strings were copied from analyzed versions of NotPetya. Just as NotPetya dropped a file named perfc.dat, and called it by an export ordinal value, this Bad Rabbit will drop a similar file named infpub.dat and call it using an almost identical method,\u201d he said.\n\nMalwarebytes took this a step further and reported BadRabbit was produced by the team behind Petya/NotPetya, although the security firm did not offer any evidence to back this theory.\n\nBadRabbit so far differs from its earlier cousin by actually being ransomware, whereas Petya's task was to simply render victim's system inoperable and did such a thorough job that companies like the shipping firm Maersk, pharmaceutical giant Merck\u00a0and FedEx\u00a0were feeling the impact for months following the attack. \u00a0\n\n\u201cBad Rabbit does seem as though it's geared to make money, unlike NotPetya, which pretty much pretended to be ransomware but in fact trashed your computer to cause network disruption rather than to 'impose' a direct financial cost,\u201d \u00a0Paul Ducklin, Sophos Senior Technologist emailed to SC Media.\n\nWhile the attackers may be interested in making a few bucks, so far the evidence points to most victims taking U.S. CERT's advice and not paying up. BadRabbit asks for a .05 bitcoin ransom, about $280, but Gabriel Gumbs, vice president of product strategy for STEALTHbits Technologies told SC Media that he saw only three payments related to the attack made so far to two bitcoin wallets.\n\nOn the bright side, Rapid7 has heard, but could not confirm, reports that two of those who paid did receive a key.\n\nThere are two points everyone is agreeing upon.\n\nThe first is that BadRabbit is not using the EtnernalBlue during any stage of the attack. Instead the malicious actors are using SMB to spread the malware. \n\n\u201cBad Rabbit has the ability to spread via an SMB component used for lateral movement and further infection. This appears to use a combination of an included list of weak credentials and a version of Mimikatz similar to that which was used in Nyetya,\u201d said Gumbs.\n\nThe second is that nobody knows who is behind the attacks.\u00a0Bob Rudis, chief data scientist at Rapid7, said, \"We can say that this attack is more sophisticated and less \"noisy\" than previous ones this year, and the campaign appears to be well-thought out, given that the attackers began setting up purloined infrastructure well-before the attack and ensured they there was no easy \"kill switch\" or way to spread over the internet.\"\n\nTrend Micro's research shows BadRabbit spreads to other computers in the network by dropping copies of itself in the network using its original name and executing the dropped copies using Windows Management Instrumentation and Service Control Manager Remote Protocol. When the Service Control Manager Remote Protocol is used, it uses dictionary attacks for the credentials.\n\nAnother difference between BadRabbit and Petya/NotPetya is it can be blocked. Unlike the earlier malware, BadRabbit did not come equipped with a kill switch, but within hours of the malware being spotted Cybereason researcher Mike Iacovacci posted a series of steps to take that will prevent a system from being infected with BadRabbit.

The ransomware/EK combo began striking South Korean targets on October 15 and doing so in a way not seen before in a ransomware. Magnitude is using methods such as language checks, external IP and geolocation to ensure that only South Koreans are impacted.\n\n\u201cTargeting a single country is unusual on its own, but performing multiple checks to be sure of the country and language of origin makes this a first for ransomware,\u201d Malwarebytes researchers noted.\n\nTrend Micro's fraud researcher Joseph Chen agreed noting that while Cerber, SLocker and Locky are used in pinpoint attacks these are not limited to just one country, but are carried out worldwide. Trend's researchers also found it interesting that Magnitude had disappeared briefly from the threat map starting on September 23 before starting its South Korean attacks on October 15 and prior to that had mainly been used against targets in Taiwan where it dropped more well-known types of ransomware.\n\nConsidering the high-stakes game of political brinkmanship that has taken place surrounding the Korean peninsula over the last several that has seen North Korean hackers attacking their southern neighbor, not to mention missile tests and military exercises being conducted by both sides, it might be understandable to believe North Korea is responsible. However, Jerome Segura, Malwarebytes' lead malware intelligence analyst, told SC Media\u00a0 that while the study did not look at a geopolitical motivation, but thought more might be learned about the attacker's motivation in the coming weeks.\n\nTrend Micro also does not point any fingers.\n\n\"Trend Micro does not disclose attribution of nation-state activities mainly because we feel attribution is extremely hard to accurately identify based on most of the IoCs,\" Jon Clay, Trend's director of global threat communications, told SC Media.\n\nThe attacks themselves are conducted through malvertising and currently Magnitude is exploiting the previously patched CVE-2016-0189, a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer. Encryption is mostly AEX in CBC mode, Malwarebytes reported.\n\nIf a non-Korean target does happen to come across Magnitude/Magniber Malwarebytes said it runs a quick ping command and then deletes itself.\n\nAnother odd aspect is the ransom note that is generated is in English and in some ways mimics what a Cerber ransomware victim might see, Malwarebytes noted.\n\nHowever, Chen said there are some indications that the Magniber attacks may represent a test case, possibly being either conducted by or with the permission of Magnitude's creators, and he predicts the attack will be further developed.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/exploit/topic/47246/", "topic_name": "Exploit"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Phishing campaigns used victim's location to determine whether to deliver Locky or Trickbot", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing-campaigns-used-victims-location-to-determine-whether-to-deliver-locky-or-trickbot/article/701516/", "title": "Phishing campaigns used victim's location to determine whether to deliver Locky or Trickbot", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "October 19, 2017", "body": "Researchers at PhishMe recently detected two email-based phishing campaigns that infected users with either Locky ransomware or the Trickbot banking trojan based on the victim's geographical location \u2013 a technique that the company claims is rather uncommon.\n\nAccording to a company blog post published last week, the first campaign on Sept. 28 was designed to distribute TrickBot to targets in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the UK. All other locations received Locky. This operation was followed by another Trickbot-Locky phishing campaign on Oct. 11, which relied on a malicious script that had recently evolved to include a command-and-control reporting mechanism.\n\nBoth campaigns were part of a larger effort to distribute two new variants of Locky known as Ykcol and Asasin, PhishMe Threat Intelligence Manager Brendan Griffin told SC Media. But these two examples stood apart from the other contemporaneous campaigns because of how geography dictated whether the victim received the ransomware or TrickBot instead.\n\nThe combination of two threats in one also forces security professionals at multinational organizations to execute different incident response strategies in differently affected regions, the blog post explains.\n\n\"By using different tools, attackers open up multiple fronts where network defenders and information security professionals are presented with multiple potential threats to address at the same time,\" explain post authors and PhishMe threat analysts Neera Desai and Victor Cornell. \"Without the help of sufficient context, could create a scenario that puts network defenders at a disadvantage.\"\n\nIn the Sept. 28 campaign, the phishing emails came with an attached .7z archive containing a malicious VBScript application responsible for delivering either Locky or TrickBot. The VBScript would make this determination by first querying three websites \"that provide geo-IP services to determine where the target is located,\" the PhishMe report explains.\n\nThe Oct. 11 campaign worked very similarly, with a couple of notable enhancements. For one, the VBScript initiated a POST request to the C&C server, in order to signal a successful infection, as well as to convey the payload URL, Windows Host OS version and a unique identifier number. Also, the VBScript included references to the side-scrolling video game Cobalt. \"This was likely an attempt to defeat heuristic scanning of the code,\" intelligence analyst Chase Sims explains in an Oct. 19 blog post.\n\nA previous PhishMe report described a previous Locky phishing campaign that similarly used Game of Thrones references within the VBScript.\u00a0\n\nIn a separate report last September, Trend Micro reported on another spam campaign that served up either Locky or FakeGlobe ransomware, based on an ongoing rotation between the two programs.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Ykcol and Asasin Locky variants released within short time frame", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/two-new-locky-variants-released-within-a-month-of-each-other/article/700229/", "title": "Ykcol and Asasin Locky variants released within short time frame", "author": "Robert Abel", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/robert-abel/author/3631/", "date": "October 13, 2017", "body": "At least two new Locky ransomware variants have been released within less than a month of each other although one of the variants is broken for the time being due to a malformed spam campaign.\n\nTrustwave researchers spotted a new Locky ransomware variant dubbed ykcol, Locky spelled backwards, in a Sept. 19 spam blast targeting 3 million inboxes within a three hour period and most recently Bleeping Computer researchers spotted a\u00a0new Locky ransomware variant Oct. 10 which uses the .asasin\u00a0extension for encrypted files.\n\nThe ykcol ransomware follows the same convention as a previous Lukitus version of the Locky, is packed with Game of Thrones references, and is distributed via Necurs gang which is also used to spread TrickBot banking trojan numerous other ransomware variants.\n\nThe ykcol variant tries to entice users to open the malicious attachment using subject lines that mimic messages from usernames or as invoice notifications.

The ransomware requires that the threat actor have GUI access to the system, uses no code obfuscation, and requires threat actors to maintain the stability of the system. \n\nCarbon Black researchers further examined the ransomware and found that during the setup stages, the malware's author uses three API calls, BeginUpdateResourceW, UpdateResourceW, EndUpdateResourceW, to match the version language information of the malware to the native explorer.exe binary, according to an Oct. 2, blog post.\n\nResearchers said this combination of APIs allows the malware to read in the version information, apply it to the malware, and look like explorer on disk. \n\nThe malware then looks to hide its origins on the system by performing final anti-forensic tasks and clears both the SYSTEM and SECURITY logs, deletes the copy backups from the systems, deletes any shadow copies from the system, and attempts to hide from the victim by impersonating explorer.exe.\n\n\u201cIn order to complete the charade, Kangaroo performs time stomping on the malware by reading in explorer's create/write/access times and applying them to itself using GetFileTime and SetFileTime,\u201d researchers said in the post. \u201cThis combination can make it difficult to locate the malware if traditional timeline forensics are performed on the system.\u201d\n\nThe Kangaroo ransomware family also uses an encryption whitelist to prevent any damage from occurring to the system itself.\n\nResearchers recommend users prevent or limit access to RDP from the internet or at least use two-factor authentication where it is required to prevent infections.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Ransomware Resurrected", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware-resurrected/article/696196/", "title": "Ransomware Resurrected", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "October 02, 2017", "body": "As Stephen King once put it, \u201cSometimes they come back.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLike a dormant volcano that may suddenly awaken at any moment, ransomware programs are an unpredictable lot. They may lay low for a while, or fall out of favor. But then they reemerge, often with new tricks up their sleeve.\n\nIndeed, ransomwares never truly die \u2013 at least, not until a decryptor renders their powers useless. But what is it about certain ransomwares that make them so viable for multiple comebacks? And why with each surprise return do they remain so difficult to protect against?\u00a0\n\n\u201cMalware, especially ransomware, seems to run in cycles,\u201d says Derek Manky, global security strategist at Fortinet. \u201cWe'll track a large number of triggers and exploit attempts for months. Over that time, a number of variants will be launched that either change the attack vector, improve the malware payload, refine its ability to avoid detection, or change how it communicates with its command-and-control server. They can lie dormant for a while, and re-activate in microseconds once attackers decide it is time to launch a new campaign.\u201d\u00a0\n\nLocky is a prime example: The ransomware made waves when it debuted in early 2016 and soon after infected Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, triggering a scourge of similar attacks against the health-care industry. Then in 2017 it fell mostly quiet, until the Necurs botnet pushed it heavily in April, and then once again in August with the two newest variants (as of this printing), Diablo6 and Lukitus.\u00a0\n\nCerber, a ransomware-as-a-service (RAAS) product, has also played hide-and-seek since its 2016 debut, periodically popping up with new features such as anti-detection and anti-sandboxing techniques, as well as the ability to steal cryptocurrency wallets and passwords.\u00a0\n\n\u201cEvery time it returns, it comes back stronger and smarter than ever,\u201d says Manky. \u201cBoth Cerber and Locky now have a large number of variants that have been developed, and quite often there are several running simultaneously in the wild.\u201d\n\nTorrentLocker dates back even further. According to Kaspersky Lab, the ransomware has experienced at least five significant releases since 2014.\u00a0\u201cIts authors have made several major changes\u2026and it is still spreading, although not as aggressively as Cerber and other ransomware strains,\u201d said Ondrej Vlcek,\u00a0Avast\u00a0CTO and EVP and GM, consumer. Vlcek also cited Hidden Tear, a ransomware that began as an open-source project but was turned malicious by amateur developers. \u201cWe continue to see new offspring of this ransomware on a regular basis, despite the fact that it known for its poor code quality.\u201d\n\nThere are any number of explanations for why Locky, Cerber and even older ransomware programs seem to wax and wane in activity. One key reason is that the malware authors are using their downtime to improve their weapons, evolving them with new key features for the next round of infections.\n\n\u201cEach campaign reveals a new trick, and is responded to with a new counter-defense,\u201d says Sean Sullivan, security advisor at F-Secure.\n\nTake Locky, for instance: \u201cIt started out with as a simple ransomware that phoned home to its command-and-control servers and downloaded an RSA key to be used along with the AES encryption algorithm for encryption of files,\u201d says Vincent Weafer, VP of\u00a0McAfee\u00a0Labs. \u201cOver time, the attackers made quite a few changes to it, including changes in the names used in the encrypted files to evade existing detections, using hardcoded RSA keys so that a target system will be encrypted and held hostage even if the system does not have internet connectivity, and changes to the types of executables from PE files to DLLs.\u201d\n\nWeafer said that Locky's operational model tends to be to build up the attack infrastructure, then run massive malspam campaigns, collect the resulting ransom payments, and finally \u201ccut and run,\u201d using the ensuing quiet period \u201cto work on the next evolution of the ransomware.\u201d\n\nHowever, Vlcek,\u00a0argues that Locky's most recent disappearing and reappearing act likely wasn't due to development cycles or major code changes, as there are \u201cvirtually no new modifications in the latest version of the strain.\u201d Perhaps, then, the explanation is far more simple: \u201cRansomware operators and authors are\u2026 humans that take time off from their work\u201d like everyone else,\u201d said Vlcek, also suggesting that they might be using the time off to \u201cexperiment with different distribution methods.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIndeed, a ransomware's activity can also depend on the availability of distribution channels such as malspam botnets and exploit kits. \u201cIf one distributor uses a hot exploit on a high-traffic site, for example, [a ransomware program] is able to jump to hundreds of thousands or possibly over million victims in a short period of time,\u201d says Manky.\u00a0\n\nRansomware developers may also temporarily close up shop \u2013 only to reopen later \u2013 because feel they are attracting too much attention, or believe the authorities are breathing down their necks.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMedia and market attention are likely catalysts for any ransomware strain. Financially motivated attackers will often try to strike a balance between obtaining maximum revenues while staying under the radar of the security industry and the media,\u201d says Rich Barger, director of security research at Splunk. \u201cIn fact, public awareness of various ransomware strains can be counterproductive to hackers, who do not want\u00a0to bring undue attention to their schemes. Staying under the radar helps hackers maximize efficacy and longevity of their exploit capabilities and payloads.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIn the cases of RAAS offerings, certain popular ransomware services may suddenly take a back seat to a seemingly bigger, badder new kid on the block \u2013 or a cheaper one \u2013 before building up its user base again. It's all part of the ebb and flow.\u00a0\n\nBut not all ransomwares are destined for longevity. So what makes the most enduring ransomwares so hard for users to protect against, while others are more of a flash in the pan?\u00a0\n\nThe primary quality of any type of ransomware which makes it viable, new or old, is its efficacy,\u201d says Barger. \u201cSo, variables such as anti-virus or email gateway detection can impact how effective ransomware campaigns might be.\u201d\u00a0\n\nClearly, one of the keys to long-term efficacy is how advanced the encryption is. \u201cThe first versions of ransomware used very weak encryption and didn't last very long,\u201d says Manky. \u201cMore successful ransomware uses public/private key pairs for each victim making it much stronger. The ransomware families that do this are the most profitable because they do not use weak encryption, meaning the key cannot be reverse engineered with ease.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsymmetric encryption techniques used by these ransomwares make it difficult to create reliable decryptors by AV companies,\u201d says Weafer. \u201cThis, coupled with the fact that ransomware like Locky\u2026 provide excellent victim support and make decryptors available if the ransom is paid, contributes to their success, since a high likelihood of decryptors being distributed will lead to more victims paying the ransoms.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIndeed, the creation of an effective decryption tool is very likely the death knell of a ransomware program. \u201cAuthors will either stop investing in the ransomware strain or try to create an entirely new strain that leverages the lessons the author learned with the previous strain,\u201d says Vlcek.\n\nThe ability to leverage a wealth of different proliferation techniques, including exploit kits and spam emails, also contributes to a ransomware's success, as does having an established infrastructure and operational model in place. \u201cMature, standardized development infrastructure and practices are already in place for ransomware like Locky. Thus, running new campaigns is easier which leads to periodic resurgence of new variants,\u201d said Weafer. \u201cIn the case of RaaS models, distributors are more likely to go with established Ransomware which is more likely to ensure a payout.\u201d\u00a0\n\nExperts also cited a ransomware's persistence mechanisms, secure payment methods, and profit-sharing terms (in the case of RaaS agreements) as additional factors affecting its long-term effectiveness and overall survival.\n\nOf course, a lot of the above boils down to the skills of the developer. Indeed, \u201cSome strains vanish shortly after their initial appearance because their authors lack the skills to implement a proper chain of encryption, payment, infrastructure, and delivery, said Vlcek.\n\nAs established ransomware families continue to evolve, the onus will be on organizations to keep pace and maximize their protection.\n\n\u201cWe are sometimes our own worst enemy. Most organizations do not have a proper detection and segmentation strategy, which means they can't see malware that is operating deep in the network or prevent it from spreading,\u201d said Manky. \u201cAnd because ransomware is beginning to spread using worm-like behaviors, they are much more difficult to defend against, especially if patches are not in place.\u201d\n\nStill, Sullivan at F-Secure believes the security professionals are better at stopping ransomware than they get credit for. \u201cSuccess is quiet. Failures are noisy. I would suggest at least part of the issue is perception,\u201d says Sullivan. \u201cIt's not significantly more difficult to defend against ransomware than banking trojans from five years ago.\u00a0It's just that the stakes feel higher because people having their pockets picked isn't as dramatic as those being extorted at gunpoint.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Alive and Kickin'", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/alive-and-kickin/article/696192/", "title": "Alive and Kickin'", "author": "Teri Robinson", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/teri-robinson/author/3627/", "date": "October 02, 2017", "body": "Do you remember where you were the day ransomware died? Me neither. Because, of course, it didn't. But right about mid-2015, many of us were donning our finest, combing our hair and shining our shoes in preparation for the funeral of one of cybersecurity's biggest menaces. \n\nAnd then 2016 blew in with a vengeance. And 2017 hasn't been any better with ransomware like WannaCry and NotPetya, the resurrection of \u201cold,\u201d familiar ransomware with brand-new twists and the promise of an abundance of new threats and challenges that should keep ransomware alive and kicking for a long time to come.\n\nSounding an early death knell was (sort of) understandable - c'mon now, wouldn't simply backing up files, something any organization or individual could easily do, solve the problem? Wasn't the problem that most routinely didn't? Wouldn't the fix just require a little best practice mojo? In tech years that age of innocence lasted about a millisecond. \n\nNearly two brutal years later, though, research from the likes of Infoblox, SANs, BlackHat and ESG find ransomware among the top three threats, often at the top of the list.\n\n\u00a0\u201cEveryone interacting with the Internet is at risk for\u00a0ransomware,\u201d says Michael Patterson, CEO of Plixer. \u201cThe continued proliferation of this type of malware re-enforces that we are losing the compromised data war.\u201d \n\nAnd battered companies hesitantly, and with trepidation, ask, what's next?\n\nWhat's old is new again\n\nNo look into future ransomware threats is complete without at least a peek at the past, in fact it's where the future starts. Not to go into too much detail - that's another story to be told on another page (See Ransomware Resurrected, page tk) \u2013 companies will continue to see old ransomware evolve into new attacks. Take Cerber, Locky and TorrentLocker which, if they didn't exactly rise up from the dead (because they never died), re-emerged more recently to wreak havoc with new features and purposes. \n\nIn more recent months, there's been \u201can uptick in polymorphic malware in zero-day attacks and advanced exploits,\u201d notes Rod Murchison, vice president of product management at CrowdStrike. \u201cPolymorphic\u00a0ransomware, distributed at scale, can take down millions of servers in a matter of minutes as we saw with WannaCry.\u201d\n\nThe most common ransomware is still file corruption using cryptographic API, according to Imperva's blog. With good reason \u2013 it still works and is profitable for attackers. But the firm says that database corruption attacks through SQL queries are on the rise, as evidenced by the latest incidents waged against the likes of MongoDB and MySQL. Makes sense because databases house companies' most sensitive data.\n\n\u201cRansomware\u00a0attacks have been widespread this year and as these recent attacks against MongoDB show, there's a growing trend of\u00a0ransomware\u00a0attacks against big data databases in the form of database corruption attacks,\u201d says Morgan Gerhart, vice president of product marketing at Imperva. \u201cAs the volume of data grows, the challenge of securing it is tied to the nature of the data itself.\u201d\n\nThe enormity of data volumes associated with these NoSQL databases presents presents challenges to those charged with protecting it, requiring \u201csecurity solutions built to handle them,\u201d says Gerhart. \u201cThis means incredibly scalable solutions that are, at a minimum, an order of magnitude beyond that for traditional data environments. Additionally, these security solutions must be able to keep up with big data speeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe multiplicity of big data environments is what makes big data difficult to secure, not necessarily the associated infrastructure and technology,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no single logical point of entry or resource to guard, but many different ones, each with an independent lifecycle.\u201d\n\nBut that sea of data makes would-be attackers salivate. \u201cAnd, when you combine this large volume of business data with\u00a0ransomware, attackers see dollar signs,\u201d says Gerhart, cautioning that \u201cwhile protecting the data in your databases is important, monitoring big data services like MongoDB and Hive, which are \u2018databases on steroids,' is just as important. Data corruption, like in MongoDB, is a key growth area for attackers.\u201d\n\nEncryption, the most common method of corruption, is not the only method. It can, and will more frequently in the future, come in the form of wiping out files, dropping database tables and mucking around with the data's integrity. That latter is particularly scary since corrupted data can have huge impact way down the road.\n\nData out, money in\n\nData exfiltration is \u201cwhere big money is still waiting to be had,\u201d Imperva says, pointing to the Vault 7 attacks that had hackers steal documentation on the CIA's cyberweapons, which was then posted by WikiLeaks.\n\nIf the motive was money, the blog post notes, more of it was to be had by selling the information on the dark web rather than encrypting it and pressing for a ransom.\n\n\u201cMaking private data public can scare data owners the most. That's probably why the popularity of extortionware\u2013aka\u00a0doxware\u2013 is going to rise. Exposing financial records, medical records, state-actor data, pending patents or any other sensitive data is a major threat,\u201d says Imperva, calling exfiltration \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d with the \u201cpotential to continue to be a huge money-making machine.\u201d\n\nAlso lucrative to attackers out for monetary gain are disruptive, targeted attacks against organizations with large, customer bases. Targeted attacks, though, are more expensive and time-consuming to execute.\u00a0 By exploiting a Web vulnerability, though, attackers can gain access to large numbers of devices and customers.\n\n\u201cA vulnerability in the web server communicating with the app or update mechanism can lead to remote code execution on these vehicles,\u201d says the Imperva blog. \u201cFor example, hackers could hold you hostage and demand a ransom, while threatening to disable your car's brakes or steering system.\u00a0The even more chaotic scenario (and bigger payout) is a hacker taking control of all of a specific vendor's connected cars and demanding a ransom directly from the vendor.\u201d\n\nLook out, IoT\n\nThe connected car example could serve as a cautionary tale for the Internet of Things on whole. As devices continue to proliferate \u2013 many being developed without much thought to security and others not updated with the latest security patches \u2013 the likelihood of ransomware attacks proliferates as well. A recent (Blackhat/Plixer tk?) study found that more than 70 percent of organizations were concerned about an IoT-based ransomware attack. \u00a0\n\n\"Over the next two years, cybercriminals behind\u00a0ransomware\u00a0will shift their attention to 'smart devices' permanently connected to the internet i.e. devices which form the Internet of Things,\u201d says Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum (ISF). \u201cWhile holding specific devices for ransom will offer lucrative ways to grow their revenues, attackers will also use these devices as gateways to install\u00a0ransomware\u00a0on other devices and systems throughout an organization.\u201d\n\nDurbin notes that \u201cthe downstream impacts (e.g. interruptions to business operations and automated production lines) may appear severe, but will fade into the background when lives are put at risk by attacks on medical implants or vehicle components\u201d and that \u201csimply restoring from a data backup (rather than paying the attacker) will not be an option.\u201d\n\nAn affected organization, he says, \u201cwill face the potential of a double financial hit as it is forced to pay a large\u00a0ransom to protect its people or resume normal operations, and then to retrospectively build in security.\u201d\n\nThe rising popularity of \u201cIoT will extend the potential attack surface for those installing\u00a0ransomware, with target devices increasingly found in places as diverse as cars, trains, homes, offices, factories and hospitals. They will also be embedded in human bodies as facilitators of improved health,\u201d says Durbin. \u201cHowever, as the security of IoT devices continues to be overlooked, they will create new opportunities for cyber criminals to remotely encrypt digital files and demand payment (typically in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin) from the owner for access or operation to be restored.\u201d\n\nA recent recall of St. Jude's pacemakers by the FDA sounds the alarm for a \u201clives-at-risk\u201d scenario. \u201cThis incident is a reminder of how software has become integral to almost every aspect of our lives, and how security vulnerabilities aren't something that we only need to worry about if we're shopping or banking online,\u201d says Mike Pittenger, director of security strategy, Black Duck. \u201cIn this case, the software is driving a device that it is essentially part of a patient's body and responsible for maintaining life.\u00a0 Imagine a\u00a0ransomware\u00a0attack where the consequences could be loss of life.\u201d\n\nDurbin says the potentially \u201cmost lucrative model for attackers will be to directly extort the manufacturers of IoT devices.\u201d Once a vulnerability is discovered in a device and an attacker can demonstrate the ability to disable it, the \u201cattacker may approach the manufacturer and threaten to take down a whole product line, thus potentially jeopardizing the organization's entire customer base,\u201d he says. \u201cIn such circumstances, some manufacturers may prefer to pay a ransom rather than admit that a vulnerability has been maliciously exploited.\u201d\n\nThat's just further evidence of what Joseph Carson, chief security scientist at Thycotic, sees as the next big change for ransomware. \u201cRansomware\u00a0is going to evolve drastically in the near future, becoming platform agnostic. This means that\u00a0ransomware\u00a0will be able to target any OS platform including smart devices, such as TV's, manufacturing systems and autonomous vehicles,\u201d Carson says.\u00a0\u201cThey will target time sensitive industries like the entertainment, health and transportation that, when unavailable for short periods of time, have major financial costs or even life threatening catastrophes.\u201d\n\nCarson believes that \u201cthe financial aspect of\u00a0ransomware\u00a0will become much easier than today, meaning it will be as easy as clicking a button.\u201d\n\nCh-ch-changes\n\n\u201cPerhaps the worst part of all this is the cross-breeding we now see between\u00a0ransomware\u00a0and worms. These beasts \u2013 which some are now calling Ransomworm \u2013 take the dangerous file encryption of\u00a0ransomware\u00a0and the self-spreading of worms and combine them to terrible effect,\u201d says Sander. \u201cWe've seen a couple of these hit big and now that the trick is out there it's likely to stick around and become part of the new mass-produced\u00a0ransomware.\u201d\n\nIn addition, fileless attacks will grow in number and continue to challenge security pros in the future. According to a 2016 survey by Barkly 50-100 percent of fileless attacks got around anti-malware, email filtering, firewalls and antivirus technologies.\n\n\u201cRansomware\u00a0has received a lot of attention because it's easily understood, but it's more of a symptom than a disease, and is typically just the last step in a well-orchestrated series of hacking techniques,\u201d says Satya Gupta, co-founder and CTO of Virsec. \u201cThese include hard-to-detect fileless techniques to exploit web server vulnerabilities, pivot laterally within networks, and hijack servers to take malicious actions such as theft, destruction or ransom. In fact, most\u00a0ransomware\u00a0attacks yield very little actual revenue, but cause lots of disruption \u2013 probably the larger goal.\u201d\n\nLenny Zeltser, vice president of products at Minerva,\u00a0expects \u201cthe use of AV-evasion tactics in\u00a0ransomware\u00a0to grow, fueling the need for enterprises to go beyond relying solely on antivirus or similar anti-malware solutions to prevent infections\u201d and urges organizations to \u201cconsider what methods they might employ to interfere with attempts by\u00a0ransomware\u00a0to bypass baseline security mechanisms on the endpoint.\u201d\n\nWhile financial gain is the top motive behind most ransomware attacks, motivations will change and expand. In the future the drivers will become more diversified. \u201cDue to the nature of\u00a0ransomware, it will also evolve into DistructiveWare or TerrorWare that have the same impact of making systems unavailable. However, the motive will be simply to cause destruction,\u201d says Thycotic's Carson.\u00a0\u201cI believe that we will also likely see an increase in members of the media, their publications as well as political parties being top targets used to disrupt governments.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAs ransomware matures, it will become a more challenging force to reckon with. \u201cIf\u00a0ransomware\u00a0follows the same path as other cyber threats, then it's going to enter the mass production phase of its life,\u201d says Jonathan Sander, CTO of STEALTHbits Technologies. \u201cRansomware\u00a0in mass production will be especially dangerous because the reliability of payment to fix the problem will likely go down.\u201d\n\nHe notes that early\u00a0ransomware\u00a0attacks \u201chad a pretty good reputation for giving back the data when paid. That was a key to their success.\u201d But \u201cas less and less professional \u2013 and less competent \u2013 people get involved, the worse that reputation will get and the worse the damage will be on all sides,\u201d says Sander. \u201cPeople will be less willing to pay which will hurt the bad guy's business model. Less data will be recovered and that will hurt the victims.\u201d\n\nHackers already are finding it difficult to pay up quickly. \n\n\"There's a natural technical evolution in\u00a0ransomware\u00a0that's underway, driven by the success and failures of recent mass-scale campaigns to hold users ransom,\u201d says Robert Capps,\u00a0authentication strategist, vice president, NuData Security. \u201cWith so many organizations all anteing up in Bitcoin simultaneously, the perpetrators struggled to collect their ill-gotten gains and decrypt their victims' machines, and some deadlines weren't hit \u2013 the bad actors were simply immobilized by the success of their campaigns.\u201d\n\nSince ransomware campaigns work if attackers can deliver on their promise to unlock files,\u00a0\u201cif they don't deliver, future victims will be unlikely to cough up the ransom,\u201d says Capps. \u201c\u00a0I think the cybercriminals are acutely aware of this fact, and are stepping up their game.\"\n\nSo, unbutton your collars and take off your Sunday best, we won't be attending ransomware's funeral any time soon.\n\nIt's coming from inside the house\u2026\n\nOrganizations keen on thwarting ransomware attacks might do well to take a lesson from that creepy old movie that has a babysitter a target of crank calls from a murderer who's calling, as it turns out, from inside the house. The biggest threat \u2013 and easiest entry point \u2013 for a ransomware attack is the insider and or an internal vulnerability that hasn't yet been addressed.\n\n\u201cIt's important to keep in perspective that no matter what the affect, whether ransom or otherwise, cyberattacks begin with phishing,\u201d said Oren Falkowitz, cofounder and CEO at Area 1 Security. \u201c99 percent of ransomware is delivered via phishing.\u201d\n\nIt is, he says, \u201cthe root cause in over 95 percent of cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nSince the \u201cproblem begins with users that have legitimate access to enterprise data, attacks from the inside can be present for long periods of time before finally being detected,\u201d says Ajay Uggirata, director at Imperva. \u201cWhat's more, costs associated with loss of data can run in the millions and lead to customer loss, brand damage and stock price decline.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to ransomware, it's \u201cequally as damaging,\u201d he says, \u201cas once a web application is compromised it is easy to plant ransomware to restrict access to the data that application is serving.\u201d\n\nUggirata says \u201cit is important to protect the application itself by blocking web app attacks and denying account takeover attempts.\u201d\n\nContinued awareness training for users throughout an organization can improve security posture and challenge attackers.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "WannaCry and NotPetya: Who, what, when and WHY?", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/wannacry-and-notpetya-who-what-when-and-why/article/696198/", "title": "WannaCry and NotPetya: Who, what, when and WHY?", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "October 02, 2017", "body": "There isn't a cybersecurity professional in the world that is not sick and tired of hearing about WannaCry and NotPetya, and with good reason as the NSA's EternalBlue exploit and DoublePulsar backdoor tool were known to the cybersecurity community well before either attack was launched.\n\nThe lessons imparted by WannaCry and NotPetya range from the no-brainer type \u2013 make sure your computers and systems have all their security patches \u2013 to who will ultimately pay the price for a company being subjected to these or similar attacks in the future.\n\nWith that said, the list of those ultimately responsible for the amount of damage done by the WannaCry and NotPetya malware this summer is long and distinguished. It includes the good folks at the National Security Agency (NSA) who detected the flaw, but withheld that knowledge so it could use the vulnerability as a potential weapon. The NSA also has the dubious honor of holding the second place on the list for not properly protecting its hacking tools thus allowing The Shadow Brokers to swipe and eventually reveal EternalBlue and DoublePulsar to the criminal world, for which they are assigned a fair share of the blame.\n\nHowever, the agency did summon the wherewithal to inform Microsoft of the vulnerability in Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 (x64) for which the company issued a patch in March, (however, as one cybersecurity researcher noted, Microsoft could have moved faster). \n\nHowever, the two groups that should shoulder the bulk of the responsibility are the IT administrators who did not implement Microsoft's patch when it became available and the cybersecurity teams that were made aware of the vulnerability, but did not see it as a threat.\n\nThat was the analysis put forth by Sean Dillon, senior security researcher with RiskSense and Rapid 7. The latter in its 2017 Q2 Threat Report noted that security analysts were initially thrilled to get their hands on the hacking tools revealed by The Shadow Brokers. But after the researchers realized the tools were old and not obviously dangerous because they attacked known and patched vulnerabilities they infosec world moved on to other projects.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we were the only ones [to move on]. Attackers did not move on; they realized that even though we thought we were safe against these non-zero-day, unexciting attacks, we were not,\u201d the report stated.\n\nDillon, who was the first to reverse engineer WannaCry, said cybersecurity firms were slow to act on the initial data dump that included EternalBlue, but were quick to show up later with products to help mitigate the situation once it got out of control.\n\n\u201cThe response to these dumps could have been better by the industry,\u201d Dillon says, but pointed out that Microsoft is the main culprit by not reacting quickly once it knew the vulnerability was made public. \n\nMicrosoft issued a patch that covered EternalBlue with its usual March security update, but the company waited until after WannaCry became a major issue to patch out of support products like Windows XP, he said, adding that Microsoft may have known about EternalBlue as early as February 2017.\n\n\u201cAntivirus companies need to be on the ball and take more threats, even those that are patched, more seriously,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nTaking advantage of the human element in a company's cyber defense has long been a part of the hacker's arsenal taking advantage of people for years, most notably in phishing and business email compromise attacks that have led to ransomware being installed or money transferred to thieves. So in the same way companies try to train workers to not click on unknown links, cybersecurity staffers must learn to look beyond an initial threat and think like a cybercriminal. Malwarebyte's Jerome Segura noted that this has, so far, not met with a ton of success.\n\n\u201cDespite continuous awareness campaigns, the same old tricks are being used again and again. What will it take for users to know that enabling macros is a bad idea? Sadly, social engineering is a tested and proven technique that is likely to continue to be one of our biggest headaches,\u201d he says.\n\nMicrosoft did issue a list of lessons it learned from these attacks, which included having a business continuity and recovery plan in place, modern file sharing and cloud storage services were not affected by the attack so should be used, and endpoint protection coupled with identity and security management is absolutely a must-have along with a layered security approach to proactively defend against future attacks.\n\nDedicated cybersecurity companies and their employees are not the only entities that still need to learn a few lessons from WannaCry and NotPetya. A survey by Tripwire conducted at Black Hat 2017 of 108 security professionals found that the majority do not think their organization has done enough in the wake of those attacks to prepare for the next wave that is bound to come at some point.\n\nThe survey found that 68 percent do not feel confident that their enterprises made the improvements needed to protect against similar type attacks. The biggest hole in their security those surveyed believed they had to deal with was network device discovery with 28 percent saying they are failing in this area. Other points of concern were:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vulnerability management (14 percent)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Administrative privilege management (6 percent)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Audit log reviews (6 percent)\n\nTim Erlin, Tripwire's vice president of product management and strategy said, this lack of response to WannaCry and NotPetya is not only dangerous, but foolhardy.\n\n\u201cNo matter the size of your organization, you must treat cybersecurity seriously. If you were lucky enough not to have been directly affected by WannaCry or Petya, take it as an opportunity to get your cybersecurity house in order. Remember, you don't have nine lives. All it takes is one data breach or another WannaCry and your company has lost data, money, credibility and most importantly, customer trust, which is one of the most difficult things to recover,\u201d he says.\n\nTaking some positive steps after such massive and well publicized attacks is also important. For example stopping a company's IT and cybersecurity departments from turning on each other while trying to assign blame is also a necessity, says Imperva CISO Shahar Ben-Hador. This is not only important for company moral, but will help when another attack takes place.\n\n\u201cWhen an organization succumbs to an attack such as the recent WannaCry or NotPetya, it's not an issue of blaming an individual or group. Instead, it should be an opportunity to test and improve the relationship between Infosecurity and IT and the overall process \u2013 in this case - of patching systems,\u201d he says.\n\nIn fact, being able to limit exposure to such attacks actually comes down to how well these two groups get along, communicate and realize each needs the other to protect their firm. Where such teamwork really comes into play is with detection and remediation. \n\n\u201cIn many cases, InfoSec needs to detect in a timely manner that the organization is vulnerable and IT needs to patch and remediate in a timely manner. If this process doesn't work quickly enough, the process owners own the failure and they are in both the infosec and IT groups,\u201d he notes.\n\nBob Noel, director of strategic relationships and marketing for Plixer, concurred saying he sees ownership of cyber incidents moving up the corporate food chain, saying a major shift in how organizations perceive and respond to massive attacks has taken place. Whereas in the past a data breach or successful ransomware attack was considered the sole responsibility of the CISO and his or her technology department, now blame is climbing up the ladder to the C-suite.\n\n\u201cBreaches like WannaCry and NotPetya, however have caused severe damage to many companies resulting in lost productivity and revenues. Boards of Directors are beginning to worry much more about massive damage to the brand and the financial liability caused by high profile breaches. This shift in attitude is changing cybersecurity from being a tactical, department-led function to a strategic CEO-led responsibility,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat should scare everyone from the lowliest corporate worker on a network to the CEO is that EternalBlue is not even the most dangerous or reliable, for a hacker, to utilize, says RiskSense's Dillon. Several other tools that were part of the initial dump of NSA content are potentially much worse going after flaws in Windows 10. \n\n\u201cIt's interesting that these have not been used,\u201d he says, adding that this might not remain the case for long as there are rumblings some nation-states are gearing up to put them to use.\n\nRapid 7 backed up Dillon saying EternalBlue which targeted SMB is not the only one that could be used by attackers. \n\n\u201cSeveral other exploits in the batch target mail services, some target IIS web servers, and others target Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Many of the vulnerabilities are older, but that doesn't mean that attackers can't, or won't, find a way to take advantage of them; plenty of targets that are still out there make it worth their time and effort,\u201d the company says.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Want to prevent ransomware attacks?

Or at least the response isn't on par with the threat when it comes to ransomware. \n\nEven as ransomware continues to threaten industries, costing organizations an estimated $1 billion in 2016 and predicted to be even more expensive this year following WannaCry, Petya and other high profile outbreaks, many organizations skip out on some obvious steps that could help them prevent future infections, such as properly training employees on online safety, actively monitoring their networks, ensuring systems are patched, and properly backing up important files to name a few precautions.do\n\nUntil IT departments start taking these threats seriously and taking a more proactive approach, organizations will continues being hit with otherwise preventable attacks. Known vulnerabilities with available patches are providing gateways for criminals to infect entire networks such as with WannaCry and it's crucial that organization ensure they're systems are up to date to prevent repeats.\n\nWannaCrypt ransomware was distributed through the EternalBlue Windows SMB vulnerability, a flaw that was patched in March 2017 but was heavily exploited in the May 2017 WannaCry attacks and June 2017 NotPetya attacks. The attacks didn't have to be as damaging as they were.\n\nSiteLock Web Researcher Michael Veenstra told SC Media that beyond the ever-present need for strong data loss contingencies, the most important thing an administrator can do is maintain effective security policies across the board that ensure systems are maintained and patched in a timely fashion.\n\n\u201cThe EternalBlue vulnerability was patched on all supported Microsoft operating systems two months prior to the WannaCry outbreak, and one month before the existence of the vulnerability was publicized by a leak from the Shadow Brokers,\u201d Veenstra says. \u201cOrganizations affected by this attack would have been saved countless dollars \u2013 between paid ransoms, incident response, and immaterial costs like the loss of customer trust \u2013 if the servers on their network were kept up-to-date.\u201d \n\nIgnorance of how ransomware attacks work also contributes to the spread of ransomware infections. Employees often aren't aware of best practices to prevent attacks. Human errors can prove just as dangerous, if not more so, as unpatched systems, meaning that organizations should work to better educate employees on how to spot phishing attacks and admins should enable backups and contingency plans in the event of mistakes, researchers say. \n\n\u201cAccording to Verizon's DBIR Report, the use of social actions, like personalized phishing emails, increased from 8 percent to 21 percent of malware incidents in 2016,\u201d Cyberbit Chief Technology Officer Oren Aspir tells SC Media. \u201dBy training employees to avoid phishing emails the majority of ransomware will be avoided.\u201d\n\nThere's an added bonus for putting effort into training. Preventing phishing attacks can also curb other cyberattacks as well, Shalabh Mohan, vice president, products and marketing, at Area 1 Security\n\n\u201cPhishing is the root cause for a majority of all cybersecurity incidents; and that includes ransomware breaches,\u201d Mohan says. \u201cIn order to truly protect against ransomware, organizations should look towards stopping phishing attacks comprehensively for their end users, irrespective of what attack vector it may be coming from.\u201d\n\nSTEALTHbits Technologies Chief Technology Officer Jonathan Sander told SC Media the while there are very good platforms that can ramp up user awareness of these threats, the real trick is to find ways to keep the damage to a minimum in the case where\u00a0ransomware\u00a0does get in.\n\nExperts agree, Dean Ferrando, SE Manager \u2013 (EMEA) at Tripwire told SC Media \u201corganizations should continually test their backups and implement a streamlined restoring process to reduce the impact an attack will have on trade\u201d in case an infection slips through.\n\nOne of the biggest ways to reduce the damage of a ransomware attack is by ensuring all important files are frequently backed up in a safe place in the event of a compromise.\n\n\u201cFresh backups are key to remediating after a ransomware attack, and destructive attacks more generally,\u201d Chris Doman, a security researcher at AlienVault, tells SC Media. \u201cIt's also important that the backups are\u00a0located\u00a0somewhere that the ransomware can't touch\u201d since it's possible for ransomware to infect backups as well. \n\nIt's also important to understand that cloud storage can also become corrupted and plan accordingly to prevent cloud backups from becoming compromised as well. As more organizations move to the cloud, researchers warn organizations to keep track of the blind spots that could arise from using these platforms.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cIn the cloud, you get huge advantages in agility but it's also harder to maintain an accurate assessment of your entire environment,\u201d Tim Prendergast, CEO at Evident.io., says. \u201cNew functionality is turned on, updates are deployed, and default settings run counter to your policies; no one organization can see and respond to everything going on.\u201d\n\nPrendergast says ransomware in the cloud takes advantage of unprotected data, services and servers operating in company cloud environments and that once the malware has infiltrated the environment through one of many potential weakness, it locates and encrypts unprotected data and systems to fuel ransom demands for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital currencies.\n\n\u201cAn organization that carries out an effective data-backup strategy for servers and for user-endpoints is far more likely to successfully recover from a\u00a0ransomware\u00a0event than the organization that puts their faith in the criminal's ability to assist in a recovery,\u201d says Scott Keoseyan,\u00a0threat intelligence leader at Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory Cyber Risk Services.\n\nOrganizations should also ensure they have the proper tools to effectively monitor their networks and spot potential attacks before they can cause major damage. \n\nKeoseyan saysa comprehensive vulnerability management program that provides a continuous monitoring outlook of an organization's publicly-exposed assets, is critical and that the information gathered must be fed into a remediation process that includes timelines and SLAs for mitigation and remediation. \n\n\u201cIncident response, disaster recovery and business-continuity planning had been moving in the direction of understanding things like \u2018how to acquire bitcoin to pay ransoms' but it is critical that these key cyber-security and IT processes be adapted to account for scenarios where recovery via ransom is not an option.\u201d Keoseyan says.\u00a0\u201cThis means that an organization that carries out an effective data-backup strategy for servers and for user-endpoints is far more likely to successfully recover from a\u00a0ransomware\u00a0event than the organization that puts their faith in the criminal's ability to assist in a recovery.\u201d\n\nSome researchers recommend going above and beyond, if possible, to ensure their systems are protected. Eldon Sprickerhoff, founder and chief security strategist at eSentire, says the majority of his clients have taken better-than-usual precautions against\u00a0ransomware which include the technical hardening of systems, improved analysis of attachments through upstream email services, local firewall/mail server, hardening of workstations including improved patch rigor, restricted access, removal of local administrator, disabling macros through GPO, endpoint solutions, and more. \n\nSprickerhoff says these measures were coupled with coupled with a better sense of what's appropriate from a backup/restore perspective. He notes that even with training employees can still be at risk in which one of his clients was tasked with opening another employee's email since the other employee was on vacation and almost exposed the network to malware.\n\n\u201cEven though they had\u00a0ransomware-specific training, they disabled all of the protections and became infected when they opened an email with ransomware.\u201d Sprickerhoff says.\u00a0\u201cWe identified and shot down the attack immediately, and the client restored quickly from backup.\u201d\n\nHe says these types of scenario underscore the necessity for a multi-pronged approach that includes technical precautions, training, eyes-on-glass, rapid incident response and backup/restore capabilities.\n\nSander had a similar experience that testifies to the importance of monitoring networks for unusual activity and taking alarms seriously. As soon as an alarm went off signaling unusual activity everyone including the Engineer though it was a mistake but soon they learned it wasn't and found themselves in an all-out ransomware attack. Ultimately the attack didn't spread far and the firm only lost a few files on the first machine that was hit with the attack which belonged to a user who clicked a malicious link. And most of that user's files had already been backed up which minimized loses even more. \n\nAnd while it's important to take every measure to prevent and minimizing attacks, researchers emphasized there is no silver bullet to preventing ransomware attacks and that firms have to remain diligent against the threats. \n\n\"There is no fool-proof method to completely avoid\u00a0ransomware\u00a0attacks, you can only try to prevent some from succeeding, minimize the damage of those that succeed and reduce the time and effort of recovering from such an attack.\u201d Mounir Hahad, senior director of Cyphort Labs, says, adding that you can't afford the time to decide if you should pay the ransom or not as you are under attack. \n\nOther experts agree. Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of web security company High-Tech Bridge, contends \u201cwe'll hardly invent any groundbreaking techniques to fight ransomware without following cybersecurity fundamentals.\u201d \n\nUntil companies \u201cperform holistic risk assessments to establish a cybersecurity strategy with a priority-based roadmap, any\u00a0\u201clocal\u201d\u00a0solutions will likely fail or give temporary relief,\u201d Kolochenko says. \u201cComprehensive inventory of all your digital assets, their proper maintenance and patch management, security hardening and continuous monitoring - are among the pivotal processes, essential to reliably preventing ransomware.\u201d\n\nPrevention is key and using tools like AV, Sandbox, IDS, spam filtering, Threat Intelligence feeds in addition to frequently backing up systems will help organization remain resilient against ransomware attacks. \n\n\u201cOnce an adversary encrypts your data, your options to deal with the attack get very limited, very fast,\u201d Sanjay Kalra, co-founder and chief product officer at\u00a0Lacework, tells SC Media. \u201cThe most important defense against a ransomware attack is to be prepared before it happens.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "From Mega Breaches to Ransomware, We're All In", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/from-mega-breaches-to-ransomware-were-all-in/article/696190/", "title": "From Mega Breaches to Ransomware, We're All In", "author": "", "author_link": "", "date": "", "body": "An estimated 143 million U.S. consumers could be impacted by the most recent mega breach, this time, hitting Equifax.

However, in a\u00a0blog post\u00a0on Thursday, the security firm\u00a0Radware\u00a0questioned if this latest threat is actually the work of a copycat, and expressed doubt that the extortionists can actually pull off an attack against so many targets.\n\n\"Due to the number of victims\u00a0in this campaign and low ransom demand, it's unlikely that this group posing as Phantom Squad will follow through on their threats,\" the blog post states, also noting that attacking thousands of non-paying companies at once would require major resources.\n\nAnother clue that the threat may be a bluff is that the extortionists have not launched any \"demo attacks\" to prove that they are capable of causing mass disruption, Radware points out.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAccording to the blog post, the extortionists began spamming companies across Europe, Asia and the U.S. on Sept. 19, threatening businesses in such industries as manufacturing, technology, and education.

He also noted that the Herbalife wrapper was the first that researchers saw ant that they have seen several other wrappers that are part of the same attack.\n\nRegardless of the email's disguise, researchers warn the campaign is an example of why Internet users need to exercise as much caution as they can when opening emails that\u00a0are\u00a0unusual or unexpected, DomainTools\u00a0Senior Cybersecurity Threat Researcher Kyle Wilhoit\u00a0told SC Media. \n\n\u201cRansomware, while avoidable with the right tools, is a massive day-to-day inconvenience for businesses and individuals, and the profits from successful extortion\u200bs\u200b \u200boften\u00a0\u200bgo on to fund further criminal enterprises,\u201d Wilhoit\u00a0said. \u201cA good rule to follow is that if you cannot remember making a payment (for an invoice email that seems suspect)\u00a0\u200byou should\u00a0contact the merchant, and to always assume that if something\u00a0offer\u200bed\u200b to you seems too good to be true, then it probably is!\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-crime/topic/53141/", "topic_name": "Cyber Crime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "The Dark Overlord cybergang threatens kids in its latest attack", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/the-dark-overlord-cybergang-threatens-kids-in-its-latest-attack/article/690482/", "title": "The Dark Overlord cybergang threatens kids in its latest attack", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 21, 2017", "body": "A cyber gang calling itself The Dark Overlord Solution late last week sent an unusually threatening ransom note to the Columbia Falls (Montana) school district forcing officials to shutter its schools to ensure the safety of the students.\n\nThe long, rambling and condescending email from The Dark Overlord Solution, the same group likely responsible for the Netflix and Disney hacks with the addition of the word \u201csolution\u201d to the name, to the district stated that the group has fully compromised the school's network hinting that it knows intimate details about students, their parents and staff and contains references to the school shooting tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary, misspelling the school Sidney Hook. As a precautionary measure the district's schools, along with Flathead Valley Community College, were closed for three days reopening on July 19 affecting about 15,000 students.\n\n\u201cWe know who you are Columbia Falls. We know everything about your operation. We know everything about your schools, and the children in them. Your nursery children, your primary children, and your secondary children. We know who the problem children are, who the honour performing children are, and even who many of the parents are. We have educated ourselves and made ourselves aware of your entire lives,\u201d The Dark Overlord Solutions wrote.\n\nUnlike most communications associated with a cyberattack or ransomware situation, this letter was issued but the district's computer network was allowed to continue operating instead of being locked up or having he files encrypted. Instead the gang included in the note some student information, which was redacted by the school and local police before being made public, that was purportedly pulled from the school's computer system as evidence that The Dark Overlord Solution had hacked the system. Something quite normal for this type of cybercriminal James Carder, LogRhythm's CISO, told SC Media, as they need to prove to the victim that they have indeed hacked their system.\n\nThe gang only alludes to physically injuring anyone, but it does say it will release what it believes to be embarrassing information about the students and district to the public if its demands are not met.\n\nCarder said that despite the change in tactics reflected in the harsh ransom note he does believe The Dark Overlord is responsible.\n\n\u201cThe ransom letter TDO used did deviate from what you would normally see with general ransomware. This isn't, however, unique for hacking collectives (real people behind keyboards). It reminds me of the letters and messages that Anonymous and Lulzsec used to send during their heyday,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group is demanding $150,000 be paid in bitcoin, going so far as to allow Columbia Falls to use an installment plan spreading the payments out over one year.\n\nFlathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry posted the email on his department's Facebook page saying the he does not believe the students are in any physical danger.\n\n\u201cThe group who have identified themselves in this letter have been identified, and are the subject of active investigations elsewhere in our country. They are located outside of the United States. We have also discovered that they have frequently failed to live up to their promises to not release the stolen data in the past, even when their ransom demands have been met,\u201d Curry wrote.\n\nThe FBI is also involved in the investigation, but an agency spokesperson told SC Media, \"The FBI has resources devoted to this investigation and because it's ongoing, I'm unable to provide any more details at this time.\"\n\nCarder backed this up saying the release of student information and contacting parents is par for the course with The Dark Overlord and similar groups as it \u201craises the stakes\u201d and scares the victim into paying. \n\nThe reason the Columbia Falls was chosen had less to do with what type of organization it is, a school, as opposed to the fact it was an easy target. \n\n\u201cTDO scans the internet looking for easily exploitable vulnerabilities, leverages those to gain access to networks, steals data before victims even realize they've been compromised, and then tries to extort them for profit. Although school districts probably have less money to extort than a massive media conglomerate, they're much easier to compromise as they generally don't invest in cybersecurity protections or practice good IT hygiene,\u201d Carder said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Remotely locked Apple devices being held for ransom", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/remotely-locked-apple-devices-being-held-for-ransom/article/690314/", "title": "Remotely locked Apple devices being held for ransom", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 21, 2017", "body": "Some Apple product owners have found themselves on the receiving end of a new ransom attack that has someone locking their device most likely using stolen iCloud credentials and the initiating the Find My iPhone remote lock feature. \n\nMacRumors is reporting that the owners of the locked device have received messages demanding a payment for the passcode.

Others showed no mercy, asserting that ransomware is a lucrative business, and the end justifies the means.\n\nThose who disavowed or showed distaste for ransomware following the attacks often did so for one of two key reasons: the potential of causing actual physical harm to individuals, and the negative impact that ransomware incidents could have on their future business prospects.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nConcerns over causing physical harm emerged after the February 2016 Hollywood hospital attack, which disabled computer systems at the medical facility, affecting daily operations and forcing administrators to transfer some patients elsewhere.\n\nAccording to the report, a \"majority\" of the Russian and Eastern European cybercriminal community condemned the attack, with one reputable member of a top-tier Russian cybercrime forum declaring, \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, I sincerely wish that the mothers of all ransomware distributors end up in the hospital, and that the computer responsible for the resuscitation machine gets infected with [the ransomware]\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, others were unmoved, with one forum member arguing that, ultimately, the attack worked, as the hospital paid the $17,000 (or 40 bitcoin) ransom.\n\nThe May 2017 WannaCry attack also triggered a new round of ethical debates. But on a more pragmatic level, cybercriminals also expressed concern that ransomware attacks were become too high-profile and could ultimately\u00a0damage their other revenue streams.\n\n\"We're digging our own grave,\" lamented one threat actor, who suggested prohibiting ransomware from cybercriminal forums. Nearly half of the responses to this comment \u2013\u00a048.5 percent \u2013 were in favor of such a ban.\n\nThis same actor said that high-profile ransomware attacks were motivating companies to improve their security measures and improving the public's awareness of information security issues. He (or she) also complained that ransomware \"kills malware tools predicated on loaders, js (javascript execution), doc macro (payloads) etc., as these get blocked everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe individual also griped that the ransomware business lacks sophistication, noting that it's \"built not on intelligence and mental dexterity, but on brute-force and luck.\u201d\n\nResearchers also observed cybercriminals expressing concern that ransomware attacks could easily inflict damage on organizations in Russia and other former Soviet nations comprising the\u00a0Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). If that happens, Russian authorities could crack down heavily on local cybercriminal forums, which experts say are normally left alone as long as CIS assets are not impacted.\n\nAgain, not all forum members agreed, with one threat actor calling one's use of ransomware, including who gets victimized, a personal decision.\n\n\u201cThere is only one rule: don't target Russia,\" the actor said.\n\nThe WannaCry and the hospital attacks were not the only incidents to create a divide between cybercriminals. \"The NotPetya ransomware outbreak also contributed to the rift due to its significant impact on\u00a0Russian individuals and institutions,\" said Vitali Kremez, director of research at Flashpoint, in an email interview with SC Media.\n\nKremez suggested that the\u00a0WannaCry and NotPetya attacks\u00a0could even impact how cybercriminal forums operate moving forward.\n\n\"By and large,\u00a0the WannaCry and [NotPetya] ransomware attacks will likely cause underground administrators to more strictly enforce the rule about not targeting Russia in regards to ransomware sold on Eastern European underground forums,\" continued Kremez, who authored the report along with Anomali's director of security strategy Travis Farral.\u00a0\"Ransomware may also continue to fall under scrutiny within cybercrime communities if it attracts the attention of the Russian government and causes that government to increase measures to monitor and collect telecommunications data from such communities.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/health-care/topic/47228/", "topic_name": "Health Care"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/research/topic/47237/", "topic_name": "Research"}]}, {"news_name": "Doubling Down: Locky and FakeGlobe ransomware pushed in dual spam campaigns", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doubling-down-locky-and-fakeglobe-ransomware-pushed-in-dual-spam-campaigns/article/689861/", "title": "Doubling Down: Locky and FakeGlobe ransomware pushed in dual spam campaigns", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "September 19, 2017", "body": "Cybercriminals kicked off a spam campaign earlier this month capable of delivering either Locky or FakeGlobe ransomware creating a situation where a single person could be victimized twice in the same attack.\n\nThe cyberattack featured a rarely used trick that has the malicious actors rotating which ransomware is delivered with the initial spam email, Trend Micro reported. The danger here is a victim could end up being hit with both varieties by making a single mistake.\n\n\"The campaign is designed in such a way that a victim clicking on a malicious link from the spam email might deliver Locky one hour, and then FakeGlobe the next. This increases the\u00a0likelihood of secondary infections due to the rotation,\" Ed Cabrera, Trend Micro's chief cybersecurity officer for Trend Micro, told SC Media.\n\nThis could result in the victims having to pay twice or worse, lose their data permanently,Trend Micro researchers Julie Cabuhat, Michael Casayuran and Anthony Melgarejo wrote.\n\n\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe attacks kicked off on September 4 and hit 70 countries, but Japan, the United States and China were the primary victims garnering almost half the spam emails.\n\n\u201cThe cybercriminals behind the campaign designed it so that clicking on a link from the spam email might deliver Locky one hour, and then FakeGlobe the next. This makes re-infection a distinct possibility, as victims infected with one ransomware are still vulnerable to the next one in the rotation,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nIn all cases the spam came with an embedded link and an attached document both posing as a payment invoice. The link and malicious document each led to a different URL for their download. The scripts associated with the URL or document download two different binaries one of which downloads the .lukitius Locky variant the second to FakeGlobe. FakeGlobe, also known as Globe Imposter, first appeared in June 2017 and also used fake invoices as its social engineering component.\n\nTrend Micro tracked the attacks and found most came from India, Iran and Vietnam, but few other details about the culprits can be determined.\n\n\"Hard to tell at this point the strategy and ultimate capability of the actors involved, however we do know they are evolving their tactics daily and RaaS providers are equally growing in numbers. One can speculate that by delivering multiple ransomware families during a single campaign could increase the impact of an attack and affect incident response.

In short order, researchers have discovered two new major versions of Locky being distributed via voluminous malspam campaigns.\n\nThe first variant to emerge is a version called Diablo6, named after the .diablo6 file extension that it appends to encrypted files. BleepingComputer has credited its discovery to researcher \"Racco42,\" who tweeted about his findings back on Aug. 9, when the attacks reportedly began in earnest.\n\nA newer variant with similar behavior appeared on Aug. 16, capturing the attention of Malwarebytes analysts, as well as researcher Rommel Joven, who were both early to report on their findings. This version appends the extension \".Lukitus\" to affected files.\n\nMany of the spam emails have subject lines featuring simply a date and random number, with a minimalist message body that states: \"Files attached. Thanks\". However, Fortinet\u00a0researchers found a more content-rich email sample with a subject line referencing a business document from a company, with a message claiming the attachment is an invoice for purchased goods.\n\nFortinet statistics show that most of the Diablo6 spam has been distributed to the U.S. (37 percent) and Austria (36 percent), followed by Great Britain, Denmark and India, the company reported in an Aug. 14 blog post.\n\nComodo Group\u00a0said in a separate report that from Aug. 9-11 it detected more than 62,000 Diablo6 phishing emails on endpoints that it monitors. (Comodo, however, refers to the threat as IKARUSdilapidated.) The company also found that the attackers are leveraging more than 11,600 different IP addresses from 133 countries to execute the campaign. The team checking the IP range owners noticed that most are telecom companies and ISPs.\u00a0For this reason, Comodo is also classifying this threat as a botnet as well.\n\nIndeed, according to a Malwarebytes\u00a0blog post, both the Diablo6 and Lukitus versions are being pushed via the\u00a0Necurs botnet.\n\nLocky debuted in 2016, but faded from the scene somewhat this year as attackers moved on to other ransomware families. Occasionally, however, Locky would rear its ugly head again, including during a large Necurs-fueled campaign this past April.\n\nThe Diablo6 spam sample that Racco42 found has an attached a zip file containing a VBS downloader script, which includes a URL from which the Locky ransomware executable is downloaded and subsequently executed. Malwarebytes spotted this too on Aug. 9, but then observed in the following days campaigns\u00a0using PDFs embedded with malicious .DOCM files and RAR and ZIP files embedded with .JS malware.\n\nFortinet also reported in its blog post that it found two unique hashes of Diablo6, which\u00a0means \"newly created samples are being pushed, possibly with different configurations, or simply as an attempt to evade specific file signatures.\"\n\nDiablo6's ransomwares note asks for .49 bitcoins or roughly $1,600, BleepingComputer reported. If a machine is infected with either the Diablo6 or Lukitus version of Locky, its files cannot be successfully decrypted.\n\n\"It's still too early to say if this campaign signals the start of Locky diving back into the ransomware race or if it is just testing the waters,\" the Fortinet blog post stated. \"We'll probably see in the next few weeks or months, or maybe never.\"\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Top 10 Security Challenges for 2017", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/top-10-security-challenges-for-2017/article/682314/", "title": "Top 10 Security Challenges for 2017", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "August 17, 2017", "body": "The first half of 2017 has not exactly been a ride in the park for cybersecurity professionals. \n\nSome of the highlight events so far this year have been the Shadow Brokers regularly dumping NSA hacking tools for public consumption, cybercriminals then using these shiny new toys to run amok producing WannaCry and NotPetya and most recently HBO being threatened with having its hottest show unveiled early unless a $6 million ransom is paid.\n\nSo will the last few months of 2017 see a continued level of activity or will things calm down as the bad guys take off for the holidays? SC Media asked some of the top executives in the field for what they see as the biggest threats and problems that will be faced in the next few months. This will be a living list with more threats being added as they appear.\n\n1. Malware with worm capabilities \n\nJerome Segura - Lead malware intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes\n\nWannacry shocked the world by its rapid spread and this wouldn't have been possible without its worm component. It reminded us of how quickly malware can propagate with devastating effects. Sadly, other malware authors have realized it also and are starting to add worm capabilities to their malware, such as recently with the Trickbot banking trojan.\n\n\n\n2. Release of more Shadow Brokers tools\n\nJeff Schilling - Chief Security Officer at \u200eArmor\n\nEternalBlue and DoublePulsar, the critical component of the WannaCry worm are potentially just the tip of the iceberg of what may be coming from the Shadow Brokers.\u00a0 These sophisticated tools, in the hands of a less than a sophisticated adversary, had massive global impact.\u00a0 Expect more to come.\n\n3. Getting back to basics (patching, endpoint, hygiene)\n\nMatt Pascucci\u00a0- Cybersecurity Practice Manager at CCSI\u00a0\n\nThis is the biggest issue of the year and the malware has shown just how easy it is to comprise systems.\n\n4. The vulnerability of mobile carriers\n\n\u00a0Elad Yoran - Executive Chairman of KoolSpan\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly one of the more important security challenges facing us today is the growing realization that the carrier networks that transport the world's voice and data communications are systemically vulnerable to interception and monitoring. Hackers, terrorist organizations, foreign governments and others take advantage of these internetworking protocols and exploit them on a regular basis from anywhere around the world.\n\n5. Stop overwhelming clients with alerts!\n\nBen Herzberg, head of application security research at Imperva \n\nSecurity controls generate a lot of alerts that can easily overwhelm an organization. In large organizations such as banks, it is common to have over 100,000 security alerts per day.\u00a0 As you can imagine, this requires a battalion of security engineers and analysts to sort through.\n\n6. Adapting the firewall to face new threats\n\nJody Brazil, co-founder and chief product strategist, FireMon\n\n\u201cThe evolution of the firewall is not complete. Networking technology is changing rapidly and the firewall will have to adapt. Cloud, SDN and containers threaten the traditional role of the firewall. The traditional network segmentation is being replaced with very flat networks - which removes a lot of network complexity, but introduces a significant challenge to the firewall.\n\n7. Monitoring Cloud Configuration and Security\n\nTim Erlin, Vice President, product management and strategy at Tripwire\n\nOrganizations continue to adopt cloud technologies at a rapid rate, but information security isn't keeping up. There have been discovered misconfigurations leading to data leaks, but for every one of these found, there are likely many more that aren't published. With a rapid rate of technological change, huge variation of skills, and fast paced adoption, it's clear that monitoring cloud assets and infrastructure will continue to be a challenge.\u00a0 \n\n8. High Impact Attacks\n\nLimor Kessem - executive security advisor at IBM Security \n\nThinking about the biggest challenges for the remainder of the year, the one that stands out the most to me is \u201cimpact.\u201d No one can deny the destructive effect of attacks we encountered this year so far, from Shamoon v2, to WannaCry, and NotPetya, the world witnessed the power of malicious code at its highest impact to date. For the rest of year, organizations cannot ignore the overall increasing risk of highly advanced leaked code which has been used widely against organizations of all types and sizes and spreads quickly without discrimination. These attacks have shown us that it's not just simply an organizations customer data, trade secrets, or finances that are at stake \u2013 entire operations have been shut down with devastating effects on business, employees and end users. \n\n9. The Insider Threat\n\nItsik Mantin - head of data security research at Imperva\n\nSimilar to previous years, many of the breaches seen in the last year were not the result of hackers penetrating the organization and stealing data from it, but employees and third-parties that have access to sensitive data for the sake of their work, that in some cases steal the data, where in other cases leak it by sending it accidentally to unauthorized recipients. The challenge with data breaches involving insiders and third-parties is double. Not only do the attackers have much more inside info than an external attacker, but since no malware is involved and no penetration happens through the organization perimeter, many of the common security mechanisms, like firewalls and anti-viruses, become blind to these attacks happening.\n\n10. Operationalizing GDPR\n\nChris Olson - CEO of The Media Trust \u00a0\n\nThe EU's pending data protection regulation ushers in a world of change for enterprise security teams. Beyond identifying and documenting data elements and data collection activity, IT and security professionals will join forces with privacy, risk and compliance officers to operationalize data governance policies. Implementation of compliance mechanisms to ensure data protection policies--including data unknowingly collected by third parties from everyday website operations--are actively monitored and enforced will be a key focus leading up to May 2018.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cloud-security/topic/49913/", "topic_name": "Cloud Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hacking/topic/47220/", "topic_name": "Hacking"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/insider-threat/topic/52185/", "topic_name": "Insider Threat"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/patch/topic/47236/", "topic_name": "Patch"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy/topic/47216/", "topic_name": "Privacy"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/privacy--compliance/topic/49765/", "topic_name": "Privacy & Compliance"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Vaccine discovered for Cerber ransomware - based on its own evasion", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/vaccine-discovered-for-cerber-ransomware--based-on-its-own-evasion/article/682292/", "title": "Vaccine discovered for Cerber ransomware - based on its own evasion", "author": "Rene Millman", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/rene-millman/author/4067/", "date": "August 16, 2017", "body": "Security researchers have discovered previously undocumented behaviour of existing strains of Cerber ransomware that could help in \u201cvaccinating\u201d a system's files and folders.\n\nAccording to researchers at Cybereason, the behaviour was discovered through Cybereason's free anti-ransomware\u00a0tool RansomFree. It was found that when cyber-criminals attempted to hack RansomFree, it backfired and instead resulted in a possible directory-specific \u201cvaccine\u201d that preventing the\u00a0ransomware\u00a0from decrypting files.\n\nIn a YouTube video, researchers demonstrate how the process works. \u00a0Cerber searches computers for any image file (.png, .bmp, .tiff, .jpg, etc.) and checks whether they are valid. Image files that are commonly used as canary files. If a malformed image is found, Cerber skips the entire directory in which it is located and does not encrypt it. \n\nWhile this trick might allow Cerber to evade some canary-file anti-ransomware\u00a0solutions, it also makes it vulnerable - a user can \u201cvaccinate\u201d any important directory against Cerber by creating an invalid image file inside it.\n\nPieter Arntz, Malware Intelligence researcher at Malwarebytes, told SC Media UK that to \u00a0protect specifically against Cerber, it could be used, but there are already so many tricks like this (some effective, some not) that can be found on the internet it would be very cumbersome to apply all of them. \n\n\u201cFor example,\u00a0installing a Russian keyboard which helps against some attacks, or having your machine pretend to be a Virtual Machine also helps, in some cases. Applying a lot of these techniques would be more work than whitelisting which\u00a0programmes\u00a0are allowed to run which is far more efficient,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nJamie Moles, security consultant at\u00a0Lastline, told SC Media UK that tricks like this to 'vaccinate' against malware are not new.\u00a0 \n\n\u201cBack in the early 1990s,\u00a0MS-DOS computer viruses often used tricks such as setting the 'file created date' of files to something impossible (31st February for example) to stealthily mark them as already infected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that these tricks are not very reliable - interactions with other programs can break them,\u00a0malware researchers can discover them and none of them have ever lasted as a realistic protection model.\u201d\n\nChris Doman, security researcher at AlienVault, told SC Media UK, that Cerber skipping folders with invalid images is an interesting piece of malware analysis, but not much help in the real world. \n\n\u201cIf the technique became popular, then the attackers would change this check. And there are thousands of variants of ransomware - it's not scalable to apply local tricks to stop each one,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen \"vaccines\" for Locky ransomware became public, the malware authors quickly changed their code so the vaccine no longer worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said, it's great that Cybereason and other companies are releasing ransomware specific security applications for free.\u201d\n\nBromium EMEA CTO Fraser Kyne told SC Media UK that as more variants of malware appear that are designed to evade detection, organisations simply can't rely on the same detection-based approach. \u201cInstead, companies should be looking to solutions that don't just try to trick malware, but actually allow it to execute in a completely isolated, secure environment, removing the risk entirely from common attack vectors like malicious documents and zero day exploits.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Four arrested in India for leaking HBO's Game of Thrones episode", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/four-arrested-in-india-for-leaking-hbos-game-of-thrones-episode/article/682030/", "title": "Four arrested in India for leaking HBO's Game of Thrones episode", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "August 15, 2017", "body": "Four Indian men were arrested Monday for releasing an episode of the hit HBO show Game of Thrones days before its scheduled appearance, but the incident is apparently not related to that network's hack that has seen a cybergang releasing various pieces HBO content over the last several weeks.\n\nThe three of the four men arrested work for Prime Focus Technologies, the firm that handles data for Star India which is the company that owns the rights to the show in India, according to CNNMoney.

Attackers did not move on; they realized that even though we thought we were safe against these non-zero-day, unexciting attacks, we were not,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIn hindsight it might have been obvious that cybercriminals were up to something. Rapid 7 honeypots started seeing an increasing amount of traffic following the Shadow Brokers dump in mid-April culminating in giant spikes in May and June when WannaCry and NotPetya were launched.\n\nRapid 7 warned that EtneralBlue is not the only tool that can be used by criminals. The company specifically pointed to several that target Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and in fact the company has tracked what it calls an \u201calarming\u201d increase in RDP traffic in late May, possibly based on the exploit, EsteemAudit. This has not developed into a full-fledged problem as Microsoft issued a patch for the end of life systems vulnerable to this tool.\n\nThe other main takeaway from all the activity that took place during the second quarter of the year is that even when the entire world becomes focused on one or two major attacks, the criminal underground is not so myopic and continues with its regularly scheduled attacks.\n\n\u201cDuring both outbreaks, we continued to see the same tempo of unrelated attacks, including phishing attacks, wire fraud attacks, and bot infections,\u201d the report stated, adding, \u201cDo not micro-focus on the specific IOCs related to a single event. Instead, look for the opportunities your enterprise is presenting to an attacker (i.e. unpatched vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, etc.), as well as behaviors that indicate not just the individual attack but similar attacks you may see.\u201d\n\nThe top threat types per month were account privilege escalation, April; protocol poison, May; and account locked in June.\n\nThe company also noted that during the period small and large businesses experienced much different types of cyber problems with the former companies having to deal with external threats, while the latter firms had trouble caused by their employees. \n\n\u201cWhile threat categories such as malicious network and endpoint behaviors were very similar in large and small organizations, small organizations had a higher rate of remote entry threats, which include authentication from multiple countries and ingress from a disabled account, while large organizations had a much higher rate of dangerous user behavior, which includes visiting malicious websites, domains, or IP addresses,\u201d the report stated.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "HBO breach accomplished with hard work by hacker, poor security practices by victim", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/hbo-breach-accomplished-with-hard-work-by-hacker-poor-security-practices-by-victim/article/680568/", "title": "HBO breach accomplished with hard work by hacker, poor security practices by victim", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "August 08, 2017", "body": "Cybersecurity executives are speculating the HBO hack by \u201cMr. Smith\u201d was the result of the intruder putting in a tremendous amount of effort to infiltrate the entertainment giant that included many separate attacks, while said giant most likely was slayed by ignoring basic security hygiene.\n\nOn August 7 a small treasure trove of HBO content was posted publicly to the web by a hacker who is now demanding a $6 million payment to stop any further release of data. The hacker who goes by Mr. Smith posted five scripts for Game of Thrones and a month's worth of email from HBO Vice President for Film Programming Leslie Cohen along with some other corporate information, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe general consensus among cybersecurity insiders is the hacker was able to procure this information through a series of small attacks conducted over an extended period of time tied to poor security practices by either by HBO or perhaps a third-party vendor. Mr. Smith seemed to confirm the timeline saying the $6 million ransom amount is tied to the length of time his crew spent on the hack, about six months.\n\n\u201cThrough a persistent effort of phishing, malware attacks and plain old social engineering, the attackers likely compromised many individual identities. Once these identities are compromised, the attackers can inject malware onto systems that over time learn more passwords and allow them lateral access into other systems on the network,\u201d Corey Williams, Centrify's senior director of products and Marketing, told SC Media.\n\nAnother strong possibility is HBO is simply another victim of partnering with a third-party vendor that either made an error or did not have its cybersecurity ducks lined up in a row. If this turns out to be true HBO will join a long list of companies, to include Verizon, Trump Hotels, Hard Rock and Scottrade, which suffered a data breach due to one of these ancillary companies proving to be a weak link.\n\n\u201cThey have to treat intellectual property (IP) with the same level of protection that banks treat regulated customer information \u2013 that is it should be given the highest level of IT security controls and data privacy protection.\u00a0 Then in those instances where a studio has outsourced to a vendor (e.g. Larson Studios and the Netflix hack), they must insure that their vendors employ equally strong security,\u201d Brad Keller, director 3rd Party Strategy for Prevalent, said in an email interview with SC Media.\n\n\u00a0HBO launched an investigation into the initial attack that took place on August 1 when its CEO and Chairman Richard Plepler confirmed the cable company had been victimized. So far the company has not released any information.\n\nWhatever the company discovers during its investigation, along with its decision on whether or not is should pay the $6 million ransom will prove quite educational for other media firms who may find themselves victimized in a similar manner. \n\nAs with most ransomware situations, the consensus on whether or not the victim should pay up was split. If the data is deemed more valuable than the ransom and it cannot be replicated than breaking out the corporate check book might be in order, but otherwise, if at all possible, the bad guys should not be paid off.\n\n\u201cIt's a business decision, plain and simple. If an attacker was threatening to release the new Star Wars movie early, I'd want to understand the business impact of that. If it meant that there would be a decrease in people attending movies or buying merchandise in dollar amounts that exceeded the amount of the ransom, I'd at least consider coming to the table and negotiating,\u201d said James Carder, CISO of LogRhythm.\n\nHowever, everyone did agree that snatching IP was a smart move as it forces the company to quickly make a decision over what is essentially a product with an expiration date. And they did not rule out that despite asking for money the hacker could have an ulterior motive, one similar to the Sony hack that was focused on damaging the studio for the release of the anti-North Korea movie \u201cThe Interview.\u201d\n\n\u201c\"Intellectual property is particularly well suited to ransomware attacks because there is little way to repair the damage after it has been released.\u00a0 In the case of movies and/or episodes, there is an immediate diminution in market value,\u201d Keller said.\n\nWilliams agreed, adding the negative consequences of pre-releasing brand defining IP can be tremendous with the possibility of subscriptions being impacted in HBO's case.\n\nCarder did add that if a company manages to save a few dollars in negotiating to pay a lower ransom it would be smart to take that money and invest in boosting its cybersecurity. And he had a few suggestions on where to invest with the most important point made being the amount the company invests should be near the equivalent to the value of what it is trying to protect.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there isn't a silver bullet or one thing these studios can do. It's a combination of things that must happen. Studios must practice good IT and security hygiene (patching systems and applications, updating and modernizing systems/applications/infrastructure, controlling access to only those that need access, validating identities, encrypting or applying other safeguards to critical business systems and data). They also must implement stringent monitoring and alerting mechanisms as compensating controls for when or if an attacker breaks through their defenses,\u201d Carder said.\n\nWilliams noted that even improving some basic security protocols would be a huge help. The first change he suggested is to stop relying on passwords as a line of defense to protect intellectual property. Next is to implement multifactor authentication and utilize machine learning to halts attacks as they happen.\n\nWhile there are many things companies must do to increase security, the one thing they cannot do is underestimate their enemies, said Matthew Pascucci, Cybersecurity Practice Manager at CCSI.\n\n\"The HBO hack should be taken seriously. Anytime a malicious actor has your sensitive data and is releasing it to the public they've earned the right to be taken serious. How HBO responds to their demands and moves forward with the isolation of the incident will determine what needs to be done moving forward from a hardening and process perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the end it may be hard to discern what will be the final result of this attack. HBO may determine how it was done, but unless it publicly states that it paid, or the hacker makes such a disclosure, the world may not know. Unlike the NotPetya attack, which has negatively impacted the financials of FedEx and Maersk, HBO may pass through this incident unscathed. Especially if it enters into a negotiation with Mr. Smith.\n\n\u201cJust like with any business deal, there could be some level of negotiation and potentially some agreements made if HBO thinks that the stolen data has considerable value from a business perspective. By comparison, if you look at the effects of Sony's breach, there was really no material impact on Sony's fiscal results the year it was breached. Most of the cost incurred was associated with the investigation and the remediation necessary to bolster their cybersecurity program, which could be seen as an investment in the long run,\u201d Carder said.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cyber-attack/topic/49488/", "topic_name": "Cyber Attack"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/email-security/topic/47206/", "topic_name": "Email Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/phishing/topic/47212/", "topic_name": "Phishing"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Surprise WannaCry developments: Bitcoin wallets emptied, 'kill switch' researcher arrested in banking trojan case", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/wannacry-kill-switch-researcher-arrested-in-banking-trojan-case-bitcoin-wallets-emptied/article/679778/", "title": "WannaCry 'kill switch' researcher arrested in banking trojan case; bitcoin wallets emptied", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "August 03, 2017", "body": "The FBI on Wednesday arrested U.K. researcher Marcus Hutchins,\u00a0who was internationally celebrated after disabling WannaCry\u00a0ransomware with a kill switch he reported discovering.

It also references a July 2014 video that was published on a publicly accessible website in order demonstrate Kronos' capabilities to potential buyers.\n\nMeanwhile, it was Keith Collins, a tech reporter at Quartz, who disclosed the WannaCry cryptocurrency transactions, after a Twitter\u00a0bot he set up detected that someone withdrew roughly $140,000 from three bitcoin wallets in multiple installments of roughly $19,000-$27,500.\n\n\"The money was likely sent through a bitcoin mixer, a process that obscures its trail from bitcoin to hard currency. The process is a sort of\u00a0laundering operation\u00a0for digital currency,\" explained Collins in a blog post detailing his observations.\n\n\"It was thought that there was so much attention to those particular accounts by law enforcement and by other agencies as well that the [bitcoin] stored in those wallets wouldn't have been able to be released. There was just too much heat, as it were,\" said Carl Leonard, principal security analyst at Forcepoint, in an interview with SC Media. \"But... what we're seeing is large chunks of that money are being taken bit by bit through the bitcoin exchange system. The malware authors are now trying to spread those funds around in order to get them outside of the bitcoin platform.\" Leonard said that monitoring this activity could help investigators in identifying additional abused cryptocurrency accounts and wallets, if not necessarily the perpetrator.\n\nThe prevailing theory among experts is that the WannaCry attack was launched by North Korea-sponsored hackers.\n\nHowever, Orla Cox, director of security response at\u00a0Symantec, said that it's not entirely certain who emptied the wallets.\u00a0\u201cThere is no way of knowing whether it was the WannaCry attackers, or even law enforcement, that accessed the three bitcoin addresses,\" she told SC Media, passing along a quote she had previously provided to Bloomberg Technology. Additionally,\u00a0\"These addresses may not represent all of the attackers' earnings as WannaCry can generate unique bitcoin addresses per infection.\"\n\nThe WannaCry attacks shut down endpoints and organizations in more than 150 countries, spreading across networks using a wormable exploit. Its propagation was halted, however, after Hutchins, also known by the handle \"MalwareTech,\"\u00a0triggered a kill switch mechanism by registering an unclaimed domain that the ransomware\u00a0was attempting to query.\n\nIn a tweet, the Electronic Frontier Foundation digital rights group commented that it is \"deeply concerned about security researcher Marcus Hutchins' arrest.

In many cases, the impact was significant, as cyberattacks forced 22 percent of those hit to cease operations for at least a day, while 90 percent who were hit said they were knocked offline for at least one hour.\n\nAdam Kujawa, Malwarebytes director of malware intelligence, told SC Media that 35 percent of attacked SMBs were hit with ransomware. This means that not only were these companies taking a financial hit by being shut down, but then they had to ponder whether or not to pay the bad guys.\n\nThe survey found that three percent of the ransom demands were in excess of $100,000 and 11 percent were above $10,000. However, it's not paying the ransom that will kill a company, it's the downtime, which can be much more costly.\n\n\u201cMost don't believe in paying the ransom, which is a good thing,\u201d Kujawa said, adding this can be due to plain stubborness or the fact that they don't have the budget to do so.

Over half the sample (55 percent) contained the ransom demand in the initial splash screen. The average amount asked for by attackers was 0.47 BTC (\u00a3972). \n\n \n\nThe report also examines the differing levels of sophistication on the part of the attackers and comes in the wake of recent global ransomware attacks which have struck both public sector and private organisations, causing massive disruption and costing businesses millions in lost revenue. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe know that psychology plays a significant part in cyber-crime - what's been most interesting from this study is uncovering the various ways that key social engineering techniques are used to intimidate or influence victims\u201d said Hadlington. \u201cWith ransomware on the rise, it's important that we improve our understanding of this aspect of the attack and how language, imagery and other aspects of the initial ransom demand are used to coerce victims.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlthough ransomware has leapt to the top of the public's consciousness following recent attacks, what's been less well documented is exactly how the criminals are manipulating their targets into paying up,\u201d said Tony Rowan, chief security consultant at SentinelOne. \u201cThis report sheds light on the most common tactics used, with the aim that, through awareness, we are better placed to advise individuals and businesses how not to be duped by these criminals' claims.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybecrime/topic/50062/", "topic_name": "Cybecrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "Cisco predicts a major increase in cyberattacks designed to destroy systems", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cisco-predicts-a-major-increase-in-cyberattacks-designed-to-destroy-systems/article/676306/", "title": "Cisco predicts a major increase in cyberattacks designed to destroy systems", "author": "Doug Olenick", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/doug-olenick/author/3633/", "date": "July 20, 2017", "body": "Cisco researchers are predicting more and larger cyberattacks that have the goal of destroying their targets systems, instead of financial gain or stealing information.\n\nCisco offered this forecast in its 2017 Midyear Cybersecurity Report where it cited the destructive nature of the NotPetya attacks, that appeared to be traditional ransomware, but were in fact something designed to wipe a target's system destroying its ability to operate as a model that will be used more often and on a greater scale going forward.

During this burst of activity ProMediads was using Rig, but switched to Sundown-Pirate on June 25, Trend Micro fraud researcher Joseph Chen said, adding it also has expanded well beyond malvertising being linked to ransomware and crypto-currency mining among others.\n\nChen believes Sundown-Pirate may be a new, privately held EK because it is only being used to deliver ProMediads in a similar fashion as the ShadowGate campaign just used the GreenflashSundown EK. \n\n\u201cOur analysis and monitoring revealed that Sundown-Pirate borrowed code from predecessors Hunter and Terror exploit kits. Its JavaScript obfuscation, however, is similar to Sundown's. This mishmash of scrounged capabilities is what made us think it's new,\u201d Chen said.\n\nThe good news is ProMediads only works against Internet Explorer and Flash by utilizing three known and patched IE vulnerabilities and one for Flash. This means the more popular Chrome and Firefox browsers are protected as Flash is disabled by default.\n\nWhat is new is that ProMediads no longer deals just in malvertising malware. Instead when the malware diverted its victims to Sundown-Pirate the EK would deliver a botnet/info stealer, POS malware, ransomware and even a crypto-currency miner.\n\n\u201cOn June 25, for instance, Sundown-Pirate dropped the Trojan SmokeLoader (TROJ_SMOKELOAD.A), which installed the information-stealing botnet infector Zyklon (TSPY_ZYKLON.C). By July 12, the exploit kit's payload changed to point-of-sale (PoS) malware LockPOS. It's a known conspirator of Flokibot's campaigns, another threat that targets point-of-sale/credit card data,\u201d Chen said.\n\nSince this malware only takes advantage of previously patched vulnerabilities, Chen said the best defense is simply making sure a computer system's updates are current.\u00a0\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/credit-card/topic/47243/", "topic_name": "Credit Card"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malvertising/topic/50030/", "topic_name": "Malvertising"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "More staff cyber-security aware following WannaCry devastation in May", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/more-staff-cyber-security-aware-following-wannacry-devastation-in-may/article/675974/", "title": "More staff cyber-security aware following WannaCry devastation in May", "author": "Tom  Reeve", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/tom--reeve/author/3965/", "date": "July 19, 2017", "body": "The WannaCry attack may have laid waste to vast tracts of the NHS as well as other organisations and individuals, but it appears to have also focused attention on cyber-security in a way that hasn't been seen before. \n\nThat's according to a survey conducted by technology research firm Vanson Bourne on behalf of Clearswift in which 600 business decision makers and 1,200 employees were asked about WannaCry. This included personnel in the UK, US, Germany and Australia. \n\nWannaCry \u2013 a strain of ransomware that was spread by EternalBlue \u2013 struck in May and quickly racked up damage in the NHS and other organisations in 150 countries around the world. \n\nNotable in a world where the public doesn't avidly follow the cyber-security news feeds, more than three-quarters (77 percent) of those surveyed in the four countries had heard of WannaCry, while in the UK it was a full 11 points higher (88 percent), possibly due to the NHS connection. \n\nIn the UK, 58 percent of firms expect another attack within a few months. Some 29 percent of businesses told the researchers they will add cyber-security to the board of directors' agenda, with a further 29 percent pledging to upgrade their cyber-security. \n\nThe research found that staff were increasingly concerned about the security of their employers' data and were taking steps to improve their security practices: 38 percent are reading more about security, 33 percent have changed their passwords, 24 percent have enrolled in courses and 26 percent were taking unspecified steps to help their companies improve their cyber-security. \n\nHowever, in the public sector, attitudes toward security seemed laxer than in the private sector, the research said. \n\nDespite the NHS hitting the headlines over WannaCry, UK staff fared poorly in the international comparison stakes as they were less likely than their peers in the US, Germany and Australia to change their passwords, read more about cyber-security or ask for advice. \n\nThe country with the most proactive staff was the US (49 percent) followed by Australia (43 percent), Germany (37 percent) and the UK (35 percent). \n\nAmong the young (aged 18-24), the likelihood of responding to knowledge proactively, by reading about cyber-security (55 percent of those who had heard of WannaCry) or enrolling in a cyber-security course (29 percent), was much higher. \n\nDr. Guy Bunker, senior vice president of products at Clearswift, said: \u201cUK employees are worried about the practices of the custodians of their data, however the gulf between frontline security professionals and board members may at last be bridging, with close to a third (29 percent) now recognising cyber-security has a place at the boardroom table.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAn educated workforce that is well briefed on policies and procedures will go some way in limiting the effects of a breach, however boards need to take a proactive stance on this. Having the latest security technology enables organisations to stop attacks at the boundary, before they enter a network, by removing the source of an attack from documents and attachments shared into an organisation.\u201d\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}, {"news_name": "GhostCtrl malware silently haunts Android users, hijacking functionality", "news_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ghostctrl-malware-silently-haunts-android-users-hijacking-functionality/article/675562/", "title": "GhostCtrl malware silently haunts Android users, hijacking functionality", "author": "Bradley  Barth", "author_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/bradley--barth/author/3635/", "date": "July 17, 2017", "body": "Researchers have uncovered a highly versatile Android remote access trojan that hijacks device functionality, steals information and can even perform ransomware attacks.\n\nThe malicious backdoor, dubbed GhostCtrl, is part of a larger campaign that also involves the Windows-based information-stealing worm\u00a0RETADUP.A, according to Trend Micro, whose researchers found both malwares. RETADUP was discovered on June 27 after samples were detected and blocked after attempting to infect two Israeli hospitals.\n\n\"The actors behind the attacks utilized both RETADUP and GhostCtrl.\u00a0One targeted PCs while the other targeted Android users,\" said Jon Clay, director of global threat communication at Trend Micro, in an email interview with SC Media.\u00a0\"We're seeing more targeted attack actors utilize multiple malicious tools in their arsenal to ensure they are able to gather information and/or intelligence from their target victims.\"\n\nTrend Micro did not further elaborate on why the two malwares are linked to the same actor, or if GhostCtrl similarly targeted health care institutions in Israel, or otherwise. SC Media has reached out for additional answers.\n\nIn\u00a0a Monday\u00a0blog post\u00a0detailing the GhostCtrl threat,\u00a0Trend Micro further reported that\u00a0GhostCtrl\u00a0gives attackers significant flexibility and options in terms specifying which malicious actions to perform and what content to steal. For instance, the malware can secretly upload and download files, intercept and send out SMS and MMS messages, run shell commands, call phone numbers, and even record voice and auto and exfiltrate those recordings to a malicious server.\n\nEven more unusual for RATS, the spyware can clear or reset specific account passwords, control Bluetooth in order to search and connect other devices, and disconnect active phone calls. The ability to reset passwords, as well as lock device screens, allows some versions of GhostCtrl to potentially act as ransomware, forcing users to pay up in order to regain control of their devices.\n\nThe malware can also steal an \"extensive\" range of information, Trend Micro warned, including data related to call logs, SMS records, contacts, phone numbers, SIM serial numbers, usernames, locations, Android OS versions, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, cameras, browsers, searches, service processes, activity information, and more.\n\nTrend Micro reports that the malware either directly descends from or closely imitates\u00a0the multiplatform OmniRAT malware that notably hijacks not only Android devices, but also Windows, Mac and Linux systems (although Trend Micro did not come across any GhostCtrl samples that could cross over to platforms besides Android).\n\nThere are actually three versions of the malware, each one offering an increasing number of functions capable of being hijacked, the report continues. The first version introduced a framework to enable admin-level privilege, while the second introduced the ransomware capabilities and allows attackers to root infected devices. The third version incorporates obfuscation techniques to hide malicious routines, and also uses both a wrapper and an intentionally complex infection sequence chain to make detection more difficult.\n\nAndroid users can infect themselves with GhostCtrl by downloading fraudulent versions of legit apps. Trend Micro said that malicious APKs laced with GhostCtrl have used names such as \"App,\" \"MMS,\" \"whatsapp\" and \"Pokemon GO.\" Upon downloading, the malicious app will repeatedly send users pop-up requests for installation, even when they refuse such an action, until they finally give up and comply.\n\n", "topics": [{"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/cybercrime/topic/47218/", "topic_name": "Cybercrime"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/health-care/topic/47228/", "topic_name": "Health Care"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/malware/topic/47215/", "topic_name": "Malware"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/mobile-security/topic/47225/", "topic_name": "Mobile Security"}, {"topic_link": "https://www.scmagazine.com/ransomware/topic/47247/", "topic_name": "Ransomware"}]}]}]
