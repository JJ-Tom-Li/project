Recently, the IT security researchers at Proofpoint have discovered a Monero mining malware that uses leaked NSA (National Security Agency) EternalBlue exploit to spread itself.Dubbed Smominru by researchers, the is highly sophisticated malware has infected 526,000 Windows-based computers since May 2017 and is capable of mining around 24 Monero (XMR) per day which is currently $5,657. So far, the malware has generated 8,900 Monero which is around $2 million from targets in India, Russia, and Taiwan.\u201cBased on the hash power associated with the Monero payment address for this operation, it appeared that this botnet was likely twice the size of Adylkuzz,\u201d researchers wrote in their blog post.Adylkuzz is another cryptocurrency malware appeared after the WannaCry attack. Adylkuzz also uses EternalBlue and targets Windows-based computers to mine Monero cryptocurrency.The EternalBlue exploit was leaked by Shadow Brokers hacking group after hacking the agency. The same exploit was then used by hackers to spread WannaCry ransomware campaign which affected over 200,000 victims and more than 300,000 computers around the world.According to researchers, hackers are also using another NSA exploit called EsteemAudit to spread Smominru malware. The EsteemAudit exploit was leaked by Shadow Brokers in April 2017. The ex-NSA spy Edward Snowden had described the leak as \u201cThe mother of all exploits.\u201dFurthermore, Smominru\u2019s command and control (C&C) infrastructure is hosted on SharkTech, a DDoS protection company in Las Vegas, NV. Proofpoint informed SharkTech about the ongoing cybercriminal activity on their server but did not receive any reply from the company.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});\u201cAs bitcoin has become prohibitively resource-intensive to mine outside of dedicated mining farms, interest in Monero has increased dramatically. While Moreno can no longer be mined effectively on desktop computers, a distributed botnet like that described here can prove quite lucrative for its operators,\u201d said Proofpoint researchers.\u201cThe operators of this botnet are persistent, use all available exploits to expand their botnet, and have found multiple ways to recover after sinkhole operations,\u201d researchers added.As HackRead previously reported the easiest way to generate Monero is using Javascript code provided by Coinhive however, hackers have been using the code for malicious purposes. Just a week ago, YouTube ads were found generating Monero by using the visitors\u2019 CPUs (Central Processing Unit) power.Moreover, hackers also exploited vulnerabilities in Oracle WebLogic flaws to mine $266,000 worth of Monero while BlackBerry\u2019s mobile website was also hacked to mine Monero. These incidents indicate that hackers and cybercriminal community is eager to make easy money, therefore, users should remain vigilant and avoid downloading files from third-party websites.There are several ways of blocking cryptocurrency minors from using your browser and CPU power including minerBlock and No Coin extensions on Chrome web store developed for the sole purpose of blocking cryptocurrency mining and cryptojacking. Both extensions are open source and open to the public, users can check out the source code on Github here and here.Opera browser is a valuable line of defense against such cryptocurrency mining. Opera 50 prevents websites from hijacking your browser to mine cryptocurrency while its apps on Android and iOS store are equipped with anti-cryptocurrency mining capability which stops malicious apps from hijacking your device to mine cryptocurrencies.Related: Russian Hacker Exploits GTA 5 PC Mod to Install Cryptocurrency Miner", "title": "New Monero mining malware infected 500K PCs by using 2 NSA exploits"}, {"date": "February 1, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Business", "Fortune 500 companies", "hacking", "internet", "ManageEngine", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability", "zero-day"], "body": "Hackers can exploit security flaws in ManageEngine software to gain administrator type control of the system.Digital Defense Inc., a San Antonio based IT security firm has identified multiple security flaws in ManageEngine\u2019s IT management software that companies use for management of their IT infrastructure. The Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) at Digital Defense Inc., stated that there are seven vulnerabilities in several Zoho ManageEngine products allowing unauthenticated file upload, blind SQL injection, authenticated remote code execution and user enumeration, potentially revealing sensitive information or full compromise of the application.According to Digital Defense\u2019s official blog post, an attacker can compromise the system by simple modification of the configuration file. The flaws were previously undisclosed and exploiting them would allow an attacker to gain administrator type control of the system. The list of affected products includes \u201cServiceDesk Plus, Service Plus MSP, OpManager, Firewall Analyzer, Network Configuration Manager, OpUtils and NetFlow Analyzer.\u201dManageEngine is a subsidiary of Zoho Corporation and based in Pleasanton, California; it is quite popular among enterprises as over 60% of Fortune 500 firms use its products with over 40,000 customers worldwide. The company has footprints across the globe with offices located in China, Japan, India, and Singapore apart from the United States.According to the official website of ManageEngine\u2019s \u201cThree of every five Fortune 500 companies trust us to manage their IT\u201d which indicates that 3 out of 5 Fortune 500 companies are currently vulnerable. A full list of ManageEngine\u2019s customers is available here.The flaws were identified when researchers at Digital Defense were carrying out penetration test for a customer to assess the security of business and identify vulnerabilities. During the course of their research, they found multiple flaws of critical nature in the IT help desk software ManageEngine. In total seven flaws were identified, each of them allowed the attacker full control of host servers that ran Zoho\u2019s SaaS suite of applications.Moreover, the flaws happen to be application-level vulnerabilities present in the web-RPC services of the impacted software suites. Vulnerabilities included unauthenticated file upload, authenticated remote code execution, blind SQL injection and user enumeration flaws. Researchers were concerned that these flaws can easily reveal sensitive user data and also let the application to be fully compromised.Mike Cotton, vice president of engineering at Digital Defense, said that: \u201cThese flaws can be generalized as application failures that do not properly sanitize user input, resulting in a sequence that can allow a hacker to execute remote code on targeted systems.\u201dZoho Corp. was notified about the flaws by Digital Defense in November 2017 and the company also coordinated exposure of the flaws. ManageEngine has stated that fixes are available for all the seven affected applications. Cotton further noted that the flaws are \u201cbad and critical,\u201d but the vulnerability in Service Plus is the one companies need to watch out for.\u201cWe have seen a lot of instances of companies making these interfaces available externally on the internet,\u201d Cotton stated and further added that such kinds of configuration scenarios allow attackers a direct non-firewall attack route to obtain control on key infrastructure almost instantaneously. Researchers explained that the Service Plus vulnerability is triggered by a servlet  (CmClientUtilServlet), which does not require authentication to be accessed. This lets attackers create a request to the application such as moveAttachments without checking the extension of the file.\u201cThis (method) can be leveraged to upload a JSP web shell, that can be used to run commands as SYSTEM, fully compromising the host running the ServiceDesk Plus application,\u201d researchers wrote in their blog post.Image credit: DepositPhotos/LightSource", "title": "3 of 5 Fortune 500 companies vulnerable due to ManageEngine flaws"}, {"date": "January 31, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["BigBotPein", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "hacking", "IoT", "Lizard Squad", "Malware", "Mirai", "security"], "body": "According to researchers, evidence suggests Lizard Squad is alive and well, continuing their malicious activities under the guise of BigBotPein.ZingBox researchers have strong evidence that BigBotPein group is the new name under which the Lizard Squad is discreetly carrying out cybercriminal activities and that Lizard Squad has a close connection with Mirai malware. This information connects Lizard Squad and Mirai (which is a known fact) to the series of DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack that caused widespread destruction in 2017.The co-founder and CEO of ZingBox, Xu Zou stated: \u201cDespite the courageous efforts of our law enforcement agencies to identify and tear down various hacking groups, the collaboration between groups makes it extremely difficult to completely shut down their efforts for good. Arrests of high-profile members and founders of such groups certainly slow down their momentum, but organizations can\u2019t take their foot off the gas when it comes to being vigilant about the security of their network.\u201dLizard Squad is known for some very disturbing and far-reaching DDoS attacks in the history of digital crimes. This group is responsible for successful disruption of networks of Sony PlayStation, Xbox Live, and Blizzard\u2019s Warcraft. Over the years, various individuals have been alleged to have utilized the LizardStresser DDoS service offered by Lizard Squad, and have ended up getting arrested.On the other hand, Mirai, which came to light since a year and a half only, made headlines in mid-2016 after successfully attacking OVH hostings, security expert Brian Krebs\u2019 blog and Dyn DNS\u2019 infrastructure with a massive army of botnets. It must be noted that the source code of Mirai malware was leaked online merely weeks after these DDoS attacks were launched and Brian Krebs\u2019 blog was targeted probably because the journalists severely criticized Lizard Squad and linked the group with Mirai.As per the information acquired by ZingBox researchers, Lizard Squad hackers and Mirai are linked and the fact that Lizard Squad and Mirai both used the same Ukrainian hosting service Blazingfast further reinforces this fact. Moreover, it is also a point to be considered that the source code of Mirai malware was released exactly 9 days later when Zachary Buchta, the founder of Lizard Squad, was captured.Researchers were able to single out BigBotPein as connected to Lizard Squad after analyzing a domain associated with another Mirai-based scheme that was launched in late 2017; this domain was registered in the name of a person linked with Lizard Squad. BigBotPein came to limelight for supporting Buchta after he was captured by the police and this group chose Mirai as its key Internet of Things weapon to target a variety of systems including x86, x64, ARC, MIPS, ARM, SPARC, and SuperH.Furthermore, the report [PDF] suggests that this group has added Ethereum and Monero miners to its malware portfolio and has managed to improvise their social engineering skills to a great extent over time. In October 2017, researchers also identified a Mirai-based campaign that utilized a domain bigbotpein[.]com while Mirai authors were known for using blazingfact[.]io for controlling the army of botnets. Satori, Memes and Masuta, two of the many variants of Mirai malware, were also linked to this group and the Satori campaign that was originally titled Okiru was hosted from numerous domains one of which happened to be network[.]bigbotpein[.]com. From mid-January 2018, the domains used by both Lizard Squad and BigBotPein were switched to US-based hosting service providers Rackspace and Search Guide, which again highlights the connectivity between the two groups.According to ZingBox researchers, the malware code of Mirai contained a structure that was identified in July 2017 to be related to Lizard Squad and the code allowed malware to decode second stage payload in a discreet manner. Moreover, a file dropped from BigBotPein domain control[.]almahosting[.]ru during the November 2017 Satori campaign to launch Monero Stratum miner also showed evidence of a link between Lizard Squad and Mirai.\u201cDuring this research, we witnessed firsthand the evolving complexity of the different variants of Lizard Squad and bigbotPein group\u2019s malware within a span of one year [\u2026]. The Lizard Squad and bigbotPein groups used to be very active creating most of the well-known variants of Mirai,\u201d noted ZingBox researchers in their report.Thus, it can be stated that despite arresting various key members of founders of Lizard Squad hacker group, the group is very much alive and actively carrying out cyber-attacks through another ID BigBotPein.Read ZingBox\u2019s 21-page research here [PDF].", "title": "Lizard Squad is alive and continuing activities as BigBotPein: Report"}, {"date": "January 31, 2018", "authur": "Zehra Ali", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "DDOS", "DNS", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "body": "The DNS or Domain Name System is one of the most necessary components for the internet functionality. Most often, the internet businesses are negligent to the security of their digital identity that is the DNS. This poor security of DNS makes it vulnerable to many cyber attacks which are beneficial for the attackers.Fortunately, an individual or regular internet user could prevent DNS leaks or such related vulnerabilities through DNS leak test and by changing their device\u2019s setting to another DNS server.Here are 4 threats to your DNS security:The Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks are executed through accessing DNS server of an internet user or provider, where they pitch a bunch of malicious traffic and hinder the legitimate requests. Yet, this attacking technique is not particularized to DNS and its security, but the DNS server could have serious through it. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the website is prominent or not, if the DNS infrastructure is not working means it cannot monitor the number of incoming requests, then the site may face disruption. To prevent a DDoS attack on DNS server, you may use an effective DNS provider which embody a wide coverage of Anycast servers so that there is the appropriate handling of traffic. Yet, the reason to use Anycast servers is enhanced performance and efficient load distribution while DDoS attack. Also, if you are constructing your own managed DNS servers then better leverage the power of Anycast. The technique to trick web traffic through constructing a fake domain name almost same as the real target domain is known as Typosquatting. Through this method, a hacker could set up a variety of phishing attacks. However, it could also be used for stealing information.To evade such threats from your domain, it\u2019s necessary to monitor the new domain entries which are similar to your business names. Yet, an easier way to demolish this threat is to hire firms that provide digital brand management and safety services for you. Unlike Typosquatting, you don\u2019t fake it instead you break it. Most often the domain names are registered through a registrar company which makes them exposed to potential threats. An attacker could access your account that is managed by your registrar and could take control of the domain. Therefore, they can migrate the domain to the servers of their choice and worse than this, they could switch the ownership too. They are successful in such execution through breaking the account passwords of registrar\u2019s support personnel.To avoid such condition, the best practice is to account password management and setting up the strong passwords. Also, you must select a registrar that has better account security offers such as two-factor authentication or dedicated account managers. Such service may cost you money but it\u2019s worth the security you would have.The DNS information or data is used to send emails and to locate the websites that are present on the internet. This data is cached on servers to decrease the load on them and to enhance their performance. On the other hand, poisoning attacks could target the DNS cached data on these servers. This technique also routes the user to a fake website that is under the monitoring of a hacker. To execute such actions, a hacker tricks the DNS server by accessing its weak configuration and entering fake address information. Unfortunately, this change is undetectable by your browser too. To end the cache poisoning data, a highly preferable and working solution is to add a DNSSEC protocol to your domain name. This addition will make the browsers and ISP servers to authenticate the DNS data it receives thus removing the risk of cache poisoning. Therefore, you must ask for DNSSEC from your ISP.    There is a serious need for full risk assessment of infrastructure by every organization and it\u2019s necessary to evade possible risks.For DNS protection, there are some general recommendations so that there is an adequate security.Also, the individual internet users could use some techniques to evade DNS associated risks. Either they could use the tool such as VPN for mitigating risks such as DNS leaks or they can change the DNS settings on their devices.Image credit: DepositPhotos/maxkabakovRelated: BlackWallet hacked: Hackers replace DNS server, steal $400k in Stellar", "title": "Most Threatening DNS Security Risks And How To Avoid Them"}, {"date": "January 31, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Blockchain", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "Infosec", "internet", "Malware", "Monero", "Privacy", "Ransomware", "Scam", "security", "Tor"], "body": "Tor proxy owners are replacing Bitcoin payment addresses to divert payments from ransomware victims to their own wallets.The IT security researchers at Proofpoint have discovered a new type of attack/scam in which cybercriminals are becoming victims of other cybercriminals \u2013 In this attack, cybercriminals are found using Tor proxy sites to steal Bitcoin which were originally earned by other cybercriminal groups as a result of ransomware attack.In a ransomware attack, hackers infect the computer systems of unsuspecting users with a malicious software which locks their data and asks the victims to pay a ransom in Bitcoin or Monero cryptocurrency through Tor Browser or Tor proxy sites. Due to the unprecedented growth of the value of cryptocurrencies, there has been an increase in ransomware attacks accordingly.But since not every user is familiar with how Tor works, desperate victims rely on Tor proxies to send ransom payment and receive the decryption key for their data. However, these proxies are owned by people (web administrators) who by default can work as man-in-the-middle and keep an eye on whatever a user does on the proxy.According to Proofpoint security researchers, the proxy owners of the site Onion.top have been found to be modifying the transit source of web pages used for payments and diverting Bitcoin payments from ransomware victims to their own wallets. This means once the victim performs a transaction, the ransom money goes to administrators rather than the hackers behind ransomware attack. This also means that administrators are preventing victims from receiving their keys and stealing from hackers.\u201cThis appears to be the first scheme of this type affecting both ransomware victims and operators,\u201d noted Proofpoint.The researchers first learned about the scam during LockeR, Globelmposter and Sigma ransomware campaigns. In LockeR campaign, researchers identified that its payment portal warned users of not using onion.top proxy to send ransom payment. \u201cDo NOT use onion.top, they are replacing the bitcoin addresses with their own and stealing bitcoins. To be sure you\u2019re paying the correct address, use Tor Browser,\u201d the warning said.The researchers also tested Globelmposter and Sigma ransomware on Tor and Onion.top and found two different Bitcoin addresses each time. For instance, Tor Browser showed the correct Bitcoin payment address while Onion.topshowed a different payment address, however, both replacement addresses were the same that means Onion.top proxy owners are using one Bitcoin address to steal ransom payment.Proofpoint analyzed the payment addresses and found out that so far $20,154 (BTC 1.82) have been transferred but it is unclear if the cybercriminals are using other address or proxies to scam innocent victims of ransomware attacks.It may come as a surprise but the proxy administrators are not replacing payment address for every ransomware campaign. During their test, the researchers noted that the BitPaymer ransomware Bitcoin address was unchanged while sophisticated ransomware operators appear to be aware of this behavior and are attempting to mitigate with \u201cuser education\u201d and technical workarounds.Although Onion.top administrators have stolen a small number of Bitcoin; researchers believe it can grow as a major threat that will ultimately harm the victims eager to get their data back. The idea of replacing payment addresses can now open doors for other proxy owners to do the same and harm the desperate victims.\u201cThis kind of scheme also reflects the broader trend of threat actors of all stripes targeting cryptocurrency theft. Continued volatility in cryptocurrency markets and increasing interest in the Tor network will likely drive further potential abuses of Tor proxies, creating additional risks for new users,\u201d researchers concluded.", "title": "Tor Proxy Used By Cybercriminals To Initiate Bitcoin Theft"}, {"date": "January 30, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["backdoor", "Fingerprint", "internet", "Lenovo", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability", "Windows"], "body": "Vulnerability in Lenovo Devices Allows Attacker to Bypass Fingerprint Authentication and Gain Higher Privileges.In case you own a ThinkCentre, ThinkPad or ThinkStation system manufactured by Lenovo, then we suggest that you immediately install an important security fix so as to prevent the vulnerability that bypasses encoded fingerprint data with a hardcoded password.More: Lenovo removes backdoor present in networking switches since 2004Categorized as CVE-2017-3762, the vulnerability was discovered by Security Compass\u2019s Jackson Thuraisamy after locating a weak algorithm that affected the Lenovo Fingerprint Manager Pro utility for Windows versions 7, 8 and 8.1, which allows users to log-in to their devices through configured websites using fingerprint authentication process.

In some parts of the world, cybercriminals use skimmers steal card data while in some places they prefer using explosives to crack open ATMs to steal cash.In the United States, however, two of the largest ATM manufacturers Diebold Nixdorf and NCR Corp. have warned citizens to be aware of an attack in which hackers are taking over ATMs to steal cash in a technique that was never seen before in the country. Dubbed \u2018Jackpotting,\u2019 the technique involves hackers to physically access the ATM, infect it with a malware/malicious software and use hardware including industrial endoscope which forces the machine to give away cash according to commands executed by hackers.This was revealed by journalist Brian Krebs who got his hands on a confidential US Secret Service memo that reveals how jackpotting has hit the ATMs in the United States for the very first time. Before that, the attack was popular against ATMs in Asia and Europe.The memo further reveals that once the hackers take over an ATM, the attack forces it to dispense money at the rate of 40 notes every 23 seconds and only stops once the machine is empty. Currently, the prime targets of Jackpotting are Big-box stores, pharmacies and drive-thru ATMs.An alert [PDF] issued by Diebold gives in-depth details about the attack and how it can be prevented.\u201cIn a Jackpotting attack, the criminal gains access to the internal infrastructure of the terminal in order to infect the ATM PC or by completely exchanging the hard disk (HDD). In recent evolutions of Jackpotting attacks portions of a third-party multi-vendor application software stack to drive ATM components are included. In cases where the complete hard disk is being exchanged, encrypted communications between ATM PC and dispenser protects against the attack,\u201d the alert warns.According to the warning issued by NCR, the company said none of their ATMs have been compromised however the attack itself is a big threat to the ATM industry in the country. \u201cThis should be treated by all ATM deployers as a call to action to take appropriate steps to protect their ATMs against these forms of attack,\u201d said NCR.Remember, for cybercriminals hacking an ATM machine is now a piece of cake since most of these machines are still running on Windows XP. Just a few months ago, a security researcher Leigh-Anne Galloway had demonstrated how one can hack an ATM by simply drilling a hole. She also highlighted the fact that since a majority of cash machines are Windows XP systems that are linked with a safe, therefore, the trick makes a varied range of machines vulnerable to hack attack.

The malware is capable of evading anti-virus software and manipulate the file system of a targeted device, take screenshots, run arbitrary DLLs for secondary infection on Windows, and gain persistence on the infected system.However now Patrick Wardle, a security researcher, and ex-NSA hacker has published a detailed report on CrossRAT according to which once infecting the computer, the malware performs a thorough scan on the machine. It can identify the kernel, the most basic layer that integrates the system with hardware, and the type of architecture. The purpose is to do the specific installation of the program according to each software. CrossRAT is so sophisticated that it can rummage through Linux systemmd to identify the distribution of the system including Arch Linux, Centos, Debian, Kali Linux, Fedora etc). In addition, CrossRAT has a built-in keylogger, software that records what is typed on the computer and send it to the command control center (C&C). However, Wardle did not find a way to activate the latter tool.Moreover, according to Wardle, Windows and Linux computers are more susceptible to infection. This is because, as the malware is built in Java, it is necessary for the user to have this software on the computer. The two operating systems already bring a pre-installed version of Java, whereas, in macOS, it would be necessary to download.When the researcher scanned the sample hmar6.jar file that installs CrossRAT on VirusTotal, it turned out that only 1 out of 58 anti-virus programs could detect the malware however at the time of publishing this article, 28/58 programs could detect the file as malicious.Now that the malware is detected by most of the security software on VirusTotal, its threat has gone to a low level however following commands can also help you identify if your system is infected with CrossRAT:Source: objective-see / Image credit: DepositPhotos/Welcomia", "title": "CrossRAT keylogging malware targets Linux, macOS & Windows PCs"}, {"date": "January 27, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "CoinHive", "Cryptocurrency", "hacking", "internet", "javascript", "Malware", "Monero", "Scam", "security", "Technology", "youtube"], "body": "Did you visit YouTube from January 18th to January 26th?

On further analysis, Betto found out YouTube ads were infected with CoinHive JavaScript code to mine Monero.More: The biggest hack in the history of cryptocurrency $534 Million stolenCoinHive is a company that provides cryptocurrency miner, which sends any coins mined by the browser to the owner of the website, application or extension. Since September 2017 there have been more than 5000 websites that have been compromised to mine Monero through CoinHive.On the other hand, CloudFlare considers the secret use of CoinHive code as using malware against site visitors. To prove its point, the security firm booted off one of its customers in October for using the CoinHive code and not allowing users to opt out of it or disable the code.In a conversation with ArsTechnica, YouTube acknowledged the misuse of its ads but claims that the infected ads were blocked within two hours and malicious actors were also removed from its platforms.\u201cMining cryptocurrency through ads is a relatively new form of abuse that violates our policies and one that we\u2019ve been monitoring actively. We enforce our policies through a multi-layered detection system across our platforms which we update as new threats emerge. In this case, the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms.\u201dHowever, according to a report published by the cybersecurity firm TrendMicro on January 26th, it was revealed hackers have been conducting Malvertising campaigns which abuses Google\u2019s DoubleClick ad platform to run cryptocurrency miners.The whole campaign was going on since January 18th, 2018 which means it took Google more than a week to get rid of CoinHive miners after the researchers informed Google about the issue in which users from Italy, France, Japan, Spain, and Taiwan were the prime target.In a conversation with Las Vegas-based security researcher Troy Mursch (\u201cBad Packets\u201d on Twitter), HackRead was told that \u201cIt could be the poor result of screening ads by YouTube, however, the point is that I think they did it intentionally.\u201dAccording to Alexa ranking, YouTube is the second most visited website in the world where visitors spend tons of time. The longer the user stays on a site infected with cryptocurrency miner the more Monero it generates for cybercriminals just like two Showtime video websites that were infected with a CoinHive minor in September last year.Moreover, websites providing Torrent sites are also a lucrative target for website owners and cybercriminals since visitors spend quite some time on the site to search and download Torrent files. Remember, The Pirate Bay was caught twice secretly using CoinHive minor on the site.There are several ways of blocking cryptocurrency minors from using your browser and CPU power including minerBlock and No Coin extensions on Chrome web store developed for the sole purpose of blocking cryptocurrency mining and cryptojacking.

FedEx also published its 10-K filing at the same time when world\u2019s insurance giant Lloyd\u2019s issued a report on the possibility of losses worth $121.4 bn worldwide due to a well-planned cyber-attack.Thanks to the sudden surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, a few days ago, researchers discovered another ransomware campaign that uses cryptocurrency as bait to target innocent users. The campaign works in such a way that it claims to introduce a profitable new cryptocurrency called SpriteCoin and its Blockchain setup.However, in reality, SpriteCoin does not exist while its setup does not install Blockchain but infects the device with a malware that locks files and asks users for ransom in Monero cryptocurrency. Once the user pays ransom the malware further infects the device another malware that spies on the victim.If you are an Internet user, you can be the next victim of ransomware attack, therefore, keep a backup of your data so that you are not forced to pay ransom to cybercriminals.

Until now, dozens of gas stations have been attacked as customers are conned into paying more for fuel than what has actually been pumped into their vehicle tanks. Reportedly, around 3 to 7% increment per gallon of pumped gas has been added to the cost customers paid at the gas stations due to this new scam.In lieu of this scam campaign, Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) captured Denis Zayev this Saturday from Stavropol, Russian. Zayev is a hacker and he has been charged with creating software programs for the primary purpose of swindling gas station customers and defrauding them with malware installed on the pumps. It is worth noting that the software Zayev created was identified on several electronic gas stations where he installed the IT systems. Pumps located in and around Southern Russia have been the predominant targets in this campaign so far.According to the investigation, the software developed ran on gas pumps as well as cash registries. This aspect allowed Zayev and his affiliates to steal at least 3% and up to 7% more on actual fuel pumped into customer cars. The software was allegedly deployed by Zayev with the approval from the operators at the gas stations since it is discovered that the malware was sold to the operators by Zayev and he remained a partner in their malicious scheme and received a share of the fraudulent earnings.According to local media \u201cA giant scam covered almost the entire south of Russia in which viruses were found in dozens of gas stations in the Stavropol Territory, Adygea, Krasnodar Territory, Kalmykia, several republics of the North Caucasus, etc. A whole network was built to steal fuel from ordinary citizens \u2013 they did not bear any financial loss.\u201dWhat actually happened was that the operators left the gas tank empty whenever a new gas fraud cycle took place and when customers returned to refuel their cars the malware redirected between 3 to 7% of the fuel customers already bought to the empty tank without even alerting the customer. The gas pump displayed full details and the cash register issued a receipt for both attempts of gas refueling. When the empty gas tank filled up, operators put the present gas up for sale so as to hide the transactions.How this scheme was identified is not yet disclosed by the FSB and all that we have been told is that the authorities found it at Russian territories of North Caucasus and Stavropol, Adygea, Krasnodar, Kalmykia.

However, according to security experts from, Checkmarx, a Tel Aviv based security company, Tinder has two critical security flaws that expose every swipe and match of yours to strangers including cybercriminals who are using the same wireless network. The flaws were identified in November last year and Tinder was informed about them at that time but a fix is yet to be released.The first flaw is associated with the encryption process surrounding images category; it lets hackers get information about the photos you have been checking out. The other flaw can expose the data patterns for certain actions such as swiping right or left; through understanding these patterns, hackers can easily comprehend your intentions. It must be noted that Tinder is a highly popular dating service having matched over 20 billion people to date and used in 196 countries.Checkmarx researchers opine that a hacker can easily take control of profile pictures and then swipe them for unsuitable content as well as perform rogue advertising. The reason why the service is facing issue is that it is yet to implement HTTPS encryption. The app allows swiping of pictures over unsecured HTTP, which makes it easy to be intercepted by a person using the same Wi-Fi network. However, using HTTPS would mean that no third party can read the messages. Since Tinder\u2019s swipe feature lacks HTTPS protection, therefore, the messages get exposed to others. It can lead to dire consequences such as by gaining information about the sexual preferences of a user a hacker can blackmail him/her and threaten to make such sensitive information public.According to Erez Yalon, Checkmarx\u2019s manager of application security research: \u201cWe can simulate exactly what the user sees on his or her screen. You know everything: What they\u2019re doing, what their sexual preferences are, a lot of information.\u201dMoreover, unprotected HTTP allows attackers to obtain data from Tinder through identifying byte patterns for various actions. Such as, left swipe represents 278 bytes while right swipe represents 374 bytes and a match is found at 581 bytes. By recognizing data patterns, hackers can perform all sorts of actions or interrupt an on-going action. For instance, they can inject their own picture into photo stream of another user. They can monitor all your actions on Tinder and can record them as well. Whoever you like or plan to chat with will be known to them, which is indeed disturbing.The two flaws collectively produce grave privacy issue for Tinder users. In their official blog post, researchers noted: \u201cThe answers will ultimately determine the amount of effort companies such as Tinder, EA games, and even Uber put into ensuring their apps are released vulnerability free (or as close to that as humanly possible.\u201dResearchers also recommended that app makers need to implement reliable and up-to-date security testing methods in order to safeguard user data and privacy. On the other hand, they urge users to use such services cautiously and never use them on public wi-fi networks.\ufeffThe proof-of-concept software to demonstrate Tinder\u2019s vulnerabilities was also built by Checkmarx researchers, which has been dubbed as TinderDrift.

Uber has been testing the 2FA feature since 2015 however, Siani\u2019s findings highlighted how a hacker can bypass 2FA security without even entering the correct code.According to a statement to ZDNet, Uber spokesperson Melanie Ensign said that the bug was not a bypass but could be caused by ongoing security testing the company is conducting on the app.\u201cWe\u2019ve been testing different solutions since we received a lot of user complaints about requiring 2FA on [an Uber web address which we are redacting per our decision to not reveal specifics of the bug] when people are trying to report a lost or stolen phone and can\u2019t receive a code on that device, Ensign told ZDNet.\u201cWe believe those tests are causing both the existence and inconsistency of this issue.\u201dIf you are a hacker or security researcher keen to report vulnerabilities to Uber you have to be sure about the severeness of it as you never know what is serious for the company and what not. However, this is not the first time that Uber has rejected someone\u2019s findings regarding the presence of critical security flaws in its online infrastructure.

In return, the company paid $100,000 to hackers to hide the breach.In the breach, two hackers stole files containing names and license numbers of 600,000 drivers from the US and personal data such as names, email IDs and mobile phone numbers of 57 million Uber users from across the globe. More: Uber users beware; Faketoken Android malware hits ride-sharing appsIf Uber keeps on treating the good guys like Saini and Perry in such a negative manner, it is quite possible that reluctant security researchers might simply stop reporting their findings to Uber which could be disastrous for the company.

But, what makes it more lethal is that Evrial is capable of monitoring the Windows clipboard and look for certain text. Once it detects that text, it modifies it into something else.

MalwareHunterTeam states that the Trojan is being sold on Russian criminal forums for 1,500 Rubles ($27). To sell it, the seller advertised that when the product is purchased an attacker would gain access to a web panel to allow buyer build an executable while the web panel would track the clipboard modifications and let the attacker configure the most feasible replacement strings. Malware does this by connecting to a remote site to upload original string and downloading a string that is to be used as a replacement.According to Lawrence Abrams of Bleeping Computer, an intriguing feature of Evrial is that it only monitors clipboards for certain types of strings and changes them with the ones that the attacker sends, which lets the attacker reroute a cryptocurrency payment to another address owned and controlled by the attacker. To modify strings in such a way is a rare feat and hasn\u2019t been noticed in other malware so far even in those that are capable of matching strings. What\u2019s even more alarming is the fact that the Trojan is configured to detect strings corresponding to a variety of cryptocurrency including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, WebMoney and Qiwi addresses.Moreover, Evrial also steals bitcoin wallets, stored passwords and all the files that are stored on the targeted desktop. It can also capture a screenshot of the active windows and then compiles all the information into a .zip file. The file is then uploaded to a web panel operated by the attacker. It identified the location of bitcoin\u2019s wallet.dat through scanning for the registry key; if the key is found it can steal the wallet to access and steal bitcoins.

A vast variety of games now allows players to mix with real-life players across the globe on their servers, but keeping yourself safe should always be a priority. From popular games to large multiplayer platforms such as PSN, Steam, and Origin, to personal servers and games with your friends, it\u2019s important to be aware of the risks of playing online and how to protect yourself against them. Below are six key steps to help keep yourself safe when gaming online. It almost goes without saying in today\u2019s modern world, but it\u2019s important while gaming that you don\u2019t reveal too much of your personal information. This includes your full name, address, and any other identifying information such as where you work or attend university. If you\u2019re starting a brand new game online, you should always check the server you are using has the correct encryption and authentication before you begin to play. If your server doesn\u2019t have these, it can be vulnerable to hacks which can attack the databases of the gaming site. This means your personal information, such as login details, email address and payment options if you have a subscription, are available to be stolen. Using websites dedicated to finding the best game hosting for your games is a great way to ensure you\u2019re playing on a secure server to protect yourself and your friends. While you may think cyberbullying is solely aimed at trolls on social media, it can also affect your game experience if you\u2019re playing a multiplayer game online. Most online servers now have dedicated regulations against cyberbullying to try to protect their players. Therefore, it\u2019s vital for your enjoyment and your own mental wellbeing that you not only report any cyberbullying to the game site if it\u2019s possible but you also immediately block any player who is causing you distress or anxiety. Cyberbullying can include nasty and malicious remarks about you, to intimidating threats designed to stop from playing the game.If you are running your own hosting server for gaming you must take advantage of security firms providing DDoS protection services. A DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. Remember don\u2019t underestimate DDoS attacks since it\u2019s an increasing threat and gaming giants like EA, PSN and Blizzard had a hard time tackling them.It might be all too tempting to download the latest cheats or update to your game, but if you\u2019re illegally pirating such software, there is the possibility it contains a virus or spyware that will infect your computer. Recently, hackers have started spreading gaming mods infected with cryptocurrency miners therefore, you should only download cheats and updates from verified websites or the game creator. As with being careful with what you\u2019re downloading, you should always ensure your antivirus/antispyware software is installed and up-to-date. Good practice would be to check for updates to your software before you begin your game every time. This will keep any new malware that may not have been protected against before from attacking your files.

Upon infecting an Android device, the malware secretly opens malicious websites and automatically clicks on its content including banners and links by downloading a script from the C&C (command and control) server the purpose of which is to generate revenue through advertisements and links.Furthermore, the malware uses its capability to drop additional Trojan modules which perform a number of malicious attacks including opening phishing windows and stealing login credential of victims, spams their device with advertisements and downloads other malicious apps without the knowledge or permission of victims.\u201cIt covertly downloads and launches additional modules that perform various malicious actions.

However, according to Fidus InfoSecurity Limited, a British cybersecurity agency, OnePlus checkout was using Magento eCommerce platform that was in the news lately for containing a critical bug that could be exploited to take over any website. Remember, the same bug was used by a Coinhive user to hack BlackBerry mobile website and place Monero cryptocurrency mining code.Furthermore, Fidus pointed out several loopholes in the OnePlus website and concluded that there is a chance OnePlus website could be compromised by placing Javascript and modifying the Cc.php file which requires shell access to the server and indicates a serious compromise.Earlier today (January 19th, 2017), according to the official forum post by OnePlus\u2019 staff member Mingyu it has been acknowledged that the company did suffer a hack attack in which hackers infected a malicious script into the company\u2019s payment page code and siphoned out credit card data.One of our systems was attacked, and a malicious script was injected into the payment page code to sniff out credit card information from customers who were entering the data on OnePlus.net.

It is capable of stealing Facebook credentials after infecting devices. The malware tricks unsuspecting users into installing it and it is spread through malicious, infected apps. Research suggests that it is present in 53 different applications. One of these infected apps has over 100,000 downloads. The prominent targets of GhostTeam include users in Brazil, India, and Indonesia but researchers are of the opinion that this campaign will spread to other regions most probably to the US considering that Google Play Store has been unknowingly harboring malicious apps since April 2017.More: Hacking Facebook Account by Simply Knowing Account Phone NumberJust like other Android malware, GhostTeam also is capable of performing a variety of tasks. It basically steals Facebook credentials, which Trend Micro researchers believe could be an attempt to build what they refer to as a \u201czombie social media army.\u201d Their objective, speculate researchers, is to spread unauthentic news articles and cryptocurrency mining malware along with launching full-screen ads on targeted devices to generate click revenue.The apps in which this malware is hidden are harmless looking regular apps such as social media video downloaders, flashlights, and QR scanners, etc. It must be noted that the malware is not downloaded by the installation of these apps, just like other malware does, but instead, it involves a multi-stage attack process so as to keep its payload hidden.After the infected app is downloaded from Play Store it checks if it is running on an Android VM or an emulator to hide its code from security professionals. Once it realizes that it is running on a physical device, it downloads the GhostTeam payload in the form of Google Play Services app. When the user opens Facebook or Google Play, a popup appears requesting to install the fake Google Play Services app and also asks for administrator-level permissions. Afterwards, whenever the user opens Facebook for the first time, a fake WebView page is loaded, which asks the user to verify his/her Facebook account. The malware captures the email ID and password and immediately sends it to its C&C server. If 2FA is not enabled, the attackers would easily access the account.To stay protected, you need to install a reliable anti-virus app and before downloading an app do check out its reviews, comments, and ratings. If you suspect anything fishy, do not download it at all. Furthermore, you need to keep Android device updated with latest security patches. If you somehow fall prey to GhostTeam infection, you can disable device administrator permissions from accessing Settings menu to mitigate the threat. Finally, it is really important to enable 2FA (two-factor-authentication) for Facebook and all other social media accounts wherever it is available.Trend Micro has already informed Google about the presence of infected apps and these have been removed as well.

In a joint investigation carried out by cybersecurity company Lookout Security and the civil rights group, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) a new string of spyware campaign being operated from Lebanon has been discovered.According to the research report from Lookout Security, the campaign has been launched by a new group referred to as Dark Caracal, which is associated with attacks on not tens or hundreds but thousands of victims across 21 countries. The range of targets is also extremely broad while the building from where this campaign is operated is situated in Beirut and owned by the Lebanese General Directorate of General Security (GDGS). GDGS has a reputation of gathering intelligence for the purpose of national security as well as launching offensive cyber-espionage campaigns.Researchers opine that [PDF] this campaign is different from previous spyware launches because it has paved way for the trend of \u2018spyware for hire.\u2019 The campaign has been active for the past 6 years; it involves stealing of text messages, documents from journalists, call logs, WhatsApp messages, geolocation information, browsing history, audio recordings and targets corporations, military personnel and similar entities of sensitive nature. Its key targets include smartphones across the Middle East, North Africa, North America and Europe.The research team assessed test devices, which included a set of phones configured primarily to roadtest Dark Caracal, and identified that these were linked to a WiFi network that was hosted from a website of Lebanon\u2019s security headquarters. The hacking campaign was identified after Lebanese spies published stolen data worth a gigabyte on the internet.As per Mike Murray, Lookout Security\u2019s intelligence head, this was just like thieves robbed a bank and kept the door where the money was stored unlocked.  When researchers analyzed the stolen data, they were able to identify that military and government personnel, education professionals, medical practitioners and people from academic fraternity across Pakistan, Germany, Italy, Russia, Syria, the United States and South Korea were among the key targets of hackers. It is worth noting that British officials are not impacted by this campaign so far.To make their targeted campaign successful, spies employed a network of fake websites and malicious smartphone applications disguised as Telegram and WhatsApp so as to steal credential information from users like passwords and spying on conversations. Until now, spies have managed to capture around 486,000 text messages.Moreover, hackers targeted victims through WhatsApp messages and Facebook groups from where malicious software was sent to targeted computers. The malware captured smartphone data after being downloaded and transferred the information back to the servers hosted by GDGS.Apart from using Android malware including fake versions of messaging apps like Signal, the group also use the notorious surveillance tool FinFisher. The malware is also capable of stealing two-factor authentication codes and accesses the front and back cameras of the phone along with a microphone.\u201cOne of the interesting things about this ongoing attack is that it doesn\u2019t require a sophisticated or expensive exploit. Instead, all Dark Caracal needed was application permissions that users themselves granted when they downloaded the apps, not realizing that they contained malware.

The developer posted about his findings on GitHub this Tuesday.According to Masri, the vulnerability was identified when he was attempting to break the operating system through inserting random characters into its internal coding. If a message containing a link having the code identified by Masri on GitHub is sent to a device, and even the user doesn\u2019t click on it, the bug will be activated.More: Avoid Clicking CrashSafari.com! It Crashes Android, iOS Devices + Web BrowsersThe iMessage app generates a preview of this malicious link and since Apple allows developers to insert a few characters into the HTML of their website for customization of the title of that link preview in the app Masri was able to insert new characters. Masri actually inserted thousands of characters, which was much more than the iOS allowed. This is why the iMessage app got crashed. The code for this bug was later posted on GitHub by Masri due to which it became available to the public.The bug was tested by a Twitter user @aaronp613 and reported that when the link was sent the device froze for a few minutes and then restarted. The device continually crashed and the user wasn\u2019t able to load messages. Masri stated that the bug affected iOS versions 10.0 through 11.2 beta 5 while the flaw wasn\u2019t tested on the recently released iOS 11.2.5 beta 6 and that he tested the bug on iPhone X and iPhone 5S.

Oculus was established in 2012 and it is most famous for the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality (VR) headset.To provide its users a more \u2018social\u2019 experience Facebook acquired Oculus VR in July 2014. In August 2014, Facebook added Oculus assets to its white hat bug bounty program through which the social network managed to identify various vulnerabilities in Oculus service. Some flaws were of serious nature and a researcher fetched $25,000 for discovering a series of flaws.Given this vulnerable nature of Oculus VR, web security consultant Josip Franjkovi\u0107 decided to probe further into the Oculus app for Windows primarily because it allowed users to link their Facebook account to the app. He identified that using especially designed GraphQL queries, an attacker can easily connect the Facebook account of any user to attacker\u2019s Oculus account. GraphQL query language was developed by Facebook in 2012. It was, therefore, observed by Franjkovi\u0107 that it was possible to hijack Facebook accounts through abusing the social network\u2019s integration with Oculus VR headset.The flaw is basically a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows the hijacking on a user\u2019s Facebook account. Once hijacked, the attacker can easily obtain an access token for the account and take full control of it. In a normal scenario, this token cannot be accessed by third-party apps.The account hijacking mechanism was demonstrated by Franjkovi\u0107 where a GraphQL query was used to add a new mobile phone number to the targeted Facebook account. The number was then leveraged for resetting the password of the account.On October 24, Franjkovi\u0107 notified Facebook about this vulnerability; in response to the report, Facebook released a temporary fix by disabling the facebook_login_sso endpoint, which was immediately implemented. Later on October 30, the social network rolled out the permanent fix. However, merely a few weeks later, Franjkovi\u0107 told SecurityWeek that the CSRF flaw was prone to be exploited for bypassing the patch. Then on November 18, another flaw was reported and Facebook again disabled the facebook_login_sso endpoint. Three weeks later Facebook implemented a complete patch.\u201cThe fix was to implement a CSRF check on the /account_receivable/endpoint AND add an additional click to confirm the link between Facebook and Oculus accounts. I believe this properly fixes the vulnerability without degrading user experience too much,\u201dFranjkovi\u0107 wrote in his blog.To go through technical details of this follow this link or read after fix post from the researcher here.", "title": "Researcher reports how to hack Facebook account with Oculus Integration"}, {"date": "January 17, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Android", "Google", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Scam", "Skype", "Spyware", "WhatsApp"], "body": "A malware that can extensively spy upon unsuspecting users and force mobile phones to record audio and video as well as capture photographs and obtain geolocation data, calendar events and financial or business related data stored in the device memory has been identified by security researchers at Kaspersky Labs.Yes, you read that right. The malware is being termed as an extremely advanced program that can steal WhatsApp text conversations and call records without even leaving a trace or making the user suspicious. The malware although has been dubbed as Skygofree it is not at all connected to Sky or any of its offered products and it doesn\u2019t affect Sky Go service either.In its report published on Tuesday, researchers noted that Skygofree is an aggressive malware that is being distributed by an Italian IT firm that is known for providing surveillance wares. Its new version contains over 48 unique commands, which shows that the malware has been through rigorous development process since the time it was developed in 2014.Skygofree uses five different exploits to obtain privileged root access through which it can bypass Android security mechanisms. The malware is also capable of automatically recording conversations and noise whenever an infected device enters a location that has been specified by the attacker. Another unique feature is that it abuses the Android Accessibility Service the function of which is to help disabled users be able to use the device.Moreover, it can connect to the infected device across Wi-Fi networks that are being controlled by operators of the malware; attackers are able to completely control infected devices remotely through reverse shell feature. This malware is equipped with various Windows components that contain this reverse shell, keylogger, and Skype conversation recording capability.As per researchers at Kaspersky Labs, this malware is \u201cone of the most advanced mobile implants [that] includes a number of advanced features not seen in the wild before.\u201d\u201cUpon receiving a specific command, the implant can download a special payload to grab sensitive information from external applications. \u201cThe payload uses the Android Accessibility Service to get information directly from the displayed elements on the screen, so it waits for [WhatsApp] to be launched and then parses all nodes to find text messages,\u201d explained the researchers.The malware is being spread via webpages that seem like legitimate websites of mainstream mobile network operators such as Vodafone and Three.

Sometimes even the extension turns out to be fake and a piece of malware.

The four extensions include:More: Chrome Extension with 105,000 installs is a Cryptocurrency MinerIt is worth noting that Lite Bookmarks and Change HTTP Request Header have been removed from official Google Play Store.The findings of the research were published in a blog post on Monday 15th January by two ICEBRG researchers namely Justin Warner and Mario De Tore. As per the report, these malicious extensions contain suspicious coding that affected over 500,000 users worldwide including corporate workstations. The extensions are used to carry out \u201cclick fraud\u201d and \u201csearch engine optimization (SEO) manipulation.\u201d Moreover, these offer a strong foothold to threat actors because they can leverage these extensions to obtain access to corporate networks and user information. These extensions were discovered while the team of researchers at ICEBRG was investigating the sudden increment in outbound network traffic between a European VPS provider and a customer\u2019s workstation.\u201cChrome\u2019s JavaScript engine evaluates JavaScript code contained within JSON. Due to security concerns, Chrome prevents the ability to retrieve JSON from an external source by extensions, which must explicitly request its use via the Content Security Policy (CSP),\u201d wrote Warner and De Tore.Researchers noted that these four extensions didn\u2019t contain an obvious coding but used a combination of two different features that allowed attackers to inject and execute arbitrary, malicious JavaScript code whenever a permission request to retrieve JSON was received by an update server from an external source. When injected the malicious script creates a WebSocket tunnel using the change-request.info and then the extension uses it to proxy browsing traffic through the browser installed on the targeted machine.\u201cThe threat actor utilized this capability exclusively for visiting advertising related domains indicating a potential click fraud campaign was ongoing. The same capability could also be used by the threat actor to browse internal sites of victim networks, effectively bypassing perimeter controls that are meant to protect internal assets from external parties,\u201d wrote ICEBRG researchers.One of the two features access the infected system for Chrome debugging tools and if detected it immediately halts the execution of the injected code. This has been termed by researchers as an anti-analysis technique used to avoid detection.Currently, it is not clear whether same attackers are involved or there are different threat actors behind each of the four malicious extensions but it is evident that similar TTPs (techniques, tactics, and procedures) have been used. Researchers noted that these techniques can also allow sophisticated hackers to establish a beachhead into \u201ctarget networks.\u201dGoogle, US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) and the National Cyber Security Centre of The Netherlands (NCSC-NL) have already been notified along with affected customers of ICEBRG regarding the four extensions.More: Hackers using Google Adwords & Google Sites to spread malware", "title": "4 Malicious Chrome Extensions Put 500k Users at Risk of Click Fraud"}, {"date": "January 17, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Data", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Virtual Reality", "VR", "Vulnerbaility"], "body": "Virtual Reality apps can be fun to use but they also carry a major threat since they are connected to the Internet \u2013 This time, SinVR app was caught leaking user data due to critical vulnerabilities.A group of researchers from Digital Interruption cybersecurity firm identified a set of critical vulnerabilities in a Virtual Reality porn app SinVR which if exploited could allow attackers to steal personal detail of its users \u2013 To researchers, the app exposed data of 20,000 registered users.On December 28th, 2017, one of the researchers from Digital Interruption discovered vulnerabilities in SinVR\u2019s app, upon exploiting, it gave him access to usernames, email addresses and download details of 20,000 users.But it did not end there, the researcher noted that there was no authentication on the endpoint making it possible for hackers to download a full list of users of SinVR. This means the vulnerabilities would let hackers know everything about a user, for instance, their fantasies and who bought scenes through PayPal. However, researchers could not access user passwords or credit card data.After finding the vulnerabilities, Digital Interruption decided to share their findings with SinVR in order for it to fix those flaws before a malicious threat actors take advantage of them. Therefore, the company sent several emails to the email address they found, sent messages to its Twitter account and also sent private messages to its active account on Reddit but there was no response from SinVR.This forced researchers to publish one of their findings on their blog.

The statement from OnePlus came in response to a number of customers who reported credit card fraud and purchases after buying OnePlus smartphones from its official website (OnePlus.net) between October and December 2017.According to a post by \u201csuperdutynick,\u201d one of the OnePlus customers, he wrote \u201cI purchased two phones with two different credit cards, first on 11-26-17 and second on 11-28-17. Yesterday I was notified by one of the credit cards of suspected fraudulent activity, I logged onto credit card site and verified that there were several transactions that I did not make. I went through the process and switched accounts\u2026 no big deal.\u201d\u201cToday same thing with the other credit card. I do not use either of those credit cards frequently. The only place that both of those credit cards had been used in the last 6 months was on the Oneplus website.\u201dAnother OnePlus customer \u201cadrianlamkh\u201d reported a similar incident \u201cEhh purchased a 5t back in mid-December. Got a notification today (January 11th) from my bank today due to 2 suspicious transactions. This may be true!!\u201dFurthermore, there are several other OnePlus customers reporting credit card fraud on Reddit. \u201cLooks like I got hit as well\u2026 No one in their right mind would order 200 dollars of Papa John pizza. Smh,\u201d SavvyByNature wrote on Reddit.\u201cWoke up to $1600 in attempted charges so it\u2019s safe to say I was a part of this, phones great though,\u201d said another Reddit user \u201cButternutmilkman.\u201dOn the other hand, a British IT security company \u201cFidus InfoSecurity Limited\u201d reported that their researchers conducted an in-depth investigation and found that OnePlus checkout page was using Magento eCommerce platform that has been lately exploited by hackers, for instance, last week BlackBerry mobile website was hacked to place Coinhive code and used visitors\u2019 CPU to mine Monero cryptocurrency.However, In their blog post, Fidus has emphasized on the current vulnerable structure of the payment flow and how it can be exploited to achieve malicious goals rather than confirming whether OnePlus suffered a data breach or not.The researchers analyzed the payment process on the OnePlus website and found that the payment page which requests the customer\u2019s card details is hosted on-site and did not offer iFrame integration with the payment processor.\u201cThis means all payment details entered, albeit briefly, flow through the OnePlus website and can be intercepted by an attacker. Whilst the payment details are sent off to a third-party provider upon form submission, there is a window in which malicious code is able to siphon credit card details before the data is encrypted,\u201d Fidus said.Moreover, researchers identified two more issues within the site including 1: OnePlus do not appear to be PCI compliant and did not mention it on their website and 2: the company claims it does not handle any card payments made. Whilst card payments are handled by a California-based E-commerce credit card payment system management company CyberSource, the processing form is still hosted on the OnePlus infrastructure.Fidus noted that hackers can use two ways to carry a successful hack attack and steal customer credit card data from eCommerce stores including by placing  Javascript which takes place client-side and by modifying the Cc.php file which requires shell access to the server and indicates a serious compromise.However, researchers did not find any malicious JavaScript hosted one OnePlus website. The Magento eCommerce hacking spree was first discovered and reported by a website security firm Sucuri back in 2015.In response to the complaints, OnePlus\u2019 staff member Mingyu wrote that the company does not save or process customers\u2019 credit card information on their website. \u201cIt is sent directly to our PCI-DSS-compliant payment processing partner over an encrypted connection and processed on their secure servers,\u201d said Mingyu.OnePlus customers should still be vigilant and keep an eye on their credit card transactions and inform their bank in case of any suspicious activity. Those customers who have bought OnePlus products between October and December 2017 should also contact their bank to investigate any fraudulent transaction.This is not the first time that OnePlus is in the news for hacking related incidents. In August last year, a critical security flaw called QuadRooter hit millions of Android devices including OnePlus One, OnePlus 2 and OnePlus 3 devices.In November 2017, a Security researcher found two preinstalled backdoor in OnePlus devices that could spy on users and collect their data without their permission or knowledge.Top, Featured Image credit: DepositPhotos/Welcomia", "title": "OnePlus denies checkout page hack amid credit card fraud reports"}, {"date": "January 14, 2018", "authur": "Carolina", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Data", "Fraud", "hacking", "internet", "Password", "Phishing", "Privacy", "Scam", "security"], "body": "As the big tech corporations are coming under increased attack from hackers, it can make the domestic users unsure of which way they can turn to best protect themselves against cyber-attack: if the big guns are struggling, how does the average Joe keep his personal data safe? No matter how soon new software is available, new scams arise that have identified and taken advantage of the flaws that the makers were previously unaware of. Defense against cyber-criminals needs to be multi-layered to ensure that the risk of security breaches is minimized. Here are 3 ways that you can protect yourself against online attack.You will be aware of the threats that come to you via e-mails. They come in many guises and are usually quite easy to identify \u2013 if you know where to look. Check out the sender\u2019s e-mail address. Typically, the name displayed will be of the trusted organization, but the e-mail address from which it sent will be quite clearly not them. Never respond to these phishing e-mails, by replying you are confirming to the sender that they have a legitimate e-mail address. If the e-mail\u2019s content is sent from an authentic organization, there will be no spelling mistakes or requests for personal data. Never click on a link that the e-mail has provided. Contact the alleged sender by the details on the genuine website. An authentic bank, for example, would never request that you input personal details, and even if the e-mails say that they have identified a security breach that you need to clarify, your bank would telephone you or contact you via letter.Your passwords need to be complex. Never choose your date of birth, the name of your child, or another piece of information that could be found in the public domain. Each app and website that you need to log on to should have a different password. Remembering all your different passwords can be troublesome, and as it is advised that you don\u2019t jot them down, you can use heavily encrypted software to store the passwords.This may feel counterintuitive, but as 81% of business security breaches are due to password weaknesses, it is advisable to use enterprise level security in the domestic sphere. You can find out more about this software by clicking here to read the LastPass review to further understand the benefits available to you.Software security updates are regularly distributed by service providers. They are released as new threats and viruses are identified, and failing to update your desktop or other devices means that you are not protected by the latest security versions of the software. While you may think that the update is only to fix cosmetic bugs, the reality is that the updates contain essential security fixes that have been coded to protect you, the user. The information that you provide websites and apps is enough for hackers to exploit you for their benefit. Think about what you sign up for and the information that you are providing. It is prudent to have a separate e-mail address that you can use for the non-important communications: newsletters, competitions and the such like. Update your devices as and when requested to, and choose passwords that are complex to make life as hard as possible for the scammers.Top, featured image via DepositPhotos/Hipspeeds", "title": "How to Protect Your Personal Data in 3 Simple Ways"}, {"date": "January 13, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Cisco", "Encryption", "internet", "Malware", "RTA", "security", "Technology"], "body": "On January 10, Cisco\u2019s officially released its software platform Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA) that can keep a check on network packet metadata so as to detect malicious traffic. The software was previously launched in June 2017 but it has remained in private preview ever since because only enterprises were able to use it. Now, Cisco has released its general version, which is available on current and former generation data center network hardware and most of Cisco\u2019s enterprise routing platforms such as Cloud Services Routers, Integrated Services Router, and its branch office router are compatible with it.More: IXmaps Map reveals if your Internet traffic is being monitored by the NSAThe revamped ETA can now aid enterprises in inspecting encrypted malicious traffic as well without needing to decrypt it. In simple words, ETA is able to perform passive monitoring to infer content from encrypted traffic instead of opening and inspecting the content.The software would make it easier to detect malicious traffic since cybercriminals have reached such a high level of skills where they can use encryption to hide C&C communications, payloads, data exfiltration and similar other activities from being detected.Conventional malware detection software is unable to detect encrypted malicious traffic without decrypting it first, which is a not only complicated task but also compromises the privacy of non-malicious encrypted traffic. Given that organizations need to comply with certain data regulations (such as US-CERT prohibits organizations from implementing traffic interception software that compromises TLS security). Therefore, detection of encrypted malicious traffic became a grave issue for companies.According to the blog post by Scott Harrell, Senior Vice President and General Manager at Cisco \u201cETA uses network visibility and multi-layer machine learning to look for observable differences between benign and malware traffic.\u201dWith ETA\u2019s arrival organizations can breathe a sigh of relief since the software provides a reliable way to detect and block such threats primarily because it doesn\u2019t need to decrypt for inspecting traffic. It does so by inspecting three features of encrypted data; first is the initial data packet of the network, which stores important data regarding the rest of the encrypted content. Secondly, it searches for the sequence of packet times and lengths to find clues into traffic content beyond what was identified in the initial packet. The third feature that ETA inspects is the byte distribution process across the packet payloads in the encrypted traffic flow. ETA uses StealthWatch software to compare the metadata of malicious and benign network packets in order to detect encrypted malicious traffic.ETA can spot malware in encrypted traffic through the research conducted by Cisco to understand the salient difference between the way malicious and benign traffic uses DNS, TLS, and HTTP. Since Cisco offers telemetry services for security, therefore, the administrative and operational costs are fairly low.\ufeffMore: Shodan\u2019 Malware Hunter to Expose Command & Control Centers of BotnetsTop, featured image via DepositPhotos/FireFix", "title": "Cisco\u2019s new tool will detect malware in encrypted traffic"}, {"date": "January 13, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["backdoor", "hacking", "HP", "internet", "Lenovo", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "body": "Engineers at Chinese firm Lenovo have identified a backdoor in the networking switched namely Rackswitch and BladeCenter firmware. The company stated that the backdoor, referred to in the company\u2019s security advisory (CVE-2017-3765) as \u201cHP backdoor,\u201d was discovered after carrying out an internal security audit of firmware for all the products featuring in its portfolio after acquisitions of other firms. It was revealed that the backdoor affects the above-mentioned networking switches\u2019 Enterprise Network Operating System (ENOS).Reportedly, ENOS received the backdoor in 2004, at the time it was maintained by Nortel\u2019s Blade Server Switch Business Unit (BSSBU). Understandably, Lenovo is claiming that Nortel must have authorized the backdoor addition upon request of a \u201cBSSBU OEM customer.\u201d The backdoor code seems to have remained hidden in the firmware after the BSSBU was spun off by Nortel as BLADE Network Technologies (BNT) in 2006 and even after IBM acquired BNT in 2010, while Lenovo bought BNT portfolio from IBM in 2014.For both the networking switches, Lenovo has released updates and has stated that the company never allows mechanisms that can bypass authentication or authorization or that doesn\u2019t follow product security practices at Lenovo to exist.\u201cLenovo has removed this mechanism from the ENOS source code and has released updated firmware for affected products,\u201d explained Lenovo in its security advisory.Researchers at Lenovo claim that the HP backdoor is difficult to exploit because it requires strict conditions for being implemented given that the backdoor isn\u2019t a hidden account but merely an authentication bypassing method. A variety of methods are supported by the abovementioned switches including Telnet, SSH, a serial console and a web-based interface. Exploitation of backdoor is possible only when affected switches have different authentication methods and security features turned on or off.The backdoor wasn\u2019t identified in the Cloud Network Operating System (CNOS) hence, switches that run on CNOS are safe. Updates for both new switches that bear the brand name of Lenovo and for older IBM brand switches are available as these still run on ENOS.

It reveals the findings of Morphus Labs researcher Renato Marinho, according to which a new globally active cybercrime campaign is underway attacking Monero cryptocurrency.Marinho explains that Monero miners are being deployed on hundreds of computers by exploiting a flaw that is present in Oracle Fusion Middleware\u2019s supported and unsupported versions. There are multiple attackers involved and prime targets happen to be PeopleSoft and WebLogic servers.The attackers leverage a Web application server flaw (CVE-2017-10271) that Oracle claims was patched in October 2017. The proof-of-concept exploits for this vulnerability was published by Chinese security expert Lian Zhang in December 2017, which has probably been leveraged by the attackers to launch this campaign. That\u2019s because as soon as the proof-of-concept was published, reports of installation of cryptominers started pouring in; these reports came from diverse servers some of which were already compromised servers. These servers were hosted by Athenix, GoDaddy, and Digital Ocean.This exploit is quite easy to execute since a Bash script is used to make scanning for potential targets easy and effective. Reportedly, the vulnerability is affecting four supported versions of Oracle Fusion Middleware including 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.1.0 and 12.2.1.2.0 along with one unsupported and unpatched version 10.3.3.0. Marinho notes that the dropper script that downloads the miner in this campaign kills the WebLogic services on the targeted device, which alerted some of the victims. It is also revealed that the attacks started in December, soon after Zhang\u2019s proof-of-concept was made public.\u201cLian\u2019s post may not be the first, but this looks like the exploit that was used in the attack discussed here, and the post appears to have started an increased interest in this flaw,\u201d wrote Ulrich.Currently, there is no evidence of loss of data from the compromised machines and it seems that the exploit\u2019s primary purpose is to mine cryptocurrencies. As per the analysis of Johannes B. Ulrich, SANS\u2019 Dean of Research, at least 611 Monero coins were obtained by an attacker, approx. $226,000.Ulrich noted that the scope of this campaign is quite wide and this means the victims are also distributed worldwide. However, Ulrich doesn\u2019t think that this is a targeted campaign because after the exploit\u2019s proof-of-concept made it to the internet, anyone having some sort of scripting skills could attack WebLogic/PeopleSoft servers.The attacker installs a legit Monero mining software package dubbed as xmrig on nearly 722 vulnerable PeopleSoft and WebLogic systems, most of which run on public cloud services, whereas over 140 systems were in Amazon Web Services public cloud. There are other smaller servers 30 of which are on Oracle\u2019s public cloud service.Ulrich suggests that victims need to patch their servers so as to end their response to intrusions and deleting the miner.", "title": "Attackers Exploit Oracle WebLogic Flaw to Mine $266K in Monero"}, {"date": "January 12, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Computers", "Flaw", "hacking", "Intel", "internet", "Laptop", "security", "VPN", "Vulnerability"], "body": "It has been a matter of days when we found out about the flaws in AMD, ARM and Intel\u2019s computer microchips that allowed attackers to carry out Spectre and Meltdown attacks. Since these microchips are widely used in almost all desktops/laptops, smartphones and tablets, therefore, the discovery sent out shockwaves among high-profile tech giants including Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, and Amazon. Security experts rushed to churn out security updates and patch the flaw. Seem like problems for Intel are far from over because another flaw has been discovered in Intel hardware by Finnish cyber security firm F-Secure.In its official statement released on Friday, 12th January regarding the newly identified hardware flaw, F-Secure stated that it allows hackers to remotely access corporate laptops. However, the company has categorically denied that the new discovery has any connection with Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.More: A Malware That can Bypass Windows Firewall Using Intel\u2019s Management TechOn the contrary, this issue has been identified in the AMT (Intel Active Management Technology) commonly used in corporate laptops. AMT vulnerability allows hackers to gain full control of a device within mere seconds (less than 30 seconds). Moreover, the problem scope is extremely wide since \u201cmillions of laptops globally\u201d are believed to have been affected so far.According to Harry Sintonen, F-Secure consultant and the one responsible for discovering this flaw, the issue is \u201cshockingly\u201d simplistic but has tremendous \u201cdestructive potential,\u201d because it provides complete control of the affected laptop to an attacker regardless of the presence of industry\u2019s best security practices.It is revealed by F-Secure that to compromise a laptop an attacker would need physical access to the device and after accomplishing that, the AMT would be re-configured after which a backdoor will be created. This would eventually let the attacker connect to the same wireless network that is being used by the victim and the device could be remotely accessed. It is also possible to modify the programming of AMT so that it connects to the attacker\u2019s server, which would eliminate the need for the attacker to connect to the same network that is being used by the victim to fulfill their malicious objectives.In a statement, Sintonen explains: \u201cBy selecting Intel\u2019s Management Engine BIOS Extension (MEBx), they can log in using the default password \u201cadmin,\u201d as this hasn\u2019t most likely be changed by the user. By changing the default password, enabling remote access and setting AMT\u2019s user opt-in to \u201cNone\u201d, a quick-fingered cybercriminal has effectively compromised the machine. Now the attacker can gain access to the system remotely.\u201dThe most concerning aspect is that nothing can prevent exploitation of corporate laptops whether it is full disk encryption, VPN, anti-malware software or firewall. On the other hand, successful attack leads to complete loss of \u201cconfidentiality, integrity, and availability,\u201d and the attacker can read and modify all the apps and data stored on the targeted laptop and any malware could be installed, explained F-Secure.More: Flaw in WPA2 Protocol Lets Attackers Intercept & Decrypt Encrypted Data TrafficThe only thing organizations can do to prevent their systems from exploitation, according to Sintonen, is setting a stronger AMT password or completely disable AMT. The flaw is a critical one and organizations need to think of remedies quickly because a system can be compromised in less than a minute.

Two years back mobile messaging app WhatsApp was equipped with end-to-end encryption in order to provide its users comprehensive security from government spying, hackers\u2019 scams and WhatsApp itself. However, making group chats protected with end-to-end encryption is not as easy as regular conversations are. Latest research from a group of cryptographers from Germany\u2019s Ruhr University Bochum proves just that.According to the team of researchers, group chat encryption in WhatsApp and other messaging apps including Signal and Threema is flawed that makes infiltrating the chats much easier for cybercriminals without seeking permission from group admin. The findings of their research were revealed at the Real World Crypto security conference (RWC) held in Zurich, Switzerland on Wednesday. Researchers revealed that they identified a series of flaws in encryption process for group chats in the abovementioned apps and the flaws greatly undermine the security claims of each of these app\u2019s multi-person group communications to various degrees.More: Snowden Explains Why Telegram Messenger App is UnsafeThe flaws were identified in the security protocols of all the apps but WhatsApp\u2019s case is particularly shocking given that there are over a billion users associated with the app. Moreover, the nature of flaws in Threema and Signal are not as serious as of WhatsApp\u2019s since anyone can gain control of WhatsApp\u2019s servers to compromise private groups and perform a variety of exploits such as inserting new people into the group. Since group administrator\u2019s permission is not required, therefore, there is every possibility that criminals would want to make use of the flaws. Paul R\u00f6sler, the co-author of the paper [PDF] and member of the research team, wrote that:\u201cThe confidentiality of the group is broken as soon as the uninvited member can obtain all the new messages and read them. If I hear there\u2019s end-to-end encryption for both groups and two-party communications that means adding of new members should be protected against. And if not, the value of encryption is very little.\u201dIncidentally, WhatsApp utilizes Signal protocol for enabling end-to-end encryption and the flaw is present in the authentication system of the app. Researchers noted in their paper that WhatsApp does not use any authentication method when group admin adds a new member to the group. This makes its servers vulnerable to spoofing since if a person gets control of the app\u2019s servers then anyone can be added to the group. Although the new member will not be able to read previous conversations between group members but after getting added, he/she will be able to access all the messages. There are salient other risks involved such as an attacker can manipulate and delete the messages. As R\u00f6sler pointed out: \u201cHe can cache all the message and then decide which get sent to whom and which not.\u201dThe flaws have been confirmed by WhatsApp as well and the company stated that every time a new, unknown member is added to the group, a notification alert is sent by the app to group admin.

The reason for this was that those devices were encrypted. One case that made news in 2016 was regarding the access to encrypted iPhone 5C device of San Bernardino shooter in which the Bureau asked Apple for access to the phone but the request was declined by the company.At the conference, held at Fordham University in New York, Wray said the FBI had attempted to crack 15,000 devices.

The FBI asked Apple to make a backdoor in 2016 so that, conversations from San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone could be retrieved and used as a proof. In reply, Apple had refused to assist the FBI however, a month later, the Bureau was able to crack the shooter\u2019s iPhone device by paying millions of dollars to Cellebrite, a privately held Israeli company.This is not the first time that an FBI official has complained about encryption in smartphones. Previously, Michael Steinbach, a senior FBI official told the House Homeland Security Committee in Congress that Apple and Google are encouraging terrorism by providing encrypted communication facility.The former FBI director Jim Comey pleaded for a law which would pressurize tech companies to form a backdoor into any encrypted communication device.

Jsmad warned that the interface the completely unprotected and that some sort of password protection is necessary since the interface is used for remote execution if commands.Jsmad wrote in his post on Github that; \u201cwhile the electrum daemon is running, someone on a different virtual host of the web server could easily access your wallet via the local RPC port. Currently, there is no security/authentication, giving someone access to the RPC port full access to the wallet.\u201dMore: How to Safely Store Cryptocurrency \u2013 Review of 5 Safest Bitcoin WalletsThe critical vulnerability allows malicious websites to access and steal from bitcoin wallets that are not protected by a password because the flaw leaves the crypto wallet at the risk of port scanning and deanonymization attacks. Furthermore, if the wallet is protected with a password, even then attackers can steal address and transactions related information as well as modify Electrum account settings. This would eventually lead to extended exploitation of the wallet.Google\u2019s Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy responded to the post from jsmad and notified Electrum regarding the issue while expressing concerns that both passwords protected and non-password protected wallets would be emptied of bitcoin if attackers can compromise them through simple brute forcing method. In his tweet posted on January 7, Ormandy warned Electrum users about the flaw:\u201cUpdate your #electrum wallets. Only having the program running and surfing the web can be unsafe.

As stated by Thomas Voegtlin, Electrum founder, that the company identified the flaw as of critical nature back in November, when it was originally identified. When Ormandy explained how serious the bug was,the developers rushed to release the patch. A partial fix was issued followed by a complete patch. In an email, Voegtlin noted that:\u201cWhen a zero-day exploits is made public, it is important to address the vulnerability as soon as possible because attackers are going to use the exploit.

However, renowned digital surveillance and security tech services provider firm IC Realtime has introduced a new cloud-based AI-enabled search engine Ella that solves this issue to a great extent.The deep-learning based search engine is equipped with natural language search function that allows users of surveillance cameras to search across recorded video footage. Apart from deep-learning capabilities, Ella also uses algorithmic tools to recognize objects, colors, vehicles, animals, and individuals from security camera footages.Hence, Ella makes even a nanosecond of footage easily searchable by letting users type in queries such as to find a white truck and Ella would instantly provide relevant results by exploring hours of footages. Ella has been designed in collaboration with tech firm Camio, a start-up established by former Google employees. According to Camio CEO Carter Maslan, the basic idea originated from a normal question\u201d \u201cIf we can search the entire internet in under a second, why can\u2019t we do the same with video feeds?\u201dAbout collaboration with IC Realtime, Camio CEO noted that the company believed \u201cIC Realtime is the perfect partner to bring this advanced video search capability to the global surveillance and security market because of their knowledge and experience with the needs of users in this space. Ella is the result of our partnership in fine-tuning the service for security applications.\u201dTraditional security camera systems let users search for events by time, date and camera type while the average cameras contain less than two minutes of useful images while recording videos 24/7. The results of our queries are quite broad-ranged and non-specific most of the times and we manually need to do sifting that involves hours and hours of our precious time. However, with Ella, this issue will be resolved as the search engine highlights all the interesting events and allows quick searching across the footages.After being connected to the internet, Ella starts learning and tagging all the objects that are being recorded by the camera; the software is already loaded with recognition capabilities spanning over thousands of objects such as all the makes and models of cars. This is how users are able to search for their required images or objects within seconds.Ella also resolves limited bandwidth issue for HD streaming cameras or NVR by featuring interest-based video compression instead of pushing the entire video to the cloud. Machine learning algorithms in Ella allow it to recognize patterns of motion in every camera scene and identified what is interesting in every scene. HD recording starts only if Ella believes something is important. Through learning from the system\u2019s recording, Ella potentially reduces false positives, such as swaying of a tree in the wind might not be considered important by Ella while a delivery truck would be deemed important by its software. Unimportant events are stored in low-resolution, a time-lapse format so as to ensure uninterrupted security coverage 24/7.As per IC Realtime CEO Matt Sailor, \u201cthe video search capabilities delivered by Ella haven\u2019t been feasible in the security and surveillance industry before today. This new solution brings intelligence and analytics to security cameras around the world; Ella is a hardware agnostic approach to cloud-based analytics that instantly moves any connected surveillance system into the future.\u201dBoth professional surveillance cameras and DIY security cameras will be compatible with Ella.

These apps have now been removed from the Play Store, but prior to their removal, the apps had been downloaded between 1.5 and 7.5 million times.What happens is that when any of these 22 apps get downloaded, the user\u2019s decision to disable ads from illegitimate websites would get overridden by the malicious script and then the app\u2019s icon would be hidden so as to prevent its deletion from the device. It is quite clear that the real objective of this campaign is to generate illegal ad revenue at the expense of the innocent and unsuspecting Android users.As per the findings of some users, some of these ads forced them to answer calls or perform other activities while some noted that despite installing the ad-free version of the Android app, the malicious ad activity continued. Google was informed about the presence of suspicious apps on Play Store, and after they were removed.\u201cDespite the vast investment Google has recently made in the security of their App Store, \u2018LightsOut\u2019 reminds us once again that users need to be wary of downloading from App Stores and are advised to have protection while using them.

Most of the organizations were in some way linked to the upcoming games as some were connected through the provision of infrastructure while some were serving as support groups.

It depends on where the networks are connected \u2014 to specific teams, committees, planners at a high level.\u201dThe campaign, stated McAfee, ran from 22nd Dec and bears all the signs of involvement of a nation-state adversary that also speaks the Korean language. Since the investigation is currently underway, therefore, the company did not provide any specific name of the probable perpetrator of the attacks.This time around, attackers have used a much more sophisticated method than the regular spear phishing attack because the recipient of the email does not need to download any file to the malicious software gets installed without getting noticed by a security program. This fileless malware uses Microsoft Powershell to be launched, which has now become a very common tactic among cyber-attackers.The IP address from which these malicious emails are being sent is based in Singapore and the email requests the recipient to open a Korean text file, which looks legitimate since it seems like an email from the National Counter-Terrorism Centre in South Korea. Through steganography, attackers have managed to hide the malware within images and text.The timing of this campaign is rather crucial since North Korea has agreed to participate in high-level talks with South Korea.

However, with the perspective of security, these USB drives could prove to be vulnerable to your devices. In the mid of the previous year, the famous WikiLeaks Vault 7 series has accused the CIA of infecting USB drives for injecting malware into the PC or device to which they are connected.More: Watch out for this USB Device Charger, it could be Keystroke Logger: FBIHowever, the overwhelming rise in the use of such devices has also raised the incidents regarding privacy. Whereas, the data transfer contains some extreme security risks without you being able to judge the vulnerability before a potential destruction.  The properties of USB drive such as portability and on-the-fly connection to various networks makes it more prone to losses such as physical control and network security breaches. The flash drives are designed in a way which could have some security flaws in them and according to some researchers, these could impact day-to-day computing. This could be an extreme judgment; however, these could at least bring a suspect to the efficiency and trustworthiness of the routine devices we insert to our PCs such as keyboards, flash drives, external hard drives, mouse, and more.According to the findings of researchers, Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell at Security Research Labs, the USB manufacturers do not protect the firmware in USB devices and therefore, a malware could likely overwrite the firmware and could take over the device\u2019s control.Thumb drives or other USB peripherals can be reprogrammed to steal any data written into the drive. Through such methods the USB is used to transmit the firmware-modifying code to the device it is inserted. This could result in destruction much like the previous one through floppy disks, that is, a self-replicating virus which spreads through sparing thumb drives. According to US-CERT, the TechAdvisory.org has reported that 25 percent of the malware are transferred through USB drives. Unfortunately, the malware presence is noticed when there are certain symptoms of destruction and a malware in a single device could lead to other PCs in your home or organizational network. A USB could act maliciously in three ways as predicted by Nohl and Lell;1. A device could falsely act as a keyboard and issues its own commands to the control system for a malicious act such as to install malware or to steal files. 2. Another way it could be damaging is when the USB device pretends to be a network card. Eventually, it changes the computer\u2019s \u201cDomain name system\u201d and directs you to insert a URL for a website to secretly redirect your traffic. 3. These external hard disks or thumb drive could infect the computers more when they intervene at the boot stage prior than the action of antivirus.What could be Done to Minimize the USB ThreatsEither you are connecting a USB drive to your personal PC or into a device of your organization; certain precautions could help you to evade the potential threats. There are some practices for the individuals to secure their devices from USB virus and vulnerabilities.Most of us don\u2019t care when it comes to a device like USB. Usually, we store our important data into these storage devices and therefore, it\u2019s common to share it with a friend or colleague. Due to such exchanges, a virus or malware could easily target your device as well.However, a \u2018free stuff\u2019 is never uninvited, so it\u2019s possible that a left out USB flash drive would be accepted by us. But, always remember that these abandon devices might be purposed to fool you to load a malware into your PC or another device. For that, a survey report shows that the almost 50 percent of individuals who find a lost UBS, they insert it into their device without following certain precautions. Encryption is one of the most effective methods to protect your data, no matter on which device you are using it. That\u2019s why; it is the most recommended practice by the cybersecurity experts and analysts. Strong encryption protocol such as AES 128/256 bit would be the best for data safety and flash drive protection. However, there are a few steps of flash drive encryption to ensure the most effective encryption. Install reputable antivirus software that is purposed to scan the device which is inserted into your device through a peripheral port. Often, people don\u2019t care about the efficiency of an antivirus and keep going with a secured status perception. However, a report from Europe Breaking News shows that only 10 out of 61, antivirus software was able to stop the immense ransomware attack, NotPetya. This is due to a couple of reasons, such as outdated antivirus software or the one which is not powerful enough. It is better to enable auto-update settings so that they update regularly with ongoing security patches. The features such as Autoplay and Autorun should be disabled from the settings. This is because these features automatically run USB devices when they are inserted into the USB port of a device. Also, you should delete the sensitive data from your flash drives once the information has been transferred to the designated location or it\u2019s no longer of use. Due to the portability of flash drives, they are more prone to lose and malicious intervention. That\u2019s why it is sensible decisions to password protect your USB drive for such unfortunate situation.Unlike other devices such as your mobile phones and PCs, you could not set a password for your entire flash drive. You have to select certain files which contain sensitive data and you can simply save those with a USB password.  Using a device like USB has both values as well as risks; however, you could minimize the chances of vulnerability with certain intelligent measures. With a negligent approach to these simple and quick preventions, you are encompassing yourself with many privacy threats.

Every day we get to learn about alarming new details, which reinforce the fact that the problem is bigger than we initially thought. Now, we have learned that apart from Windows, Linux, and macOS, the vulnerability in Intel CPUs also affects Amazon Cloud services, AMD and ARM too.There is no doubt about the fact that the exploits are facilitated by the built-in flaws in CPUs design because of which other programs and codes can access the otherwise discreet and highly private kernel memory section of a processor. The flaw hasn\u2019t been exploited in the wild as yet but chances are that cybercriminals won\u2019t leave any stone unturned to benefit from it. This is what makes the immediate release of patches so much important for developers and OS vendors.If you need to know how you can protect your PC and Smartphone from Meltdown and Spectre then this article would help you out. It must be noted that currently, it is not possible to fix Spectre flaw since the exploit is wide ranged and quite complicated. Not much is known about it as of now and without redesigning of processor and hardware updating, it is not possible to fix it. Therefore, only Meltdown exploit can be fixed. Let\u2019s find out how to fix the issue for different platforms.Updates for Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 OS have been released by Microsoft and can be installed easily after checking Windows Update feature. However, Microsoft states that a majority of antivirus software is incompatible with the new updates. The tech giant hasn\u2019t disclosed the names of antivirus programs that are incompatible with the new security updates but security researcher Kevin Beaumont has shared a spreadsheet that lists the names of incompatible software. Check it out here.Moreover, you need to be sure that the system you are trying to update has the latest BIOS update from PC manufacturers such as HP, Dell or Lenovo. You can find it out through your PC OEM website. A sample PowerShell has been released by Intel and Microsoft to assess if a user has installed the required firmware and Windows update to stay protected from the two malicious attacks.We have come to know that Linux developers have been working for months to devise fixes for Meltdown, which is the sole reason behind the immediate availability of Linux patches for this attack. We suggest that you carefully read the advisories released by your distro vendor since various distributions have been providing these patches. It is also recommended to update your CPU firmware too.For Ubuntu users, it is reported that kernels update will be released by Jan 9, 2018, and the following kernels will be updated:To ensure protection for Macs and iPhones from Meltdown, Apple has also released patches that mitigate attack threat for iOS version 11.2, macOS version 10.13.2 and tvOS version 11.2. Immediately install these updates to be sure that your macOS and iPhone are secure from attacks. Please note that Apple Watch is not yet believed to be impacted by Meltdown and as far as Safari is concerned, Apple has stated that the company will be releasing a fix against Spectre. Furthermore, Apple said in a statement that it is planning to release more updates for ensuring security from Meltdown and Spectre in the next versions of iOS, macOS, and tvOS.The flaw was originally discovered by Goole and it is the only firm that has uploaded a very detailed advisory to address the issue. G Suite and Google Cloud users are protected from the threat. On the other hand, Android users on Google devices can expect a fix in January security patch release while non-Google device users need to wait a bit for the patches. The company already patched the flaw in Google Chrome OS version 63 released in December while for the Chrome 64 browser, the patch is expected to be released on January 23.An update is available for Mozilla browser users and it provides protection from Spectre and Meltdown attacks.

Now there are new details available about the flaws. These flaws were identified by Google\u2019s Project Zero team and researchers from different universities in 2017 affecting Speculative Execution feature of all modern day Intel CPUs (perhaps all processors developed in the past 20 years). These flaws are being regarded as a \u2018massive problem\u2019 as it allows access to low-level kernel memory that is home to all essential core components of an Operating System.Speculative execution is a technique used in modern day microprocessors in order to improve their performance. When a processor uses Speculative Execution feature it stops performing tasks sequentially and starts predicting the calculations in a sub-sequential manner to solve them in a parallel fashion resulting in enhancing the processing of chains of commands. The security flaws have been identified in the way Intel processors are hardcoded for using Speculative Execution feature. The issue is that modern processors don\u2019t seek permissions correctly and information about those speculative commands that are eventually not run is leaked. This allows user programs to take a peek into the protected parts of kernel memory. Kernel memory not only protects the core components of an OS but also monitors their interaction with the system hardware, which is why it is kept isolated from user processors all the time. But, due to the flaws in Intel CPUs, now user programs can get glimpses of everything from stored files to passwords.Graz University of Technology researchers have named the flaw in a group of attack methods: Meltdown and Spectre (categorized as CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5754). As per their findings, these flaws can be exploited by three attack methods, one if Meltdown while the other two are collectively represented as Spectre. Meltdown is capable of breaking the isolation between OS and user applications and lets a program to access memory so as to retrieve protected information about other programs and the OS. Spectre is also capable of breaking isolation between various applications and lets an attacker trick error-free programs into leaking all the secrets. These attack methods can possibly be used by malicious cyber criminals to access the most deeply embedded inner workings of any computer through exploiting the flaws. For instance, a low-level user can gain access to kernel memory simply by running JavaScript code hosted on a website. Or, cloud services users can access other clients\u2019 operations since the services share hardware resources. Meltdown and Spectre cannot be fixed entirely; either on the hardware level nor through a microcode update. Needless to say that billions of computers, smartphones and cloud instances will receive impact from these flaws as cybercriminals would be sharpening their social engineering skills to exploit the security vulnerability. Although there is no incident of attacks so far researchers are of the opinion that exploitation attempts will be hard to detect. As noted by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich: \u201cWe\u2019ve found no instances of anybody actually executing this exploit\u2026.it\u2019s very hard\u2014we can\u2019t go out and check every system out there. But when you take a look at the difficulty it is to actually go and execute this exploit\u2014you have to get access to the systems, and then access to the memory and operating system\u2014we\u2019re fairly confident, given the checks we\u2019ve done, that we haven\u2019t been able to identify an exploit yet.\u201dA hardening technique called kernel page table isolation (KPTI) can help in preventing the attacks. The technique is designed solely for the purpose of improving the security of kernel memory by isolating it from user memory. Yet, this will affect the performance of a CPU; researchers claim that performance decline of up to 30% for affected processors (depending upon the model) is expected in KPTI method is used.On the other hand, Google has patched the security flaws in its Cloud platform while some user may require to manually fix the issue. \u201cGoogle Compute Engine used VM Live Migration technology to perform host system and hypervisor updates with no user impact, no forced maintenance windows, and no mass reboots required. However, all guest operating systems and versions must be patched to protect against this new class of attack regardless of where those systems run,\u201d said Google.Amazon said the company is aware of the issue recently disclosed research regarding the side-channel analysis of speculative execution on modern computer processors.\u201cAll but a small single-digit percentage of instances across the Amazon EC2 fleet are already protected. The remaining ones will be completed in the next several hours, with associated instance maintenance notifications. While the updates AWS performs protect underlying infrastructure, in order to be fully protected against these issues, customers must also patch their instance operating systems. Updates for Amazon Linux have been made available, and instructions for updating existing instances are provided further below along with any other AWS-related guidance relevant to this bulletin,\u201d said Amazon.Since the flaws affect all the Intel processors manufactured in the past decade, therefore, it is understandable that developers of every major platform are now frantically working on patches to fix the fault. Windows 10 has already been patched by Microsoft and patches for Windows 7 and 8 are in the pipeline. AMD is investigating the issue while the ARM is trying to find a way to address the issue. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is quite secure. Apple has now confirmed that Meltdown vulnerabilities will be mitigated in its macOS 10.13.2 and iOS 11.2 updates while updates for Spectre attacks affecting Safari for iOS and macOS will be arriving soon.Moreover, Mozilla (1), Red Hat (2), VMware (3), Cisco (4), NVIDIA (5), Rackspace (6) and Digital Ocean (7) have also confirmed the issue and working on issuing patches.", "title": "Meltdown and Spectre Flaws Collateral Damage to OS & Cloud Services Unavoidable"}, {"date": "January 4, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["breach", "DHS", "hacking", "internet", "LEAKS", "Military", "Privacy", "security", "USA"], "body": "A data breach targeted towards the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has resulted in the exposure of personally identifiable information of over 240,000 DHS employees (247,167 to be precise) including both current and former personnel.Reportedly, the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Case Management System was accessed and data belonging to individuals linked with previous investigations by the department was obtained.

Cyber/Computer Forensics is a department that comes under Digital Forensic Science for improving cybersecurity. In a 2002 book, Computer Forensics, authors Kruse and Heiser define computer forensics as involving \u201cThe preservation, identification, extraction, documentation, and interpretation of computer data\u201d.They basically follow a certain standard procedure of investigation. First, they physically isolate the infected device from the network and make sure it\u2019s been backed up and cannot be contaminated by the outer intrusion. Once they safeguard the device, it is kept aside for further procedures and the investigations are done in the cloned one.To understand the facts about computer better we can assume that the computer is a reliable witness and it definitely cannot deceive. Until acted upon by any external character and the sole purpose of the Cyber/Computer forensic is to search, preserve and analyze the information obtained from the victim device and use it as an evidence.So what are the tools used by these professionals? Here\u2019s a list of top 7 tools (referred by InfoSecInstitute) used with a brief description and key features.SIFT has the ability to examine raw disks (i.e. the data in byte level secured directly from the hard disk drive or any other storage devices), multiple file systems and evidence formats. It is basically based on Ubuntu and is a Live CD including the tools one needs to conduct any in-depth forensic investigation or response investigation. The best thing about the SIFT toolkit is that it\u2019s Free and Open Source. SIFT can match any modern day incident-response and forensic tool suite which is also featured in SANS Advanced Incident Response course. So what sort of evidence formats does SIFT support? It supports anything ranging from Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) to RAW (dd) evidence formats and even more.  ProDiscover Forensic is that Computer/Cybersecurity tool which can enable the professionals to locate all the data from a particular computer storage disk and also simultaneously protects the evidence and creates the documentation report used for legal orders.This tool has the ability to recover any deleted files from the victim system and examine the slack space. It can access Windows Alternate Data Streams and allows you to have a preview and search or capture the process (i.e. take a screenshot or any other means) of the Hardware Protected Area (HPA). ProDiscover Forensic uses its own technology to conduct this exercise. Hardware Protection for the data in any system or organization is a very important thing and also equally tough for anyone to break through it. ProDiscover Forensic reads the disk at the sector level and hence you can say that no data can be hidden from this tool. Volatility Framework is a framework which was exclusively released by Black Hat. It directly relates to the Advance Memory Analysis and Forensics. Advance Memory Analysis and Forensics are basically about analyzing the volatile memory in the victim system. Volatile memory or Volatile data is the data that changes frequently and can be lost when you restart any system. This data analysis can be done using Volatility Framework. This framework introduced the world to the power of monitoring runtime processes and state of any system using the data found in RAM (Volatile memory).This framework also provides a unique platform that enables the Forensic research towards better efficiency which can be immediately taken up by Digital Investigators. This tool is used by the Law Enforcement of the country, the defense forces or any commercial investigators all over the world.The Sleuth Kit (+Autopsy) a command line interface is a mode of interacting with a computer program. Here the users/clients issue commands to the program successive lines of text known as commands in a programming language.Similarly Sleuth Kit is a collection of such command line interfaces/tools. It allows the user to examine the disk images os the victim device and recover the damaged files. It is generally used in Autopsy along with many other Open Source or Commercial Forensic tools.Autopsy\u00ae along with Sleuthkit is a GUI-based program. It allows the user to examine the hard drives and smartphones with better efficiency than other tools. Caine is built upon a Linux environment. It is actually a live CD containing a number of forensic tools required for. Since the latest version of CAINE is built on the Ubuntu Linux LTS, MATE, and LightDM, anybody who is familiar with these need not put in extra effort to work on CAINE. Xplico is yet another Open Source Network Forensic analysis tool which can reconstruct the content of any acquisitions performed by packet sniffer such as Wireshark, ettercap etc. This tool can extract and reconstruct the content from anywhere.Xplico is installed by default in some of the digital forensics and penetration testing Operating Systems Kali Linux, BackTrack and even more.X-Ways Forensics is the advanced work environment used extensively by the Forensic Examiners. One of the problems faced by the professional while using any Forensic toolkit is that they are resource-hungry, slow, incapable of reaching all nook and corners. Whereas X-Ways Forensics is not resource-hungry, faster, finds all the deleted files and comes with additional features. This forensic tool is user-friendly and fully-portable and can be carried on a USB stick.

Now, the IT security researchers at Symantec have discovered malware that secretly spies upon Uber\u2019s Android app and extracts private, sensitive data such as users\u2019 passwords. This allows attackers to hijack the accounts owned by Uber users and has been dubbed as Android.Fakeapp.The Android malware is capable of mimicking Uber\u2019s interface; it was identified after various Trojan pop-ups were observed by the researchers on the screen at regular intervals. The purpose was to fool the users into giving away their phone numbers and passwords. When the user presses Enter, the malware sends login credentials to a remote server. The attackers would receive the information and use it to compromise accounts and sell them off to other hackers on the black market.More: Uber users beware; Faketoken Android malware hits ride-sharing apps\u201cIn order to steal a user\u2019s login information, the malware pops up on-screen regularly and prompts the user to enter their Uber username and password. Once a user falls for the attack and enters their information, it gets swept up by the attacker.\u201dThis Fakeapp variant also gives a false sense of security to the user apart from showing a fake log-in screen of Uber. This is done to prevent users from suspecting any foul play and changing their password before the malware is able to obtain the required information.According to Symantec\u2019s findings, the case shows that malware creators are always eagerly looking to find new social engineering tricks to trap users.They recommended that users must keep their software updated and install a reliable anti-malware app to prevent malware from infecting the device. Furthermore, it is suggested that apps from unfamiliar websites are not downloaded at all.\u201cWe recommend only downloading apps from trusted sources. However, we want to protect our users even if they make an honest mistake and that\u2019s why we put a collection of security controls and systems in place to help detect and block unauthorized logins even if you accidentally give away your password.\u201dTo cover up the stealing of credentials, the malware accesses Uber app\u2019s deep links to show the current location of the user, which gives away the feeling that user is using legitimate Uber app. Dinesh Venkatesan, the threat analysis engineer at Symantec, stated:\u201cTo avoid alarming the user, the malware displays a screen of the legitimate app that shows the user\u2019s current location, which would not normally arouse suspicion because that\u2019s what\u2019s expected of the actual app.\u201dThe malware is not as widespread as we might believe it to be and a majority of Uber users are protected from it.

There are versatile devices such as child or pet trackers, fitness monitoring gadgets and automobile trackers that work using GPS and GSM tracking capabilities. Services that offer photo and audio recording facility are also on the list of.As per their findings, these devices are managed by different online services that offer location tracking devices. However, these devices cannot be trusted because exposure of sensitive information is a possibility.Reportedly, hundreds of GPS services are vulnerable, most of which use open APIs and weak passwords, such as 123456. This ignorance has led to a wide range of privacy issues, for instance, direct tracking, while logged data is exposed due to open directories of these services. More than 100 vulnerable services were identified by the security experts while it was identified that the devices could be attacked by cybercriminals to access personal data.Attackers need to exploit the default credentials of a device or weakly protected insecure direct object reference (IDOR) flaws in order to access personal information. These features are responsible for allowing access to other accounts of the user by changing the URL parameter value.The security flaws have been dubbed as Trackmadeddon. The information exposed by the devices includes location history and current location, phone number, model, type and IMEI number of the device and audio recordings and images. Moreover, it is also possible to activate or deactivate certain features of a device (for e.g., geofence alerts) by sending out commands. Attackers can also expose information via log files, directory listings, publicly exposed API endpoints, source code and WSDL files. The software was probably provided by the Chinese firm ThinkRace.Researchers noted that most of the devices were identified between November and December while 9 out of the 100 impacted domains have patched the flaws or fixes are underway and more than 12 websites have fixed the issues without informing them.

According to the research, 79 domains are still vulnerable, which means more than 6.3 million devices and 360 device models are vulnerable to data exposure. In many cases, it was noted that ThinkRace has no control over the servers that hosted the tracking device.Experts have stated that they are not 100% sure if they have identified all the vulnerable domains. Gruhn said while speaking with Salted Hash: \u201cWe have 79 domains (including sub-domains) listed as still vulnerable.

This means, almost all Intel processors developed in the last decade contain a huge security flaw that allows regular user programs such as web browser JavaScript can discern the contents and layouts of protected kernel memory spaces.The design flaw would eventually allow malicious programs to access protected areas of kernel memory, which basically is the home of all the essential core components of an OS and its interactions with the hardware.

The flaw is present in the Intel x86-64 hardware and requires an OS-level overwrite on every mainstream OS being patched.The report, published in The Register, states that the bug may lead to grave consequences if OS kernel patches are not released for Windows, Linux and OS X. It must be noted that multiple generations of Intel CPUs are affected by this flaw.More: Hidden Kill Switch Identified in Controversial Intel ME controller chipHowever, the fixes would lead to affecting the performance of CPUs as these would become slower than usual so there are chances that your gaming experience on PC would be affected slightly but not entirely. As identified by researchers, \u201c5 to 30 percent slowdown, depending on the task and processor model\u201d is expected to hit CPUs due to the flaw.Dubbed \u201cMeltdown\u201d and \u201cSpectre,\u201d the attack method involves identifying virtual memory pages in certain sequences in order to reveal memory locations where protected kernel space is present. Since this is a hardware bug, therefore, it is difficult to fix it unless Intel issues a fix in the next generation of CPUs.As of now, the exact details of the design flaw and the extent to which it makes users vulnerable are kept hidden but it is evident that developers are in a rush to release patches, which hints upon the gravity of the situation.In its Monday blog, the Python Sweetness wrote: \u201cUrgent development of a software mitigation is being done in the open and recently landed in the Linux kernel and a similar mitigation began appearing in NT kernels in November. In the worst case, the software fix causes huge slowdowns in typical workloads \u2026 There are hints the attack impacts common virtualization environments including Amazon EC2 and Google Compute Engine.\u201dA short-term fix would be from the OSes, that is, operating systems can apply a kernel Page Table Isolation (PTI) to hide kernel memory addresses. This will force the processor to continually flush its caches holding TLBs.A PMTS software engineer at AMD, Thomas Lendacky, stated that AMD CPUs are not affected by this bug and that the PTI patch will not be enabled on them because its memory controller doesn\u2019t allow the same memory references that let fewer privileges calls to access high privilege information.More: Intel\u2019 Management Engine Tech Just Got Exposed Through USB Ports", "title": "Multiple Intel Processors Generations Hit by Serious Security Flaw"}, {"date": "January 3, 2018", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Botnet", "Brickerbot", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "hacking", "Huawei", "IoT", "Malware", "Mirai", "security", "Technology"], "body": "The code behind Satori malware which is a variant of infamous Mirai DDoS malware has been published online. According to NewSky Security\u2019s principal researcher, Ankit Anubhav the code was posted on Pastebin over Christmas.Initially, the code pushed Satori which means \u201cawakening\u201d in the Japanese and Brickerbot malware to hijack thousands of (Internet of Things) IoT devices on November 27, 2017, including Huawei routers and more than 280,000 different IP addresses.Brickerbot was discovered in April last year conducting PDoS (Permanent Denial Of Service) and literally destroying IoT devices around the world. Now that the malware code behind Satori botnet has been leaked online it can allow hackers to cause havoc by conducting large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\u201cThe proof of concept code was not made public to prevent attackers from abusing it. However, with the release of the full code now by the threat actor, we expect its usage in more cases by script kiddies and copy-paste botnet masters,\u201d said Anubhav in a blog post.In order to avoid misuse, NewSky Security has decided not to share the link to the leaked code.Satori was originally identified by Israeli endpoint security provider Checkpoint during a zero-day attack exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2017\u201317215) in Huawei HG532 devices.

On the very first day of 2018 (or the last day of 2017, depending on your location and region), a security researcher having immense expertise in hacking Apple\u2019s iOS has posted details of an unpatched security flaw present in macOS operating system.\u201cOne tiny, ugly bug. Fifteen years. Full system compromise\u201d wrote the researcher, who uses the alias Siguza (s1guza).The researcher stated that the flaw can be exploited by cyber-crooks to gain full control of the computer. The unpatched zero-day vulnerability is claimed to be 15 years old. The researcher has also posted a proof-of-concept exploit code, which can be reviewed on GitHub.Fuck it, dropping a macOS 0day. Happy New Year, everyone. https://t.co/oG2nOlUOjk\u2014 Siguza (@s1guza) December 31, 2017Siguza, who also calls himself Hobbyist Hacker, noted that this is a dangerous local privilege escalation (LPE) flaw, which allows anyone (even an unprivileged attacker) to obtain root access on the targeted computer so as to execute malicious code. This LPE flaw affects the kernel extension IOHIDFamily, which was designed for HID (human interface device) like touchscreen or buttons.Furthermore, the malware that has been designed to exploit this 0-day vulnerability can install itself deep into the system and cybercriminals can target Apple\u2019s critical security programs like the System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI). In order to successfully carry out the exploitation of the system, cybercriminals need to get users logged out from the system, which is likely to alert most of the users. However, to evade detection, cybercriminals can attack when the system is shut down or restarted.The flaw was discovered when Siguza was trying to identify flaws that would allow him to hack the iOS kernel. While doing so Siguze noticed that some of the extension\u2019s components including the IOHIDSystem existed solely on macOS. This discovery led to the identification of the critical zero-day vulnerability in the operating system. Siguza wrote in his post:\u201cNeeds to be running on the host already (nothing remote), achieves full system compromise by itself, but logs you out in the process.\u201d\u201cCan wait for logout though and is fast enough to run on shutdown/reboot until 10.13.1. On 10.13.2 it takes a fair bit longer (maybe half a minute) after logging out, so if your OS logs you out unexpectedly\u2026 maybe pull the plug?\u201d explained Siguza.People mad at me for dropping a 0day and making them vulnerable: what's your threat model?If it's script kiddies, you're safe because it's just a LPE and nothing remote.If it's people who can get remote code exec, what makes you think they don't have kernel r/w as well anyway?\u2014 Siguza (@s1guza) January 1, 2018The vulnerability is found only in macOS and not in other Apple products such as the iOS but it affects all versions of macOS. Although the flaw is not too serious and concerning it does show that Apple needs to enhance the security of its software. The proof-of-concept created by Siguza is applicable on macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 and earlier versions but he believes that the exploit can be tweaked to become effective on a new version of macOS 10.13.2 released on Dec 6.Siguza further added that the reason why he publicly announced his findings instead of informing Apple secretly is that the flaw was not remotely exploitable and Apple\u2019s bug bounty program also didn\u2019t cover macOS. Apple, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t responded to the news or released any statement in relation to the findings of Siguza. We will update the article when Apple responds.", "title": "15-year-old Unpatched Root Access Bug found in Apple\u2019s macOS"}, {"date": "January 1, 2018", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Android", "hacking", "internet", "Pin", "Privacy", "security", "Smartphone", "Technology"], "body": "Smartphones have remained the primary domain of experimentation for cybercriminals as they are always finding out ways to exploit and crack smartphones mainly Android devices. Apparently, researchers at Singapore based Nanyang Technology University or NTU Singapore, have identified a brand new way with which cyber-crooks can compromise a smartphone, which involves the use of device\u2019s sensors.Believe it or not but the very own sensors of a smartphone could provide cyber-criminals the key to cracking your device. Researchers found that 99.5% of the time the method worked and their device got unlocked. It is worth noting that the researchers tested the method thrice and monitored the data from six sensors installed on an Android smartphone. They were able to correctly guess the 4-digit PIN code for the device.Researchers tried to identify the PIN code through exploiting sensors installed inside Android smartphones by letting three people enter a varied range of 4-digit number sequences (about 70 times) randomly and then applied machine learning to the sequences in order to predict the pin code. The team tested six sensors including the magnetometer, accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, barometer and proximity sensor. They noted that when combined with the accelerometer, the gyroscope gave much accurate information and the team hit 10,000 4-digit combos of codes every time. The smartphone they tested had one of 50 most commonly used PIN codes.Finally, they managed to guess the PIN code with 100% accuracy, which is a ground-breaking discovery since previously in a similar research the Newcastle University, UK, researchers could guess PIN code of a smartphone with 70% accuracy.The team opined that the discovery highlights a critical flaw in smartphone security that is posed by the built-in sensors. Since the sensors inside the phone do not need user permissions for storing data and are always open for being accessed by apps, therefore, these can easily jeopardize phone\u2019s security.The researchers believe their work highlights a significant flaw in smartphone security, as using the sensors within the phones require no permissions to be given by the phone user and are openly available for all apps to access.The project\u2019s lead researcher Shivam Bhasin wrote: \u201cWhen you hold your phone and key in the PIN, the way the phone moves when you press 1, 5, or 9, is very different. Likewise, pressing 1 with your right thumb will block more light than if you pressed 9.\u201dThe discovery is also alarming since researchers claim that presence of malicious applications on smartphones is an issue of concern because if these apps record sensor data then the information can be used to hack into the device. Therefore, to prevent your smartphone from being hacked, it is recommended by NTU researchers that longer codes must be used instead of 4-digits. Furthermore, a backup system in the device such as a fingerprint or facial recognition is also helpful but in the end, it all depends upon smartphone makers to identify ways of locking down data stored by the sensors.As researchers wrote in their paper [PDF]:\u201cLimiting the maximum operating frequency of the sensors can reduce the attack feasibility. Alternatively, disabling sensors while sensitive operations like PIN entry can also prevent such attacks. However, these are just temporary fixes, and sensors access in smartphones must be rethought, in general.\u201dIt was quite amusing that although a different code was entered by every individual on the phone the experiment also proved that the higher data is fed to the algorithm the better would be the success rate. This means, if a malicious app is unable to accurately guess the PIN right after getting installed, it can eventually guess the correct code using machine learning, which would help in learning the PIN entry pattern.Therefore, Dr. Bhasin urges that mobile operating systems must be modified so that access to these six sensors could be restricted and users are able to choose to give permissions to trusted apps only.

It seems like the world\u2019s favorite, the multi-award-winner show is not going to have a smooth sail in the next season, which will be the final season of HBO\u2019s super hit show since the alleged script of season 8 has been leaked online. The makers of Game of Thrones haven\u2019t yet confirmed the leaking of the script though.Reportedly, a Reddit user has posted scripts of various episodes of the Game of Thrones including a page of Episode 3, two from Episode 5 and a page of Episode 6. Although we cannot say with certainty that the leaked documents contain content from the original script but a few clues regarding the happenings in Westeros after the breaching of the wall by the Night King are somewhat relatable. Some of the happenings are listed below:[Warning: Spoilers Ahead]In this page, it is written that in a wagon filled with characters Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, Brienne, Podrick and driven by the Hound will race away through a crowd of wights and crash while Dothraki Bloodrider will latch on after being turned into a wight.Reddit user posted that this is the point where viewers will say bye to Podrick.As mentioned above, two alleged pages of this episode have been leaked, which basically give out details of three scenes. First two scenes are between Jaime Lannister and Cersei Lannister; the two are arguing in the throne room at the Red Keep and Jaime is convincing Cersei that Jon Snow isn\u2019t their enemy but the real enemies are outside the city gate. However, Cersei does not listen to Jaime in the end and says that Jaime left her at the time when she needed support.Another of the leaked scenes explains that Jaime is trying to discourage Cersei from stopping the White Walkers from taking King\u2019s Landing. Although it is not written in the leaked scene we can now easily predict Cersei\u2019s weapon of choice.The third scene occurs between Brienne and the Hound as the two ride through streets of the King\u2019s Landing in their attempt to reach the Red Keep. So, the alleged leaked bits from Game of Thrones season 8 episodes inform us whatever will happen in Westeros this time.This episode will apparently be the finale episode of the season. The scene is between Tyrion Lannister and Bronn of Blackwater and Jamie is being cursed for getting himself \u2018killed\u2019 without handing over the \u2018promised castle.\u2019 Tyrion then presents him The Twins. This conversation suggests that the Golden Company generals were \u2018single-handedly\u2019 taken out by Bronn.

Today, we will be highlighting biggest hacking incidents of 2017 including malware attacks leading to ransomware infection or a simple email that turned out to be a phishing email and stole millions of dollars from unsuspecting users and businesses.These incidents also involve those which took place in the last few years but announced in 2017. So brace yourself.In July 2017, the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax suffered a massive data breach in which personal data of 143 million Americans were stolen. This means over 40% of the entire population of the United States had their personal information stolen.The stolen data includes names, birthdays, addresses, driver license numbers, credit card data and including social security numbers (SSNs). The company only announced the incidents to the victims and media on September 8th.Yahoo is often in the news for wrong reseasons and on October 4th, 2017 the company announced it suffered a cyber attack in which hacker stole 3 billion user accounts in August 2013. This means each and every Yahoo user had their Yahoo email and password stolen.2017 was a bad year for Home Box Office (HBO) thanks to an alleged Iranian hacker who stole a massive trove of company\u2019s data including unreleased episodes of Game of Thrones, Curb your Enthusiasm and Insecure etc.The hacker also stole personal data from HBO\u2019s Viviane Eisenberg, the Network\u2019s Executive Vice President Legal Affairs and ended up leaking it online. The data included emails and plain-text passwords for her social media, bank, work and university accounts.WannaCry ransomware attack was one of the most powerful cyber attacks the online world had ever witnessed. WannaCry infection began from the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) on May 12th, 2017 and took control of 200,000 outdated Windows-based devices in 150 countries.In order to unlock their computers, attackers demanded $300-600 ransom in Bitcoin from the victims. Although the United States blame North Korea for spreading the ransomware, there is no substantial evidence. However, whoever was behind WannaCry attack used NSA hacking tools leaked by Shadow Brokers hacking group which will be discussed later in the article.In June, disk wiper malware Petya infected Ukrainian businesses, the British advertising agency WPP, FedEx, the Danish shipping firm Maersk, gas giant Rosneft and the Russian oil. The malware also used hacking tools belonging to the NSA that were leaked by Shadow Brokers.The major victim of Petya malware was FedEx who in September revealed that it attributed a $300 million loss to the attack while TNT had to suspend its operations.In March, a series of denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks hit a US college that lasted for 54 hours straight. In their attack, attackers used a new variant Mirai malware botnet. During the attack, the average traffic flow measured was 30,000 RPS (Requests Per Second), and the highest peak was at 37,000 RPS. The DDoS mitigation firm Imperva Incapsula said that it was the most they have seen out of any Mirai variant so far. They reported that the attack generated more than 2.8 billion requests.In September, the cybersecurity giant Avast revealed that its subsidiary CCleaner was hacked by unknown hackers who infected its servers with a backdoor impacting 2.27 million users. The researchers confirmed that the malicious version of CCleaner was being hosted directly on CCleaner\u2019s download server as recently as September 11, 2017.On December 7, 2017, Cryptocurrency mining market NiceHash was hacked in which cybercriminals stole more than $70 million from the company\u2019s wallet. In the incident, hackers emptied its entire Bitcoin wallet. As a result, the company\u2019s CEO had to resign from his post.Although Shadow Breakers appeared in the summer of 2016, after hacking the National Security Agency (NSA) and leaking its hacking tools and exploits. Those exploits were later on used by hackers and cybercriminals to spread WannaCry, Bad Rabbit, and Petya malware.However, the group made a comeback and leaked yet another trove of Windows exploits. According to New York Times NSA had been \u201cdeeply infiltrated\u201d over the years, especially after The Shadow Brokers conducted a massive data breach against its cyber infrastructure. California voter recordsOn May 31st, 2017, researchers identified an incident in which a hacker stole 19 million California voter records after holding MongoDB database for 0.2 bitcoin ransom. The stolen data included names, city, phone number, home address, voting status, emails and other personal data.The incident highlights how foreign hackers can steal US voters data with little effort.In August, the social media giant for Latin America Taringa suffered a data breach in which 28 million accounts were stolen and leaked online. The data included usernames, email addresses, and their passwords hashed with MD5 algorithm. The company acknowledged the hack but claimed no phone numbers and Bitcoin wallets addresses were stolen.The mother of all leaks was discovered by researchers earlier in December 2017, in which a file containing emails and clear text passwords of over 1.6 billion users. The credentials were collected from different leaks and data breaches and combined in one file.Researchers believe it is the \u201clargest aggregate database found in the dark web to date\u201d beating the Onliner Spambot dump with 711 Million accounts following Exploit.in data dump in which 593 million accounts were exposed. However, the fact that the data was available in plain text format poses a huge security threat to users.A marketing firm DeepRoot that was employed by the Republican National Committee accidentally exposed data belonging to 200 million US citizens. That was around 62% of the entire population of the US. The exposed data includes information like home addresses, political views, phone numbers and even birthdays.The data remained public for anyone to download until a security researcher reported the incident to DeepRoot. The company, on the other hand, acknowledged the leak but claimed it was never hacked. \u201cWe take full responsibility for this situation. Based on the information we have gathered thus far, we do not believe that our systems have been hacked,\u201d said the company.There were several other incidents involving hack attacks leading to data breaches however in July 2017, a mid-year report by Risk Based Security (RBS) identified that there were 2,227 incidents of data breaches as of June 2017, allowing hackers to steal 6 billion records. This means that in the first six months of 2017, hackers stole more data than the total number of medical and financial records stolen in the whole of 2016.Therefore, 2018 can be worse than 2017, since cybercriminals are becoming sophisticated in their attacks while unsuspecting users are outdated with the latest tricks and scams used by malicious elements.Be vigilant, Happy New Year and happy browsing.", "title": "2017\u2019s Top hacks and data breaches"}, {"date": "December 31, 2017", "authur": "Carolina", "topics": ["internet", "Messaging", "security", "Technology", "WhatsApp"], "body": "If you are wondering why your WhatsApp is down, don\u2019t worry,  you are not alone the messaging service is down for many around the world.

But today, citing the tense situation in Iran, the whistleblower has posted a series of tweets explaining why Telegram Messenger app is unsafe and it can be secured with little effort. In his first tweet, Snowden wondered why an app like Telegram has unsafe and censorable public channels when it claims to provide secure messenger service. According to Telegram FAQ page, \u201cChannels are a tool for broadcasting public messages to large audiences.\u201dMany don\u2019t seem to understand why I object to @Telegram having unsafe, censorable public channels in an app that is promoted as a secure messenger.

So let\u2019s talk about it:\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017He then gave a brief background of Telegram in Iran due to the sudden political unrest and protests against the government and how the authorities can use Telegram app to track user conversations for political advantages since Iran has more than 40 million people using the app.Background: @Telegram has a special position in Iran. Its \u201cpublic channels\u201d are an important source of news for many low-tech users. Competing services are often blocked, but Telegram makes concessions to avoid this (like setting up local CDNs https://t.co/Lnec1oemsw ).\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017Earlier today, Telegram shut down a channel that called for \u201cviolent protests\u201d against the Iranian government. It happened after Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, Iranian telecommunications minister, tweeted Pavel Durov, the CEO, and founder of Telegram.Calls for violence are prohibited by the Telegram rules. If confirmed, we'll have to block such a channel, regardless of its size and political affiliation.\u2014 Pavel Durov (@durov) December 30, 2017And then came the suspension order from the CEO:A Telegram channel (amadnews) started to instruct their subscribers to use Molotov cocktails against police and got suspended due to our \u201cno calls for violence\u201d rule. Be careful \u2013 there are lines one shouldn\u2019t cross. Similar case from October \u2013 https://t.co/OWQFBLywjr\u2014 Pavel Durov (@durov) December 30, 2017Snowden, on the other hand, highlighted the fact that due to its public channels the company will face pressure from the Iranian government. The latest example of it is the suspension of \u201camadnews\u201d Telegram channel.On the other, it means @Telegram will face increasing pressure over time to collaborate with the Iranian government\u2019s demands for this or that. Today we saw the communications minister demand a big channel be shut down. And here\u2019s where we start getting into complexity.\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017Should Telegram shut one Iranian channel down to preserve access to all the others? Most would say \u201cof course.\u201d It\u2019s more important to keep that tether to their ecosystem alive, right? They\u2019re in something close to a monopoly position, where the fallback for many is unsafe SMS.\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017Snowden then tweeted to Durov and reminded him of what happened when he was forced from Russia for not doing enough favors at Vkontakte (VK), a Russian-based online social media and social networking service founded by Durov.If we presume @Durov is acting morally, this might sound like an argument for Telegram to do whatever they can to keep their Iranian presence alive. But this is unsustainable, which he should know: after all, he was forced from Russia for not doing enough favors at Vkontakte.\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017He also advised Telegram to come up with features that may help the people by keeping the service accessible \u201ceven after the block\u201d by authoritarian regimes. Moreover, Snowden questioned why Telegram still encourages \u201cdangerous cloud messaging instead of secret chats.\u201dYou can\u2019t keep an independent, destabilizing service from being blocked in authoritarian regimes, you can only delay it. So you need to be thinking about how to continuing protecting people by making the service accessible *even after the block.*\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017And this is where we start getting to my core concerns. @Telegram has for years faced criticisms about the basic structure of its security by prominent cryptographers and technologists. Many defenses rely upon unbroken trust in a central authority (the company). \u201cTrust us.\u201d\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017We\u2019ve seen some improvements, and that\u2019s not nothing. But not the revolutionary rework it needs. Telegram still seems to encourage dangerous cloud messaging instead of secret chats. Experts ask \u201cwhy?\u201d And the answer is \u201cconvenience.\u201d That\u2019s unsafe.\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017Snowden advised Durov to convert all Iranian Telegram users accounts to 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) and teach them how to use Tor bridges. According to Tor Project, bridges relays are Tor relays that are not listed in the main Tor directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if user ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably will not be able to block all the bridges.Governments are becoming more abusive, not less, on the internet, especially in places like Iran, China, and Russia. @Durov said @Telegram has 25,000,000 daily users in Iran. He could be converting them all to 2FA. He could be teaching them how to use Tor bridges. I hope he will.\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) December 30, 2017To read all the tweets posted by Snowden click here. Remember, Snowden is a big fan of encrypted messaging app Signal and advises his followers to use Signal. In fact, in one of his tweets, he mentioned using Signal app every day.

HDDs are a mandatory element of any computing system from PCs to CCTV, bedside monitors and ATMs. Until now we never doubted the security of HDDs and stored data without any hesitation. But probably now we would need to think twice since the findings of a combined study conducted by researchers from Princeton and Purdue University reveal that [PDF] devices using HDD technology can be compromised using acoustic signals are certain frequencies.It can be termed as the first ever example of non-contact Denial of Service (DoS) attack against HDDs. Acoustic resonance plays a prominent role in this attack mechanism. Acoustic resonance is a method in which a sound wave pushes an object to vibrate at high amplitude. This can be done by setting specific frequencies. Researchers noted that real-world systems heavily rely upon HDDs, which is an aspect that inspired this research. It was observed that acoustic resonance causes vibrations in an object so when physical characteristics of key components of HDDs were examined (including read, write head and platters) it was noted that acoustic signals are created that caused considerable vibration in HDD platters. Due to the oscillation, the write and read operation of the HDD got halted, which had the tendency of affecting the security of mission-critical systems.The six-member team of researchers utilized the resonance scattering theory to prove that HDDs can leak critical private data due to electromagnetic or acoustic emanations. In their proof-of-concept, the team showed that their non-contact DoS attack negatively affected the operations of HDDs. As they noted in their paper [PDF]:\u201cWe demonstrate how an attacker can disable a CCTV system by targeting its digital video recorder (DVR) device. Further, we show how the proposed attack can target a personal computer, causing a failure in its underlying OS.\u201dResearchers opened an HDD and exposed its parts to strategically designed sound waves to properly analyze inherent vulnerabilities. After several attempts to attack, an increment in Seek_Error_Rate was witnessed in the SMART logs of the HDDs. This was the pre-failure feature that can affect the system\u2019s performance. When they assessed CCTV cameras, it was noticed that every frame of the video, which was being stored on a DVR had highly \u2018crucial forensic evidence.\u2019According to Bleeping Computer, the method works because sound waves create resonance effect to amplify vibration. Since HDDs nowadays shut off automatically when vibrating to avoid scratching of data-storage platters by mechanical arms that perform the read-write operation because this would lead to data loss and disrupt or even crash the other associated devices. Depending upon the length of the resonance, researchers claimed, it was possible to include temporary and permanent faults.The research was conducted on CCTV systems and desktop computers and both devices were found to be vulnerable to attack by the sound-wave system. However, the disruption relied upon specially designed sound and it was also important that the sound was played from a close distance. It was also identified that if more powerful sound sources are used, the attack range surprisingly increased accordingly. But, while examining CCTV systems, researchers could prevent the device from recording camera data and in Desktop Computer, they were able to drive it into BSOD state.", "title": "Sound Waves can Help Hackers Disrupt Functions of Hard Disk Drives"}, {"date": "December 28, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Amazon Echo", "Bose", "Google Home", "hacking", "IoT", "Privacy", "security", "Sonos", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Another day, another IoT flaw \u2013 Sonos and Bose Smart Speakers Vulnerable to be Hacked Remotely to Play Sounds of Hackers\u2019 Choice.With smart technology, it is very important to remain alert and aware enough about security loopholes otherwise you can prepare yourself for dire consequences. According to security experts at Trend Micro, some of the popular smart wireless speakers can be hijacked to play the sound of attackers\u2019 choice and attackers can even control the default voice-activated assistant.Researchers claim that some models of smart wireless speakers made by Sonos and Bose such as the latest Sonos Play:1, Sonos One and Bose SoundTouch systems, are vulnerable to be hijacked and exploited by hackers. Hackers can easily play any audio file that they choose to simply by exploiting the poorly configured network provided that they have access to that network. This is quite a dreadful discovery because it means thousands of speakers are currently prone to hijacking.Trend Micro\u2019s research director Mark Nunnikhoven states that these smart speakers can be controlled just because of a \u2018carelessly configured network\u2019 or lack of appropriate security. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that these devices assume the network they\u2019re sitting on is trusted, and we all should know better than that at this point anyone can go in and start controlling your speaker sounds.\u201dReportedly, around 2,000 to 5,000 Sonos speakers and 400 to 500 Bose speakers are identified to be vulnerable to hijacking. Trend Micro researchers utilized popular network testing tools to arrive at this conclusion; however, it is suspected that the actual, potential number of vulnerable devices might be higher than this.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});This revelation from Trend Micro [PDF] is not surprising at all since a Sonos customer had reported earlier this year that her speaker played strange sounds every now and then such as of crying babies or breaking glass. Sometimes the speaker also played creepy, ghostly sounds.Researchers noted that the vulnerable models can be discovered by attackers and hackers easily using basic internet scans such as Shodan and NMap while they can access these devices remotely to play any audio they want to. The compromised devices would allow any device connected to the same wireless network to access the APIs that are used to communicate with apps like Pandora or Spotify without user authentication.Furthermore, researchers believe that the exploit would definitely be used to connect to nearby smart speakers like Google Home and Amazon Echo in order to control other smart features like smart lights, temperature controls and/or smart locks. Sensitive information like the IDs of other devices connected to the wireless network and their IP addresses can be obtained by hackers and targeted spear-phishing attacks can be launched to get more information. As researchers noted: \u201cIf an attacker finds out what type of music or even an artist the user liked, it may provide an avenue for an attack. For example, the attacker could craft a spear-phishing email leveraging social engineering or promising tickets to an upcoming gig of the target\u2019s favorite artist.\u201dSonos and Bose both firms have been informed by Trend Micro regarding the identified security flaws. Sonos responded by stating that the issue is caused by \u2018misconfiguration of a network\u2019 and it impacts just a fraction of their customers, who have connected or exposed their devices to public networks.\u201cIn the near term, anyone concerned about this issue should ensure their Sonos system is set-up on their secured internal network,\u201d stated Sonos in an email.\ufeff  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Read more on Trend Micro [PDF].", "title": "Bose &\u00a0Sonos\u00a0Smart Speakers can be Hacked to Play Disturbing Sounds"}, {"date": "December 28, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "John McAfee", "Privacy", "Social Media", "SS7", "twitter"], "body": "The official Twitter account of security guru John McAfee was apparently hacked on December 28th.

These emails are supposed to be sent by commonly used printer and scanner brands, which is why nobody tends to suspect foul play. The attachments in the spoofed emails contain malware.More: Hacker takes over thousands of Printers; sends alerts to usersFleming Shi, the technology SVP at Barracuda, wrote in an official blog post that corporate printers are extensively used across the globe primarily because these devices can scan and copy pages and send emails of scan as well as provide an easy way to exchange PDF versions of important documents. These devices are different from simple printers and this is why these are so much in demand. Perhaps, cybercriminals have their eyes set on corporate printers and scanners now.The emails contain very regular and normal looking subject lines such as Scanned from HO, Scanned from Canon or Scanned from Epson, etc. Cybercrooks have modified extension and file names and hidden the malicious coding in such a way that email antivirus software cannot detect them.When the attachment is downloaded, the malware immediately installs a backdoor on the machine. This backdoor offers unauthorized access to the targeted PC to cybercriminals and grants the attacker capability of spying on the device.Furthermore, the malware can perform functions like tracking every move of the machine, modifying computer settings, copying documents, using bandwidth for malicious tasks and access other systems connected to the infected machine. It can scan connections as well to obtain higher user rights on the desktop such as local admin rights. Attackers can also use the malware as ransomware by simply changing the wallpaper of the infected computer and display any message that they want. Therefore, it is important to double check the sender prior to opening any attachments that come with the email.

This time, according to a joint research conducted by security firms SfyLabs and Avast Threat Labs, there is a new Android malware strain that can pose as not a hundred or two but nearly 2,200 banks to steal passwords and carry out fraud. The malware, dubbed as Catelites Bot, can pose as Santander and Barclays banks as well.The malware has potential links to the infamous Russian gang who managed to infect over a million devices using the CronBot Trojan and make a whopping $900,000. This gang, however, was dismantled recently.The malware can get installed on an android device in more than one ways such as via fake, malicious applications available at third-party app stores or phishing websites. It may also get installed with malicious malware. Catelites can intercept texts, lock the mobile phone, delete device data, access phone numbers, modify speaker volume, spy on message conversations and force password unlocks.After being downloaded, an icon titled System Application appears on the screen. When the user clicks on this icon, the software asks for admin rights. In case the victim grants these permissions, the icon disappears and the real job of Catelites Bot starts. Now the screen displays three trustable app icons of Gmail, Google Play, and Chrome. And then the malware looks for credit card information.When the victim opens any of these three new icons, a fake overlay appears asking for sensitive financial information. Considering that the icons are of reliable apps, a majority of users will fall prey to this trap and enter the required data. However, if the user suspects foul play then attackers have another trick mechanism in place; the overlay will be present on the top of the screen so that the user tries to get rid of it by providing the required information.The primary objective of the malware is to obtain bank account login details. Since the malware can pose as most of the top tier banks and financial institutions, therefore, users are bound to be deceived. When banking app is opened, the malware produces a fake overlay in place of the authentic banking app screen and the user may not know that it is not the real bank app where he or she is entering bank login credentials and credit card information. When this is done, attackers can easily access your bank account and credit card.In their blog post, security experts stated that CronBot and Catelites are quite similar to each other. According to Nikolaos Chrysaidos from Avast:\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have any evidence that the Catelites Bot actor is linked to CronBot, it is likely that Catelites members have gotten their hands on the Cron malware and repurposed it for their own campaign.\u201d\u201cThe malware has the ability to automatically and interactively pull Android banking applications\u2019 logos and names from Google Play Store. While the manipulative mobile banking screens don\u2019t resemble the original banking apps, the power lies within the malware\u2019s shotgun approach: Targeting millions of users of thousands of banks to increase the likelihood a few victims will fall for the trick,\u201d added Chrysaidos.You can stay protected by using an updated anti-virus for Android devices. If you don\u2019t have it then boot the phone into safe mode to ensure that the malware is not installed. If you find any suspicious apps, immediately delete them. Also, remember never to grant admin rights to a program or app unless you are completely sure about the authenticity of the app.Moreover, as we always recommend, never download apps from third-party app stores and only use authentic platforms like Google Play. Whenever you open your bank app, try to find out if the app is behaving normally or not and if you suspect something then immediately close it.The malware is identified in Russia until now but experts believe that this is just a testing stage and the attackers will most probably try to spread it to other parts of the world to target banks worldwide. Until now, approx. 9,000 users have been targeted.Source: Avast", "title": "Catelites Android Malware Poses as 2,200 Bank Apps"}, {"date": "December 25, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Browser", "Cryptocurrency", "Malware", "Monero", "Opera", "Privacy", "security"], "body": "Opera browser developers have good news for web users annoyed by the cryptocurrency mining capabilities of certain websites that drain the life out of their CPUs. The Norwegian browser developer firm, Opera, has introduced Opera 50 beta version, which is the first every popular browser to come with cryptocurrency mining blocker. The beta version offers brand new defense mechanism to prevent cryptojacking and cryptocurrency mining software hidden in websites, which is a rising trend nowadays. Mining is pretty dangerous for the devices because it can hugely affect the performance of your device, either computer or mobile, and waste electricity too.More: After iOS, Opera\u2019s Free VPN App is Available for Android DevicesNot only cyber-crooks but organizations are hiding JavaScript miners on websites as well as deploying pop-under windows due to which the sites continue to use the visitor\u2019s CPU even when the visitor has left the site. Opera explains in its blog post about what happens when the CPU is used by cryptocurrency miners:\u201cYour CPU suddenly working at 100 percent capacity, the fan is going crazy for seemingly no reason, and your battery quickly depleting might all be signs that someone is using your computer to mine for the cryptocurrency.\u201dThis can be termed as a step forward in safeguarding the privacy of users and protection of computers.

Most people prefer shopping online and that is where hackers and cybercriminals take full advantage of the situation and scam unsuspecting users.Here are some Holiday and Christmas scams you should be aware of:Fake online gift stores are one of the most successful ways of tricking shoppers into handing over their banking data. These stores offer a jaw-dropping discount which naturally catches attention for those willing to spend less and get more in return. But it all ends up ruining holiday season as the sole purpose of such stores are stealing your data for their use.Do not worry, you still can find out if that amazing sale or discount is real by doing some social engineering, Googling about the store, looking for its social media presence. Pro tip: Use Who.is to check who owns the store\u2019s domain and when was it registered. If \u201cthese stores\u201d pop up days or weeks before the holiday season it is an alarm for sure.Phishing attacks are not just increasing, they\u2019re also evolving and when it is holiday season scammers tend to target users more than ever. In some cases, it has been noticed that a phishing email plays with the religious sentiments of people and use charity related verses from scriptures to trick people into sending donations.In some cases, scammers use fake donation sites to steal user data such as social media or email credentials and banking data of victims. In some cases, the phishing email invites victims to fake Christmas markets and ask them to sign up with their banking and personal data such as name, address and contact number.For some reason, Hollywood celebrities are often used in the distribution of online scams. Like every year, this time scammers are using Oprah Winfrey\u2019s name to conduct a Christmas cash giveaway scam on Instagram.This type of scams is also known as \u201cSecret Sister Scam.\u201d In this scam, Instagram users are being told to follow Oprah\u2019s fake account on the site and share it with their friends to earn $5,000 (\u20ac4,216). However, not only the account is fake the purpose of it is to get followers on the social media site. Oprah also noticed the scam and used Twitter to address the issue calling it \u201cFraud Alert.\u201dFor businesses, the holiday season is hectic and requires more manpower. For this, scammers post fake job listings to lure users into making quick cash, however, depending on the seriousness some scams steal candidates personal data while some asks for money to sign up for the job. Remember, if someone asks for money or Social Security Number (SSN) consider it a scam and do not fall for it.It might feel great to receive gifts but during holiday season scammers send specially crafted emails informing users about the delivery of a gift that they never ordered or in case they did, it has been delivered to a wrong address. Either way, victims are asked to click on a link to confirm that they ordered the delivery and that is where their personal information or card details are targeted.As discussed above, scammers use phishing emails to steal personal data, however, infecting users with malware is also one of the things a phishing email can do. Yet, there are tons of ways in which a malware can infect your devices such as Christmas card embedded with a malicious file, sending the malware-infected link in an email or using instant messaging services like Facebook Messenger, Skype and WhatsApp.In this case, remember never click on any link coming from an unknown email and avoid clicking or downloading attachments. In case your device is infected with a malicious software run an in-depth antivirus scan as it can be a malware equipped with ransomware capabilities that end up locking your files and ask for money to receive a decryption key.There are several other scams such as Hotel scams, E-cards scams, E-voucher scams and Wishlist scams etc. Therefore, be vigilant, shop from authentic and verified online stores, keep an eye on your bank account and card activity and contact the bank in case of any suspicion. If you have gone through the list of this scam alert we hope you will not fall for any Holiday or Christmas scams.Earlier, researchers revealed that \u201c90% of the people we ask will provide not just the spelling of their names but their email addresses without confirming our identity while 67% of the people we ask will give out social security numbers, birth dates or employee numbers.\u201dHappy browsing and seasons greetings.", "title": "Holiday and Christmas scams users should be aware of"}, {"date": "December 24, 2017", "authur": "Asad Gilani", "topics": ["cyber attacks", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Ransomware", "Scam", "security", "Social Media", "Spyware", "Technology", "USB"], "body": "Living in a modern digital era of computers can bring a lot of risks including data exfiltration to you and your PC. Computers are extremely vulnerable, and if the person on the other side of your network knows how to find the exact loophole in the system \u2013 you may suffer from huge loss of data and permanent damage to your PC.Even your personal data can be lost, and we are not talking here just about the firewall. A firewall can help, and it does in fact help, but there are a lot of other channels that can make your computer vulnerable to all sorts of malware.For example, leaving a trace while Tweeting, different forum posting, etc. These are all things that represent the specific types of channels that an attacker can find to get in your system. One of the best indicators of how much malware is spread is in the statistics. Math does not lie, and here are the facts:1: Simple browser attacks account for almost half of the attacks (45%), and it is done by tracing the packets you sent to a specific website.2: Android malware has had exponential growth \u2013 in the past year, malware in the Google Play Store has risen by amazing 388 percent.3: Software that is not updated, especially Java and Flash; there are some big companies that still use Java 6 today, which is extremely vulnerable.4: Leaving statistics aside, here are the 5 most common ways attackers get their malware into your system, and how you could defend against it.It is obvious; anybody can put anything into a file and name it whatever he or she wants. It may look legit to you, and you do not know until you download and open it.As reports from Palo Alto say, a huge majority of malware entrances into systems are with a drive-by download. The best cure for this is to scan your computer and file first \u2013 before you open it.There are many software services for that; you can check out everything about it here.You would be surprised with the statistics of email malware. Biggest data exfiltration in the past has occurred via email and messaging systems. A huge majority of email sent today contains some kind of malware.Luckily the services we use such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook possess a certain level of security \u2013 so you have filters for spam as well as the service sometimes not even letting you open a certain file.This technique is also called phishing, and it has different purposes \u2013 from hacking social media accounts to tracking your keystrokes and getting all your computer data emailed directly to them.They can even be pre-programmed, so the malware gets spread from your email without you knowing about it. Be careful what you open and whom it\u2019s from!All of the USB devices have a file called autorun. That is the way they work, as soon as you put it on your PC, the autorun is being started, and that is the first thing that happens when plugging your USB in.However, the problems begin when you realize that this autorun file can be changed and modified. There were some very popular USB attacks in the past, used to spy on people, watch their screen and what they are doing. Be careful when you go to internet cafes or coffee shops \u2013 their PCs might already be infected and so will your USB. Take the USB only from the people you genuinely trust and make sure your anti-virus software is enabled all the time.Admittedly, different malware scripts are written today, and what is really scary is that once a computer gets infected all other computers on the same local network can get infected too.They share one public router IP address and these computers are open to the world all the time. That group of linked computers may become extremely vulnerable to all other kinds of threats, just because one computer got infected in any way. Take care of your router and network management. Software are being developed all the time, and just because you are too lazy sometimes to install the newest update you may expose your computer to various different kinds of threats.Software updates are done because the programmers that coded it in the first place find some kind of bug that needs to be fixed; they do not just come on its own. Most big companies of today make updates for their software regularly \u2013 Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, etc.Some of them even have long-term support so you do not have to worry about any problems you might possibly get into. If the hackers find a bug before the original developers, that is called a zero-day exploit, and there is no cure for it.Until the updates come out, you are vulnerable to any other person that downloaded the same piece of software from the internet \u2013 not thinking about security measures.A zero-day exploit is popular on the topic of cybersecurity, and it is known for a long period of time. The hardest thing is that you cannot effectively avoid it; it is the software developers mistake and not yours.In hope of staying \u2018clean\u2019 on the internet, do regular anti-virus checks of your PC \u2013 This should be your first and most basic step to staying safe.

To help alleviate that fear, on 22nd December the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden and a team of collaborators have launched a new Android app called Haven. The app will help Journalists and others in protecting their information.Haven will turn your laptops and phones into small security systems. Haven was designed to track sudden changes in the environment using phones inbuilt sensor. Micah Lee from The Intercept described the use of Haven to deal with malicious attacks.He said, if you leave the laptop in a hotel safe and put your Haven phone on it, should someone try to open your laptop without your presence, the Haven phone will detect the light changes and if you\u2019re laptop moves then its camera may capture a screenshot of that attacker.Devices that record audio clips and pictures in your office or home and sends directly over the internet can be unbearable for those as privacy-sensitive as Snowden. Snowden has not carried a mobile phone with him since he became the first fugitive from US government in 2013.Haven takes some serious measures from being turned on by anyone other than the phone owner. In fact, it combines encrypted massaging application to make sure that every picture and audio clip sent to the owner is fully encrypted.As another safety measure, Haven can work with an Android app known as Orbot which can turn your phone into a Tor onion service. This means that your Haven phone can be logged into and controlled by a computer or another phone using Tor undetectable connection. In fact, the founder of guardian project Nate Freitas said that Haven is the most secure and powerful system ever.Snowden added that he has used Haven while traveling and in hotel rooms with additional precautions [PDF] that he refused to say.Edward says, Haven can detect the presence of an intruder but cant prevent him from harming someone.

Researchers at renowned cyber-security firm Trend Micro have discovered a malicious new cryptocurrency mining malware that specifically targets Facebook Messenger users . The malware has been dubbed as Digmine. It is hidden in a video file bearing the title video_xxxx.zip, and it is capable of infecting the entire machine if this file is opened and executed by the user.According to Trend Micro\u2019s blog post, the malware installs a fake Chrome extension, which lets it access the Facebook profile of the victim and also send messages containing the malware file to all the contacts on the victim\u2019s behalf. This is how this campaign is spreading so rapidly. However, the campaign is mainly effective on the desktop version of Google Chrome whereas it is not infecting users who accessed Facebook Messenger on mobile.Moreover, when Digmine is installed on the machine, it keeps downloading other components, which includes a cryptocurrency miner, which uses the PC for mining Monero, a popular cryptocurrency. Miner.exe is the mining component, which is basically an iteration of XMRing, an open-source Monero miner. This miner has been reconfigured to launch via config.json file and there is no need to receive parameters from the command line. Specific HTTP headers are used by the downloader and mining component for establishing communication with the command-and-control server.It is also capable of performing other routines including the installation of autostart method registry and system infection marker. It can search and launch Chrome browser to load the infected browser extension retrieved from its command-and-control server. Since the attackers launched the extension through the command line, therefore, they were able to bypass Chrome Web Store scanning, which is responsible for loading and hosting all Chrome extensions.The malware is currently active in Thailand, Ukraine, Venezuela, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, South Korea and the Philippines but Trend Micro researchers noted that the malware would definitely spread elsewhere because of its default propagation function. The malware was firstly spotted in South Korea.The malware is coded in Autolt and the file that appears to be containing video is actually an Autolt executable script. This means, if the Facebook account is set to be on automatic log-in then the malware will exploit Facebook Messenger so that the malicious link is sent to other friends of the user.Facebook reportedly has removed all the links connected to Digmine but it is suspected that hackers would again target users by modifying the current links or by adding fresh code to hijack the user\u2019s account or at least exploit it in some way. As of now, Digmine\u2019s aim is to stay on the infected system for as long as possible and to infect as many computers as possible to get more money.Facebook states that a number of automated systems are maintained by the social network to stop malicious links and files from invading Facebook and its Messenger app but even then if the computer gets infected with malware, the company will compensate by providing free anti-virus scan conducted by its trusted partners.", "title": "Hackers Spreading Digmine Monero Mining Malware via Facebook"}, {"date": "December 21, 2017", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Android", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Crime", "Google", "Google Play", "internet", "Malware", "Scam", "security"], "body": "After non-stop malware attacks, Android users have a couple of new threats to worry about and these include cryptocurrency miners and fake wallets on Google Play Store.

It had more than 1000, to 5000 installs while one of the users wrote in the menu section that \u201cThis app tried to steal my Google password.\u201dAccording to app\u2019s description, the developer claimed \u201cBitcoin Mining\u201d is \u201cthe most reliable and highest paying app available\u201d while in reality, it was stealing data once installed on the device.The second malicious app was called \u201cBlockchain Bitcoin Wallet \u2013 Fingerprint\u201d and had 5,000 to 10,000 installs claiming to provide buy and sell service for the digital currency.

This plugin already has nearly 300,000 installations, which shows how popular it is among the users. However, when WordFence identified that a backdoor was added to it after an update was released on December 4. Hence, a warning was issued explaining that Captcha must be replaced with WordPress version 4.4.5 immediately.Matt Barry from WordFence explained that they collaborated with WordPress plugin team to create a patch for 4.4.5 version while the developer of Captcha\u2019s code will not be allowed to publish updates before reviewed by WordPress. WordFence would be including firewall rules for blocking five other plugins from Captcha\u2019s developer namely Convert me Popup, Death To Comments, Human Captcha, Smart Recaptcha, and Social Exchange. Barry states that all these plugins also contained the backdoor.According to Barry, they got alerted about the plugin several months after its ownership was changed from BestWebSoft to an unnamed developer in September 2017. Captcha\u2019s version 4.3.7 was released just after three months and this version had the backdoor. He further explained that the plugin\u2019s auto-downloader accesses a link for downloading a ZIP file and once it is inside the ZIP archive, another file titled plugin-update.php is included along with minor modifications to the actual plugin.The file is actually a backdoor. It creates a session with \u201cuser ID1\u201d which happens to be the admin user created by WordPress by-default after being installed. It then sets authentication cookies and self-destructs itself. Since the backdoor installation code is not authenticated, therefore, it can be triggered by anyone. The ZIP file includes another update to the URL link using a similar process that is used for installation of the backdoor but this time its task is to delete all traces of the malicious code.In its blog post, WordFence noted that a group of repeat offenders is possibly involved in this issue since the link simplywordpress[dot]net is associated with Martin Soiza as per domain records while the domain contact email ID belongs to Stacy Wellington (scwellington@hotmail.co.uk), who has multiple domain names registered in her name. It is worth noting that Mark Maunder from the same group launched a backgrounder back in September 2017 while there is a domain unsecuredloans4u[.]co[.]uk linked to Mason Soiza who was associated with other cases of backdoored WordPress plugins.\u201c[Soiza] has a long history of buying WordPress plugins in order to place cloaked backlinks on his users\u2019 sites. He then uses these backlinks to increase page rank in SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) since only web crawlers such as Googlebot can read them,\u201d read the post from WordFence.The purpose behind inclusion of backdoor is to produce cloaked backlinks for different payday loan businesses for increasing Google rankings. Barry traced links to numerous payday loan firms one of which was registered to Soiza while another was owned by Charlotte Anne Wellington. Further probe revealed that Wellington and Mason Soiza are both associated with Quint Group LTD while Wellington has mentioned working for an SEO firm Serpable. Yet, it is unclear whether Charlotte or StacyWellington is the creator of the backdoor code in this case.

Other fields contain financial histories, mortgage ownership, number of children in the household, phone numbers, number of adults and people living in a unity, zip codes and street numbers etc.\u201cFrom home addresses and contact information to mortgage ownership and financial histories to very specific analysis of purchasing behavior, the exposed data constitutes a remarkably invasive glimpse into the lives of American consumers,\u201d noted UpGuard\u2019s Dan O\u2019Sullivan.The internet is full of exposed databases and for UpGuard Director of Cyber, Risk Research Chris Vickery finding those databases seems like a piece of cake since Vickery was the one to discover 191 million US voter registration records and Mexican voter database of 93.4 million citizens.As for the Households data, it was discovered on October 6, 2017, when Vickery discovered an Amazon Web Services S3 cloud storage bucket located at the subdomain \u201calteryxdownload containing highly sensitive and private data.The bucket would allow any AWS \u201cAuthenticated Users\u201d to access and download the data without any further security hurdle. This means that anyone with an Amazon AWS account was allowed to access the data which can be deemed as a treasure trove for hackers, cybercriminals, and foreign spy agencies.There has been no official comment from Alteryx and Experian however, in a conversation with Forbes, Alteryx claimed that the exposed data was not as serious as it has been thought. According to Alteryx:\u201cSpecifically, this file held marketing data, including aggregated and de-identified information based on models and estimations provided by a third-party content provider, and was made available to our customers who purchased and used this data for analytic purposes. \u201cThe information in the file does not pose a risk of identity theft to any consumers.\u201dUpguard on the other emphasized the severity of the leaked data and said that \u201cThe data exposed in this bucket would be invaluable for unscrupulous marketers, spammers, and identity thieves, for whom this data would be largely reliable and, more importantly, varied. With a large database of potential victims to survey \u2013 with such details as \u201cmortgage ownership\u201d revealed, a common security verification question \u2013 the price could be far higher than merely bad publicity.\u201d", "title": "Sensitive Data of 123 Million American Households Exposed\u200b"}, {"date": "December 20, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Crime", "EternalBlue", "EternalSynergy", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Monero", "NSA", "security"], "body": "Due to the unprecedented and unexpected increase in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, there has been a sudden rise in cyber-attacks on cryptocurrency marketplaces and exchanges. Hackers are unleashing all sorts of attacks from DDoS to spearphishing and frontal attacks to make use of the popularity of cryptocurrencies.Now, security firm F5 Networks\u2019 researchers Maxim Zavodchik and Liron Segal have identified a new cryptocurrency mining operation that utilizes recently discovered NSA exploits EternalBlue and EternalSynergy for mining popular cryptocurrency Monero.This campaign has been dubbed as \u201cZealot\u201d and it is being termed as a sophisticated and complex multi-stage attack targeting internal systems that run on Linux and Windows OS. Since the attack involves the use of powerful exploits like EternalBlue and EternalSynergy, therefore, attackers are able to access internal networks laterally. Furthermore, through NSA exploits, attackers install cryptocurrency miners on the targeted systems and networks.The primary purpose of hackers behind this campaign is to access Monero and in their quest, they have managed to affect various Linux and Windows-based servers but so far they haven\u2019t been able to target Macs. The multi-stage attack has a complicated Python agent for Linux/OS X and PowerShell agent for Windows. It also is capable of exploiting servers that are vulnerable to Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart Parser attack (CVE-2017-5638) and DotNetNuke (DNN) content management system vulnerability (CVE-2017-9822).It is not the first time that hackers have used NSA exploits in malware campaigns since we have already witnessed malicious campaigns like NotPetya and WannaCry ransomware in which these exploits were leveraged. However, Zealot could be categorized as different from them because for the first time Struts campaign uses these NSA exploits to access internal networks of targeted systems/servers.F5 Networks\u2019 researchers noted in their official blog that this campaign appears to be opening brand new attack vector doors by using web applications flaws to automatically deliver malware on internal networks.\u201cThe level of sophistication we are currently observing in the Zealot campaign is leading us to believe that the campaign was developed and is being run by threat actors several levels above common bot herders,\u201d researchers wrote.When a hacker is able to access Windows-based system, the PowerShell is used to download and install Monero mining program. On Linux based systems, Python scripts taken from EmpireProject, a post-exploitation agent for Powershell and Python, are used to install Monero miner.It is suspected that hackers have collected around $8,500 in this campaign but the actual sum might be higher than this since hackers could be using cryptocurrency wallets that haven\u2019t yet been identified by researchers. It has been observed that the hackers are inspired by StarCraft video game because the malware files bear names from the game such as Zealot, Observer, Overlord, Raven, etc.This is not the first time when hackers are using EternalBlue NSA exploit to mine cryptocurrency. In August this year, a fileless malware was found using EternalBlue to target Windows devices to mine cryptocurrency.", "title": "New Cryptocurrency Mining Scheme Uses NSA Exploits EternalBlue & EternalSynergy"}, {"date": "December 20, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Android", "Cyber Crime", "Google", "Google Play", "internet", "Malware", "Play Store", "Privacy", "Scam", "security", "Spyware", "Technology"], "body": "Android devices seem to be the most preferred target for hackers as there have so far been multiple incidents involving malware, ransomware and cryptocurrency miner apps designed to infect Android devices. Now, security experts have identified a new Android malware that has been dubbed as AnubisSpy. This particular malware targets Arabic speaking users and its primary attack domain seems to be the Middle East. Researchers have linked this malware with the Sphinx cyberespionage campaign, which was discovered in 2014-15 and launched by the APT-C-15 group, mainly because it also targeted users across the Middle East.More: Loapi malware physically damages Android devices The malware was discovered by Trend Micro\u2019s Mobile Threat Response Team and their findings were disclosed on December 19th. According to their research, AnubisSpy is equipped with wide-range data-stealing capabilities and it can also spy upon the user\u2019s activities. Trend Micro\u2019s team assessed seven apps on Google Play and third-party marketplaces and found them to be containing AnubisSpy. These apps were written in Arabic language and were found to be related to Egypt such as some apps showcased Middle Eastern news and Egyptian television show. The apps had fake Google certificates and were installed only in a handful of countries.\u201cThe apps mainly used Middle East-based news and sociopolitical themes as social engineering hooks and abused social media to further proliferate. Versions of AnubisSpy posed as social news, promotional, healthcare, and entertainment apps,\u201d explained Trend Micro\u2019s researchers in their blog.AnubisSpy can steal SMS messages, contacts, photos, videos, email accounts, Samsung and Chrome internet browser histories and can also capture screenshots and configuration files of Twitter, Facebook, Skype and WhatsApp due to which it is capable of spying on these apps. It can also self-destruct to hide its tracks and delete the data on infected devices.The file structures, JSON file decryption method, C&C server, and targets have a stark resemblance to the Sphinx campaign. It is possible that the authors of AnubisSpy malware are also the operators of Sphinx campaign or they might be other actors.As far as the malicious apps are concerned, researchers stated that these were being launched since April 2015 and their latest variant was released in May 2017. Google was contacted by Trend Micro regarding the presence of malicious apps on 12 Oct 2017 and was requested to update Google Play Protect.\u201cWhile cyber espionage campaigns on mobile devices may be few and far between compared to ones for desktops or PCs, AnubisSpy proves that they do indeed occur, and may have been more active than initially thought,\u201d noted Trend Micro researchers.More: Dune!

The same has happened in this case where a new malware is targeting Android phones.This particular malware, dubbed as Loapi, is an evil piece of code that can perform five different malicious activities including mining cryptocurrencies, conducting DDoS attacks and causing the phone\u2019s battery to the bulge that leads to the destruction of the phone after few days of its installation.It also runs an advertising fraud scheme; the victim feels that they are visiting advertisers\u2019 web pages and every time an ad is clicked the advertiser is paid some amount. Through the capability of mining Monero, the malware runs web requests and signing the device for different subscription services whenever the attacker sends a command.The malware was discovered by Kaspersky Labs researchers and given the wide range of malicious functions that it performs researchers are claiming it to be Jack of All Trades. Loapi has a complex modular structure that is different from other malware that have attacked Android devices so far. It contains an advertising module, proxy module, texting module and Monero mining module. Moreover, this threatening malware is capable of evading detection as well.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen such a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019 before,\u201d researchers from Kaspersky wrote in their official blog post published on Monday.Over 20 malicious apps that are downloaded from third-party platforms and are mostly mobile antivirus or adult apps are responsible for infecting Android phones with Loapi. Victims are lured towards these apps through misleading advertisements. The user is bombarded with never-ending popups and there comes a time when the victim gives in to whatever the malware is requesting for, which usually is getting admin rights. When the rights are acquired, the malware deletes the antivirus to avoid detection. When the user tries to deactivate the administrator account, the Loapi-infected apps close the Settings menu and the device has to be booted in Safe Mode to delete Loapi.Loapi attacks a user in two different ways; firstly, it sends SMS messages and secondly, a group of phones infected with Loapi is created to flood a server with traffic to such an extent that the server resultantly collapses.Loapi is an aggressive malware that made around 28,000 different requests of advertising and subscription within a 24 hour period. It must be noted that since cryptocurrency mining is a processor-intensive feature that\u2019s why it is possible for Loapi for draining the system\u2019s resources quickly. When the battery gets overheated, it expands and ultimately bursts out from the phone case.\u201cLoapi is an interesting representative from the world of malicious Android apps. Its creators have implemented almost the entire spectrum of techniques for attacking devices: the Trojan can subscribe users to paid services, send SMS messages to any number, generate traffic and make money from showing advertisements, use the computing power of a device to mine cryptocurrencies, as well as perform a variety of actions on the internet on behalf of the user/device. The only thing missing is user espionage, but the modular architecture of this Trojan means it\u2019s possible to add this sort of functionality at any time,\u201d warned researchers.The good news is that currently Loapi hasn\u2019t invaded Google Play Store but Kaspersky Lab researchers identified 85 apps that were already trojanized that can steal VK.com\u2019s login credentials.", "title": "New Android Malware Loapi Attacks Phones in Five Different Ways"}, {"date": "December 19, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Adware", "Chrome", "Google", "Google Drive", "Google Sites", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Scam", "security", "TROJAN"], "body": "Today, we at HackRead have discovered a sophisticated malware scam that tricks users into downloading fake Google Chrome browser installer but in reality, the file is infected with malware that installs Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP\u2019s) on Windows devices and connects to certain servers to receive commands from the remote attacker.Google AdWords is an online advertising service that lets users pay Google to display advertisement on prominent slots during its search engine results. For instance, if the user does a Google Search using the term \u201cDownload Antivirus,\u201d the top slot will display advertisement. In some cases first four search results display ads paid by people or companies to get quick sale or traffic.Below is an example screenshot of Google Search Engine results that simplifies the difference between paid search and organic search results. \u201cThe top10\u201d Free Anti-Malware 2018 result is an ad while Malwarebytes link is a result of the organic search.In this malware scam, hackers are taking advantage of Google Adwords service and apparently paying Google to display their website link at the top. But it seems like Google does not scan links before accepting advertiser application or displaying the results to the masses.Although Google Search Results are linked to user browser cookies and/or varies from country to country, we played with \u201cDownload Google Chrome\u201d keywords on Google and found out that the very first search result belongs to an advertiser which once clicked takes the user to a site.google.com link developed using Google Sites service.Google Sites is a structured wiki- and Web page-creation tool offered by Google as part of the G Suite productivity suite. The goal of Google Sites is for anyone to be able to create a team-oriented site where multiple people can collaborate and share files. In this case, however, once the user is on the Google Sites link it tricks users into believing that they are on the authentic Google Chrome browser download site.Upon clicking on \u201cDownload Chrome\u201d tab, users are taken to a Google Drive link that drops a download file on the device. The download file is labeled as ChromeSetup.exe and detected as a virus by Windows Defender Antivirus, however, its relation with Coinrobot.xyz is unknown.A look at Coinrobot.xyz website shows it is a Russian language website that provides cryptocurrency miners to users. However, a background check on Coinrobot.xyz shows the domain was registered on December 14th, 2017 and is used for the sole purpose of spreading malware that targets Windows users and possibly use their computing power to generate cryptocurrency for cybercriminals.Furthermore, upon scanning the malware file on VirusTotal seventeen antivirus software came up with following results:Kaspersky has identified the file as \u201cHEUR.Trojan.Win32.Generic\u201d which according to MalwareTips:We at HackRead believe in online security and busting scams like this one. We have already reported the incident to Google and hopefully, the issue will be resolved soon. As for the users; the lesson is never to click links on the Internet without verification but when hackers can trick Google into using its own platform such as Google Sites and Adwords to spread malicious content, one cannot blame unsuspecting users for falling for the scam.This is not the first time that hackers have used Google Adwords to trick people online. Previously, fake Bittrex cryptocurrency exchange site also used Adwords service to display advertisement on the top slot of Google Search Engine. The campaign did not only trick Bittrex users into believing that they are on authentic site but also stole their funds.

One of these flaws can lead to letting an attacker remotely execute malicious code on the application server of vBulletin. It must be noted that vBulletin version 5 is affected by these vulnerabilities.The findings have been disclosed under the SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program by Beyond Security. Beyond Security noted that after identifying the flaws in late November 2017, it contacted vBulletin but there wasn\u2019t any favorable response from their side. For your information vBulletin is written in PHP and used MySQL based server that hosts over 100,000 websites including Alexa Top 1 Million firms\u2019 websites and some Fortune 500 firms\u2019 websites.One of the two identified vulnerabilities is a file inclusion flaw that eventually allows remote code execution, through which the attacker can remotely include any vBulletin server file by sending GET command to index.php and routestring= parameter and execute arbitrary PHP code. The attacker can create a customized request that is sent to vBulletin server and includes just about any file available on the web server. This technique can easily be performed on Windows OS.A proof-of-concept has been provided by the researcher to demonstrate how this vulnerability can be exploited, however, until now the vulnerability hasn\u2019t been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number.The second vulnerability has been assigned CVE number though, which is CVE-2017-17672. This particular flaw is claimed to be a deserialization issue. The issue is caused by the unsafe use of unserialized() on user-supplied input. Through this vulnerability, an attacker can delete arbitrary files on vBulletin installation and also execute malicious code in certain situations.As per the advisory released by Beyond Security, \u201cvB_Library_Template\u2019s cacheTemplates() function is a publicly exposed API which allows to fetch information on a set of given templates from the database in order to store them inside a cache variable. The $temnplateidlist variable, which can come directly from user-input, is directly supplied to unserialize(), resulting in an arbitrary deserialization primitive.\u201dAlthough the two flaws haven\u2019t been patched by vBulletin the developers will be releasing fixes soon. The company claims that contrary to Beyond Security\u2019s information that it notified vBulletin on 21 November 2017 no ticket was received about the vulnerabilities and only last week did the company got alerted to the issue.In 2016, HackRead exclusively discovered that more than hundred vBulletin based forums were compromised due to vulnerabilities in vBulletin 4.2.2 & 4.2.3. As a result, millions of user accounts were being sold on Dark Web marketplaces.Now that researchers have publically released the information on existing vulnerabilities vBulletin team needs to come up with a fix without further delay while users need to be vigilant and keep an eye on their forum.", "title": "Two critical and unpatched flaws identified in vBulletin"}, {"date": "December 18, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Bitfinex", "Cryptocurrency", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "internet", "security"], "body": "On December 12, 2017, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex announced its servers were under a series of massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

In the majority of such cases, researchers contact the affected party and inform them about the exposed data, but in this case, Kromtech researchers were unable to identify the owner.Remember, MongoDB is used by popular organizations such as LinkedIn, MetLife, City of Chicago, Expedia, BuzzFeed, KMPG and The Guardian etc.Since early 2017, hackers have been targeting MongoDB based databases. In this case, according to researchers hackers discovered voters records, took control of it and left a ransom note before deleting the entire database.The ransom note asked the owner of the database to send 0.2 bitcoin, that is around USD 3,123 (thanks to sudden price hike) to a bitcoin address. However, the fact that cybercriminals erased the database, researchers were unable to conduct a detailed analysis.Furthermore, the group stated that \u201cyour database is downloaded and backed up on our secure servers.\u201d Simply put: the group now holds the database and wants the owner to pay to get it back.In total, the 4GB database contained 19,264,123 records. As expected, it included highly personal and sensitive data of registered Californian voters such as:Moreover, researchers also found a 22GB file that contained a massive 409,449,416 records of complete California voter registration records. It is believed that the database was created back on May 31st, 2017.Since 2016, there have been a number of incidents where MongoDB database have been found exposed on the Internet or held for ransom. In January this year, several unsecured MongoDB databases were hijacked by a hacker, who not only wiped out those databases but also stored copies of them and asked for a ransom of 0.2 bitcoins (roughly US$ 211 at that time). Researchers also found 13 MillionMacKeeper\u2019 credentials and 58 million business firm accounts exposed online due to misconfigured MongoDB database last year. Last week, AI.Type keyboard app had 31 million customers records exposed online due to misconfigured MongoDB database. In that case, it was discovered that the keyboard app has been spying on users and collecting everything a user does on their smartphone.A dark web marketplace is a perfect place for hackers and cybercriminals to sell what they steal from others. A year ago, entire US voters\u2019 registration records were being sold on now seized Hansa marketplace, therefore, Californians should not be surprised if their data goes on the dark web for sale.", "title": "Hackers steal 19M California voter records after holding database for ransom"}, {"date": "December 15, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Adware", "Apple", "Cyber Crime", "internet", "Israel", "Mac", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "body": "Security firm Cybereason\u2019s principal security researcher Amit Serper has discovered an invasive OSX.Pirrit adware variant that has been launched to target macOS so that attackers could invade and completely hijack any Mac computer. Already thousands of Mac devices across the globe have been infected with the adware.This campaign is a bit different from regular adware campaigns, stated Serper, since other such campaigns let the attacker bombard a computer with ads while this particular campaign not only floods the computer with ads but additionally spies on the user. It also allows attackers to capture personal information of the user and claim the highest level user privileges. It steals sensitive personal data including bank account logins and critical financial and business data.\u201cAs for OSX.Pirrit malware, it runs under root privileges, creates autoruns and generates random names for itself on each install. Plus, there are no removal instructions and some of its components mask themselves to appear like they\u2019re legitimate and from Apple,\u201d wrote Serper.Serper stated that the adware was \u2018Very Active\u2019 and still infecting Macs; previous versions of OSX.Pirrit utilized rogue browser plug-ins and also attempted to install a proxy server on the hijacked device but this particular version uses Apple\u2019s scripting/automation language dubbed as AppleScript. Using AppleScript enables the malware to inject JavaScript code into the browser directly, which shows how any adtech firm can exploit \u201cnefarious tactics\u201d present in the malware to protect the malware from being detected by antivirus software.Serper noted that Israeli firm TargetingEdge has created OSX-Pirrit and the malware authors\u2019 have worked really hard to avoid detection since the firm claims to be involved in the development and operation of \u201clegitimate and legal installer product for Mac users.\u201dSerper also stated that the firm was threatening with legal action for relating it to the malware. Cybereason has been publishing reports since April 2016 in which it has named TargetingEdge [PDF] for this adware and the third report [PDF] was published this week. All the reports were written by Serper and in his latest report [PDF], Serper has referred to the malware as Nasty.\u201cFor the past two weeks, they\u2019ve tried to prevent me from publishing this research. Cybereason has received a few cease and desist letters from a firm claiming to be TargetingEdge\u2019s legal counsel.

The Triconex industrial safety technology developed by Schneider Electric SE was targeted with the malware with the sole aim of causing physical damages.The malware has been dubbed as TRITON and according to FireEye\u2019s analysis, the possible perpetrator wants to exploit emergency shutdown capabilities of the organization\u2019s industrial processes. TRITON is believed to be designed to interact with industrial controllers to cripple safety features and fail the system.Reportedly, TRITON comes from a very small and limited family of malware equipped with the capability of causing physical damage via cyberspace. The attacker hasn\u2019t been identified by the company but there is evidence that the activity is related to a Nation-State that is preparing for an attack. FireEye claims that this deployment of malware is not the work of a cyber-crime group primarily because the attack on industrial control safety systems of the company hints at a bigger goal, which probably is to cause a highly impactful attack that leads to dire consequences.Security experts are regarding it as a watershed attack since the safety systems attacked this time are the units used in gas, oil, and nuclear plants. According to FireEye, at least one facility\u2019s operations were halted with the malware. Attackers took remote control of the workstation that ran Triconex safety shutdown system and then reprogrammed the controllers to identify security flaws. When some of the controllers entered Fail Safe mode, the processes were shut down and this is how the attack was identified.The incident was reported by FireEye on Thursday. After the news broke, Schneider also released a statement confirming the incident and stated that a security alert has been issued by the company for alerting Triconex users.\u201cWhile evidence suggests this was an isolated incident and not due to a vulnerability in the Triconex system or its program code, we continue to investigate whether there are additional attack vectors,\u201d read Schneider\u2019s security alert.It is worth noting that Triconex is widely used in oil/gas plants as well as nuclear facilities and it is vital for energy industry\u2019s operations. However, neither FireEye nor Schneider has identified the company, industry and the location of this attack. All that Dan Scali from FireEye told media is that the hack occurred recently and none of the equipment was damaged and physical damage also wasn\u2019t caused.Symantec\u2019s researchers noted that TRITON was identified to be active since September. The malware works by infecting a computer running Windows and connected with a safety system. They also asserted that although there have been cases of malware that can attack industrial control systems this is the first malware involving an incident in which attacks \u201csafety instrumented system devices.\u201dThe US Department of Homeland Security also issued a statement claiming that it was assessing the situation and probable impact on the \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d", "title": "Hackers Deploy Triton Malware to Shut Down Power Station"}, {"date": "December 15, 2017", "authur": "Waqas", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "data breach", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Security Breach", "Technology"], "body": "Last month, Mozilla joined hands with HaveIbeenpwned, a data breach index website, the purpose of it was to alert users when they visit a website that was previously compromised since the trend of hiding data breaches is growing among companies and businesses regardless of their status.Now, the IT security researchers at University of California San Diego (UCSD) have developed a prototype tool that would identify if websites have been compromised. The researchers involved in the development of this tool are Alex C. Snoeren, professor of computer science at the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California San Diego, Geoffrey M. Voelker, Joe DeBlasio and Stefan Savage.Dubbed Tripwire by researchers; the tool was tested [PDF] on around 2,300 websites from January 2015 to February 2017. Researchers then waited to see if any of the registered accounts would be compromised since it would be an indicator that a site has been hacked.According to Alex C. Snoeren of UCSD: \u201cIn the end, the system detected 1 percent, or 19 sites, were compromised, \u201cincluding what appears to be a plaintext password compromise at an Alexa top-500 site with more than 45 million active users.\u201d The surprising fact about the result was that none of the sites disclosed the breach to their customers.\u201cI was heartened that the big sites we interacted with took us seriously,\u201d Snoeren said.\u201cI was somewhat surprised no one acted on our results,\u201d Snoeren added, saying his team won\u2019t disclose the websites\u2019 names. \u201cThe reality is that these companies didn\u2019t volunteer to be part of this study. By doing this, we\u2019ve opened them up to huge financial and legal exposure. So we decided to put the onus on them to disclose.\u201dThe entire code for Tripwire is available on GitHub that details the source code for the crawler. Moreover, researchers have also shared an anonymized version of the login data that consists of an entry for each login event. This anonymization according to researchers was chosen to balance the desires of transparency and protecting the accounts in the Tripwire sample.However, researcher Mr. DeBlasio warned users on Github adding that:\u201cWhile we provide complete source for the crawler, I highly discourage you from actually trying to run it, and you do so at your own risk. If, however, you are interested in the heuristics that our crawler uses, or how the system works, the code is all here!But really, if you\u2019ve been tasked with getting this crawler running, turn back all ye who enter here. This code is very old, very fragile, and requires a lot of moving parts to get working well.\u201dWhile hiding data breach incidents is nothing new its results can be devastating for unsuspecting users. The effect of Equifax and Uber data breaches is a significant example of it where Equifax discovered that hackers stole SSNs of 143M Americans in July 2017 but only decided to inform its customers in September this year.Uber did a similar trick with its customers, the ride-hailing\u2019 service paid off $100,000 to hackers for hiding the massive data breach which exposed private details of around 75 million accounts. The breach occurred in October 2016, and for over a year, Uber managed to keep it a secret by paying hackers such a hefty sum.Source: UCSD / Study available here [PDF]", "title": "New tool exposes websites that have suffered data breaches"}, {"date": "December 14, 2017", "authur": "Uzair Amir", "topics": ["Android", "APPS", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Play Store", "Privacy", "Scam", "security"], "body": "A couple of days ago HackRead exclusively reported on a Fidget spinner app that has been sending other apps data to a server in China. Now, IT security researchers at Kaspersky Lab identified around 85 apps in Google Play during October and November 2017 that were stealing credentials for VK.com, a Russia-based social networking platform. A majority of these apps were listed in the Play Store in October while some were uploaded in July. One of them had over a million downloads whereas some apps had around a thousand installations. Many apps were quite popular among users since 7 apps had approx. 10,000 and 100,000 downloads and 9 of them were installed between 1,000 and 10,000 times.The apps that were most popular were gaming apps submitted to Google Play during April 2017. These apps were although uploaded without any malicious code after an October 2017 update, these were equipped with credential stealing capabilities. Over a million downloads were gathered by one of the gaming apps in just 7 months.\u201cThese apps were not only masquerading as Telegram apps, they were actually built using an open source Telegram SDK and work almost like every other such app,\u201d researchers wrote in a blog post.Conversely, the majority of offending apps were created to appear as apps for VK.com, which allows users to listen to music or track user page visits. This type of apps usually requires users to log in to their account prior to using the service and this is why it was never suspected of foul play. The apps checks for the language of the devices first and asks for credentials only if the user has enabled Russian, Kazakh, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Romanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Kyrgyz or Tajik as the device\u2019s language. It is worth noting that this particular campaign is targeted at VK.com users only since this site has quite a huge following in CIS countries.Kaspersky Lab researchers identified that the attackers behind this campaign have been publishing their malicious apps in Google Play since two years and have over the years modified the malicious code to evade detection. The infected apps used an official SDK for the Russian website VK.com so that the user is tricked into entering his or her login credentials. The information received is then encrypted and uploaded to a remote server. This server is controlled by the attacker. Though most of these malicious applications contain described functionality some of them are a bit different as these not only extract credentials but also upload them too.According to researchers, the attackers use credentials for the promotion of groups in the website VK.com and silently keep adding users for increasing the popularity of these groups. Google has removed all the credential stealing applications that were identified as Trojan-PSW.AndroidOS.MyVk.o and Telegram clients not-a-virus:HEUR:RiskTool.AndroidOS.Hcatam.a. In case the apps have been installed, it is possible to remove them by enabling Google Play Protect, the newly launched security feature that removes malicious apps from Android smartphones through machine learning and apps usage analysis.", "title": "85 Credential-Stealing Apps Found on Google Play Store"}]
