[{"authur": "Waqas", "body": "If you believe that popular, trusted websites like Facebook and PayPal are not vulnerable to exploits from previous eras then you are mistaken. Research suggests that various popular websites and online services are vulnerable to an exploit that was discovered way back in 1998 and it has made a comeback lately. The flaw, which has been named ROBOT, was discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher in 1998.ROBOT stands for the Return Of Bleichenbacher\u2019s Oracle Threat. The new version of ROBOT was identified recently during by researchers Hanno B\u00f6ck, Juraj Somorovsky and Craig Young during Facebook bug bounty program. Upon discovering this vulnerability, researchers were paid a considerable reward, which is not yet disclosed by the social network or the researchers. The findings were published on Tuesday.ROBOT is found in the TLS/transport layer security protocol and it is now impacting all the leading websites as attackers can decrypt encrypted data and use the private encryption key of the site to sign communications. TLS protocol is used to conduct web encryption while the flaw is identified in the algorithm that handles RSA encryption keys. The attack involves the use of exclusively created queries that generate errors on TLS servers in the form of Yes or No answers. the technique is called an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack. These servers are responsible for protecting the communication between user\u2019s browser and a website by decrypting HTTPS traffic. If the attack is successful, the attacker can passively monitor and record traffic too. It is also possible to carry out a man-in-the-middle-attack using this flaw.The same technique was used to exploit the ROBOT vulnerability identified in 1998 however, the original ROBOT patch didn\u2019t replace the unprotected RSA algorithm but the TLS standard was modified to make brute-force guessing much harder.\u201cAfter Bleichenbacher\u2019s original attack the designers of TLS decided that the best course of action was to keep the vulnerable encryption modes and add countermeasures. Later research showed that these countermeasures were incomplete leading the TLS designers to add more complicated countermeasures. The section on Bleichenbacher countermeasures in the latest TLS 1.2 standard (7.4.7.1) is incredibly complex. It is not surprising that these workarounds aren\u2019t implemented correctly,\u201d the researchers wrote in their blog post.After the ROBOT patch was released, the vulnerability has received several variations; such as in March 2016 another vulnerability related to ROBOT exposed around 33% of HTTPS connections to attackers. It was called the DROWN vulnerability.Researchers claim that numerous vendors have failed to implement appropriate countermeasures to thwart attacks that aim at exploiting ROBOT. They wrote that the vulnerable implementations have been identified in seven vendors so far. These include F5, Cisco, and Citrix. While they also noted that some very popular websites on the internet have been affected including Facebook and PayPal. Several vulnerable subdomains have been identified on 27 of the top 100 domains, as per the ranking from Alexa.Cisco in its advisory issued on Tuesday rated the vulnerability as Medium and that multiple products from Cisco have been affected such as the Cisco ACE30 Application Control Engine Module and ACE 4710 Application Control Engine Appliance. On the other hand, PayPal and Facebook issued patches in October 2017.Various stopgap mitigation solutions have been offered by the researchers on their blog and they are also offering a testing tool to be implemented on public HTTPS servers along with a Python tool for testing the flaw.\u201cMost modern TLS connections use an Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman key exchange and need RSA only for signatures. We believe RSA encryption modes are so risky that the only safe course of action is to disable them. Apart from being risky these modes also lack forward secrecy.\u201dThe list of some of the sites affected by ROBOT flaw is available here.", "topics": ["Bug Bounty", "Facebook", "hacking", "internet", "Paypal", "Privacy", "ROBOT", "security", "Social Media", "Vulnerability"], "title": "19-Year-Old ROBOT Flaw Resurfaces to Haunt Popular Websites", "date": "December 14, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "A group of three hackers have pleaded guilty to their role in developing, spreading and using Mirai malware botnet to conduct large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on some of the Internet\u2019s most popular websites and Dyn DNS, a prominent Domain Name Servers (DNS) service provider.In a proceeding that took place in US District Court for Alaska on November 28th, Paras Jha pleaded guilty to six charges including developing and operating Mirai botnet while Dalton Norman and Josiah White, his partners in crime also pleaded guilty to their role in the campaign in which Mirai was used for criminal activities.In January this year, Jha\u2019s father Anand Jha denied his son\u2019s role in Mirai\u2019s scheme and said \u201cI know what he is capable of. Nothing of the sort of what has been described here has happened.\u201d However, according to the court documents released on Tuesday, Jha admitted his crime.Furthermore, court documents revealed that Jha erased the device he used to run Mirai on. Paras Jha \u201csecurely erased the virtual machine used to run Mirai on his device. Jha posted the Mirai code online in order to create plausible deniability if law enforcement found the code on computers controlled by Jha or his co\u00ad-conspirators,\u201d said one of the court documents.On October 21st, 2016, Mirai malware caused havoc by hijacking millions of IoT devices including security cameras and hit some of the most popular websites on the Internet including the servers of Dyn. The sites that were forced to go offline included Reddit, Amazon, New York Time, Twitter and hundreds of others.As a result, Internet services in the United States, India, Japan and some parts of Europe suffered major interruption. Like other botnets, Mirai also compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices including security cameras and DVRs to carry attacks against DYN, Brian Krebs\u2019 blog and OVH hostings servers in France.Hackers also conducted click fraud through Mirai and made nearly 100 bitcoin that is more than $1.6 million today due to a massive increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value. But the trio did not stop there, soon after targeting DYN, the source code for Mirai was leaked online that was later used by several other hackers to carry DDoS attacks.The person who claimed to leak the source code stated his name as Anna-senpai however, on October 4th, 2016, security journalist Brian Krebs claimed Senpai is actually Jha, but Jha denied the allegation and his role in the development of Mirai botnet.According to Department of Justice\u2019s press release, Paras Jha has also admitted his responsibility for multiple hacks of the Rutgers University computer system. \u201cParas Jha has admitted his responsibility for multiple hacks of the Rutgers University computer system,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Fitzpatrick. \u201cThese computer attacks shut down the server used for all communications among faculty, staff, and students, including assignment of coursework to students, and students\u2019 submission of their work to professors to be graded. The defendant\u2019s actions effectively paralyzed the system for days at a time and maliciously disrupted the educational process for tens of thousands of Rutgers\u2019 students. Today, the defendant has admitted his role in this criminal offense and will face the legal consequences for it.\u201dAccording to document (PDF) sharted by Brian Krebs, under Jha\u2019s click fraud guilty plea agreement, he would hand over 13 bitcoin to the United States government. White, on the other hand, has agreed to pay 33 bitcoin. The current price of 33 Bitcoin is more than $547,469 while 13 Bitcoin is $215,669.", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Botnet", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "Fraud", "internet", "IoT", "Malware", "Mirai", "Scam", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Hackers behind Mirai botnet & DYN DDoS attacks plead guilty", "date": "December 13, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "Cybersecurity specialists often emphasize the dangers of insider threats and this banker has proven them correct.On Tuesday, December 12th, 2017, a 29-year-old Barclays banker Jinal Pethad was jailed for six years and four months for assisting two Moldovan cybercriminals to launder more than \u00a32.5 million ($3 million) from Barclays Ealing, London branch where he worked.The cybercriminals identified as Ion Turcan and Pavel Gincota were jailed for five years eight months and seven years\u2019 respectively for using Dridex banking malware and paying Pethad for his assistance in the scheme.Pethad who pleaded guilty on Tuesday conspiring to launder money acted as \u201cpersonal bank manager\u201d to the cybercriminals and opened 105 sham bank accounts for them using bogus ID documents that allowed Turcan and Gincota launder stolen money in 2014 and 2016 without raising suspicion.According to Mark Cains, from the NCA\u2019s National Cyber Crime Unit, \u201cJinal Pethad abused his position of trust at the bank to knowingly set up sham accounts for Gincota and Turcan, providing a vital service which enabled them to launder millions.\u201cUsing his knowledge of the financial system, he made sure the stolen money was not blocked before entering these accounts and provided the pair with reports to evidence his efforts and maintain the criminal relationship.\u201cThe NCA works with industry and law enforcement partners to target cyber crime at every level.

The group targeted card processing systems like AWS CBR (Russian Interbank System) and purportedly SWIFT (SWIFT international bank messaging service in the United States.On average, MoneyTaker stole a whopping $3 million from three Russian financial institutions while a sum of $500,000 was stolen from banks in the United States. But, the group is not limiting itself to money or banking sector, in fact, MoneyTaker also targeted financial software vendors and law firms.\u201cCriminals stole documentation for OceanSystems\u2019 FedLink card processing system, which is used by 200 banks in Latin America and the US,\u201d says the report compiled by Group-IB.Researchers confirmed that MoneyTaker targeted 20 companies with 1 in the UK, 3 in Russia and 16 in the US. All those attacks went unreported and undetected since the group used publically available tools for the operations.\u201cMoneyTaker uses publicly available tools, which makes the attribution and investigation process a non-trivial exercise. In addition, incidents occur in different regions worldwide, and at least one of the US Banks targeted had documents successfully exfiltrated from their networks, twice. Group-IB specialists expect new thefts in the near future and in order to reduce this risk, Group-IB would like to contribute our report identifying hacker tools, techniques as well as indicators of compromise we attribute to MoneyTaker operations,\u201d said Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB Co-Founder and Head of Intelligence.However, MoneyTaker first caught the attention when Group-IB\u2019 researchers tracked the group\u2019s activities after it stole money from a US bank in 2016 by gaining access to First Data\u2019s \u201cSTAR\u201d network operator portal.\u201cIn 2016, Group-IB identified 10 attacks conducted by MoneyTaker; 6 attacks on banks in the US, 1 attack on a US service provider, 1 attack on a bank in the UK and 2 attacks on Russian banks. Only one incident involving a Russian bank was promptly identified and prevented that is known to Group-IB.\u201d\u201cIn 2017, the number of attacks has remained the same with 8 US banks, 1 law firm and 1 bank in Russia being targeted. The geography, however, has narrowed to only the USA and Russia.\u201dFurthermore, researchers noted links between all 20 attacks conducted by the group in 2016 and 2017 including using the same tools, similarly distributed infrastructure, one-time-use components in the attack toolkit and spying on the target after a successful attack.To evade detection, the group uses fileless malware, and SSL certificates generated using names of popular institutions such as Microsoft, Yahoo, Bank of America, Federal Reserve Bank, and Microsoft. Moreover, MoneyTaker uses a distributed infrastructure and delivers payloads to the victim with IP addresses in MoneyTaker\u2019s whitelist.MoneyTaker takes advantage of borrowed and self-written tools such as it developed an application equipped with keylogging and screenshot capabilities. The app can take screenshots and capture keystrokes from a targeted device and steal content.To take full control of the operation, MoneyTaker uses a Pentest framework Server. On it, the hackers install a legitimate tool for penetration testing \u2013 Metasploit. The group uses Metasploit to conduct following activities:1 Network reconnaissance2. search for vulnerable applications3. exploit vulnerabilities4. escalate systems privileges5. collect informationAnother astonishing discovery by Group-IB researchers regarding MoneyTaker is that it uses privilege escalation tools based on codes presented at the Russian cybersecurity conference ZeroNights 2016. In some attacks, the group used Citadel and Kronos banking Trojans. In this case, Kronos was used to deliver Point-of-Sale (POS) malware dubbed ScanPOS.Remember, in August this year, FBI arrested WannaCry hero Marcus Hutchins for \u201ccreating and distributing Kronos banking trojan.\u201d Kronos stole banking credentials from around the world but primarily targeted the United Kingdom and North America.", "topics": ["Banking", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "MoneyTaker", "Russia", "security", "TROJAN", "USA"], "title": "Sophisticated \u2018MoneyTaker\u2019 group stole millions from Russian & US banks", "date": "December 12, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Bitfinex, known as one of the world largest cryptocurrency exchange was forced to shut down its ongoing operations after suffering a series of non-stop distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Tuesday, December 12th.Based in Hong Kong, Bitfinex used its Twitter account to inform its customers about the situation and stated that \u201cWe are currently under heavy DDOS.

If not, it creates a copy of itself in the said directory and executes from there instead,\u201d explained researchers.Orcus developers have been advertising it as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) for Windows since 2016 with all the features a RAT software should have however it is also capable of running plugins and execute C# and VB.net code on the remote machine in real-time. One of those plugins can be used to conduct Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.Furthermore, Orcus is also equipped with keylogging capabilities that let attackers steal everything a victim types on their device. It can disable the light indicator on webcams and monitor victim\u2019s activities without trigging any alert moreover Orcus can implement a watchdog that restarts the server component or even trigger a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) if the someone tries to kill its process.\u201cIn our investigation of Orcus RAT, we have again proven again that its capabilities go beyond the scope of a harmless administration tool. Regardless of the developer\u2019s claim and defense, the reality is that the application is being used in cybercrime campaigns.\u201dBitcoin users should watch out for this threat especially now when Bitcoin wallets are being constantly attacked.

At that time, the malware had cryptomining capabilities, but now, it is equipped with keyloggers.The malware works in such a way that it exploits functions.php file used by WordPress themes. It queues Cloudflare[.]solutions scripts and uses a fake CloudFlare domain in the URLs who loads a copy of a legitimate ReconnectingWebSocket library.Previously when researchers identified the fake domain; its homepage displayed the message \u201cThis Server is part of Cloudflare Distribution Network, \u201d but the new message claims \u201cThis server is part of an experimental science machine learning algorithms project.\u201dAnother change identified by researchers is the cors.js script. Upon decoding, there is no outright suspicious code like those banner images in the previous version. However, the script loads Yandex.Metrika, Yandex\u2019s alternative to Google Analytics.Furthermore, Sucuri researchers found two fake CloudFlare domains, one of which contains long hexadecimal parameters. These domains might look legitimate, but one of those domains does not exist while the other one (cdnjs.cloudflare.com) delivers payloads that are hexadecimal numbers after the question mark in the URLs. Moreover, the script according to researchers decodes and injects the result into web pages making it a keylogger.This script adds a handler to every input field on the websites to send its value to the attacker (wss://cloudflare[.]solutions:8085/) when a user leaves that field, wrote Sucuri\u2019s malware researcher Denis Sinegubko.The keylogger is designed to steal login credentials from WordPress sites while its prime target is e-commerce platforms to steal customers banking and card payment details. In case the platform requires users to log in with their social media details, personal email address or any other sensitive and useful data, the keylogger will also steal and send them to the attackers. The Cloudflare.solutions malware also injects websites with CoinHive cryptocurrency miner scripts that uses visitor\u2019s CPU power to mine Monero digital coins. Since the malicious code for this malware exists in the function.php file of the WordPress theme, users are advised by Suciri to \u201cremove the add_js_scripts function and all the add_action clauses that mention add_js_scripts.\u201d It is highly advised that WordPress site owners should check if their site is infected with Cloudflare.solutions malware and change all login credentials including username and password.

Doppelg\u00e4nging, a fileless code injection technique, works in such a manner that an attacker can manipulate the way Windows handles its file transaction process and pass malicious files even if the code is known to be malicious.According to security duo \u201cThe goal of the technique is to allow a malware to run arbitrary code (including code that is known to be malicious) in the context of a legitimate process on the target machine.\u201d\u201cVery similar to process hollowing but with a novel twist. The challenge is doing it without using suspicious process and memory operations such as SuspendProcess, NtUnmapViewOfSection.\u201d\u201cIn order to achieve this goal we leverage NTFS transactions. We overwrite a legitimate file in the context of a transaction. We then create a section from the modified file (in the context of the transaction) and create a process out of it. It appears that scanning the file while it is in the transaction is not possible by the vendors we checked so far (some even hang), and since we rollback the transaction, our activity leaves no trace behind.\u201d\u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger\u2019 in the German language means \u201cGhostly Double.\u201dThe attack affects all Windows versions starting from Windows Vista to Windows 10, however, Windows 10 Redstone and Fall Creators Update are not affected.

By using NTFS transactions, we make changes to an executable file that will never actually be committed to disk. We will then use undocumented implementation details of the process loading mechanism to load our modified executable, but not before rolling back the changes we made to the executable. The result of this procedure is creating a process from the modified executable, while deployed security mechanisms in the dark.\u201dWhat is worse is that the attack \u201ccannot be patched since it exploits fundamental features and the core design of the process loading mechanism in Windows\u201d and does not require any files to be created.

Simply put, if you share your key with someone, their key will be automatically shared with you and vice-versa. That\u2019s not it; once the key is accessed, a user can view photos through a URL while those who never signed up to Ashley Madison can access these pictures without authentication.It\u2019s true that this is not a vulnerability but aftermath of going with default settings or \u201ctyranny of the default\u201d as stated by researchers.

The general conception about website mining cryptocurrency is that once the user closes the site or browser tabs, the site stops using their CPU power. But according to the IT security researchers at Malwarebytes things are far from the truth.Researchers have discovered \u201cPersistent drive-by cryptomining\u201d technique using which hackers and website owners can use visitors\u2019 CPU power to generate Monero coins even after the browser window is closed.To prove their findings, researchers conducted a test on Google Chrome browser and visited several websites that silently loaded cryptomining code.

Closing the browser using the \u201cX\u201d is no longer sufficient. The more technical users will want to run Task Manager to ensure there is no remnant running browser processes and terminate them. Alternatively, the taskbar will still show the browser\u2019s icon with slight highlighting, indicating that it is still running,\u201d added Segura.Below is a GIF image that shows a Windows taskbar and user visiting websites that use cryptocurrency miner.

That\u2019s the valuation achieved by Bitcoin on November 28, 2017! This is living testimony to the success and the value of cryptocurrencies. Alas! Like everything of value, cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoins, in particular, have attracted eyeballs that hide malicious intents behind them. Hackers, cybercriminals, web stalkers, and fraudsters are striving hard to wreck havoc in the cryptocurrency markets, stealing tokens and coins from users who fail to safeguard their priced crypto-assets. Since 2011, there have been 35+ heists of cryptocurrency exchanges, resulting in the loss of 980,000 Bitcoins, valued at more than $4 billion.Here are some of the reasons \u20131: The general awareness among cryptocurrency owners about safekeeping their tokens is minimal.2: Many freewheeling exchanges of cryptocurrencies are severely flawed in terms of their technology\u2019s security readiness.3:  Because regulatory mechanisms around cryptocurrency exchanges are either non-existent or still in progress, cybercriminals get more adventurous in attacking these.4: Application developers often fail to implement security procedures such as 2-factor authentication in their products, exposing users to cybercrimes such as cryptocurrency thefts.5: Use of unsecured wallets, particularly by users who engage in online trading of cryptocurrencies fairly regularly.To keep your cryptocurrencies \u2018safe\u2019, you have the option of using online wallets. These wallets use different kinds of technologies to help you store your tokens, and retrieve the information when needed. Cryptocurrency exchanges use hot wallets to store users\u2019 cryptocurrencies and enable them to send and receive tokens instantaneously upon order settlement. Bitcoin exchanges use multi-signature technology to safeguard their wallets. However, even this multi-signature technology has been breached, as manifested in the hacking of Bitfinex exchange. Potentially, any cryptocurrency wallet based on the Internet can be violated. In fact, HaoBTC wallet itself released a statement asking users not store all their cryptocurrency coins in one online wallet!Desktop wallets: Like the original Bitcoin client called Bitcoin Core, these wallets relay transactions on networks, and create cryptocurrency addresses for sending and receiving coins. Some desktop wallets deliver enhanced security, like Armory, while some focus on anonymity, like DarkWallet. These wallets work by locally downloading the blockchain history, reducing dependency on web interfaces, and delivering more security.Mobile wallets: These wallets work by replicating the functionality of desktop wallets on smartphones. Some mobile wallet app uses the NFC capabilities of your phone to enable easy payments via cryptocurrencies.Both desktop and mobile wallets reduce the risks of cryptocurrency theft. Exchanges are on the radar of cybercriminals, much more than individual users of desktop wallets and mobile wallets.  However, other malicious apps on the same devices can cause trouble! For instance, keylogger malware can record your keystrokes and touch inputs, and crack your private keys.The most trusted and reliable ones \u2013 hardware wallets. These are targeted at cryptocurrency users who want to maintain a significant stash of coins but don\u2019t want to risk it with any 3rd party and online storage system or any form of cold storage. Hardware wallets comprise two parts \u2013 a connected device, and a disconnected device. The connected wallet component holds public keys to perform all functions of a standard wallet. However, it can only do so if it\u2019s connected to the offline device that holds the private key. In this manner, physical wallets overcome all risks of cryptocurrency thefts that online wallets suffer from.Let us discuss more on some of the best cryptocurrency wallets.Some wallets allow users to store Bitcoins online; others offer you the option of keeping it in an external storage device. People familiar with cold storage have probably heard of Armory. It is an open-source Bitcoin wallet that caters to clients who require an advanced storage system for their Bitcoins.The software allows you to keep the cryptocurrency in cold storage and also use multiple signatures for better protection. Private keys can be stored offline on your computer or laptop. This reduces the risk of theft considerably as only those who know the physical location of your device can access your Bitcoins. When it comes to establishing a secure connection, nothing beats the quality and consistency of Armour network. The wallet offers users decentralized locks, free access to both public and private keys and cold storage support. Widely regarded as one of the best and most secure of Bitcoin wallets, Armory is aptly advertised as \u201cThe Only Open-Source Wallet With Cold Storage and Multi-Signature Support.\u201d Here, you can set up multiple accounts both for your private use and business holdings. All your Bitcoins are password protected and come with an additional firewall protection for detecting malware.Armory is free, user-friendly and compatible with Windows, Mac, IOS, Linux Ubuntu devices. Once installed, the software allows you to transfer Bitcoins across the blockchain network.An online Bitcoin storage option can only take you so far; there remains a risk of data hacking, viruses, and harmful malware infestations. You need to be extremely careful in sharing your information online. Don\u2019t worry though; we have the perfect alternative.Trezor is the world\u2019s first Bitcoin hardware wallet, developed by Satoshilabs, a Czech Republic-based Company. TREZOR Model T is compact, has a very sleek design, and features an OLED screen. This wallet needs to be connected via USB to your computer. This way you can store all your Bitcoins, your account info and private keys in a distributed manner so that no one can use the info to carry out unauthorized transactions. Only people who know the physical location of your wallet will be able to steal your private key.Once you connect Trezor to your PC, a nine-digit pin code will flash on the backlit monitor. Enter this code on your PC to connect the two systems. A random code is generated every time you try accessing the device, even if your PC is tampered with, the Bitcoins remain safe and secure. After entering the pin, the system asks for a 24-word recovery prompt. The recovery seed is crucial for data recovery and restoring your Bitcoins if the hardware gets misplaced.Trezor is compatible with other popular Bitcoin storage apps such as Multibit HD, Mycelium and is ideal for the latest Windows, Linux, and Android operating systems. The device is very lightweight, portable and available in black, white and gray shades.Hardware wallets are a smart option for users who have to deal with lots of Bitcoins on a daily basis. Ledger Nano S is somewhat similar to Trezor, with just a few minor differences in the framework and features offered. Designed and developed by a French start-up company, the Ledger Nano is like any external hardware USB connector that can be used to store and transfer information to other devices. However, it doesn\u2019t have a battery; you can only access the device when it is connected to a computer.The Ledger Nano isn\u2019t equipped with any anti-tampering sticker because it checks for the integrity of the device using a cryptographic procedure when you power it on. This ensures that the Bitcoins are safe even when your computer might be infected or tampered with.  The OLED screen is compact, and the wallet itself is portable, featuring two side buttons for transaction confirmations.Installing and configuring the Nano S with a new device or computer system is surprisingly easy, though time-taking. Firstly, you need to plug in the device; then you have to enter the pin code in order to secure the wallet. Once you have successfully logged into your account, you\u2019ll have to put in a unique 24-words password or recovery phrase. This phrase is used when you have to recover or retrieve the Bitcoins in case of theft or an accident. With Ledger Nano S,  your private keys can be saved offline, securing them from any kind of cyber-attack.First-time Bitcoin users always have this fear that they\u2019ll lose all their savings in a cyber attack. Keepkey is a smart choice for amateurs who are still learning the ropes of how Bitcoins work. The simple, responsive and user-friendly device stores all your Bitcoins in an external storage device that can be connected to any computer or laptop. All you have to do is carry this hardware wherever you go and transfer Bitcoins by connecting it to the PC. It saves you from the hassles of protecting your Bitcoins from viruses, malware, and hackers. Users have to approve each outgoing request manually thereby preventing the risk of any unauthorized access. Keepkey is a relatively new name in the market. Though not as popular as Trezor or Ledger Nano, Keepkey still holds some credibility when it comes to keeping your Bitcoins safe. The random pin code is generated whenever you connect the device to a computer. Thus, your information is secure even if your PC has been tampered with. Keepkey also stores all your public and private keys that can be encapsulated using a password.Keepkey is compatible with loads of cryptocurrencies in the market including big names like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Namecoin, Testnet, Ethereum, and Dash. This makes Keepkey a great choice for cryptocurrency platform developers, miners, and cryptocurrency investors who have to deal with loads of altcoins on a daily basis.In spite of the security offered by hardware wallets, these devices can be stolen, exposing your crypto-assets. Paper wallets come to the rescue.Paper wallet is a document that contains copies of the private and public keys you need to complete a cryptocurrency transaction. The core benefit delivered by paper benefits is that the keys are not digitally stored anywhere, hence totally secure from hackers.To create a paper wallet, you can use a service such as BitAddress.org (for Bitcoins). Follow the on-screen instructions and go to the Paper Wallet option. Select the number of addresses you need, click Generate, and then print hard copies of the wallet.It\u2019s obvious that paper wallet is the most secure and easiest method of safeguarding cryptocurrencies. However, you must keep these cons in mind.1: Ink can degrade over time, making the information illegible2: There\u2019s a risk of theft or loss of the paper wallet3: Unless you safeguard it, the paper will is always at the risk of defiling by fire or water.Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are changing the global concept of currency. Use the info about safe storage wallets shared in this guide to keep your Bitcoins secure.Top, featured image: Dulebenets/Shutterstock", "topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "Ethereum", "hacking", "internet", "Money", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "How to Safely Store Cryptocurrency \u2013 Review of 5 Safest Bitcoin Wallets", "date": "November 30, 2017"}, {"authur": "Carolina", "body": "In 2014, Yahoo announced that it had suffered a massive data breach in which 500 million user accounts containing emails and passwords were stolen.

The bucket is configured to allow public access to exclusive intelligence information gathered by INSCOM for political leaders and US military. The repository is located at the subdomain \u201cinscom\u201d at AWS, and it contains around 47 viewable files and folders out of which three are downloadable as well.The bucket\u2019s most valuable asset is the downloadable virtual hard drive that was used for recording communications within protected federal IT environments. When opened, the drive displays confidential information titled NOFORN, which indicates that the information is highly sensitive and prohibited from being accessed by even foreign allies. Furthermore, the data bucket also includes sensitive details related to the Defense Department\u2019s Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A), a battlefield intelligence program, and Red Disk, the department\u2019s cloud auxiliary.Reportedly, the bucket contains over 100GB of classified data, and it got exposed to the public only because of adopting careless security practices. According to Vickery, anyone who gets the URL can easily access this treasure trove of valuable, sensitive data. We cannot ignore that unsecured S3 AWS buckets have caused quite an uproar across the Pentagon and US Defense Department lately as these have caused embarrassing data leakages for various governmental institutions most dominantly the NSA.The blog post from UpGuard read that this cloud leak could have been avoided it the IT-related errors were timely fixed, and much reliable security practices were implemented to ensure that such an \u201cimpactful\u201d data repository remains protected.\u201cPlainly put, the digital tools needed to potentially access the networks relied upon by multiple Pentagon intelligence agencies to disseminate information should not be something available to anybody entering a URL into a web browser.

This means, if a Mac device is left unattended then it would allow anyone to become system administrator without needing any verification. Even if the device is remotely accessed, it would give away admin rights and thus, an attacker can obtain sensitive information stored on the device.Ergin further revealed that the bug is identified in macOS High Sierra version 10.13.1 and the macOS 10.13.2 beta. Older versions of this operating system such as Sierra and El Capitan are spared of this bug.Apple has admitted that the bug is indeed present in its latest OS and has issued a statement that the company is already working on releasing a security update for the OS as soon as possible.

The campaign was started on 23rd November while attackers have used the largest email spam botnet on the internet called Necurs for distributing malicious emails. Given the extraordinary scope of Necurs, within 6 hours of its launching, around 12.5 million emails were distributed. This means the botnet is sending out over two million messages per hour and all the 12.5 million emails contained ransomware.Various security experts noticed a sudden hike in emailing activity on the web, but Forcepoint was the first to identify the new ransomware campaign. Scarab, however, isn\u2019t a new malware as it has been used in a number of previous campaigns. This campaign primarily targets computers located in the US, UK, Germany, France, and Australia. Researchers observed that the ransomware code included references to popular HBO TV series Game of Thrones.According to cybersecurity firm AlienVault\u2019s security researcher Chris Doman, the Necurs botnet has remained one of the largest since its creation in 2012 while organized cybercriminals like those behind Locky and Dridex have used it so far, but Scarab comparatively isn\u2019t that sophisticated and can be detected by almost all anti-virus programs.\u201cScarab looks less sophisticated than some other ransomware, like Locky, and the usage of an e-mail based ransom payment system is very simple in contrast to its wide distribution,\u201d noted Doman.Security experts Ben Gibney and Roland Dela Paz from Forcepoint wrote in their blog that the payload Scarab was discovered in June and after installation, just like every other ransomware it also starts encrypting all the files before dropping the ransom note.\u2018Once installed it proceeds to encrypt files. A ransom note with the filename \u201cIf You Want To Get All Your Files Back, Please Read This.Txt\u201d is dropped within each affected directory,\u201d read the blog post.The ransom note reads: \u201cYour files are now encrypted! You have to pay for decryption of Bitcoins. The price depends on how fast you write to us. After payment, we will send you the decryption tool.\u201dAccording to Forcepoint, fake scanned documents that contain actually infected files are being distributed in emails. It seems that these emails were produced through printers from renowned firms including HP, Lexmark, Epson and Canon to make them look genuine. When the recipient downloads and opens the attached 7zip file the malware takes control of the entire computer and threatens the victim to destroy all the files if the ransom is not paid.Although Scarab is distributed at an astoundingly wide scale since it can be detected by a majority of anti-virus software, therefore, users will receive a warning message about the presence of infected files. On the other hand, those users who have become victims of this campaign can run anti-virus software in safe mode to remove the malware; but this isn\u2019t a proven method.Gibney and Dela Paz opine noted that nowadays even inexperienced hackers can pull off massive global ransomware campaigns only because they have the valuable services of Necurs type botnets at their disposal.\u201cIt remains a question whether this is a temporary campaign, as was the case with Jaff, or if we will see Scarab increase in prominence through Necurs-driven campaigns,\u201d wrote the researchers in their blog.

Darabi noted that whenever he tried to create a poll, a request containing gif URL or image ID was sent and when this field value was changed to any other images ID, that image will be shown in the poll. After sending a request with another user image ID, a poll containing that image would be created.

Understandable this flaw can be exploited by malicious threat actors anytime at their will, and this is exactly what security firm Pen Test Partners\u2019 security consultant Ken Munro is concerned about.On a daily basis, large vessels use a system called BAPLIE to displace thousands of containers some carrying around 200,000 tons\u2019 load. This system informs port authorities where to place every single container, and the ship\u2019s manufacturers very regularly update it. However, if customers do not use its latest version, there is every chance of foul play since criminal hackers would obscure the real contents and weight of the container by altering the information sent to the customs.More: Ships Can Be Hacked By Exploiting VSAT Communication SystemLaw enforcement authorities cannot examine every cargo and target shipments from countries that are categorized as high-risk. If a hacker alters this information, then investigators won\u2019t be able to detect that a container is marked as high-risk.In the official blog post, it was revealed that the threat is real and anyone can perform the hack. The vulnerability of messaging system would affect the day-to-day functioning of the ship as instead of completing the job of loading and unloading in 24 to 48 hours; the ship would take weeks for manual re-inventory. Furthermore, the load planning software, which is used for placement of heavy containers at the bottom of the stacks to ensure that gravity center stays low and balance is maintained, can be exploited to disturb this balance.\u201cHow about if a hacker manipulated the load plan to put a ship out of balance deliberately? Disguise the data, so that the loading cranes unintentionally put the heavy containers at the top and on one side? While some balancing actions are automatic, the transfer pumps may not be able to cope with a rapidly advancing, unanticipated out of balance situation,\u201d read the blog post.Pen Test Partners has warned about the use of USB devices for exchanging data between ship and terminal mainly because of the possibility of inviting malware into the system since the computer having load plan software might also be used for surfing the web or emailing. Researcher claims that interoperability is vital between shipload plan and the various ports that it visits so that the load plan is securely transmitted to the port.\u201cSimple = USB = vulnerable. This is ripe for attack. The consequences are financial, environmental and possibly even fatal,\u201d states Munro.Pen Test Partners has urged operators, terminals and ports to conduct a thorough review of their messaging systems so that the threat of tampering is curtailed given that there is already evidence of stealing of valuable items from containers parked at the port probably via insider access.More: Ships Are Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks Due To Maritime Platform Flaw", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Ships", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Hackers can Exploit Load Planning Software to Capsize Balance of Large Vessels", "date": "November 27, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "A couple of weeks ago, it was reported that a group of Muslim hackers hacked into the official news website of the so-called Islamic State called Amaq and leaked a list of around 2000 of its subscribers. Now, another group of six Muslim men from Iraq are taking on the terrorist organization by using fake news and pornographic content.The group calls itself Daeshgram, Daesh is what the terrorist group calls itself in the Arabic language, and gram is taken from the popular social media site Instagram. Although the identities of the group members are anonymous, according to a report, the group includes a student, an engineer and four IT and cybersecurity researchers living in Iraq and fighting ISIS using modern tech.The group works by first taking note of appearances, activities, and behavior of ISIS members on their website and encrypted application Telegram which is used by its supporters around the world. In one of their feat, the group posted a photoshop image of a naked woman in a porno as an announcement that there will be an opening of a media center in Isis-controlled Syria. A video of ISIS supporters listening to the announcement was altered to appear as if the extremists were actually watching a projection of a naked woman.It ended up confusing the members and divert their attention from what they all had gathered for. \u201cOur intention was to flood the market with fake Amaq content in order to dilute the credibility of Amaq \u2013 a so-called news agency,\u201d Daeshgram told Newsweek.1.

The video looked so authentic that it created panic among the members of the group. In reply, a number of group members had fights between each other; some even removed each other from secret groups where the members discussed plans. Moreover, Daesh ended up telling its members not to trust Amaq links which is a huge success since the website served as a propaganda tool for the organization and is used by its officials to take responsibilities for terrorist attacks around the world.ISIS's main press site,  Amaq website  is being hacked.

At that time, the malware was being sold on a Dark Web marketplace for 40 BTC ($41,891 at the time of sale). The same malware then showed up last month infecting Mac users who download Elmedia Player.On November 20th, the IT security researchers at Malwarebytes Labs discovered attackers using fake Symantec blog website to deliver Proton malware against unsuspected macOS users. On the site, the cybercriminals published an \u201canalysis\u201d discussing the existence of a phony malware threat called CoinThief.The analysis went on to explain how CoinThief was discovered in 2014 and how users can protect themselves against this threat by installing \u201cSymantec Malware Detector,\u201d a program that does not exist. In reality, the download file was Proton malware created to infect devices and steal data.According to the blog post by Malwarebytes Labs\u2018 director of Mac & Mobile Thomas Reed stated that: \u201cThe site is a good imitation of the real Symantec blog, even mirroring the same content.The registration information for the domain appears, on first glance, to be legitimate, using the same name and address as the legitimate Symantec site. The email address used to register the domain is a dead giveaway, however.\u201dReed further found that attackers also created fake Twitter profiles to spread the scammy website on the social media site however some authentic users were also retweeting the link. But what is worth noting is that the site was using SSL certificate issued by Comodo cybersecurity firm and not by Symantec.Those users who installed the file on their Mac devices might be under threat since Proton malware can take root-access privileges and allow an attacker to obtain complete control of a targeted device. It also runs real-time console commands and file-manager, keylogging, SSH/VNC connectivity, screenshots, webcam operation and the ability to present a custom native window requesting information such as a credit card, driver\u2019s license and more.Proton also boasts the capability of iCloud access, even when two-factor authentication is enabled. The malware is shipped with genuine Apple code-signing signatures. This means the author of Proton RAT somehow got through the rigorous filtration process Apple places on MAC OS developers of third-party software and obtained genuine certifications for his program.Since Apple is already aware of the issue, it has revoked the certificate used to sign the malware. This will stop Symantec Malware Detector from further infecting users.\u201cSince Proton is designed to steal login credentials, you will need to take some emergency actions post-infection,\u201d said Reed. \u201cYou should treat all online passwords as compromised and change them all. Be sure, while you\u2019re at it, to use different passwords on every site, and use a password manager (such as 1Password or LastPass) to keep track of them. Since 1Password vaults are a target of Proton, be sure that you don\u2019t store your password manager\u2019s master password in your keychain or anywhere else on the computer. That should be the one and only password that you memorize, and it should be strong.\u201dThe good news is that after Malwarebytes Labs discovery, the fake website vanished into thin air after the company suspended its hosting account. However, this does not mean that attackers cannot come back with yet another fake domain under the name of popular cybersecurity company.Also, since malware attacks against Mac devices are increasing users should not downloaded apps and software from third-party platforms.

Zero-access encryption works in a way that despite being its creator, even ProtonMail cannot access or view the data stored by a user on the server while digital signature verification makes sure no third-party can temper or access user data.\u201cCombining encryption with digital signatures provides powerful protection that guarantees not only the privacy, but also the authenticity of the contacts saved in ProtonMail, and reduces the need to trust ProtonMail, as even we cannot access or change this information without your knowledge,\u201d said ProtonMail\u2019s co-founder, Dr. Andy Yen in a press release.With the help of the manager, a user can choose to encrypt any field of their contact data such as name and phone number. Moreover, the system generates a new private and public key pair that is used exclusively for encrypting contacts that ProtonMail cannot access whatsoever.The private key is generated on the client side and encrypted using a derivative of your password which the company cannot access, meaning that ProtonMail can never access your contacts private key. Encrypted contact fields are encrypted with your contacts public. Digital signing is done by signing the data with your private key which allows the authenticity of the data to be conclusively verified on each subsequent data access.\"#ProtonMail Contacts\" world's first encrypted contacts manager is here | More on https://t.co/X69j95K9OX pic.twitter.com/HJVyfJHBiW\u2014 Waqas (@Writerblues) November 24, 2017ProtonMail Contacts will be automatically available to users with its upcoming Version 3.12.

As per the findings of Buono, this vulnerability can let hackers create and distribute macro-based, self-replicating malware and hide it behind unsuspecting MS Word documents.Buono, who works at InTheCyber, explained that a self-replicating malware could allow the macro to keep writing more macros. Although this isn\u2019t a new type of threat and Microsoft has already developed and introduced security mechanism that can limit the malware\u2019s functionality, but the flaw shared by Buono can allow an attacker to evade the security controls of Microsoft easily.However, Microsoft doesn\u2019t regard it as a security issue when Buono tried to inform the company about the threat on October 17th. Microsoft claims that the feature is designed to function like this, but this is the same excuse that Microsoft gave for the DDE feature, which is the eye-candy of malicious threat actors nowadays.Furthermore, the tech giant pointed out that all external and untrusted macros will be disabled by default as per the latest change in the settings of macros. This limits the macros\u2019 default access to Office VBA project model. Users need to manually enable external macros by clicking on \u201cTrust access to the VBA project object model.\u201d This setting allows MS Office to automatically trust all macros and run the code without displaying security warning or asking for user\u2019s permission for running it.But, Buono identified that this particular feature could be enabled or disabled simply by editing the registry in Windows. This leads to enabling all the macros to write more macros without asking or notifying the user. Eventually, the victims get exposed to all macros-based attacks and unintentionally spread the malware by sharing infected documents with other users.Trend Micro also published a report on November 22nd to inform about the discovery of a new macro-based self-replicating malware, which has been dubbed as \u201cqkG.\u201d Surprisingly this malware also exploits the same feature of MS Office that the malware discovered by Buono does.When Trend Micro researchers assessed qkG malware samples uploaded by somebody from Vietnam on VirusTotal, they realized that the malware looked more like an \u201cexperimental project or a proof of concept\u201d instead of an actively used malware. It was also revealed in the report that qkG ransomware uses a technique that allows execution of malicious macros once the MS Word document is closed. This technique is known as Auto Close VBA macro.qkG is the first ransomware that scrambles one file type or file and one of the few file-encrypting malware that has been written in Visual Basic for Applications macros. Also, it is unique because unlike regular ransomware that use macros only to download ransomware, it employs malicious macro codes, which is a technique used by .lukitus, a variant of Locky ransomware. Both ransomware executes malicious macro when the document is closed, but .lukitus\u2019 macro codes not only retrieve but also execute the ransomware to encrypt targeted files saved on the targeted device.The newest sample of qkG ransomware shows that it includes a Bitcoin address bearing a brief ransom note with the asked amount of $300 in BTC written on it. Further probe revealed that no payments had been made at this Bitcoin address yet, which highlights that the ransomware hasn\u2019t targeted anyone as yet while the ransomware still uses the default hardcoded password: \u201cI\u2019m QkG@PTM17! by TNA@MHT-TT2.\u201dBuono shared a video to demonstrate the way his identified flaw works. In this video, it can be seen how an MS Word document containing malicious VBA code is used to distribute the multi-stage, self-replicating malware.Though this method hasn\u2019t been used by hackers as yet if they do, it will become very difficult to deal with the situation given that it exploits a legitimate MS Office feature and a majority of antivirus software doesn\u2019t issue a warning or block VBA code based MS documents. Microsoft also has no plans of releasing a patch to reduce the impact of a threat as it doesn\u2019t even consider it a threat.Therefore, Buono has provided some helpful solutions to mitigate the threat. He urges that users move the AccessVBOM registry key from the HKCU hive to HKLM so that only the system admin can edit it.

This is how websites conduct their marketing and promotional campaigns as you will notice that whatever product you checked out at a website, the next day you will see ads related to the same category of product on your browser. This is called monitoring your online activities, and websites use Session Replay scripts to perform the monitoring.To monitor your online activity, hidden strings of data are used to log everything such as whatever you type and movement of your mouse, etc. However, the latest study from Princeton University researchers reveals that this is a risky practice because third parties can easily obtain sensitive data like medical complaints or credit card details and expose users to all sorts of scams including identity theft.In fact, researchers have created a searchable list of the websites that they studied for the research. Almost all websites including Adobe, Godaddy, Skype, Samsung, Spotify, Microsoft, Rotten Tomatoes and WordPress were found to be using the Session Replay script. For their study, researchers analyzed around 50,000 top websites and identified that 482 of them were using sessions replay scripts.The findings are documented in the Web Transparency and Accountability Project from the university while three researchers from the university Englehardt, Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan collaborated for the study that is part of a series titled No Boundaries. This project is specially developed to assess websites and services regarding the way they record and use user data.It was learned that websites record everything from keystrokes, scrolling behaviors, mouse movements and the content of pages visited and the data is sent to third-party servers. The reason why this recording of data is risky for users is that it is difficult to keep it anonymous and therefore, users are exposed to a variety of online scams.Researchers from Princeton University\u2019s Center for Information Technology Policy participated in the research. In a blog post, Steven Englehardt, a Ph.D. student at Princeton University, revealed that session replay scripts are different from the regular analytics services because these don\u2019t provide aggregate stats but \u201crecord and playback individual browsing sessions,\u201d which is no less than eavesdropping. Since third-party replay scripts collect the content, therefore, it is risky for users. It is much more invasive than what we might assume.Session replay scripts are bits of code that not just offer general aggregate stats but also record everything about browsing sessions of every single visitor. These scripts don\u2019t run on every page of a website but are strategically placed on pages where users are most likely to enter sensitive, personal information such as passwords. A video was posted by the researchers to demonstrate how session play script records data.Seven most popular session replay script companies were analyzed by the researchers namely FullStory, SessionCam, Clicktale, Smart look, UserReplay, Hotjar, and Yandex. Test pages were created, and session replay scripts from six of these seven firms were installed, and further probe revealed that at least one of these scripts is used by 482 of the top 50,000 websites.Researchers noted that these companies might be vulnerable to targeted hack attacks since these are high-value targets. Such as, Yandex, Smart look and Hotjar dashboards run non-encrypted HTTP pages instead of using encrypted HTTP pages, which are more secure. This can allow attackers to launch man-in-the-middle attack to inject script into the playback page and obtain all the recorded data.\ufeffMore: Google collects Android location data even if location service is off", "topics": ["internet", "Marketing", "Privacy", "security", "Social Media", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Technology"], "title": "World\u2019s top websites record all your browsing movements", "date": "November 23, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "On Saturday night an unknown hacker targeted the Sacramento Regional Transit System (RT or SacRT) in California and hacked into its website along with its critical cyber infrastructure.

With a history of infecting apps on Play Store, the malware identified by researchers is BankBot, a banking trojan that keeps coming back and Google just cannot get rid of it whatsoever.BankBot is a banking malware that was discovered back in 2008 targeting third-party sites, but in 2014 it graduated and successfully made it to the Google Play Store to infect Android apps. Once installed, the malware conducts phishing attacks to show fake versions of banking apps and gain administrative privileges before removing the icon of the app, tricking the user into believing that the app has been deleted.In reality, however, the app continues to work in the background. Furthermore, the malware spies on SMS sent by the user, collect sensitive information such as credit card numbers, CVC number, its expiration date and user\u2019s home address. It is also able to collect device specs such as a list of installed apps, OS version, IMEI, and phone model and send it to the hacker.Previously, BankBot was found in fake Adobe Flash Player, Cryptocurrencies Market Prices app, Banking and Entertainment apps. This time, however, BankBot was caught hiding behind flashlight and solitaire gaming apps targeting customers from 131 banks worldwide including Wells Fargo, DiBa, Chase, and Citibank. According to a blog post by Nikolaos Chrysaidos, head of mobile threat intelligence and security at Avast:\u201cThe malicious activities include the installation of a fake user interface that\u2019s laid over the clean banking app when it\u2019s opened by the user. As soon as the user\u2019s bank details are entered, they are collected by the criminal. In some countries, banks use transaction authentication numbers (TANs), a form of two-factor authentication required to conduct online transfers often used by European banks. The authors of BankBot intercept their victims\u2019 text message that includes the mobile TAN, allowing them to carry out bank transfers on the user\u2019s behalf.\u201d \ufeffThe full list of targeted banking apps is also available on Avast\u2019s blog post.Furthermore, researchers found that the infected apps also dropped Mazar malware that was originally found in Play Store two years ago. At that time, researchers concluded that Mazar is so powerful that it can \u201ctransform a targeted smartphone into a trash box.\u201dMazar can perform a variety of functions on infected devices, for example, gaining boot persistence, which helps it in surviving even after the device restarts, initiate Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks, spy upon the Internet traffic, send/receive SMS messages and much more.Google\u2019s Play Protect is responsible for checking apps and devices for harmful behavior, but in this case, the infected solitaire apps did not only get the chance to take a pass but also had \u201cverified by Play Protect\u201d tag on it.The same happened with \u201cCryptocurrencies Market Prices\u201d app a few weeks ago when Play Protect failed to identify its malicious activities. By now, it is obvious that Play Protect cannot detect BankBot malware.Although all infected apps have been removed by Google, the researchers first found BankBot in Flashlight and solitaire apps on October 13th. By then, it had targeted users around the world including Australia, France, Germany, Portugal, Poland, Philippines, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Greece, Russia, Dominican Republic and Singapore.However, the malware according to researchers is not active in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. This could be because its developer is from these three countries or they want to avoid unwanted attention from law enforcement authorities in these countries.There was a time when cybercriminals used to target third party software/apps to infect Android users with malware but since Play Store has become their prime target; it is advised that users should avoid downloading unnecessary apps.

The service is designed to capture user\u2019s screen and record system audio. Since a majority of Android devices nowadays have these three versions of the OS, therefore, around 77.5% of the Android devices are at risk.Android\u2019s MediaProjection service has existed since long, but apps needed root access and signed up with the release keys of the device in order to use the service. This is why the use of this service is limited to system level apps only. But when Android Lolipop 5.0 was released, Google made this service open to everyone but did not secure it with the requirement of permission from the users. Now, the apps can access this service through an intent call that would display SystemUI prompt warning users when the app would capture the screenshot and record system audio, noted BleepingComputer.Researchers at MWR Labs opine that [PDF] an attacker can detect when this prompt would be shown and the trigger an arbitrary prompt and the content would be disguised with another message using a technique called tap-jacking. Android malware developers have relied upon this particular technique for years, and still, it works.\u201cTo use the MediaProjection service, an application would simply have to request access to this system Service via an Intent. Access to this system Service is granted by displaying a SystemUI pop-up that warns the user that the requesting application would like to capture the user\u2019s screen,\u201d explained MWR researchers.The reason why this vulnerability is threatening is that the affected android versions cannot identify obscured SystemUI pop-ups allowing an attacker to create an app that draws an overlay upon the pop-up and elevate the privileges of the app. This would let the attacker capture user\u2019s screen.Android Smartphones Plagued with Bug that Lets Attacker Capture Screen and Record AudioSince the SystemUI pop-up is currently the only access control method that can prevent the exploitation of MediaProjection service, therefore, an attacker can use tap-jacking to bypass the method and get the permission of capturing the screen. The attack won\u2019t stay undetected for long, claims researchers at MWR in their latest report, since the captured screenshot will produce an icon that will be displayed on the notification bar. Same would be the case when an attacker records the audio.Google claims that the bug has been patched in its latest release Android Oreo 8.0, but the previous versions are still vulnerable.", "topics": ["Android", "audio", "Google", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Technology", "Video", "Vulnerabilit"], "title": "Android Flaw Lets Attackers Capture Screen and Record Audio", "date": "November 20, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "It\u2019s just another day with just another news explaining the vulnerable state of Android devices. This time, the IT security researchers at McAfee have discovered an Android malware that has infected 144 apps on Google Play Store, a place supposed to be safest for users when it comes to download or purchase Apps for their smartphones.Dubbed Grabos, by researchers, the malware hides behind free music player apps. Initially, researchers found the malware in \u201cAristotle Music audio player 2017,\u201d which has been downloaded five million times. Although its rating was positive with more than 23,000 five stars, one of the users in the comment section identified it as malware.The reason for such positive rating is that once the app is installed on the device, it asks users to help the developer of the app by giving them a 5-star rating. The reason for such a massive download rate could be that the app also asks users to share the app with friends and get faster downloading speed in return.Grabos like other malware aims at stealing personal data of victims and collecting information about the infected device such as Android version, build model, network, location, country code, sim, carrier, language, time zone and whether the device is using VPN or not, etc.The malware also checks for social and Google apps on the device. Once all the information is collected, the malware sends it to a command-and-control server in encrypted format.\u201cGrabos gained popularity on Google Play because it allowed users to download music for free while constantly asking them to rate the app. However, users were not aware of the hidden functionality that comes with those apps, exposing them to custom notifications to download and install additional apps and open them without their consent, said McAfee\u2019s mobile malware researcher Carlos Castillo in a blog post. \u201cConsidering that Grabos also reports the presence of specific social and Google apps on infected devices, cybercriminals could use that information to deliver additional apps by tricking users into installing them using any of the notification methods implemented in the code.\u201dGrabos was discovered in September 2017, the reason it evaded Google Play security was likely because the injected code is protected with a commercial obfuscator, making it very difficult to analyze without executing the application statically.Good news is that Google has removed all the infected apps after McAfee shared its report with the company. However, the question remains why Google\u2019s security tools could not detect the presence of this malware and for how long the tech giant will depend on cybersecurity firms and their findings?Android is one of the most vulnerable and targeted mobile operating systems in the world.

It is capable of injecting visited web pages with HTML code to conduct man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks and steal banking data including credit card information.According to Bitdefender, the trojan also hunts for login credentials belonging to social media websites including Google Plus, Facebook, and Twitter. It also targets Yahoo users to steal their passwords, but interestingly Terdot\u2019s algorithm does not allow it to gather any data from vk.com, Russia\u2019s largest social media platform.What worrisome is that Terdot has capabilities to automatically modify and update itself which further allow it to download and execute any type of file when requested by its operator. This means the trojan can update itself with new capabilities that might trick anti-virus programs by evading detection.\u201cTerdot is a complex malware, building upon the legacy of Zeus,\u201d Bitdefender said. \u201cIts focus on harvesting credentials for other services such as social networks and email services could turn it into an extremely powerful cyber espionage tool that is extremely difficult to spot and clean.\u201dFurthermore, Bitdefender noted that the trojan is being delivered via email attachment with fake and malicious PDF files.Remember, a couple of weeks ago; Cisco Talos researchers found attackers manipulating Google Search results to distribute Zeus Panda banking trojan.

The archives contain several terabytes of data, which includes social media posts and similar pages from across the globe. The data is the property of US military, and it is alleged that the information was collected to create profiles of persons of interest. There is evidence that the software used to develop the databases was created and operated by VendorX, a defunct government contractor and it shows how risky it can be to involve third-party vendors in confidential matters.Vickery discovered the unprotected archives while performing routine scanning of open data silos hosted by Amazon and these were rather easy to found because of the absence of appropriate security measures. The archives were titled Pacom-archive, Centcom-backup, and Centcom-archive. CENTCOM is the abbreviation for US Central Command that is responsible for controlling the majority of army operations in the Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa while PACOM refers to US Pacific Command and it covers remaining regions namely China, Southern Asia, and Australasia.While speaking with The Register, Vickery explained that he accidentally discovered the databases when he entered the term COM while scanning the publicly available S3 buckets and a simple refining of his search displayed the CENTCOM archive. Initially, he believed that the archive belonged to China-based multinational firm Tencent, but he soon realized that it was the property of US military.Vickery downloaded around 400GB of data as a sample, and he claims that \u201cdozens of terabytes\u201d of data is open to public access most of which include compressed text files. One of the databases contain 1.8billion social media posts that have been collected over the past eight years until today, and the posts were made in central Asia mainly. Vickery also noted that some material was fetched from comments of US citizens.The documents Vickery scanned revealed that the US military collected the information in connection with the Outpost program launched by the US government. It is a social media monitoring and manipulating campaign that targets youth overseas to prevent them from joining terrorist groups.Vickery was able to identify Outpost development configuration files in the databases along with the Apache Lucene keywords indexes that were developed for Elasticsearch, an open-source search engine. Vickery also identified Another file titled Coral, and it probably referred to the very famous, award-winning Coral Reef data-mining program from the US military.Back in 2012, Army Distributed Common Ground System\u2019s technical director Mark Kitz stated that Coral Reef is developed to analyze a data source so that the analyst can mine a significant amount of data and assess the association between individuals to create a social network.\u201cPreviously, we would mine through those intelligence reports or whatever data would be available, and that would be very manual-intensive,\u201d stated Kitz back then.Vickery revealed that he identified the openly accessible archives on 6th September 2017, much before Amazon released the new security controls to protect the S3 buckets, so it is yet to be seen how effective the new measures are. He also informed the US military about the availability of these databases, and soon these were locked down while the military also thanked Vickery for notifying them about the issue.Although we do know exactly why Coral Reef was developed by US military and that monitoring or even collecting social media posts is nothing to be worried about but finding out that such material is quite easy to be identified given its poor configuration then one is bound to get disturbed. These kinds of open archives are no less than a treasure trove of data for intelligence agencies as well as cybercriminals and enemies of the state. As noted by UpGuard security in its blog post:\u201cWhile a cursory examination of the data reveals loose correlations of some of the scraped data to regional US security concerns\u2026 the apparently benign nature of the vast number of captured global posts, as well as the origination of many of them from within the US, raises serious concerns about the extent and legality of known Pentagon surveillance against US citizens.\u201d\u201cIn addition, it remains unclear why and for what reasons the data was accumulated, presenting the overwhelming likelihood that the majority of posts captured originate from law-abiding civilians across the world.\u201dSource: UpGuard | Via: The Register", "topics": ["Data", "internet", "Military", "Privacy", "security", "Social Media", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Technology", "USA"], "title": "Misconfigured Amazon S3 Buckets Exposed US Military\u2019s Social Media Spying Campaign", "date": "November 18, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Rhino Security Labs\u2019 researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Amazon\u2019s Key delivery service and Cloud Cam security camera. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the functioning of the camera to make it go offline due to which it will not be possible to monitor if someone entered a home or not.It is worth noting that Amazon Key Service is designed especially for homeowners so that they could remotely lock and unlock the front doors for visitors while this service is connected with the Cloud Cam security camera. When a delivery drive arrives at your home, he will send an unlock request to Amazon after which the company will authenticate the driver\u2019s identity, package information, and home address. If the information is correct, the door will unlock automatically, and the package will be left inside the home. Then the driver would send a request to lock the door and Amazon will lock it.Throughout the process, the Key app will keep homeowner connected and updated while the entire process gets completed in mere seconds. Amazon\u2019s Prime members can allow carriers to verify their identity in order to relock and unlock the door to leave a package inside the home all by themselves.This shows that the camera and key service is developed to safeguard homeowners from rogue Key delivery persons. However, Rhino Labs researchers discovered that the flaw identified in the camera is shared with all the wireless network based devices and it can bring the camera offline after which a hacker can access your Wi-Fi network and send deauthorization command script to the camera, which is known as the Deauth Attack.This would enable the camera to stop recording footages. This is contrary to the claims made by Amazon by stating that safety and security are \u201cbuilt into every aspect of the service.\u201d According to Rhino Labs, when Cloud Cam goes offline it sends a snapshot of the last taken footage before going offline to the owner. The whole attack is easily carried out using just a computer or a tiny handheld Raspberry Pi and an antenna add-on.\ufeffDeauth attack is not just applicable on Amazon Key because it affects almost every Wi-Fi connected device and makes it go offline. But, the catch in this situation is that the hacker can manipulate the Key app in a way that it won\u2019t inform the homeowner regarding any foul play and will keep showing the last live frame, which might be of a locked door. The driver will have the power to re-lock the door after re-entering it to make sure that homeowner doesn\u2019t suspect anything unusual.However, Amazon\u2019s spokesperson believes that the issue is not in the camera, but the Wi-Fi network and these findings are not as threatening to the average user of Amazon Key service as it is being touted. Moreover, their drivers are hired after a comprehensive background check and are, therefore, quite reliable.Having said that, the company assured that it would be releasing a firmware update for the camera and for the time being, Amazon will be notifying users if it finds the camera to be offline for long and the update will be churned out later this week. The company says it will provide notifications quickly if the camera is offline while delivery is taking place and the service won\u2019t unlock the door if Wi-Fi service is disabled or the camera isn\u2019t online.\u201cWe currently notify customers if the camera is offline for an extended period\u2026 Later this week, we will deploy an update to more quickly provide notifications if the camera goes offline during delivery.\u201dIt is evident that despite the vulnerability, whether it is in the camera or the network, the technique is rather complex and difficult to pull off. Only the delivery driver or a close acquaintance can unlock the door, but even then they would require sophisticated technical know-how and capability of sending deauthorization command script to the camera. Otherwise, the feat will fall flat, but even if something is stolen, then Amazon will instantly locate the criminal unless the theft is undetectable such as identity theft.Rhino Labs researchers developed a proof-of-concept video to validate their findings. In the video, the de-authentication attack has been recorded, and researchers have repeated the attack to prove their point further.

It has also urged parents to destroy these watches mostly used by children between the ages of 5 and 12 years.The decision came months after the agency banned \u201cMy Friend Cayla Doll\u201d citing that the smart toy conducts surveillance, listens to kids conversations and responds to them in real-time. Bundesnetzagentur described the doll as an authentic example of \u201cunauthorized wireless transmitting equipment.\u201dIn the latest decision, the agency also described these watches as \u201cunauthorized transmitters.\u201d Bundesnetzagentur President Jochen Homann stated, \u201cAccording to our investigations, parents were using the watches, for example, to listen in on teachers during class.\u201d While authorities are asking parents to get rid of these watches, a crackdown against some of the firms selling them online has already been initiated. Schools in the country are also asked to be more vigilant about using such watches. \u201cVia an app, parents can use such children\u2019s watches to listen unnoticed to the child\u2019s environment, and they are to be regarded as an unauthorized transmitting system,\u201d said Homann.According to Bundesnetzagentur\u2019s press release, these watches have a SIM card and a limited telephony function, which are set up and controlled via an app. Such a monitoring function is often referred to as a \u201cbaby monitor\u201d or \u201cmonitor function.\u201d The app owner can specify that the watch, unnoticed by the carrier,  calls any phone number. This enables him to listen unnoticed to the conversations of the watch wearer and his environment. Such a monitoring function is prohibited in Germany.In October this year, consumer watchdog Norwegian Consumer Council (NCC) said that there are some severe security flaws in smartwatches for kids that can be exploited, hacked and tracked the current location of kids and trick their parents to display a different location. The watches tested by researchers were equipped with real-time location tracking and facilitated two-way calls with some selected contacts. \u201cIf buyers of such watches are known to the Federal Network Agency, they ask them to destroy the clock and send proof of this to the Federal Network Agency,\u201dBundesnetzagenturNCC also found out that these smartwatches store and transmit data without encryption that once exploited can pose a serious threat. \u201cIt\u2019s very serious when products that claim to make children safer instead put them at risk because of poor security and features that do not work properly.

Although Emotet malware was hosted on a third-party website it was shared through a domain that was linked with the project. Ironically, McAfee marketed the anti-hacking service as a fool-proof solution for protecting the business from being hacked. The purpose of ClickProtect was to prevent users from phishing attacks, infected websites, and malware.The Paris-based researcher who uses the alias Benkow discovered the malware, and he reported about it via Twitter where he explained that ClickProtect rewrites all the web links in an email message with the one using the domain \u201ccp.mcafee.com\u201d and after this, it analyses the link to check if it is malicious or safe. The link is then scanned every time somebody clicks on it.cp.mcafee.\\com can seriously be used for spreading malware ?!

This means, if someone downloads the Word file, he or she will be instantly exposed to Emotet.Emotet is a dangerous banking malware that gains financial information of a user simply by injecting malicious coding in the computer\u2019s network stack, and it is delivered through infected URLs. Attackers hide these malicious links in emails, Word files, and PDFs. As per Malwarebytes\u2019 chief malware intelligence analyst Jerome Segura, Emotet is widely distributed through \u201cmalspam campaigns\u201d that contain links to infected websites hosting a malicious Word document. When a user opens this file, it triggers the macros, and Emotet malware binary is downloaded. The malware utilizes PowerShell script to get additional information.Further assessment revealed that this is not a new occurrence because previously Salesforce.com administrator observed similar problem a few years back. This shows the malware has been upgraded numerous times in recent years to make it powerful enough to evade detection. Apparently, this malware is used as a dropper to spread another banking malware called IcedID.After getting installed, the malware obtains information like card numbers and passwords, which is used to hack into user\u2019s accounts and transfer their money online. It can also hack the C&C center of a compromised computer and use hard-coded IP addresses to generate proxies and prevent detection.When notified about this issue, McAfee responded by investigating Benkow\u2019s discovery and identified that the ClickProtect feature was operating properly and that the researcher\u2019s concerns \u201carose out of the timing of ClickProtect\u2019s reputation-based status detection and response.\u201dAccording to the official statement from McAfee\u2019s Global Threat Intelligence service, until the early hours of November 13 this web link was not identified to be distributing the malware but later on they identified this link as a threat, and therefore, its reputation rank was changed from low risk to high risk and McAfee customers were blocked from accessing this link.

Kaspersky was accused of helping Russian cyber intelligence in stealing information about NSA\u2019s hacking tools. The findings were released in a report published this Thursday.The focus of Kaspersky\u2019s investigation was the computer system of the contractor; investigators linked the computer with a massive volume of Equation Group malware signatures, which its antivirus software recorded and saved onto the computer\u2019 server. It is worth noting that the Equation Group APT is also linked with the NSA. The in-depth probe revealed that the contractor\u2019s laptop was infected on 4th October 2014 by some external, malicious actor. This is the same timeframe when investigators believe NSA\u2019s hacking tools were stolen.If this information is authentic, then the hacking incident probably happened between 11th September 2014 and 17th November 2014. But, the analysis fails to fit with the already acquired information that the hack occurred in 2015. It is also alleged that the computer system was already infected with a malicious downloader and Smoke Bot or Smoke Loader [PDF] backdoor program. The backdoor was delivered to the system through a malicious MS Office ISO document. Since the contractor had disabled the antivirus program temporarily to install and run this malware program, therefore, the hack easily took place.Kaspersky accept collecting NSA files, claims they were deleted from their system later onKaspersky further noted in its report that when re-enabled the antivirus program was successful in blocking the backdoor\u2019s attempt to connect with a suspicious domain, but the system downloaded some other questionable software which was responsible for triggering 121 non-Equation oriented AV alerts. The alerts were triggered between 11th Sep and 17th Nov 2017. This hints at the fact that there might have been other malware present on the computer, which Kaspersky\u2019s engines could not detect.\u201cGiven that system owner\u2019s potential clearance level, the user could have been a prime target of nation states. Adding the user\u2019s apparent need for cracked versions of Windows and Office, poor security practices, and improper handling of what appeared to be classified materials, it is possible that the user could have leaked information to many hands,\u201d revealed the report.As per Kaspersky\u2019s investigators, the Equation Group malware was detected by its antivirus program in September 2014 in a 7zip archive, which was saved on the contractor\u2019s computer system. This particular malware was programmed to download this archive onto the servers of Kaspersky, but as per the analysis of Kaspersky, only the binaries were stored, and the remaining files including Equation Group source code and some confidential files were collected and deleted.\u201cThe reason we deleted those files and will delete similar ones in the future is two-fold,\u201d Kaspersky Lab researchers wrote in Thursday\u2019s report. \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything other than malware binaries to improve protection of our customers and secondly, because of concerns regarding the handling of potential classified materials. Assuming that the markings were real, such information cannot and will not [be] consumed even to produce detection signatures based on descriptions.\u201dThe antivirus vendor denied that its software could be used to send data to Russian spies since external parties cannot forge the system without getting detected by third-parties because its products use a secure signature system. The information is recorded in historical records and internal databases.According to their investigation, between 2014 and 2016, the researchers working on Equation did not possess the right to commit signatures directly without getting it verified by an experienced signature developer. \u201cIf there was a doubtful intention in signatures during the hunt for Equation samples, this would have been questioned and reported by a lead signature developer,\u201d claimed Kaspersky in its report.It is apparent that Kaspersky\u2019s report is the company\u2019s attempt to counter allegations that it helped Russian spies in invading the contractor\u2019s laptop. It is important for Kaspersky to provide some valid arguments in its defense to safeguard its future in the US tech market.Source: Kaspersky Labs", "topics": ["Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "cyber war", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Kaspersky", "LEAKS", "NSA", "Russia", "security", "Snowden", "USA"], "title": "Kaspersky Investigators Reveal How NSA Hacking Tools Were Stolen", "date": "November 17, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "A couple of days ago it was reported that an IT security researcher Robert Baptiste who goes by the handle of Elliot Alderson on Twitter had discovered a pre-installed backdoor application called \u201cEngineerMode\u201d on OnePlus smartphones including its 5, 3, 3T models and OxygenOS for OnePlus 1.Now, the same researcher has found another preinstalled app in OnePlus devices sold to customers around the world.

However, it becomes the responsibility of the company to safeguard user\u2019s private information and keep it private, and if it doesn\u2019t happen then, the users will be in great danger.The same has happened with Fasten, a Boston based ride-hailing service provider firm. According to the findings of Kromtech Security Center researchers, there is a misconfigured Apache Hive database containing data of Fasten customers and offers public access to the information. It is worth noting that Fasten covers two key markets in the US namely Austin, Texas and Boston, Massachusetts and reportedly, about 50% of Boston\u2019s and 90% of Austin\u2019s travelers use its service primarily because the company offers comparatively lower rates than its competitors.As per Kromtech Security, the misconfigured server was left unsecured, which is why not only end-users but anyone with an internet connection could access the internal data, driver records, customer records and similar confidential data of Fasten. Researchers assessed that customer data of nearly 1 million users on the Fasten mobile app, thousands of driver profiles, the unique 15 digit IMEI code of mobiles where its app is installed, email IDs, picture links, phone numbers, names and the last 4 digits of customers\u2019 debit/credit cards have been exposed. The data also included taxi routes, driver notes and location coordinates, drivers\u2019 car registration information, details about license plates and links to pictures of the vehicles too.Researchers noted that soon after they notified Fasten about the database, the company quickly secure the data and removed the database from public access. Gizmodo, on the other hand, revealed that out of a sample of five thousand rides, nearly 6% were directly linked to the Austin Convention Center\u2019s GPS coordinates and if the entire database is analyzed, then it may contain data of over 16,000 SXSW related rides. It must be noted that Fasten was the official service at this year\u2019s South By Southwest festival, which was held in Austin since Uber and Lyft were officially banned at that timeframe in Austin.Fasten\u2019s Corporate Communications head Jennifer Borgan stated that this database was created on 11th October and that it didn\u2019t contain sensitive customer and driver data. Borgan further explained that the database was open for 48 hours before its deletion.

It is rather surprising that all antivirus programs available nowadays are plagued with this flaw including Kaspersky, ZoneAlarm, Malwarebytes, Emsisoft, Trend Micro and Ikarus to name a few.To perform penetration testing, Bogner infected clients\u2019 computer with a conventional phishing email method, and then it was identified that the malware got quarantined by the AV program after which he was able to exploit the software\u2019s flaws. The flaws exploited by Bogner allowed unprivileged users to perform restoration of quarantined documents, while these documents could be relayed to a privileges directory of his own choice (e.g., C:\\Program Files or C:\\Windows) if NTFS file junction feature in MS Windows was exploited.It was also possible to exploit the Dynamic Link Library search order function so that malware could obtain full privileges. A key limitation associated with AVGater is that to launch it attackers need to obtain physical access to a computer and in shared computer environments attack becomes a lot more difficult.It must be noted that usually, the restore from Quarantine feature doesn\u2019t let a non-administrator to write a document to any other folder but the malware hijacks the NTFS function to perform this task.According to Bogner, to prevent AVGater, users need to update the antivirus programs installed on their devices. On the contrary, enterprise computer is more at risk to this attack and therefore, Bogner suggests that enterprise users must remove the restore files from quarantine feature for good.A video was uploaded by Bogner that explains the way this exploit performs its malicious functions while the antivirus software vendors have been notified about the flaw and some already have released security patches to fix the problem.Source: Bogner | Image Via: Blue Coat Photos", "topics": ["hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "TROJAN", "Vulnerability"], "title": "New Vulnerability Exploits Antivirus Programs to Install Malware", "date": "November 13, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Apple Inc. introduced Face ID facial recognition system on September 12, 2017, with the launch of iPhone X and claimed that even high-quality masks such as those used in Hollywood movies couldn\u2019t trick its security system.

The targeted business, a point-of-sale system repair company Washburn Computer Group (WCG) was where Gammell worked.According to US federal prosecutors, Gammell hired three people and paid them a monthly subscription to carry attacks against the company\u2019s system and bring them down. The attacks cost the company a whopping $15,000 in damages but he didn\u2019t stop there, authorities also accused him of paying $19.99 to $199.99 monthly to conduct cyber attacks on Hennepin County, Minnesota Judicial Branch, and some banks.Cyberhitmen hired for sustained DDoS attacks against mans former employerOther than DDoS, one of the hacking-for-hire used by Gammell was vDOS, a cyber-attack service that was hacked in July 2016 and taken down in September 2016 after two of its key operators were arrested in Israel.

According to a sworn affidavit [PDF] submitted by FBI Special Agent Brian Behm, at the time when Washburn started suffering cyber attacks, there was no way of identifying its culprits since the IP addresses linked to the DDoS attacks was associated with a virtual private network (VPN) provider based in the United States, wrote Behm.However, during the attacks, Washburn received two taunting emails (with a gif file showing a laughing mouse) asking about the attacks. One of the emails was sent from a Gmail account while the other was a Yahoo email address inquiring whether the company needed help with the ongoing attacks. The FBI discovered that both accounts were created on an IP address associated with Gammell\u2019s home address along with an AT&T cell phone number in his name.Gammell has pleaded not guilty to the charges and rejected the plea deal offer that would have resolved all charges and capped his possible prison sentence at a mandatory 15 to 17 years. The Newspaper further reported that Gammell\u2019s attorney, Rachel Paulose filed a motion urging a federal magistrate to review the case. Currently, the motion is under review as to whether the case should be dismissed or not.Paulose also told U.S. Magistrate Judge David Schultz that the FBI got their hands on the evidence through an anonymous researcher who stole the data by hacking the vDOS service.

Apparently, developers didn\u2019t properly follow the guidelines of using Twilio and did not secure credentials and tokens.Michael Bentley from Appthority wrote that: \u201cBy hard-coding their credentials, the developers have effectively given global access to all metadata stored in their Twilio accounts.\u201dThe affected apps have already been downloaded for more than 180 million times, which shows the extent of the threat.Researchers claim that Eavesdropper manages to expose huge amounts of confidential, private data without relying upon conventional methods like jailbreak, malware or rooting but only through the careless developer error.\u201cEavesdropper\u201d Flaw Poses Serious Threat to Enterprise Mobile Data \u2013 The data that can be exposed includes call records, minutes of calls, minutes of call audio recordings, SMS and MMS text messages\u201dThe incident highlights the fact that hackers can launch attacks without using sophisticated tools. Moreover, the concerning aspect is that the problem cannot be resolved by deleting the affected app from the device, but the user needs to update credentials and keep them secure.

Now, they have revealed additional information about their plans. According to experts, in December 2017 they intend to demonstrate that they indeed have identified the way to \u201crun unsigned code in the Platform Controller Hub\u201d on any given motherboard through the God-mode hack.IMEs are built into the chipset, and their security has been questioned by security experts for a long while some have even touted it to be a black box of exploitable flaws and bugs. The Platform Controller Hub is the central point where IME is located; it has its operating system called MINIX, its CPU and lets sysadmins to control/configure/wipe machines across a network remotely. The platform is quite useful provided if you need to manage a large network of computers especially in situations where the endpoint\u2019s OS breaks down and does not boot properly.So, when Positive Technologies experts state that they can hijack the Management Engine, this means they can take over the control of a box completely regardless of which operating system or antivirus is installed. This is made possible through the powerful God-mode hack attack, which is relatively new and used discreetly to spy upon users or hijack corporate data.Positive Technologies has further revealed that the latest IME versions are equipped with JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) debugging ports, which can be accessed through USB. These ports allow a user low-level access to the code running on a chip. This is quite a threat for Intel because using the technology anyone can remotely exploit the firmware responsible for running the Management Engine and identify security vulnerabilities.Game over!

Although there are a couple of Android bug bounty programmes offering a lucrative amount of money, the marketplace just can\u2019t get rid of malware, in fact, the old ones keep coming back.IT security researchers at RiskIQ have discovered a dangerous and widespread malware often used by cybercriminals to steal banking information from Android users. Dubbed BankBot (also known as BankingBot), this is the fourth time that researchers have discovered this malware targeting users. Meaning, Google just can\u2019t get rid of BankBot.Crypto Currencies Market Prices app belongs to BankBot malware familyThis time, researchers discovered BankBot in an app called \u201cCryptocurrencies Market Prices\u201d claiming to provide up to date price for cryptocurrencies. But the real price was paid by those who downloaded the app from app store and got their banking data stolen. Researchers also noted that despite being malicious, it still got a shiny \u201cverified by Play Protect\u201d tag on it. Google Play Protect is supposed to check apps and device for harmful behavior. However, in BankBot\u2019s case, it acted otherwise.\u201cThe app itself is a bundled application as described in the \u2018Detection\u2019 section of this document. It is a combination of a legitimate functionality\u2014comparing actual cryptocurrency market prices with global Fiat money\u2014and a Bankbot instance,\u201d researchers noted.As obvious by its name, the BankBot is developed to steal banking data from an Android device such as credit card number and other payment-related information. Once installed, it also conducts phishing attacks to show fake version of banking apps and gain administrative privileges before removing the icon of the app, tricking the user into believing that the app has been deleted.In reality, however, the app continues to work in the background. Furthermore, the malware spies on SMS sent by the user, collects sensitive information such as credit card numbers, CVC number, its expiration date and user\u2019s home address. It is also able to collect device specs such as a list of installed apps, OS version, IMEI, and phone model and send it to the hacker.That\u2019s not all; the malware is designed to display fake screens disguised as banking apps. As soon as the app gets what it wants, the credentials are then passed on to the hacker through a control and command (C&C) server. It also tracks available text fields, such as menu elements, and logs keystrokes and other components of the user interface.After RiskIQ\u2019s findings were sent to Google it removed the app from PlayStore but the question remains why Google didn\u2019t find the app before researchers and how did it get the \u201cVerified\u201d tag while it was a malware-infected app.Discovered back in 2008, the BankBot banking malware was caught infecting Android devices through malicious apps on PlayStore in 2014. It aimed at stealing credit card and personal data of unsuspecting users. Once exposed, the infected apps were booted off by Google from its marketplace.In April this year, BankBot infected 400 apps on Google Play Store. One of the infected apps was Funny Videos 2017 that was downloaded 5,000 times by unsuspecting users. Upon reporting, Google deleted all the infected apps.In July 2017, BankBot malware was again caught on Play Store disguising as fake Adobe Flash Player app aiming at stealing banking information of Android users.

Recently, IT security researchers at Trustwave discovered a critical vulnerability in printers manufactured by Brother Industries, Ltd., a Japanese multinational electronics and electrical equipment company.The vulnerability (CVE-2017-16249) exists in the web front-end of Brother printers called Debut (Remote un-authenticated DoS in Debut embedded httpd server in Brother printers) which if exploited can allow attackers to carry Denial of Service (DoS) through the victim\u2019s printer without their knowledge.\u201cSome people dismiss Denial of Service attacks as a mere nuisance, but they can tie up resources and reduce productivity at any organization,\u201d a Trustwave researcher explained in a blog post. \u201cThey can also be used as a part of an in-person attack on an organization. For instance, an attacker can launch a Denial of Service like this one and then show up at the organization as the \u2018technician\u2019 called to fix the problem. Impersonating a technician would allow the attacker direct physical access to IT resources that they might never have been able to access remotely.\u201dThe attack is executed by sending a single malformed HTTP POST request. The attacker receives a 500 error code in response, the web server is rendered inaccessible, and all printing cease to function. This vulnerability appears to affect all Brother printers with the Debut web front-end, noted researchers.Currently, there are more than 16,000 vulnerable devices publicly available on Shodan for attackers to exploit. There has been no response from Brother even after multiple attempts by Trustwave to alert the company regarding the presence of critical vulnerability. Therefore, Trustwave decided to publish their findings to the public even though the vulnerability still exists.Despite Trustwaves\u2019 attempts to alert Brother about the flaw; there was not a single reply from the firm \u2013 Therefore, the flaw still exists.The proof-of-concept (PoC) is available here. Therefore, users are on their own and advised to use firewall along with restricting the device access. Remember, in denial-of-service attack (DoS attack); an attacker can make a targeted device unavailable to its users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.Previously, HP printers were found vulnerable to attack in which hackers could use its hard drive to host malicious files.

The same malware that was reportedly active since 2013 has made a comeback and is much more threatening than ever.According to cyber-security researchers at Proofpoint, the new Marcher campaign includes three security threats namely phishing, banking Trojan, and credit card theft into a single, comprehensively designed campaign. This multi-step scheme is mainly targeted towards Bank of Austria\u2019s customers while users or Android devices are at risk. Until now, at least 20,000 users have been affected by this new campaign.What makes it unique is the fact that hackers have adopted an unconventional approach by combining three techniques into one.Proofpoint researchers wrote in their blog post that the campaign is active since January; in previous Marcher malware campaign the malicious code was distributed via SMS, but in this scheme, the link leading to the malware is sent through a phishing email. Since the link has been shortened, therefore, it is quite difficult to be detected. Furthermore, attackers have created a replica of the targeted bank\u2019s user interface, designed an authentic looking icon for the app so that it looks legitimate and somehow acquired top-level domains such as .gdn to deceive users fully.When the user clicks on the link, he/she is lead to a phishing site of the bank used by the victim where banking credentials are requested to be entered along with phone number and email address. Then the victim is asked to download a fake app titled Bank Austria Security App. It seems to be official bank app, and then the victim is asked to all apps from Unknown sources after modifying the device\u2019s security settings. It then acquires Device Admin privileges.The victim is warned about blocking of the account in case the app is not installed. Around 7% of the visitors have already downloaded this app, which is responsible for ultimately dropping Marcher banking Trojan.After installation, Marcher asks for various permissions and gets the following excessive privileges: Read/Write data to external storage device, Location Access, Read/Write/Send SMS, launch phone call without using the Dialer user interface, access Contacts, get the device Locked at any time, modify Wi-Fi connectivity status. It is worth noting that the malware can make calls and SMS messages, both of which would cost the user.When the banking credentials, email ID, phone data and other information is acquired, the malware then asks the victim to provide credit card number as soon as Google Play Store or any other app is opened. This is how the malware managed to steal all kinds of financial data from the victim.Proofpoint researchers wrote in their blog post that both desktop and mobile phone users need to be cautious while installing apps from third-party platforms and must only prefer \u201clegitimate app stores and sources.\u201d Moreover, users must be wary of fake banking websites asking for excessive information that a bank would normally ask for or need.

It is worth noting that Jeepforum.com is the second most widely visited and famous website of Vertical Scope.Security researcher Alex Holden, the founder of Hold Security, informed Krebs last week that numerous websites owned by Vertical Scope and the company\u2019s access were on sale online. Holden initially believed that hackers were trying to resell the previously hacked data, which was stolen in the earlier breach in 2016.Security researcher and founder of Hold Security, Alex Holden, notified Krebs last week that hackers were selling access to Verticalscope.com and a number of other sites operated by the company.When he contacted one of the hackers, who was selling the stolen data and learned that Verticalscope.com and some of its operated websites were compromised again using Web Shell backdoor.

Similarly, users relied upon the search results on popular and trusted platforms like Google and clicked on the links without thinking twice.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});However, now we might need to be a bit more cautious while clicking on search engine results because cybercriminals have identified a way to exploit them as well. This is called SEO-malvertising and SERP Poisoning.According to the analysis of security firm Cisco Talos, cybercriminals have learned the art of exploiting SEO to distribute their malicious links containing the notorious Zeus Panda banking Trojan to a wider range of users as they click on search results. This would be helpful for them in gaining more victims. A group of hacked websites is being used by the Zeus Panda group to embed keywords either in new pages or existing ones.The Zeus Panda distribution scheme is quite interesting, noted Cisco Talos researchers, since its configuration and operation infrastructure doesn\u2019t rely upon conventional distribution methods adopted by hackers to distribute malware. Instead, infected or compromised business websites are being used for this purpose. The hackers carefully choose these websites based on their high ratings and reviews on the search engine. That is an important step because their ratings and review would eventually lead to making the results look authentic to the victims (users).Hackers have targeted various keyword groups in this campaign; the majority of them are linked to financial or banking related information which users are believed to be searching for on a regular basis. Furthermore, specific geographic locations have directly been singled out for the attack, and numerous keyword groups are targeted to the Middle East and India based financial institutions.The finance-related keywords are selected on purpose by cybercriminals to ensure that the infected links are displayed so that the conversion rate gets maximized. The compromised devices are then monitored so that information about the financial platforms used by the user could be attained, and login credentials on these forums, banking details, and credit card information are obtained.When the infected link is clicked upon by the victim, they would be redirected to the compromised websites while a malicious JavaScript code will get executed sneakily in the background. The code will then forward a list of websites to the victim until a website containing downloadable MS Word document appears, hinting on the fact that cybercriminals have used the \u201c302 cushioning\u201d technique to lure users into downloading this document.Afterwards, the user is prompted to either Open or Save this file; when it is opened the document requests the victim to click on Enable Content and Enable Editing, which leads to execution of malicious macros. These macros then download and execute a PE32 executable to infect the whole system.The malicious payload used in this campaign seems to be a new variant of Zeus Panda, which can steal banking and similar sensitive data. This is a multi-stage payload featuring various anti-analysis tactics to avoid detection. It also displays various evasion techniques to make sure that the malware doesn\u2019t get executed in sandboxes or analysis environments.To stay protected, Talos researchers recommend that users need to implement layered defenses and to remain alert and be cautious while clicking on any link, attachment or Google search results.", "topics": ["Banking", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Microsoft", "Scam", "security", "Technology", "TROJAN", "Zeus"], "title": "Google Search Results Exploited to Distribute Zeus Panda Banking Trojan", "date": "November 4, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Tor is a unique web browser because it lets users surf the web while keeping their real IP address hidden. It has lately become quite popular among users who are privacy conscious and prefer to use the web anonymously. However, if you are accessing Tor via Mac or Linux machine, then you need to be concerned because a serious vulnerability has been discovered that can compromise your anonymity.We Are Segment security firm\u2019s CEO Filippo Cavallarin has managed to identify a critical vulnerability in Tor Browser, dubbed as TorMoil. The flaw is so critical that it leaks the original IP address of Tor users.More: How to Install TOR on Android and iOS DevicesAccording to reports, a Firefox bug that handles file:// URLs is responsible for compromising the security of Mac and Linux users while surprisingly it doesn\u2019t affect Windows users. What happens is that when a user clicks on a specially developed file:// link, he/she is redirected to a webpage for creating a direct link between the computer and remote host after bypassing the security of Tor browser.The Tor Project, the team behind Tor browser, was notified about the issue on October 26th by Cavallarin after which they collaborated with Mozilla engineers to create a temporary fix, and the leak was fixed partially. Later an update was released on October 31st that the team claims will fix all the \u201choles,\u201d but it is not yet clear whether the flaw has already been exploited on the internet or dark web. As per the post from Tor Project, the fix is a \u201cworkaround\u201d to stop the leak.\u201cThe fix we deployed is just a workaround stopping the leak. As a result of that navigating file:// URLs in the browser might not work as expected anymore. In particular entering file:// URLs in the URL bar and clicking on resulting links is broken. Opening those in a new tab or new window does not work either. A workaround for those issues is dragging the link into the URL bar or on a tab instead. We track this follow-up regression in bug 24136\u201d read the post from Tor Project.Users on Linux and Mac machines are advised to update Tor browser software (if they are using Tor) with version 7.0.9 immediately to prevent leaking of their real IP address. Tor officials have warned that the fix will not work on alpha versions of Tor browser, but a patch will be made available for these versions on Monday. In the meantime, users of alpha versions should switch to stable versions of the browser, which have been updated.It is although speculated that the flaw hadn\u2019t been exploited so far but the lack of evidence doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that stalker, private investigators and law enforcement officials haven\u2019t exploited it. Now that a fix has been released, threat actors would direct all their efforts towards the creation of working exploits.

The hackers responsible for launching Silence start their malicious operation by firstly compromising some of the machines at their targeted firm. The methods with which the hackers compromise the machines is yet unknown. The objective is to gain access to employee email accounts.The second step is to exploit the compromised accounts to send phishing emails to other employees. Thus, a multi-stage attack is launched.

According to the findings of Kaspersky Labs, which discovered the Trojan, mainstream cryptocurrencies including Dash, Monero, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Zcash, etc., have been targeted by attackers so far using CryptoShuffler and hackers have stolen $150,000 (\u00a3113,250) worth of Bitcoins.The Trojan attacks cryptocurrency wallets by modifying the original, legitimate address of the user with its own on the clipboard of the targeted device. As per the researchers at Kaspersky Lab, attacks that involve hijacking of clipboards are not unheard of as there are instances where attackers targeted online payment systems with this method but cases involving hijacking of cryptocurrency host address are quite rare.More: How SS7 Flaw Can Be Used to Hack Gmail ID and Bitcoin Wallet\u201cThe malware described is a perfect example of a \u2018rational\u2019 gain. The scheme of its operation is simple and effective: no access to pools, no network interaction, and no suspicious processor load,\u201d noted malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, Sergey Yunakovsky.Researchers also noted that the mechanism of CryptoShuffler is quite straightforward where user\u2019s walled ID number which is widely used in transaction process by copy-pasting it as the Destination Address in the transaction software that is being used, is replaced with the one sent by the malware creator. All the Trojan has to do is monitor the clipboard to do the modification.What happens later is that the wallet ID that user enters in the Destination Address line is not the original one and the money is transferred to the attacker. The entire process is completed within milliseconds since searching for wallet addresses is quite easy; most cryptocurrency wallet addresses bear similar beginning and an identifiable number of characters.\u201cIntruders can easily create regular codes to replace them,\u201d wrote the researchers.CryptoShuffler has been around since 2016 when it attacked Bitcoin wallet while the latest campaign was discovered in June 2017.

Issue Tracker program is to be used by external public and partner users who work with Google\u2019s team on different projects. This program gives access control permissions to users so that they could find, create, view and modify issues for any project.The researcher Alex Birsan discovered that the Issue Tracker had several vulnerabilities out of which the most critical was the one allowing him to access the company\u2019s internal systems, which were quite sensitive. If this particular vulnerability is exploited, anyone can spy upon Google and access every single vulnerability report sent to Google by users. It would be quite difficult for Google to detect that someone is spying on them.Researcher Identifies Bugs in Google\u2019 Bug Tracker Program and Receives Cash as RewardIn a detailed blog post, Birsan explained how he identified the bugs in Issue Tracker. He wrote that by examining the way Issue Tracker handled the communication about a bug he reported, he became suspicious and the further probe revealed that he needed an @google.com email ID for accessing the internal bug database. The address although was useless at the gate but provided him access to other areas and even let him explore Google\u2019s GRide corporate car service.Then he used a standard method to check the bugs closely, which was that he found bugs in the tracker so that it notifies him about the progress of the software, but it was identified that the software worked only on \u201ctranslation related conversations.\u201dAfterwards, Birsan tested the API of Issue Tracker and managed to find a way to receive all details about a bug by requesting it to remove an email ID from an issue thread.It is worth noting that Google has patched the bugs identified by Birsan and that\u2019s why it is not possible that someone could exploit them.

Lately, there have been quite a few incidents where malicious extensions were used to spread malware. Cybercriminals are not leaving any stone unturned into hijacking add-ons from popular browsers such as Google Chrome to fulfill their nasty objectives.According to Morphus Labs\u2019 chief officer Renato Marinho, another Google Chrome extension has been hijacked and being distributed to unsuspecting users via phishing emails. The malware can obtain all the information that is posted online by the user without going through extensive procedures.This means, there is no need to click on an infected link, get login credentials or download apps and files to get the system compromised, which shows that hackers are constantly improvising their attack tactics. That\u2019s why the malware has been named as Catch-All malware.A phishing email containing links to pictures from a weekend event having a subject line in the Portuguese language serves as the infection vector of this campaign. The message reads:\u201cSegue as (Fotos Final de Semana) Enviadas via WhatsApp (30244)\u2026.

This file is 9.5 Mb zip-compressed and required uncompressing. When it is uncompressed, two large files of around 200 MB are released.Catch-All Malware Steals All Posted Data without Using Malicious URLs or Login CredentialsWhen md0 file is executed, it disables Windows Firewall and kills all the processes of Google Chrome to install the malicious Catch-All extension written in JavaScript. When this is achieved, it extracts the extension and modifies Chrome launcher\u2019s \u201c.Ink\u201d files to load it when the next time it is executed. All the data posted by the victim on any website is hijacked by the extension and sent to a C&C server through jQuery and Ajax connections.The malware inserts the following content on the Google Chrome link file:\u201cC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\u201d \u2013disable-extensions-file-access-check \u2013always-authorize-plugins \u2013disable-improved-download-protection \u2013load-extension=\u201dC:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\complemento\\E1EDEAE8EFE3E0EEE0DC2610495.\u201d Apart from loading the extension, it also disables key security features on the device to evade detection so that the infected extension is allowed to perform its functions easily.According to Marinho, this campaign seems to be restricted to Portuguese speaking countries including Brazil currently, because not only the message is written in Portuguese but some of the features such as directory names found in compromised computers hints that the malware attacks started in Brazil. Marinho also noted that this is an ongoing campaign that is bound to claim more victims. He further stated that browser security measures such as TLS or SSL cannot protect victims because the extension catches the data in clear text format from within the browser before sending it via an HTTPS connection.Source: SANS", "topics": ["Browser", "Chrome", "Google", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Malware", "Phishing", "Privacy", "Scam", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Malicious Chrome Extension Steals \u2018All Posted Data\u2019 without Login Credentials", "date": "October 31, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "A new algorithm called unCAPTCHA has been developed by researchers from the University of Maryland.

Now, security consulting firm IOActive\u2019s researchers have discovered that there are several vulnerabilities present in the platforms used by seaborne ships to access the internet. The bugs in the software can leak data from the sea and also can cause larger threats to the global maritime infrastructure.In its report, IOActive explained about the two identified flaws in the AmosConnect 8 web platform, developed by Stratos Global to work in combination with satellite equipment. This particular platform is used by ships to track IT and navigation systems as well as to facilitate messaging, web browsing and emailing for on-board crew members.The flaws are not readily accessible but can allow in-depth access to the systems of the ship. The attacker can easily get access to ship\u2019s network using a compromised mobile device that is present on the ship or maybe the function could be performed by an infected USB drive that might be brought onboard to exchange data with ports or attackers can get physical access too.The first of the two flaws are identified in the login form of the platform where a blind SQL Injection vulnerability is present; it lets the attacker access the database where software\u2019s credentials are stored and obtain sensitive data like username and password. It is worth noting that AmosConnect 8 saves the credentials in pairs and in plaintext format, which means that attacker may not even need to crack encryption scheme to get desired data.\u201cThe server stores usernames and passwords in plaintext, making this vulnerability trivial to exploit.The parameter data [MailUser][emailAddress] is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection, enabling data retrieval from the backend SQLite database using time-based attacks,\u201d read IOActive\u2019s blog post.The second flaw identified by IOActive researchers is that the server contains a built-in backdoor account that offers full system privileges. This particular flaw would let attackers execute commands while enjoying system privileges on the remote system through merely compromising Task Manager of AmosConnect.If AmosConnecy products are compromised, it would be devastating for maritime institutions because extensive operational data would be exposed while other critical systems will be undermined. Ultimately the vulnerabilities will help an attacker in completely hijacking a communications server.\u201cAll in all, these vulnerabilities pose a serious security risk. Attackers might be able to obtain corporate data, take over the server to mount further attacks or pivot within the vessel networks.\u201dIOActive\u2019s principal security consultant Mario Ballano referred to the flaws as \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d because the software used by the ships nowadays is around 10 to 15 years old.

Although the situation is not as worse as that faced by Android users, the IT security community is witnessing a rapid increase in cyber attacks against Apple users as well as discovering of security flaws.Recently, a Google engineer Felix Krause discovered that any rogue app on iPhone could use the device\u2019s camera to spy on the user secretly. It can do it by abusing the permission by default and use both front and rear cameras for malicious purposes.To prove his point, Krause developed a fake social media app that would take pictures of the user after every few seconds and upload them on the site \u2013 All that without the permission or knowledge of the user. The reason for demonstrating the issue was to highlight \u201cprivacy loophole that can be abused by iOS apps.\u201dOn iPhone, permissions work in a way that once a user allows an app to take photos, they must grant that app full camera access which can be turned off once the app is done taking pictures. However, Krause discovered that once granted permission, an app can record videos and take photos whenever it is turned on even when the permission is taken back.The issue with smartphones including iPhone is that their cameras don\u2019t indicate if they are being used or turned on unlike in laptops in which a small silver light or small green light in case of Mac computers indicate users that their camera is being used. Therefore, there is no indication in smartphones whether their camera is taking photos or recording videos.However, this is not a security flaw. It\u2019s a system that Apple developed, and it works the way it was designed, but Krause\u2019s findings highlight the system is somehow flawed and poses a privacy threat to iPhone users. Remember, in an Interview, Edward Snowden once told John Oliver that National Security Agency (NSA) could secretly spy on users through their smartphones and even collect personal photos from a targeted device.Krause suggests that Apple should come up with a system that would alert or notify users whenever their camera is being used by them or a third-party app without their permission. A Macbook like green light indicator along with a push notification will do the job.

When a user leaves any of these devices switched on or off, cybercriminals get the perfect opportunity to convert them into real-time spying devices.To prove their point, Check Point researchers demonstrated how a hacker could turn LG Hom-Bot vacuum cleaner into an espionage gadget.

Previously, the ETERNALBLUE exploit was used in the WannaCry ransomware campaign in May 2017, and the very next month ETERNALBLUE and ETERNALROMANCE exploits were used in the NotPetya ransomware campaign. It is worth noting that a hacker group The Shadow Brokers is responsible for making NSA\u2019s exploits public.As per latest revelations made by Cisco Talos and F-Secure, ETERNALROMANCE code is identified inside Bad Rabbit ransomware. This is contrary to initial reports, which suggested that instead of any NSA exploit, the Mimikatz exploit was used to infect a computer and dump its passwords from memory using hard-coded credentials. However, the continued investigation revealed that ETERNAL ROMANCE exploit is used in this campaign. This particular tool also used SMB protocol for its distribution, and since its modified version was used in the Bad Rabbit ransomware, therefore, security experts could not identify it immediately.\u201cIt is very similar to the publicly available Python implementation of the EternalRomance exploit that is also exploited by [NotPetya. However, the BadRabbit [EternalRomance] exploit implementation is different than the one in [NotPetya], although it is still largely based on the EternalRomance exploit published in the ShadowBrokers leak,\u201d noted Cisco Talos researchers.These findings have been confirmed by F-Secure researchers as well while it is also identified that Bad Rabbit and NotPetya both were developed by the same authors because their core codebase and build toolchain are similar. Both also use the commercial DiskCryptor code for encrypting the hard drive while Wiper code removes the drives on the victim\u2019s computer.The BadRabbit campaign was identified by security researchers at Kaspersky Labs on October 24th. In a detailed blog post, Orkhan Mamedov, Fedor Sinitsyn, and Anton Ivanov wrote that Bad Rabbit is distributed through drive-by download attacks and utilizes fake Adobe Flash players installers to trap victims into installing malware.\u201cWhile the severity of this attack is still unknown as the attack is still spreading, the level of systems being targeted is cause for concern. Whenever critical infrastructure is hit, it is a stark reminder of why cybersecurity needs to be a top concern for both private and public institutions around the world. In this case, a simple \u2018fake Flash update\u2019 is the culprit, reinforcing the need for all employees to be hyperaware of what sites they are visiting and what links they are clicking.

The phishing notifications use the original icon of the application they try to impersonate. In addition, the phone is made to vibrate right before the notification is shown so the victim will take notice of it. When the notification is tapped it will trigger an overlay attack,\u201d SfyLabs researchers said in a blog post.Currently, LokiBot is targeting Android devices running on version 4.0 or later but its capability of stealing data is not limited to apps mentioned above. LokiBot can also steal contact details from a targeted devices, read and send SMS messages, spread itself by spamming the contact list, send victim\u2019s browser history to command and control center and most importantly, its capable of turning itself into ransomware if the victim decides to remove the malware.

The ransomware note threatens victims that their \u201cphone is locked for viewing child pornography\u201d and displays links to websites from where the payment can be sent to cybercriminals.Researchers also noticed that the BTC addresses provided by cybercriminals to send the ransom payments already had transactions worth 1.5 million dollars in BTC. However, it is very unlikely that the actors behind this malware have gained this amount of money using only LokiBot.Android users are urged not to download third-party apps or unnecessary apps on their device.

This particular news is about another widespread ransomware campaign that is affecting users around Europe, and about 200 mainstream organizations have already become victims of the attack.The ransomware, named as Bad Rabbit, is spreading like wildfire and has targeted corporate networks in Russia, Germany, Ukraine, and Turkey mainly. Organizations that have been targeted so far include Kiev Metro payment systems, Interfax and Fontanka (Russian news agencies), Odessa International Airport and the Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Infrastructure.This is a Petya type ransomware that has launched targeted attacks in the past few hours. After successfully compromising the system and encrypting the data, attackers demand 0.05 bitcoin, approx. $285 as ransom to hand over decryption key.The campaign was identified by security researchers at Kaspersky Labs on October 24th. In a detailed blog post, Orkhan Mamedov, Fedor Sinitsyn, and Anton Ivanov wrote that Bad Rabbit is distributed through drive-by download attacks and utilizes fake Adobe Flash players installers to trap victims into installing malware. Bad Rabbit belongs to a relatively new and unknown ransomware family, and its target is achieved without using any exploit. The victim is required to manually execute the ransomware dropper, which is downloaded from the attacker\u2019s infrastructure at hxxp://1dnscontrol[.]com/flash_install.php.The file downloaded is named install_flash_player.exe. The victim manually launches this file but to operate properly; it requires high-level administrative privileges that are obtained through the standard UAC prompt. When initiated, the file stores the malicious DLL at this location in the computer: C:\\Windows\\infpub.dat. It is then launched through rundll32 command.Various compromised websites were identified by Kaspersky researchers, all of which were news and media related sites. The original vector attack was detected in the morning of October 24th, and the attack lasted until midday, but it is an ongoing and active campaign, which is being monitored by Kaspersky researchers. According to their findings, victims are redirected to malware web sources located at authentic and legitimate websites.ESET security researchers discovered Bad Rabbit malware as another variant of Petya (also known as NotPetya, GoldenEye, Petrwrap, and exPetr) ransomware ,\u2019Win32/Diskcoder.D\u2019. Diskcryptor, which is an open-source full drive encryption software, is used by Bad Rabbit to perform data encryption on infected computers using RSA 2048 keys. According to ESET researchers, this new campaign does not use EternalBlue exploit but scans the internal network to open SMB (Server Message Block) shares and then uses a hardcoded list of common credentials to drop malware. It also utilizes Mimikatz post-exploitation tool to obtain credentials from infected systems.Once compromised, the attackers force victims to log into a Tor onion website to pay the ransom within 40 hours, as depicted in the ransom note below:Amit Serper, a security researcher, and malware analyst came up with a \u201cVaccination for Bad Rabbit\u201d and as confirmed by other security researchers it really works.

According to their findings, FIN7 is exploiting victims in the retail industry using various phishing techniques and continuously adapting phishing documents to evade detection.After compromising the Point of Sale systems of the targeted company, it steals a massive amount of protected card data. FIN7 is extremely flexible when it comes to adaptability and manages to avoid detection along with affecting a large number of retail companies across the US.In August 2017, ICEBERG published the set of IOCs/indicators of compromise for the infected document payloads. These payloads depicted similar characteristics and techniques of infection. However, recent reports from ICEBERG suggest that there is a change noticed in the techniques and presence of a modified payload, which uses a newer type of embedded file type.Moreover, FIN7 has changed the obfuscation that was used by the HALFBAKED backdoor to avoid detection in upcoming campaigns. In previous versions of the infection documents, the actor utilizes visual basic scripts called VBE or VBS and malicious shortcut files/LNK to carry out code execution. The malicious files are embedded into the infection documents through Object Linking and Embedding/OLE framework within the Windows setup. OLE framework is used to merge two objects from different applications.It is noted in a blog post by ICEBERG that the malicious documents observed recently don\u2019t reflect a different or new attach mechanism while the changed payload can cause detection issues for legacy signatures and heuristic detections. Also, FIN7 has pivoted from using OLE embedded LNK files, which is evident from the new set of documents released by ICEBERG.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Now, it utilizes the OLE embedded CMD files that write JScript to \u201ctt.txt\u201d after the execution, and the script is written to the home directory. The batch script is then copied into \u201cpp.txt, \u201d and it is also written in the home directory of the current user before running WScript. The JScript code will read from the pp.txt file while it will skip the initial four lines of the code but will evaluate everything after the first character of every single line in the file.CMD and LNK file formats both perform code execution in the end but the shifting to CMD file indicates that the attackers are trying every trick up their sleeve to evade detection. In the previous version, there were various stages of HALFBAKED as its codebase used base4 encoding, which was saved in a string array present in srcTxt. Now the attacker is obfuscating the name, and the base64 string is broken into multiple strings within the same array.The getNK2 command, which is named after NK2 file of Outlook, comprises a list of auto-complete addresses belonging to Microsoft Outlook 2007 and 2010 versions. Since new versions of MS Outlook don\u2019t use the NK2 file, therefore, FIN7 has changed its functionality to control latest versions of Outlook within the same getNK2 command to execute the JScript function.Michael Gorelik, VP of R&D, Morphisec, told HackRead that \u201cThe latest Fin7 campaign adds functionality to burrow deeper in the victim\u2019s network by taking over some of the Outlook information. As usual, they also modified every significant tracked component in their attack chain. The group is clearly well organized with experts in every domain since the modifications of different components require different specialties. Once again FIN7 proves that evading behavior and static pattern-based security solution comes more easily than security providers would like to admit. Their rapid ability to modify old techniques and innovate new ones is alarming and other groups are likely taking notes. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these kinds of attack strategies and techniques soon become commonplace. Until we change our approach to security, move towards prevention without reliance on known patterns, like Morphisec\u2019s Moving Target Defense approach, security vendors and their customers will always be playing catch up.\u201dMorphisec\u2019s previous coverage on FIN7 is available here.

Using Reddit handle Poloniex2FASucks the researcher revealed that he waited for 60 days for the company to respond and fix the issue but ultimately sold the vulnerability.According to a blog post by Lukas Stefanko of ESET Security firm, Poloniex users are being targeted by two fake credit stealing applications that appear to be legitimate Poloniex Android apps. These apps are available on an authentic and reliable platform like Google Play Store and are capable of not only stealing the victim\u2019s Poloniex website login credentials but also end up accessing the Gmail accounts of the victim, which are then hijacked by the attackers.It is worth noting that there is no official mobile app launched by Poloniex yet and this is the very aspect that is being exploited successfully by cybercriminals. Given the high profile nature of Poloniex, as it is world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange service, it comes as no surprise that cybercriminals have set their eyes on this particular organization.The first of the two malicious apps is called POLONIEX. It is available for download on Google Play and published by a developer named Poloniex. Despite the bad reviews and low ratings of the app, it was downloaded and installed by more than 5000 users between 28 August and 19 September 2017.Another fake app is called POLONOEX EXCHANGE. It is published by a developer named POLONIEX COMPANY. It was uploaded on Google Play on October 15, 2017, and within just a week it has been installed by 500 users. After ESET notified Google about the malicious nature of the app, this was removed from the store.To hijack Gmail accounts and obtain Poloniex credentials of unsuspecting users, these apps use the same method. As soon as the app is launched after installation, it displays a fake Poloniex message box asking for login credentials. When the victim enters the credentials and clicks on Sign In, the attacker receives the credentials. This method is successful when the user hasn\u2019t enabled 2FA on the Poloniex account.When attackers get the credentials, and 2FA is not enabled, then they can easily access the account and perform transactions on behalf of the user. They can also change account settings and change the password to lock the account. Afterwards, attackers try to gain control of Gmail account of the victim. The user is sent a message that appears to be sent by Google.In the message, the user is asked to enter Gmail account login details to complete the Two-Step Security Check. When the user clicks on Sign In, the app requests for permission for accessing the email messages and settings as well as explore basic profile. If the permission is granted the app successfully accesses the inbox.After accessing the Poloniex account and the Gmail account linked with the exchange service, the attackers manage to make transactions through the hijacked account and remove all signs of unauthorized access and transactions from the inbox. Lastly, the app requests the user to download the mobile version of the authentic Poloniex website and then the user is asked to sign in.On the other hand, if 2FA is enabled then the account will remain protected from being hijacked because now Poloniex is providing 2FA through Google Authenticator which involves generation of random login keys that are sent to the users as a text message, voice call or through the Google Authentication app. Attackers cannot access any of these.To ensure that you stay safe from the malicious apps then change your Poloniex and Gmail account passwords as soon as possible and if you have installed any of these fake apps, delete them immediately. Also, enable 2FA authentication for both services.Also, make sure that the service you are using does have a mobile app and only download the mobile app from the official website of the service. Moreover, never ignore user ratings and reviews about a particular app and install a reliable mobile security product.

The haunting memories are brought back to our attention with the emergence of malware that is trying to perform similar acts.A new malware has been identified by security researchers at CheckPoint. According to their research, the malware, dubbed as IOTroop or Reaper can target and hijack IoT devices including routers, webcams, and DVRs. The malware has been affecting devices across the globe. The objective behind this campaign seems to be the creation of a massive army of botnets to disrupt the internet service. It is worth noting that the malware mainly targets devices that are poorly secured but the rate at which it is infecting the devices. This malware is quite similar to Mirai regarding malware code, the scope of attack and devastation. However, it is a completely new campaign and has nothing to do with Mirai.\u201cThis has the potential to be more damaging than Mirai. The most interesting difference between this malware and Mirai is that it is far more sophisticated. Attackers are not just exploiting default credentials to compromise devices, but also using a dozen or more vulnerabilities to get on these devices,\u201d said Horowitz.The malicious code was discovered by CheckPoint researcher last month, and so far it has managed to infect \u201chundreds of thousands of devices,\u201d revealed Check Point\u2019s threat intelligence group manager Maya Horowitz. Horowitz also notes that there is one vulnerable device present at nearly 60% of corporate networks. The malware is attacking a majority of devices manufactured by Linksys, D-Link, TP-Link, Netgear, Synology, Avtech, MikroTik and GoAhead. Some of these manufacturers have released patches to fix the vulnerabilities in their devices.Preliminary research revealed that more than a million organizations across the world including the US and Australia had been affected. Moreover, researchers have identified various command-and-control servers that are being used by perpetrators of this campaign. The cybercriminals behind IoTrooper are continually updating the code with a broad range of IP addresses as well while every infected device gets a range of IP addresses. These addresses help in scanning the vulnerable devices.According to Horowitz, the malware is self-propagating and doesn\u2019t communicate much with its command-and-control server. It is believed that the quick amassing of botnets is probably the preparation of a massive DDoS attack, however, until now the malware hasn\u2019t launched a DDoS attack. Who has launched this new malware campaign, it is yet unknown, but Horowitz noted that the tools required to create this sort of malware are easily available online and the code of Mirai was also leaked online in 2016.\u201cWe are still studying the malware and reverse engineering it to understand better how it works. While we don\u2019t have the completed answers, we do know that the infected devices get a range of IP addresses that the malware is instructed to check for vulnerabilities. And then the IPs of the vulnerable devices are sent back to the C2,\u201d stated Horowitz.Qihoo 360 researchers also identified Reaper, and according to their estimates, it has affected nearly 2 million devices. They stated that Reaper is different from Mirai since it does not rely on cracking the default password but targets publicly known vulnerabilities in commonly used IoT devices.Unlike Mirai, which relies on cracking the default password to gain access to the device, Reaper has been found targeting around a dozen different vulnerabilities found in products from D-Link, Netgear, Linksys, and others.

It is also possible to add new folders to this list, but it is not possible to modify the location of the folders in the Library or move them from one folder to another once these have been added to the protected list. If this is done, then the folder will not be protected by CFA anymore.To enable CFA simply open Windows Defender Security Center and follow this sequence: Open>Virus & Threat Protection>Controlled Folder Access.

The most probable option is to block them automatically since the sites aggressively use CPU resources, which is not acceptable to Google.It is also noted by Vafai that Google is working on a feature which, if a website uses CPU resources for a predetermined timespan or percentage then the page will go into Battery Saver Mode and the user will be asked to manually opt out of this mode while when the battery saver mode runs in the background the tasks will be stopped entirely.\u201cI think we\u2019ll want measurement to figure out what values to use for XX and YY, but we can start with really egregious things like 100% and 60 seconds,\u201d stated Vafai.The in-browser blocking feature is still in the process of development, but given the way cybercriminals and web operators using the cryptocurrency miners, we can expect a solution soon enough.As mentioned above there are more than 500 websites secretly mining cryptocurrency using CPU of their visitors.
