[{"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Gamers were delighted with the release of world\u2019s second most popular video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) released by Rockstar North. It was in every way a modder\u2019s dream as while playing the game it allowed gamers to change the base game to a great extent. However, with the high profile and extreme popularity of the game, cybercriminals were bound to identify ways of exploiting and benefitting from it. And, cryptocurrency mining being the latest fad among hackers is the primary mode of exploitation of GTA 5.According to researchers, a mod maker going by the online handle of \u2018Anton\u2019 is reportedly distributing malware into the GTA 5 mods. The young, Russian speaking cybercriminal is apparently trying to hijack the computer power secretly to mine cryptocurrency. The mod maker of GTA 5 was discovered by researchers at Minerva Labs, a cybersecurity firm.As per their findings, the Arbuz GTA 5 mod was utilized as the source of distribution of malware whereas Anton was found to be using malware WaterMiner for mining cryptocurrency. WaterMiner is a modified version of the authentic open-source XMRig miner. Through the malware, Anton successfully harvests Monero coins. All this is done without alarming the mod user.Arbuz means watermelon in the Russian language that\u2019s why researchers call have labeled the malware as WaterMiner. The malware is capable of evading all sorts of detection tools and also can hide from being identified by the Windows Task Manager tool or other monitoring services that are meant to keep tabs on computer resources. In case WaterMiner identifies that a computer monitoring tool is trying to detect it, the malware instantly aborts the process and shuts down mining after which it goes into hibernation.A developer using the alias Martin 0pc0d3r is responsible for creating WaterMiner. Researchers were able to locate the developer because the developer has implemented poor track covering measures. It was due to the same careless attitude that researchers could trace Anton. The aim of Anton was to capitalize on the in-demand games in Russia and that\u2019s why he hid the malware in the fiercely popular GTA 5 game. We suggest that you be cautious while installing mods and the platforms from where you download them in order to stay protected.Anton, for your information, has become quite popular with his Twitter rants where he claims to have the immense hacking expertise and boasts about his experience as a hacker. The researchers noted that \u201cIt is clear that we are not dealing with an experienced cybercriminal.\u201dMinerva researchers are expecting more fireworks from Anton, and other hackers as the trend of employing malware based miners gain momentum. \u201cIt seems that Monero also attracts resourceful individuals who are not the classic attackers we might imagine as criminal masterminds, just like Alaska lured many unskilled miners during the gold rush,\u201d stated the researchers at Minerva.In a tweet, FiveM, a modification framework for GTA V said that they had issued a security update just to stop users from adding miners to their code. But it looks like things are already out of control.A minor FiveM update has been released with some small fixes, and blocking of 'coinhive' mining services. Thanks for the reports!\u2014 FiveM (@_FiveM) October 1, 2017The trend of using Cryptocurrency minors is at peak. It was The Pirate Bay that was caught secretly using Coin Hive\u2019s script to mine Monero digital coins.

Reportedly, there are a number of Minecraft oriented Android apps available on Google Play Store that are infecting devices and turning them into botnets.According to research conducted by Symantec\u2019 cybersecurity researchers, eight apps on Google Play Store are infected with an embedded malicious Trojan called Sockbot. The installation scope of this particular malware campaign is quite wide-ranged with approx. 600,000 to 2.6 million devices targeted so far. The apps initially posed as add-ons for Minecraft: Pocket Edition game to get posted at Google Play Android app store.However, these are not official Minecraft game apps but only providing skins for changing the appearance of characters in the game. The apps have been designed to generate ad revenue through illegal ways. One of these eight apps was found to be communicating with a command and control server (C&C) for instructions to open a socket using SOCKS before creating a link with the targeted server. The C&C server provided a list of metadata and ads to promote ad requests. But in reality, the app is not meant to display ads but to compromise mobile devices for nefarious purposes.After being installed on a device, the app asks for a range of permissions including displaying of alerts, accessing GPS data, open network connections, access Wi-Fi service and acquire read and write privilege on external storage devices.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Sockbot malware creates a SOCKS proxy to ensure generation of ad revenue and making the device a botnet. According to Symantec, the proxy topology is \u201chighly flexible\u201d as it can easily be extended to benefit from vulnerabilities of networks and also effectively span security parameters. Apart from executing \u201carbitrary network attacks,\u201d the wide-ranging scope of this infection can be utilized to launch a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack.A developer using the alias FunBaster is identified to be linked with the malicious apps. It is noted that the developer signs every app with a unique developer key and has ensured that the coding of the app is obfuscated while the key string is also encrypted. If the code could be decrypted, it would be clear how the apps have managed to thwart security processes of Google to get posted on the Play Store.A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more botsGoogle was notified of the presence of malicious apps on its Store by Symantec on October 6th after which the company removed them. However, there are tons of other malware-infected apps on Google Play Store that might trick Android users, therefore, avoid downloading unnecessary apps and use anti-virus software.

However, sending your sensitive information out into the ether comes with a certain amount of risk, especially now cyber attacks are happening so frequently. Cyber resilience is essential for any business, and it makes sense to minimize the likelihood of a breach happening in the first place. Unfortunately, no company is ever entirely protected from hackers, so what should you do if the worst has already happened? Here are five steps to take in the wake of a cyber attack.It\u2019s tempting to shut down after a data breach, but it\u2019s important to be proactive to minimize the damage. Make sure you\u2019re communicating properly with your staff, tech specialists, and clients, and be open and sincere about what happened. Provide details if you think they are necessary, and explain how each party will be impacted by what happened. Be sure to take responsibility, even if the attack was the fault of your IT provider rather than your company. To understand why a cyber attack happened, you may need to call in an engineer who can analyze your computer\u2019s forensics and traffics to find the root of the problem. This process might include data capture, network recording, search and inspection and reporting. At the end of the process, your network vulnerabilities will be investigated and reviewed to prevent future attacks. Rather than relying on firewalls, your business should look to create a multi-layered security model that will limit the pathways for malware and make it difficult for hackers to obtain sensitive data. This step is essential now that cyber attacks are so rife.It\u2019s advisable at this point to bring in an unbiased third-party IT professional so you can discover exactly where your current provider let you down and what caused the data breach. By doing this, you will come to understand the specifics of what happened and prevent another attack happening in the future.Due to the complexity of digital data, many businesses outsource to companies who have specialized knowledge in that field. For instance, after a cyber attack, you should try to reinstate all aspects of your IT. This means everything from securing your data to finding a company who can upgrade your storage capacity. For the latter, as an example, you need to ensure you hire the services of a trusted memory distributor such as those at www.offtek.co.uk. After a cyber attack, you will need to look into the elevation of all aspects of your company, no matter how small or unrelated they may seem. Recovering from a cyber attack is not a comfortable process, but it\u2019s something almost all businesses will face. Even high-profile companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail have dealt with severe security breaches, so no one is infallible. What matters most is how you respond to the incident, and that your clients know you\u2019re taking all the right steps to prevent future attacks.", "topics": ["breach", "Business", "Cyber Attack", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Post Cyberattack: The Next Steps Your Business Needs to Take", "date": "October 19, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "A few days back we informed you about the findings of Kaspersky Lab form May 2017 where the security firm identified that a particular kind of ATM malware called ATMii was targeting certain ATMs. The malware kit was designed to steal cash from ATMs using a vendor-oriented API. A post advertising the malware was also discovered by the security firm.As per the latest report from Kaspersky Lab, cybercriminals are busy in advertising about another but similar malware on the Dark Web. They are describing it as capable of exploiting both hardware and software weaknesses of the ATMs and empty them by taking out all the cash. One of the ads was posted on the AlphaBay Darknet marketplace, which was later taken down by the FBI.On this particular post, the seller provided a list of required equipment, detailed manuals, ATM models that it could efficiently target and useful tips on operating the malware. The kit was up for sale for $5,000. Buyers were informed that the malware could help them steal all the money from the infected ATMs without bothering about accessing individual accounts or stealing data of ATM cardholders.The malware, dubbed as Cutlet Maker, needs to be stored on a flash drive and the drive should be plugged into a USB port after which the malware is executed. The toolkit also contained a password generator that was called c0decalc. This was capable of cracking the system, and after that, a simulator would scan ATM cassettes for funds and create a fake transaction so that the ATM could be forced to dispense money.According to Kaspersky researchers, the functionality of Cutlet Maker malware reveals that two people are surely involved in the scheme, the Drop, and the Drop Master.\u201cAccess to the dispensing mechanism of Cutlet Maker is password protected. Though there could be just one person with the c0decalc application needed to generate a password. Either network or physical access to an ATM is required to enter the code in the application text area and also to interact with the user interface,\u201d explained Kaspersky.It is quite worrying that the scope of cyber attacks has now expanded so much that even ATMs are not safe anymore. In recent years, we have seen quite a few campaigns targeted to steal cash from specific ATMs. The most obvious reason why these machines have suddenly become eye-candies of cybercriminals is that these still run on out-dated OS such as Windows XP.", "topics": ["ATM", "Cyber Crime", "dark web", "Fraud", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Malware", "Money", "Scam", "security", "Technology"], "title": "You can now buy ATM malware on Dark Web for $5000", "date": "October 18, 2017"}, {"authur": "Carolina", "body": "With smartwatches designed especially for kids being available now, parents are enjoying full peace of mind as they know that they are connected to their kids via dedicated, secure apps at all times. These wearable devices that cost no more than \u00a3100 are being deemed as a blessing, however, reports suggest that some of these smartwatches are prone to hacking, which means your kids might be in danger because a stranger can easily track your kids\u2019 whereabouts and also spy on their conversations. The reason is that there are very serious security flaws identified in a number of smartwatches.According to a new report from the consumer watchdog Norwegian Consumer Council (NCC), kids\u2019 smartwatches aren\u2019t immune from being hacked. The NCC researched kids\u2019 smartwatches in collaboration with Mnemonic.After carrying out tests on four smartwatches that are specifically designed for kids and are equipped with real-time location tracking and facilitate two-way calls with some selected contacts, it was identified that hackers could exploit the security flaws. Hackers can play with the location tracking feature making parents think that kids are somewhere else. The smartwatches tested for this purpose include the following models: Gator 2, Tinitell, Viksfjord and Xplora smartwatches.Since these smartwatches can store and transmit data without encrypting it, therefore, the possibility of being exploited is even more concerning. The NCC also discovered that the SOS function in Gator\u2019s smartwatch was poorly implemented while the alerts that were transmitted by these models after the kid left a permitted location were unreliable. It is worth noting that the SOS feature allows kids to contact their parents when required instantly and the alarm goes off when the kid leaves an area without parents\u2019 permission.Another serious flaw identified in these smartwatches was that the stored data, which was not appropriately encrypted, could not be deleted at all. The only smartwatch with no security vulnerability and possible risk for kids was the Tinitell. However, this was also the only watch that offered limited features in comparison to the other three.NCC\u2019s Finn Myrstad stated that: \u201cIt\u2019s very serious when products that claim to make children safer instead put them at risk because of poor security and features that do not work properly. Importers and retailers must know what they stock and sell. These watches have no place on a shop\u2019s shelf, let alone on a child\u2019s wrist.\u201dIn response to the findings of NCC, companies have started giving out official statements. Gator stated that it has now improved security measures of its smartwatch by moving the data to an encrypted server. This most likely would prevent it from being hacked. Viksfjord watch manufacturer GPSforbarn stated that the security flaws have already been fixed remotely because the company was informed about the report back in September.Surprisingly, retailers are also responding quite intensely as a UK based retailer John Lewis has stopped selling one of the smartwatches identified as risky by the NCC.The findings have been reported to the US and European data regulators by the NCC. Shoppers and parents are advised not to buy these smartwatches until it is confirmed that the related companies have fixed the security flaws. In case your kid owns one of the vulnerable watches, it is better to ask for a refund from the seller and set an example for others to follow so that companies pay attention to fixing the flaws at the earliest.", "topics": ["Bully", "Children", "hackers", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Norway", "Privacy", "security", "Smartwatch", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Hackers can hack your kid\u2019s smartwatch and track their location", "date": "October 18, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "A serious flaw has been identified in Adobe Flash Player, which can deliver FinFisher spyware, according to security experts. Adobe systems already issued a warning note about the newly identified flaw, which can allow execution of a remote code. The flaw was identified by security firm Kaspersky Lab after the company noticed that the Flash Player was aiding a hacking attempt against one of its customers last week.\u201cOn October 10, 2017, Kaspersky Lab\u2019s advanced exploit prevention systems identified a new Adobe Flash zero-day exploit used in the wild against our customers. The exploit was delivered through a Microsoft Office document, and the final payload was the latest version of the FinFisher malware. We have reported the bug to Adobe who assigned it CVE-2017-11292 and released a patch earlier today,\u201d read the official blog post from Kaspersky Lab.The exploit is a Memory Corruption flaw that already is present in the \u201ccom.adobe.tvsdk.mediacore.BufferControlParameters\u201d class, explained Kaspersky researchers. In case the exploit is successful, the payload would attain arbitrary read and write privileges, and it will execute a second stage shellcode.To avoid detection by antivirus programs, the first stage shellcode is equipped with NOP sled containing alternative instructions, and it is also responsible for second stage shellcode from hxxp://89.45.67[.]107/rss/5uzosoff0u.iaf.After the second stage shellcode is executed, it is required to download the final payload FinFisher, which it will extract from hxxp://89.45.67[.]107/rss/mo.exe, it will also download a deceptive document to display to the victim and thirdly, it will execute the payload.As per the findings of Kaspersky, a sinister hacker group has designed this exploit that is initiated using the Adobe Flash Player so that it allows downloading and installation of FinFisher spyware onto the victim\u2019s PC.As noted above, the exploit is being distributed through a Microsoft Office document and is being sent via email. Until now, just one attack has been identified by Kaspersky which means the number of attacks is quite low or it is a highly targeted campaign.It is worth noting that FinFisher, which is also called FinSpy, is notorious surveillance software that is commonly used by law enforcement agencies and governments across the globe. Nearly 32 countries are suspected to be using FinSpy spyware as per the year 2015 report from University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab.The payload analysis revealed that BlackOasis is involved in this scheme. It is the same group that was identified to be involved in another Zero-day exploit discovered by security firm FireEye back in September 2017, and in the latest scheme, the same C&C server and FinFisher payload have been used as was the case in previous zero-day.According to Kaspersky, BlackOasis has been regularly targeting Middle Eastern politicians, activists and bloggers lately and previously it has tried to hack victims by sending malicious code in Word documents. The group is believed to have expert hacking knowledge as it has exploited five previously unknown flaws including zero-days since 2015.\u201cTo verify the version of Adobe Flash Player installed on your system, access the About Flash Player page, or right-click on content running in Flash Player and select \u201cAbout Adobe (or Macromedia) Flash Player\u201d from the menu. If you use multiple browsers, perform the check for each browser you have installed on your system,\u201d said Adobe.Adobe has released a security update and urged that users patch the vulnerability as soon as possible by downloading the latest version of Flash Player. Most importantly, businesses and organizations need to patch their systems to prevent installation of malicious payload.This is the second time in a month that hackers have used a vulnerability to deliver FinFisher spyware. Last month, Microsoft issued patches for 85 flaws in which one was used to trick users into downloading and installing FinFisher.To stay protected, security researchers at Kaspersky Lab are advising users to be cautious while opening emails and never click on an attachment or visit a link before proper verification of the sender.", "topics": ["Adobe", "Cyber Attack", "Finfisher", "Infosec", "internet", "Malware", "security", "Spyware", "Technology", "Vulnerability", "zero-day"], "title": "Flaw in Adobe Flash Player Used to Install FinFisher Spyware", "date": "October 17, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});According to cyber-security researchers Frank Piessens and Mathy Vanhoef from Belgium\u2019s Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, there is a dangerous flaw in the WPA2 protocol which can be exploited by cybercriminals to intercept emails, passwords and other kinds of encrypted data. However, this will be successful only if the attacker is within the range of the vulnerable device or access point.An attacker can also inject malicious content such as ransomware into a website when a client is visiting. The proof-of-concept of this exploit has been dubbed as KRACK, which is an abbreviation of Key Reinstallation Attacks. The findings of the research were disclosed on Monday followed by an advisory by US-CERT that has been distributed to nearly 100 organizations. In the advisory, it is stated that:\u201cUS-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the 4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) security protocol. The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others. Note that as protocol-level issues, most or all correct implementations of the standard will be affected. The CERT/CC and the reporting researcher KU Leuven will be publicly disclosing these vulnerabilities on 16 October 2017.\u201dThe vulnerability affects the core WPA2 protocol and devices running Linux, Android and OpenBSD are mainly vulnerable to be exploited while to some extent macOS, MediaTek Linksys and Windows devices are also vulnerable.According to Sean Gallagher, IT editor at Ars Technica, KRACK performs the attack by targeting the four-way handshake. The handshake is executed when a WPA2-protected network is accessed by a client since it the handshake confirms that both client and access points have accurate credentials. KRACK however, tricks the client, which is vulnerable, into reinstalling a key that is already in-use due to which the client is forced to reset packet numbers. In the initial value of these numbers, there is cryptographic nonce and other parameters; KRACK forces the nonce reuse in such a way that encryption is avoided.Vanhoef reveals that attackers can exploit this vulnerability to decrypt sensitive data including \u201ccredit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails, photos,\u201d which is usually encrypted through the Wi-Fi encryption protocol. It is important to note that a majority of routers and devices nowadays rely upon WPA2 protocol for the encryption of Wi-Fi traffic.\u201cThe attack works against all modern protected Wi-Fi networks. Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible to inject and manipulate data. For example, an attacker might be able to inject ransomware or other malware into websites,\u201d wrote Vanhoef.Key Reinstallation Attacks: Breaking WPA2 by forcing nonce reuse https://t.co/gFrtbou375 and see the paper at https://t.co/iloFCbE8Pv\u2014 Mathy Vanhoef (@vanhoefm) October 16, 2017However, the researcher noted that the attacker could intercept Some of the traffic traveling between the device and router. If the traffic is encrypted with HTTPS, then it cannot be intercepted by the attacker. On the other hand, cybercriminals cannot access your password through this traffic and can only perform packet injection with certain devices only if present within the range of the Wi-Fi network.To protect your device, it is highly important to update all the wireless devices such as routers, laptops, phones, and tablets or whatever device you own with the latest security patches because updating them would prevent KRACK vulnerability. Especially update your router\u2019s firmware and if an ISP has provided it, contact them immediately to update their branded kit or browse through their administration panel. The router manufacturers that have already released fixes for WPA2 protocol include Aruba, FortiNet, Meraki, Microtik, and Ubiquiti.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});If your router hasn\u2019t been fixed or a patch is not released then switch to Ethernet and turn off all the functions of wireless until a patch is released. Also, disable Wi-Fi option on your device to make sure that the traffic passes through the Ethernet cable. Or use cellular data on your mobile phone if your device does not has Ethernet port.Remember that devices running on Android 6.0 and later versions are far more vulnerable to be exploited with this vulnerability than other devices primarily due to the faulty implementation of the handshake mechanism in their Wi-Fi stack. With the successful implementation of KRACK, the attacker can force the device to reinstall an all-zero encryption key instead of the original key.Vanhoef states that visiting HTTPS-protected websites only is not an appropriate or productive solution to prevent KRACK because various improperly configured websites might be forced into transmitting unencrypted HTTP data.\u201cAlthough websites or apps may use HTTPS as an additional layer of protection, we warn that this extra protection can (still) be bypassed in a worrying number of situations. For example, HTTPS was previously bypassed in non-browser software, in Apple\u2019s iOS and OS X, in Android apps again, in banking apps, and even in VPN apps,\u201d noted Vanhoef.The researcher has also ensured that iOS and Windows-based devices are not vulnerable to severe attacks while Linux and Android devices are most susceptible since attackers can force network decryption on clients within mere seconds without much ado. In thisregard, Vanhoef stated that clients could be patched even while connected to exploitable access points. Linux and Wi-Fi access points patches are already developed, but when they are available for Android users, it is yet unclear.When asked if the vulnerability would pave the way for a WPA3 standard, Vanhoef explained that implementations could be \u201cpatched in a backward-compatible manner,\u201d which means that patched clients can communicate with an unpatched access point or vice versa.The vulnerability was kept a secret for weeks, and finally, on Monday it was discovered after it was officially disclosed on a Github page owned by Vanhoef and another website krackattack.com. The vulnerability has been indexed as \u201cCVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13081, CVE-2017-13082, CVE-2017-13084, CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, CVE-2017-13088.\u201dVanhoef and Piessens will be presenting the findings via the website krackattacks.com at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security due to be held on November 1st in Dallas.

When a site that is mining cryptocurrency is visited, there is a surprising surge in the CPU usage, which can prove to be beneficial for website owners because when a large number of PCs donates their powers, the mining is successful in earning revenues.The report published by Adguard states that within merely weeks since the revelation about The Pirate Bay, there is an astounding increment in sites that mine cryptocurrencies through PCs of their site\u2019s visitors.Reportedly, 0.22% of the top 100,000 sites on Alexa List are discovered to be mining cryptocurrency, which means about 220 sites are involved in mining while the average of visitors on these sites is nearly 500 million and this audience arrive from various parts of the world from the USA and Europe to Asia and South America. While JSEcoin and CoinHive are the two most common and popular scripts that are employed to acquire cryptocurrency.Adguard explains that around $43,000 have been raked in by these domains without any expenditure and within only three weeks. Reports also reveal that The Pirate Bay made $12,000 per month through cryptocurrency as the traffic flow is quite heavy on its domain.It is worth noting that most of the websites that are using miners are not as reliable and come from the blurry background. These include torrent search sites, pornographic sites, domains that host pirated content and similar other sites.As per the analysis of Adguard, websites having \u201cshady reputation\u201d are involved in browser mining; these sites otherwise find it difficult to make money through standard advertising practices, therefore, they use such tactics. Sites offering video-based content are most likely to generate income through mining more than any other.However, if handled appropriately, mining of cryptocurrency has immense potential as many users would agree to lend their CPUs so that they could get rid of annoying ads; but consent of users must be given importance. Domain operators need to respect end users and seek permission. Without user consent, domain operators are putting their reputation at risk, which might prove to be detrimental to their image in the long run.CoinHive released the following statement after learning about the mining scheme used by websites:\u201cWe\u2019re a bit saddened to see that some of our customers integrate CoinHive into their pages without disclosing to their users what\u2019s going on, let alone asking for their permission.

It not only encrypts your mobile phone but also modified its PIN.The ransomware has been named DoubleLocker because it performs a two-way action to lock the phone, that is, it encrypts all the files and changes the PIN as well so that victims run out of options and give in to the ransom demands of hackers. The ransomware is being distributed as a fake update of Adobe Flash while compromised websites are being used to spread it.When DoubleLocker is downloaded on your device, the fake Adobe Flash app requests for Google Play Services activation because it needs to exploit the phone\u2019s accessibility services. This particular option is present for disable people so that they could easily use their phones.It must be noted that the tactic of abusing accessibility services was used previously by Android data-stealing Trojans and it is the very first time that some cybercriminals have employed this approach on ransomware.DoubleLocker then starts exploiting the permissions by retrieving Windows content, enabling advanced web accessibility for installation of scripts and monitoring the text that the victim types. When permissions are granted, the ransomware is installed as the default Home app. This means when the user will visit Home screen the next time the ransom note will be there.According to ESET\u2019s malware researcher Luk\u00e1\u0161 \u0160tefanko, the default Home app is a launcher and is present to enhance the persistence of the malware. The user believes the malware to be default Android launcher, which is the software that controls the appearance of the device, as well as the way apps and widgets, are launched. It also is responsible for creating invisible shortcuts to self-activate when the victim clicks on Home button, and this is how the device gets locked. It happens every time the victim tries to use the mobile\u2019s Home screen.\u201cThanks to using the accessibility service, the user doesn\u2019t know that they launched malware by hitting Home,\u201d said \u0160tefanko.The two ways in which DoubleLocker attempts to lock the phone include encryption of the files stored on the device and changing the PIN of the device. It encrypts data using the AES encryption algorithm through \u201c.cryeye\u201d extension. The encryption is highly effective, and without the decryption key, it becomes impossible to unlock the files.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});On the other hand, the PIN is changed effectively by setting it to a random number, which even the attackers do not store. This means, recovering access to the device is not possible. The PIN is then reset after the ransom has been paid and the device is unlocked. Attackers give 24 hours deadline to the victims for payment of ransom.It is worth noting that hackers are demanding 0.0130 bitcoins (approx. $73) as ransom, which is a comparatively low figure if we observe what other ransomware schemes are demanding. However, it is quite possible that hackers have set the ransom amount low deliberately so that victims easily pay the ransom to regain access to their device.The only option victims have if they don\u2019t want to pay ransom amount, is to run factory reset. This will fully format the phone, and all the data that is not backed up will be permanently deleted. The chances that the rooted phone can successfully get past the PIN without needing to be reset are not bright. It can only happen if the device had to debug mode on before the installation of ransomware. In that case, it is possible to remove the system file through accessing Android Debug Bridge (ADB) as this is where the PIN is stored. This would allow the user to reset the device manually.However, we suggest that it is better to avoid installing apps and software from third-party websites and only choose reliable, authentic platforms. DoubleLocker is a dangerous threat to all Android devices since it doesn\u2019t need a rooted phone to run its code and it can effectively affect the phone rendering it useless unless the victim pays the ransom.

In his blog post, Krause explained that cybercriminals could use pop-up dialog boxes to carry out phishing attacks so that an unsuspecting user could be tricked into providing his/her Apple ID password. It is worth noting that phishing attacks are conducted to get sensitive data such as credit card number or password or private information by stealing login data or infecting the device with malicious software.To prove his findings, Krause developed a proof-of-concept showing that the security flaw indeed exists in iOS and wrote that there is just one method of differentiating the fake pop-up from the authentic one, which is by pressing the Home button. When this button is pressed, the fake pop-up dialog box will automatically close along with the app on which it appeared. For instance, if the user was playing a game and the fake pop-up appeared, by pressing the Home button the game will be closed and so will be the pop-up. A genuine pop-up will not be closed when the Home button is pressed because it will be running on an entirely different process while the fake pop-up will run on a standard app. Furthermore, the fake system of pop-up was quite easy to create (with just 30 lines of code to be written).Let\u2019s have a look at the comparison of an authentic pop-up and a fake pop-up:Krause suggests that to prevent users from being deceived into giving away their private details or sensitive data like passwords, app pop-up dialog boxes must include the app\u2019s icon so that a system pop-up and an app pop-up could be differentiated. This would ultimately help in identifying fake pop-up from authentic ones. Moreover, using 2FA (two-factor authentication method) is also helpful in improving the security of the device. If cybercriminals obtain one of the two passwords, it will not be possible to complete the attack.Krause opines that users shouldn\u2019t be asked for passwords and similar credentials in the first place to prevent exploitation of the newly discovered iOS vulnerability. However, if they are asked for credentials, it is better to go to the Settings app and enter their credentials over there to eliminate the risk of abuse.\u201cAlways close the dialog, and open the iCloud settings manually, and only enter [the password] there.

This means, without the knowledge of Kaspersky, the Russian government was using its software as a spying tool to get details about the cyber-espionage tools and tactics used by the American intelligence agencies including the NSA.In a report published by the NYT (New York Times), it is stated that Israeli intelligence has played an important role in discovering the compromising of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s servers and the use of its antivirus software by Russian government-backed hackers as a global, searchable spying tool to search for yet undisclosed American secrets. This was an Israeli operation that was already known to America.In its report, NYT did not explain the kind of information obtained by the Russians, but it did mention that the Kremlin hackers accessed Kaspersky for two years. While exploring Kaspersky\u2019s systems, Israeli hackers searched for the antivirus software vendor\u2019s research into the NSA and GCHQ\u2019s espionage tactics and when they spotted Kremlin\u2019s hackers accessing the system already, they \u201ctipped off\u201d the NSA.

This means the malware is ineffective on a majority of ATMs since most of them nowadays use Windows XP. It also hints at the fact that the operator of ATMii is intentionally attacking the ATMs of a certain network and the malware strain has been designed to steal from those machines only.ATMii was discovered in April 2017 after one of the attacked banks shared a sample with the security researchers at Kaspersky Lab. The team explored ATMii and published the technical breakdown of its capabilities.As per the analysis of Kaspersky\u2019s senior developer Konstantin Zykov, this particular malware strain isn\u2019t as powerful or dangerous as other ATM malware strains identified so far such as Rufus, GreenDispenser, Ploutus, SUCEFUL, Skimer, etc. The entire strain comprises of two files only called the exe.exe and dll.dll.\u201cThe malware turned out to be fairly straightforward, consisting of only two modules: an injector module (exe.exe, 3fddbf20b41e335b6b1615536b8e1292) and the module to be injected (dll.dll, dc42ed8e1de55185c9240f33863a6aa4). To use this malware, criminals need direct access to the target ATM, either over the network or physically (e.g., over USB). ATMii, if it is successful, allows criminals to dispense all the cash from the ATM,\u201d wrote Zykov in its blog post.ATMii is installed on the ATMs through access to the network or a USB device. The attacker can copy these two files on the storage drive of ATM and execute the exe.exe file, which will start searching for the basic atmapp.exe process. When it is found, the exe.exe file injects dll.dll file. This file lets the attacker interact with the genuine atmapp.exe process and take control of the machine.The injector is written in Visual C language while it is an unprotected command line application compiled with timestamp: Fri Nov 01 14:33:23 2013 UTC, explained Zykov. The compilation timestamp, as evident, is about four years old and it is quite unrealistic to believe that the malware remained unnoticed for such a long time. Therefore, it can be assumed that the attackers have used a fake timestamp.Another interesting fact identified by Zykov is that the malware strain supports three commands to carry out its malicious operations. The Scan command scans the ATM\u2019s cash cassettes to get the complete list of bills stored in the machine at the time of the attack. Through Disp command, attackers can dispense as much cash as they need and with Die command, attackers can instruct the malware to removes itself.", "topics": ["ATM", "Banking", "Cyber Crime", "Infosec", "internet", "Malware", "Money", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "USB"], "title": "New Malware Hits ATMs Running on Win7 and Win Vista", "date": "October 10, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "On Friday a New Town, Massachusetts based man called Ryan Lin was arrested for cyberstalking after his VPN logs were provided by PureVPN.

Initially, PureVPN claimed that the logs don\u2019t even exist and so does its privacy policy page, which reads:\u201cWe Do Not monitor user activity nor do we keep any logs. We, therefore, have no record of your activities.\u201dSurprisingly, after some time the same data was provided to law enforcement for gathering evidence, tracking and eventual arrest of the 24-year old Lin. This means, these logs do exist and can prove to be helpful in capturing criminals.In Lin\u2019s case, the online activities of the accused were tracked from April 2017 and records obtained from PureVPN showed two same accounts; one of them was Lin\u2019s email account while the other was Teleportfxgmail account. Both were accessed using the same WANSecurity IP address. Reportedly, PureVPN determined that a single customer accessed two originating IP addresses. These include the RCN IP address, which turned out to be the residence of Lin, and another address was tracked at the software firm where Lin worked at the time. His cyberstalking campaign lasted for 16 months.The FBI states that Lin utilized a number of privacy services including Tor to hide his IP address, he used anonymized international texting service TextNow, VPNs and offshore private email service providers to carry out his malicious objectives. However, his mistake was that he used a work computer for some of his schemes and although he was terminated by then and the operating system was reinstalled, investigators were able to follow the footprints that he left behind to link the evidence with Lin. If convicted, Lin will be spending five years behind bars and nearly three years of supervised release.One cannot deny the fact that Lin\u2019s arrest by the FBI is justified given that the accusations are true since Smith claims that Lin cyberstalked her and her friends and family. Not only this, the accused leaked Smith\u2019s online accounts passwords, posted fake sexually explicit pictures of her online, published personal journal records providing details of sexual encounters and created a fake profile on a BDSM site in her name and facilitated sexual encounters on sites that were \u201cdedicated to prostitution, sexual fetishes, and other sexual encounters\u201d. According to Smith, Lin wanted to enact a rape fantasy with her, and he also tricked her friend into calling the police to her home, sent \u201cimages that likely constitute child pornography\u201d to her family and friends and making rape, death and bomb threats.\u201cLin allegedly created and posted fraudulent online profiles in the victim\u2019s name (with her photographs and home address) and solicited rape fantasies, including \u2018gang bang\u2019 and other sexual activities, which in turn caused men to show up at her home. Also, it is alleged that Lin falsely and repeatedly reported to law enforcement that there were bombs at the victim\u2019s Waltham residence.\u201dCourtroom sketch of Ryan Lin (center), charged with cyberstalking, his attorney Francis Doran, and Judge David Hennessy pic.twitter.com/NJTbBIENdI\u2014 Chris Villani (@ChrisVillani44) October 6, 2017Despite that despicable behavior and the fact that people like Lin deserve to be behind bars, we still believe that PureVPN is required to keep private details secure because a majority of VPN users are unlike Lin and all of us are privacy conscious. Most users don\u2019t prefer VPNs to remain unidentifiable while conducting malicious tasks but we want to ensure personal data security. Many users switch to VPN services as they either want to access sites like Netflix, iTunes or YouTube, access blocked websites or communicate with family or folks abroad apart from using it to retain anonymity.None of these uses are harmful for other users. Moreover, just one in four users depend upon VPN to browse the net, so it is quite impractical to believe that about 800 million users across the world are using VPNs to fulfill nefarious objectives. Privacy-conscious people would most certainly feel betrayed when companies like PureVPN deceive them by claiming one thing and doing something entirely different.More: How Apple and Facebook Helped US to Arrest Kickass Torrents\u2019 Owner", "topics": ["Bully", "Crime", "Cyber Crime", "FBI", "internet", "Police", "Privacy", "security", "Surveillance", "Technology", "Tor", "VPN"], "title": "PureVPN Aided FBI to Track CyberStalker by Providing His Logs", "date": "October 10, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});For the last couple of weeks, the trend of inserting code in websites that generate cryptocurrency has been growing like never before.

According to FireEye\u2019s researchers Nart Villeneuve, Randi Eitzman, Sandor Nemes and Tyler Dean:\u201cWhile FormBook is not unique in either its functionality or distribution mechanisms, its relative ease of use, affordable pricing structure, and open availability make FormBook an attractive option for cybercriminals of varying skill levels.\u201d FormBook distributed itself in PDFs with download links; .DOC and .XLS files with malicious macros; and archive files (e.g. .ZIP & .RAR) with .EXE payloads. Upon infecting a targeted device, the malware can send instructions to Command & Control server such as stealing passwords, cookies execute files, start processes, shutdown and reboot the system.\u201cThe credentials and other data harvested by successful FormBook infections could be used for additional cybercrime activities including, but not limited to: identity theft, continued phishing operations, bank fraud, and extortion,\u201d said FireEye.The malware has been available for sale on several hacking forums since 2016. However, researchers have now discovered that it also downloads NanoCore, a remote access trojan (RAT) first identified in 2013 and extensively sold on the dark web. Its author, Taylor Huddleston was arrested in March 2017.FireEye also noted that FormBook reads Windows\u2019 ntdll.dll module from disk into memory and calls its exported functions directly. By this, the API monitoring mechanisms can be ineffective automatically.\u201cIt also features a persistence method that randomly changes the path, filename, file extension and the registry key used for persistence.

The scheme has been named FreeMilk while the researchers have claimed that it is a \u201climited spear-phishing campaign,\u201d which the security firm discovered in May 2017. The scope of this campaign is wide enough as it is targeting users around the world.According to researchers, this is quite a sophisticated campaign that exploits the CVE-2017-0199 Microsoft Word Office or WordPad Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. The decoy material is intelligently customized as per the recipient while the campaign seems to be a targeted one. Palo Alto also identified that the spear phishing emails are being sent from a number of compromised email IDs, which are all connected to an authentic domain located in North East Asia. This hints at the fact that the hacker(s) most probably posed as legitimate senders to send infected emails to the recipient. The targeted person would download malicious documents sent through two powerful malware payloads namely PoohMilk and Freenki believing that he/she is still communicating with the individual.The primary objective of PoohMilk is to execute Freenki downloader while Freenki performs two different tasks; firstly, it collects information about the host, and secondly, it plays the role of a second stage downloader. The malware obtains MAC address, username, active processes and computer name apart from taking screenshots of the targeted system. The information is then transmitted to a C&C server where the attackers receive it and exploit it further to download other malicious software.In some cases, researchers observed, PoohMilk loader loads the remote administration tool called N1stAgent. This tool was first seen in 2016 as part of a phishing scheme in which infected emails disguised as Hancom\u2019s security patches were sent.According to a blog post from Palo Alto networks researchers, the attackers have created malware that executes only when \u201ca proper argument is given,\u201d they take control of an active conversation and craft a dedicated decoy documents per conversation, which is based upon the hijacked communication.\u201cWe were not able to identify the second stage malware delivered via Freenki downloader during the campaign,\u201d researchers noted.

The breach, however, has been investigated recently by Disqus and currently it is performing the mandatory task of alerting users about the data hack.According to the investigation conducted by Disqus, the database that was hacked had user records from the year 2007, and the attackers are yet unknown. They have provided a snapshot of the hacked database as well. The information stored in this database included email IDs, usernames, subscription dates and last login date. All the information was stored in plaintext format.Since the passwords were hashed with the unreliable SHA1 algorithm at that time and Disqus switched to bcrypt in 2012. Therefore, it is believed that about a third of the total 17.5 million affected users might also have lost their passwords. Moreover, now these users are vulnerable to all sorts of phishing scams and spam messages.

The information was hacked after an unnamed NSA contractor who is an expert at hacking computers and tracking communications, stored the classified information on his computer at home, which had Russian based security firm Kaspersky Lab\u2019s anti-virus software installed.It is yet unclear whether the NSA fired the contractor or not and if he will be prosecuted but it is believed that the agency is not accusing the contractor of intentionally cooperating with a foreign government. However, it is quite likely that the contractor will be facing prosecution since he has violated NSA rules by taking classified material home and storing it on his personal computer. Due to this, Russian hackers could identify the data and penetrate the computer as he was using Kaspersky Lab anti-virus. The contractor took the data home in 2015.According to WSJ\u2019s report, the material stolen by the Russian hacker group includes confidential details about the way the NSA performs eavesdropping after compromising foreign computer networks, the computer code used by the NSA and how it protects networks within the US.This issue has brought to light the very reason behind US government\u2019s recent crackdown on Kaspersky software. It must be noted that software from Kaspersky Lab has been banned from being used by US agencies.It isn\u2019t the first time that an NSA contractor has played a role in exposing the cyber-espionage tactics and tools used by the agency; previously three other NSA contractors namely Edward Snowden, Hal Martin and Reality Winner have exposed NSA secrets while the online entity Shadow Brokers not only stole NSA spying tools but also placed it for auction at dedicated platforms.Nonetheless, the NSA has once again been embarrassed by exposing of its secret spying tools, and government officials in the US are irritated.As per Republican senator in Nebraska Ben Sasse: \u201cThe men and women of the U.S. intelligence community are patriots, but the NSA needs to get its head out of the sand and solve its contractor problem. Russia is a clear adversary in cyberspace, and we can\u2019t afford these self-inflicted injuries.\u201dSen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Democrat, is questioning the widespread use of Kaspersky products despite its banning in recent months: \u201cThis development should serve as a stark warning, not just to the federal government but to states, local governments, and the American public, of the serious dangers of using Kaspersky software. The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are extremely alarming.\u201dKaspersky has, on the other hand, denied any links with the Russian government or its involvement in this hack attack and referred to it as a False Accusation. The company stated that it \u201chas not provided any information or evidence substantiating this alleged incident, and as a result, we must assume that this is another example of a false accusation.\u201dAlthough there is no official statement from the NSA as yet intelligence officials assert that agencies in the USA have implemented extensively layered cyber-defenses which aren\u2019t reliant upon a single system or tool. Therefore, exposures like these won\u2019t affect the security measures of the NSA or its sibling agencies.In their official statement, Eugene Kaspersky, Chairman, and CEO of Kaspersky Lab denied any involvement in the attack and urged investigating the issue. \u201cSeriously: we\u2019re very concerned about the possible breach of our products.

Reportedly, PTP researchers have identified that it is quite easy to take control of Bluetooth butt plugs. This means, playing with your smart toys without even entering your house will be a piece of cake for cybercriminals.PTP showed how smart sex toys could be taken over, which refers to a practice called \u201cscrewdriving.\u201d They proved how hackers could manipulate butt plug to make it go crazy and uncontrollable by detecting a smart sex toy known as Lovense Hush and set it on full power from outside its location.\u2018One could drive the Hush\u2019s motor to full speed, and as long as the attacker remains connected over BLE and not the victim, there is no way they can stop the vibrations\u2026 adult toys appeal to a huge spectrum of people, and their ubiquity allows people to enjoy a sex-positive life. However we think that these same people should be able to use them without fear of compromise or injury,\u2019 wrote PTP researchers.The reason why these toys could be manipulated from far away is that there is a vulnerability present in smart sex toys, especially those manufactured within the US. This flaw allows full control of the device from the street, as proven by Alex Lomas from PTP security group. While wandering the streets of Berlin, Lomas discovered that suddenly an adult sex toy appeared on his smartphone. Naturally, Lomas was surprised and used the screwdriving technique to detect how hackers can locate a Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE enabled smart sex toy accurately through triangulation.BLE is also called Bluetooth Smart. It is a wireless personal area network technology devised to make sure that the device consumes less power and runs on smaller battery for a longer duration than Bluetooth. BLE is commonly used in devices like health monitors, fitness trackers, mouse, and keyboards. If this technology is reliable enough to be used in smart devices from a security perspective is an aspect that has largely been ignored so far. Lomas noted that BLE devices use the same identified across all devices and are thus, advertised as made for discovery. He identified that all Hush devices were dubbed as LVS-Z001.Since Lovense Hush is BLE connected butt plug, therefore, it was easily detected by Lomas. This device allows users to control vibration speed through their smartphones fully and can be used by long-distance couples by using a mobile app and use options like Solo Play or Discreet Public Play with BLE.Several other devices were also tested by researchers such as another US make sex toy Kiiroo Fleshlight and Lelo, Lovense Nora and Max. It was identified that none of these devices used a password or PIN to be accessed and if any did use one, it was static or generic. This issue was discovered in \u201cevery Bluetooth adult toy\u201d that the researchers tested. Hence, researchers concluded that these Bluetooth sex toys don\u2019t include UI (user interface) due to which it is possible to connect the toy to another device having pairing PIN.Since the communication between the toy and phone is performed via BLE signals, which are not encrypted, therefore, researchers could intercept the transmissions between toy and phone using a single Bluetooth dongle and an antenna. Afterwards, Lomas demonstrated that using a few basic commands can let a hacker to create a connection with the device and control them from outside the house, from a street.Moreover, BLE devices utilize P2P (point-to-point) topology to initiate one-on-one device communications, therefore, as long as the attacker is controlling the device the vibrations will continue, said Lomas.", "topics": ["app", "Bluetooth", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Privacy", "security", "Smartphone", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Hackers can identify if you are using sex toys and exploit them", "date": "October 5, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is universally famous as NATO, has been targeted by none other but the country that is a pro at hacking and eavesdropping, Russia.

As expected, the Russian government has denied its involvement in the newly discovered hacking campaign, but officials are sure about it and believe that it is a well-coordinated campaign in which the equipment used is quite sophisticated.

It was this particular data hack that forced Yahoo to lower its assets price when it was being sold to Verizon in February 2017 since the buyer lowered the original offer by $350 million.According to Verizon, Yahoo\u2019s parent company, this massive hack did affect every single Yahoo account holder, but the figure is three times higher than what was previously believed and reported in 2016. In December 2016, Yahoo issued a statement that just 1 billion accounts were compromised in the 2013 data hack. But, later the company initiated a thorough investigation in collaboration with Verizon, law enforcement agencies, and cyber-security firms to identify the full scope of the data breach.More: Yahoo built a software to secretly scan user emails for the NSA\u201cThe company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft,\u201d explained Verizon. The company did not provide information about the \u201coutside forensic experts\u201d though.On Tuesday, Yahoo stated that all the 3 billion accounts on Yahoo, which included Tumblr, Yahoo Email, Flickr, and Fantasy, were hacked after the company became a victim of huge data theft. This is undoubtedly the largest data breach in digital history as far as the size of stolen data is concerned. It is being speculated that every single account holder is affected by this breach while last year Yahoo claimed that the data hacked includes email addresses, names and passwords only and financial information was not stolen. Still, it is unclear who perpetrated the hack attack against Yahoo back in 2013.  In March 2017 HackRead exclusively reported that the stolen data was being sold at the murky network Dark Web.As per Yahoo, the hacked information didn\u2019t include clear text passwords, bank accounts info and payment card data. However, it is also a fact that outdated security protection and encryption that was easy to be cracked were used for data protection at Yahoo. The data was protected through security questions and backup email IDs. This would make it convenient for hackers to hijack other accounts of affected users who have linked a single email ID with various platforms.This is not out of the ordinary to obtain detailed information about the number of affected individuals in data breach cases like these after some time has passed. According to Thomas Fischer, Global Security Advocate at Digital Guardian, this is a norm with breaches but those that are conducted on a smaller scale. Still, it is unclear who perpetrated the hack attack against Yahoo back in 2013.\u201cThe issue here is that account details were compromised without the victims being alerted, leaving them vulnerable to phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering over the last four years. Mass data breaches like this are a treasure trove for malicious attackers. Using the compromised login details, hackers may have attempted to hijack the email accounts to steal more data, or target the victims\u2019 friends, family, and place of work.\u201d said Fischer.The news has prompted another series of class action lawsuit claims coming from Yahoo account holders and shareholders, which greatly increases problems for the company that is already facing nearly 41 consumer class-action lawsuits in not just US state courts but federal courts as well. However, in this particular case, as per the attorney representing affected Yahoo users John Yanchunis, the federal judge has asked for more evidence and information in order to justify claims of his clients. Yanchunis stated that they have the required facts now, which will provide \u201cmind-numbing\u201d information.On the other hand, Yahoo official claims that the 3 billion figure also includes accounts that were created but never activated or were briefly used, some were never used. Yahoo is now notifying the additional affected users through email.Carl Wright, CRO, AttackIQ said that \u201cThis is yet again an epic failure. It is time to try something new \u2013 seriously, find protection failures before the adversary does. Consumers worldwide and shareholders deserve better. It is one thing to deploy security controls, it is completely another thing to know that they are working correctly. This is why we believe the best defense is a good offensive \u2013 continuously testing your security stack the same way the adversary does.\u201d Yahoo, now known as Oath, has also noted that it has already implemented necessary steps to ensure the protection of its users.

Now, it is being reported that Facebook is testing facial recognition technology to assist users in unlocking their Facebook accounts.This means Facebook will use your face to verify that the locked account belongs to you and not some script kiddie or third-party trying to access someone else\u2019s account. According to TechCrunch, \u201cthat could be especially useful if you\u2019re somewhere that you can\u2019t receive two-factor authentication SMS, like on a plane or while traveling abroad, or if you lose access to your email account\u201d.\u201cWe are testing a new feature for people who want to quickly and easily verify account ownership during the account recovery process. This optional feature is available only on devices you\u2019ve already used to log in. It is another step, alongside two-factor authentication via SMS, which were taking to make sure account owners can confirm their identity,\u201d Facebook told TechCrunch.It is most likely that Facebook is impressed with iPhone X\u2019s facial recognition that lets users unlock their phone instantly. A screenshot shared by Matt Navara of TNW, one can see how Facebook\u2019s facial recognition feature will be working in future.The facial recognition itself has become one of the fastest growing tech used by companies, for instance, China is using facial recognition system in public toilets and the United States airports are using the same technology to keep track of those leaving or visiting the country. The FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) also owns a database of more than 411 million images out of which 140 million belongs to foreigners who applied for US visa and 30 million mugshots of criminals without any oversight.However, according to a recent survey of 129 hackers conducted by security firm Bitglass found facial recognition was considered the second less efficient security tool behind standard passwords. Facial recognition was also rated as the worst tool six times more often than fingerprint authentication, indicating that there are many doubts in the air about the security of facial recognition tech.According to Thomas Fischer, global security advocate at Digital Guardian, \u201cFacebook\u2019s Face ID seems to be focused on providing users with the second factor of authentication were they to lose access to their account, or forget their password. It is interesting to note that Facebook\u2019s technology will only work on a device that has already been associated with a user account. This effectively provides a three-layer authentication mechanism: account, device and biometrics, you will need all three factors to gain access. This can significantly increase the security of a user\u2019s account.\u201d\u201cThe bigger question is how Facebook will implement this. Apple claims its facial recognition technology is safe because it uses spatial analysis and an onboard machine learning processor to validate the user\u2019s face. Apple says this will reduce successful attempts to trick the solution. So how will Facebook\u2019s facial recognition tool work and how will it avoid false positives? This will be the biggest issue with Facebook\u2019s solution as it is not integrated into the device. It\u2019s likely the processing and validation of faces will be done at the server level. This requires Facebook to store user\u2019s biometric data in the cloud, or compare faces with those cached in user accounts,\u201d Fischer told HackRead in an email conversation.Remember, this is not the first time Facebook will be using facial recognition technology. Currently, the tagging feature that shows up while uploading photos on the site is an example of facial recognition tech at work.

Wordfence identified zero-days during its regular \u201csite cleaning service\u201d when a series of hacked websites and hints of exploitation were discovered.

WPMU Dev\u2019s Appointments (which was fixed in v. 2.2.2)2. Dan Coulter\u2019s Flickr Gallery (which was fixed in v. 1.5.3) and3. CMSHelpLive\u2019s RegistrationMagic-Custom Registration Forms (which was fixed in v. 3.7.9.3)In its advisory, Wordfence explained that the vulnerabilities were exploited to install backdoors on WordPress websites and warned the users about the plugins since about 21,000 websites until these are updated with the newly released plugins versions. Though the number of websites is surprisingly low, that\u2019s because these three plugins are not that popular as others nevertheless, Wordfence has advised users to exercise caution. On the CVSSv3 severity scale, this zero-day vulnerability has a score of 9.8 out of 10, which is of course very high and this means it is of Critical nature.Wordfence researcher Brad Haas states that through this vulnerability hackers were able to force a website to \u201cfetch a remote file\u201d which was a PHP backdoor. The attackers would then store the file at the desired location. However, Haas explains that the vulnerability is very easily exploited as it just needs a hacker to package the exploit code within an HTTP POST request that is sent to the targeted website and there isn\u2019t any need to undergo any authentication process on the site for triggering the exploit. Whats even more disturbing is the fact that other hackers can also perform reverse engineering in the plugins\u2019 changelogs to \u2018deduce\u2019 the exploit code.The exploits were elusive: a malicious file seemed to appear out of nowhere, and even sites with access logs only showed a POST request to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php at the time the file was created.

However, it isn\u2019t the case with all Hikvision security cameras but only some of them but if you are the owner of one such camera then it is obvious that there is a backdoor in the device.In May, Department of Homeland Security\u2019s ICS-CERT issued warning regarding the presence of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in Hikvision security cameras; these vulnerabilities were of such nature that it required low-level skills to exploit them. In its advisory, the department clearly stated that if these vulnerabilities are exploited successfully then the malicious attacker would gain high-level privileges and/or impersonate an authentic user and access or even steal sensitive, confidential data.And now, malicious attackers are trying to exploit this vulnerability, the first example is the appearance of HACKED by replacing live feed of some models of Hikvision security cameras.On Sep 12, a security researcher using the alias Monte Crypto posted access control bypass in IP cameras from Hikvision on Full Disclosure mailing list and warned users that a majority of these cams contain a backdoor that can let unauthentic impersonation of a configured user account.\u201cThe vulnerability poses a severe risk [and] is trivial to exploit,\u201d and still there are \u201chundreds of thousands of vulnerable devices\u201d that are active on the internet, wrote Monte Crypto.In his post on Full Disclosure regarding the vulnerability, it is claimed that there is a superuser admin account in all devices manufactured by Hikvision. This account allows understanding of how to retrieve users and roles, how to download camera configuration and how to get camera snapshot without authentication. Monte Crypto also noted that the vulnerability is not new and has been there in Hikvision products since 2014.A Reddit user \u2018wolfblitzer69\u2019 posted the sample image where HACKED replaced live feed of the security camera from Hikvision. Further research revealed that it isn\u2019t only Hikvision brand cameras that are affected with backdoor but various \u201cwhite labeled camera products\u201d manufactured by well-known brands are containing backdoors.Monte Crypto explained that there are various, negative repercussions of having a security camera with a backdoor installed. Such as, the hacker/attacker would obtain full administrative access and use the vulnerability of the device to retrieve plain-text passwords for \u201call configured users.\u201dChanging the weak password will not resolve the issue as well. However, Monte Crypto states that if you upgrade the camera or immediately disconnect it from the internet or any \u201cuntrusted network\u201d then you might be able to save the day. Moreover, you can also try to implement network access control rules that let only the trusted IP addresses to establish connections to the devices that are vulnerable. It is worth noting that Hikvision IP cameras are equipped with UPNP, which is enabled-by-default and can get exposed to the internet automatically.Hikvision has already released firmware updates for numerous models of its security cameras where the backdoor is removed so you must install the update if it is available for your device. However, do remember that some Hikvision cameras are sold online as \u201cEnglish, not upgradable\u201d or \u201cMultilanguage\u201d but in reality, these are modified Chinese language cameras so you cannot upload English firmware in these cameras. If you attempt to do so then a boot loop will occur, which can only be recovered by installing the original Chinese language firmware over TFTP.A demo video of Hikvision backdoor exploit is released by IPVM and can be viewed here:Featured and Top image credit: Reddit", "topics": ["backdoor", "Camera", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Malware", "Privacy", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Hikvision Security Cams Compromised to Display \u201cHACKED\u201d", "date": "September 30, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "For Android smartphone users, online life is always on the edge as every other day there is a new way with which cybercriminals plan to keep a tab on their devices and invade privacy. It is the rule of the thumb that an Android user must never trust the device for storing confidential data as even the most harmless looking apps can perform unnoticeable surveillance. Blame it on the way app developers and OEMs design their products and services.However, thankfully we are blessed with security experts and researchers working day-in-and-day-out to alert us about the secret functions and capabilities of certain apps beforehand so that we avoid downloading them.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});AdGuard security researchers have identified that Go Keyboard, an app developed by Chinese GOMO developer team, cannot be trusted because it conducts spying and therefore, Android smartphone owners must not download or install this app. According to researchers, there are two variants of Go Keyboard available on Google namely \u201cGO Keyboard \u2013 Emoji keyboard, Swipe input, GIFs\u201d and \u201cGO Keyboard \u2013 Emoticon keyboard, Free Theme, GIF.\u201c Both versions send out private data to remote servers and execute unauthorized code on the android device. Each of the versions has about 100k to 500k downloads so far, and on Play Store these apps are rated at 4.5 and 4.4 stars.Researchers from AdGuard became alerted about suspicious spying acts of keyboard apps after Touchpal keyboard app was identified to display ads on HTC devices earlier in 2017. It was suspected that GOMO developer team was trying to collect private and confidential data such as the email address used to connect with Google Play Store, Android version, screen size, network type and phone\u2019s make/model number. Moreover, the keyboard apps were communicating with tracking networks as well as executing code like dex files or native coding through a remote server. This is a violation of the Developers\u2019 Policy Center\u2019s Malicious Behaviours section. The app also contradicts the information provided by developers in the app\u2019s description. It reads:\u201cWe will never collect your info including credit card information. In fact, we care for privacy of what you type and who you type!\u201dThe app does the exact opposite of what it promises or claims. It starts sharing personal data right after its installation on the device and communicates with dozens of tracking servers apart from collecting sensitive, confidential information.It is worth noting that some downloaded plugins of these apps have been declared as adware by prominent anti-virus software programs. The dangers are pretty obvious; if the keyboard apps can register and send out everything that we type like passwords, message texts, social media login IDs, phone number and bank account numbers, etc., then this information can be exploited in a variety of ways one of which is selling them to third parties.Some of the permissions we noticed are: \u201cretrieve running apps, read sensitive log data, find accounts on the device, read your contacts, read call log, record audio, display unauthorized windows, read terms you added to the dictionary and add words to user-defined dictionary etc.\u201d\u201cWe find this behavior unacceptable and dangerous. Having 200+ Million users does not make an app trustworthy. Do not blindly trust mobile apps and always check their privacy policy and what permissions do they require before the installation,\u201d stated AdGuard researchers.AdGuard has informed Google regarding its findings, and the company is yet to release an official statement about the issue.

An initial investigation showed it was a state-sponsored attack. Now, Avast has finally revealed the complete list of organizations affected by the second stage CCleaner malware in its newest update published last Friday. The company has been busy in investigating the issue of the presence of malware in its very popular and widely used CCleaner tool. The list was compiled after the company discovered a second server database, which was used by the malware in CCleaner to send information to attackers about the infected hosts.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Avast has narrated the details of the attack in its official blog post that reads:\u201cAnalysis of the CnC server showed that the incident was, in fact, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack, targeting specific high-tech and telecommunications companies. That is, despite the fact that CCleaner is a consumer product, the purpose of the attack was not to attack consumers and their data; instead, the CCleaner customers were used to gain access to corporate networks of select large enterprises.\u201dInitially, Avast claimed that the incident happened because one of the servers ran out of disk space on Sep 10, due to which the operator had to rebuild the database fully. However, latest report uploaded on 25 Sep., Avast\u2019s Threats Labs Team explained that after further investigation it was learned that the attackers managed to back up the data from the crashed C&C server to a second server before rebuilding the database. The investigation was conducted by the Threat Labs team from Avast and US law enforcement officials collectively.The blog post noted that the IP address of the second server was identified to be 216.126.225.163. This server featured the same self-signed SSL certificate and had a usual LAMP configuration (CentOS release 6.9 with Apache 2.2.15, PHP 5.3.3) stack-wise. Avast further revealed that a MySql database was containing the data from August 18. When the backup server was accessed, the complete database was found but only the data between 2017-09-10 19:03:18 and 2017-09-12 9:58:47 UTC was missing. This refers to the timeline between the crashing of the original C&C database and the creation of the new database. However, it is not yet clear how the C&C server behaved during this period.According to the findings, there were approx. 5,686,677 connections linked with the C&C server while the number of unique MAC addresses communicating with the C&C server was 1,646,536. The second-stage payload was delivered to 40 unique PCs. It was also noted that the server\u2019s database only contained information about user infections that occurred between 12 Sep and 16 Sep after which the hackers installed another server, which was seized by Avast on 15 Sep.This refers to the fact that Avast and law enforcement has obtained the full list of infected hosts apart from the 40 hour period including the affected PCs with the first and second stage payloads. The infected version of CCleaner was downloaded by more than 2.27 million users out of which only 40 PCs were delivered the second-stage malware, claimed Avast. This, however, contradicts the company\u2019s previous statement and that of investigation firm Cisco, which claimed that 20 PCs were affected with second-stage malware.The table shows the complete list of infected hosts:As apparent, the most infected bots are 13 computers located on the network of Taiwan based ISP Chunghwa Telecom and the company ranked second on the list with ten computers is a Japan-based IT firm NEC while the third on the list is Samsung with five computers.The companies having two computers infected with the second-stage malware include ASUS, Sony and Fujitsu and one infected computer was identified on the networks of Singtel, IPAddress.com, VMWare, Intel, and O2. It must be noted that the table shown above provides a list of successful infections only because despite the efforts of C&C server to target specific networks, not all of them were affected.The filtering rules for the seized server depicted that companies like HTC, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Intel, Sony, VMWare, Vodafone, O2, Epson, Linksys, Oracle, DLink, Singtel, and Gauselmann. The backup server\u2019s filtering rules showed that before Sep 10, the attackers targeted different companies like Microsoft, Akamai, Linksys, HTC, Epson, MSI, Tactical technologies INC., GoDaddy, Cyberdyne, Cisco, Gmail, Vodafone, and DLink. Researchers believe that this filter server was the only one used by attackers while creating a backup and between August 15 and September 10.As far as the origin of hackers is concerned, Avast claims that it has solid evidence such as the PHP code on the C&C server, myPhpAdmin logs and some code snippets, which suggests the involvement of China\u2019s Axiom APT.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Bleeping Computer reported that security firm Kaspersky Lab and Cisco last week. Furthermore, Avast also claims that the logins and login activity patterns on the two servers point out to a person residing in the Eastern Russia, India and China timezones.

According to a report from Yonhap news agency, police carried out a comprehensive investigation and concluded that North Korea is directly responsible for cyber attacks on dozens of email accounts belonging to employees of four main bitcoin exchanges in South Korea.More: Hackers Steal Billions in S.Korean Won by Hacking 4th Largest Bitcoin ExchangeIt is being alleged that North Korean hackers sent emails with malware to the employees between July and August 2017. These hackers pulled off such a feat by pretending to be security authorities while the emails were sent to a single IP address, which was found to be associated with previous hacking incidents against Seoul where North Korea was found to be involved. Moreover, according to the Police, North Korea sent test emails before launching the actual attack via infected emails because the location of origin of those test emails has been traced back to North Korea.It is worth noting that North Korea has been sanctioned heavily by the UNO on the grounds of its nuclear and missile programmes. Therefore, one has every reason to speculate that the country is looking for ways to obtain funds through digital currency. However, so far there is no report about stealing of digital currency or compromising of computers in any of the reported hacking incidents from North Korea.Hackers used spearphishing method to launch attacks, and it is apparent that cryptocurrencies have emerged as \u2018an asset class\u2019 and have become the target of interest of regimes that operate as a \u2018criminal enterprise\u2019 too, stated security firm FireEye\u2019s analyst Luke McNamara in his report on the hacking incidents.\u201cThese are essentially places where people can buy or sell cryptocurrencies \u2026 like bitcoin or Ethereum. It\u2019s similar to how you might trade on the stock market, but specifically for cryptocurrencies,\u201d wrote McNamara.The reason for targeting South Korean is quite clear though; the country happens to be world\u2019s busiest trading centers as far as digital or cryptocurrency is concerned. Bithumb is the world\u2019s largest exchange for virtual currency Ethereum, which is located in Seoul.\u201cIf you also look at the amount of daily trading volume in South Korea, it\u2019s pretty significant and makes up a big portion of the global trading encrypted currencies. It makes logical sense that if you\u2019re interested in stealing bitcoin, these exchanges are a big centralized target to focus on,\u201d explained McNamara.FireEye report also pointed out that the hacking group behind these attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges is state-sponsored and working with the Kim Jong-un regime. The regime has shifted its focus on virtual currency because such transactions are usually anonymized, and hence, through them, North Korea can easily control money laundering in traditional markets.FireEye reported earlier in September that North Korean hackers attacked at least three cryptocurrency exchanges since May while investigation revealed that four exchanges had been targeted so far.

We believe that it was an experiment conducted by Showtime to raise money, but the possibility of hacking cannot be rejected as well. Regardless of how the code appeared on these websites, it is a fact that using crypto mining JavaScript injections to raise money and use as a substitute of advertising has become an increasingly popular trend nowadays.Security analyst Troy Mursch identified the use of crypto miners by Showtime websites. Mursch claims that it is quite resentful that CBS has enabled the mining software without any request or notification to its subscribers.around 60% of the CPU capacity of visitors was being used by the mining software the entire time any of these two websites were sitting idle in their browsers. When CBS got a hint of the exposure of its practices, it immediately removed the mining tech from the websites, but Mursch had saved screenshots from the websites before, during and after the miner was run.This has been ongoing for 7 hours.

According to Kromtech Security Centre\u2019s research, login data of more than half a million records of SVR Tracking was leaked online making the personal and vehicle-related information of organizations using the devices and drivers potentially vulnerable.According to Bob Diachenko from Kromtech: \u201cThe overall number of devices could be much larger given the fact that many of the resellers or clients had large numbers of devices for tracking. In the age where crime and technology go hand in hand, imagine the potential danger if cybercriminals could find out where a car is by logging in with the credentials that were publicly available online and steal that car?\u201dThe data was available in publicly accessible Amazon Web Services S3 bucket where nearly 540,642 SVR accounts\u2019 information is present. The data included email addresses, passwords, license plates and VIN/vehicle identification numbers.Kromtech claims that although the available data is of roughly half a million vehicles, there are cases where multiple vehicles are linked with a single record. Currently, the duration for which data remained exposed is not confirmed, but SVR Tracking immediately resolved the issue as soon as it was notified.SVR\u2019s data leak has also exposed 339 logs, containing a large number of vehicle records such as maintenance records, GPS service data, vehicle pictures and some important documents detailing contract information with 427 car dealerships, which use services of SVR Tracking. The data was stored in a backup folder titled \u201caccounts,\u201d and this folder contained the 540,642 records.The issue is related to a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket. Reportedly, the bucket was not configured appropriately, which is why it was publicly accessible for a certain, unidentified timespan. This was when the data breach occurred. The cache was firstly discovered on 18th September while the AWS bucket was closed when Kromtech informed SVR on 20th September.SVR Tracking is known for providing expert, reliable Vehicle Recovery solutions through 24/7 surveillance devices installed in automobiles. The basic objective of these devices is to prevent the vehicle from being stolen or towed. To ensure 24/7 monitoring, the device has to provide live updates of the location of the vehicle, which is a continuous process that is conducted at every two minutes interval when the vehicle is mobile and after every four hours when it is immobile. Vehicle owners can access data of the past 120 days. It must be noted that the device is installed at a secret location inside the vehicle; therefore, any unauthorized individual cannot notice it.As we mentioned that the vehicle owner can access location of the car in the past 120 days but it relies upon having access to accurate login credentials for the SVR app. The app is compatible with desktops, laptops and all mobile devices. The SVR passwords are hashed with other random data but the problem is that the protection level, which is SHA-1, is quite weak. This means it is very easy for a hacker to crack SVR passwords.Kromtech researchers have been quite active these days. Previously, the security firm discovered database of 3 million WWE fans.

Experian is a big-three credit bureau that offers a free online service to consumers with which they can ask for a PIN when they want to unlock their consumer credit file which is frozen at Experian.

The flaw relies on social engineering tactics and needs advanced skills, but it is exploitable, says Krebs.The exploitation is performed after submitting personal verification information on Experian, which is a multiple step process. The first stage requires that the attacker must provide personal information of the victim including the person\u2019s name, address, Social Security number and date-of-birth. You might be thinking that acquiring Social Security number would be difficult for someone but given that Equifax data breach exposed identifiable information of about 143 million US citizens including the Social Security number, therefore, it is most likely that attackers would grab it in Experian\u2019s case as well.In the next stage, attackers need to provide an email address along with confirmation that the submitter is providing verified information about himself. Lastly, Experian requires people to submit an answer to four \u201cknowledge-based authentication\u201d questions to prove the identity. This can be understood as the last layer of defense against unauthorized access to credit accounts. However, the downside of this method is that it can easily be aced by a seasoned hacker as it just requires a bit of research on the internet to gain necessary information about the targeted individual. These questions are presented in the format of multiple choices where the submitter has to select an answer from four different options. For instance, there could be a question about the city you have previously resided in with four options so a quick search about the person on social media or elsewhere would most definitely reveal this detail.It is true that the PIN could be compromised, but it is also true that despite these shortcomings consumers need to freeze their credit accounts as it serves as an additional layer of security to prevent fraud and identity exposure.

Reportedly, the infected CCleaner software was distributed to nearly 700,000 customers between 15th August and 12th September. Newest details related to this hack attack reveal that a state-sponsored hacker group might be involved in the attack while mainstream tech giants were the real targets of hackers.Previously Avast maintained that the malware payload was never delivered to customers and therefore, there was no damage caused. However, latest revelations point out that the scope of the damage is far greater than what we have been told so far because it is indeed true that the payload was delivered effectively. Unarguably, the objective of distributing malware at such a massive scale was to gain access to the servers and networks of around high-profile tech firms including Google, Microsoft, Intel, Vodafone, SinTel, VMware, HTC, Sony, Samsung, D-Link, Akamai, Linksys, and Cisco.It must be noted that CCleaner software removes unwanted data like temporary files and cookies and scan for malware and other data monitoring software on Windows-based systems. As per researchers, the malicious code was added to the software before its compilation, which means the hackers had access to Piriform, CCleaner\u2019s development infrastructure providing firm. Avast acquired Piriform in July.Cisco\u2019s research team got hands on a copy of the C&C server of the hackers where they discovered detailed logs of over 700,000 computers. These computers had communicated with the hackers earlier in September. Further investigation revealed that the hackers weren\u2019t at all interested in a majority of the infected customers, which led the researchers to believe that this was actually a well-designed, state-sponsored attack. The attack was targeted towards major tech firms, and the motive was to access and copy trade secrets and internal data of these organizations. Thus, Cisco\u2019s researchers concluded that what they have been treating as a \u201crun-of-the-mill mass cybercrime scheme\u201d was a \u201cstate-sponsored spying operation\u201d in reality.Security experts are divided regarding which group could be involved. Cisco Talos highlighted that the presence of malware in CCleaner software has the same code that is linked with a notorious yet sophisticated hacking group called Group 72 or Axiom. As cited by Motherboard, the group was noted to be involved by security firm Novetta in a Chinese government operation back in 2015. Another security firm FireEye hasn\u2019t named any particular hacker group as yet but believes that state actors are involved:\u201cFireEye found infrastructure overlap with a nation-state threat actor. CCleaner is used in lots of orgs (even if primarily consumer-focused).

Nonetheless, after the emergence of new information, Avast finally conceded that what they have been claiming so far that the multi-stage payload was never delivered was a false claim, however, now the company states that the second stage payload was sent to nearly 8 companies, and affected machines are in \u201cthe order of hundreds.\u201d\u201cThe server logs indicated 20 machines in a total of 8 organizations to which the 2nd stage payload was sent, but given that the logs were only collected for little over three days, the actual number of computers that received the 2nd stage payload was likely at least in the order of hundreds.\u201dCisco has warned targeted tech firms that the problem cannot be fixed by deleting CCleaner software because the payload might have installed the second payload on their networks and the C&C server might still be actively communicating with it.Cisco\u2019s blog post is available here while Avast\u2019s blog post can be read here.", "topics": ["avast", "backdoor", "CCleaner", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Privacy", "Scam", "security"], "title": "CCleaner Backdoor Attack: A State-sponsored Espionage Campaign", "date": "September 22, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Database on Amazon Web Services Containing Sensitive Data of Viacom Is Publicly Available.Amazon Web Services S3 is in the news for all the wrong reasons as its Cloud storage has been found leaking massive amounts of data.

California based security firm UpGuard has noted that the data present in the leaked database might have compromised various company properties so far.Cyber Risk Research director at UpGuard Chris Vickery, who discovered the leaked database, identified 72 .tgz files demonstrating irregular backups of technical files while folders are bearing the names manifests,\u201d \u201cconfigs,\u201d \u201ckeys,\u201d and \u201cmodules.\u201d The database was created in June 2017, as per UpGuard researchers. The backups have been identified as incremental and were located in a subdomain called \u2018mcs-puppet.\u2019Here, the term MCS refers to the group Multiplatform Compute Services that support the infrastructure of not one or two but hundreds of online properties owned by Viacom such as MTV and Nickelodeon, etc. It seems like MCS was in the process of transferring its infrastructure to AWS to launch production workloads on Amazon ECS or other containers that\u2019s why it uploaded backup data on AWS, which has been leaked now. Analysis of the leaked data reveals that it contains a master provisioning server running Puppet, which is also available publicly. The leaked database also contains secret cloud keys of Viacom, which can help attackers in launching all sorts of attacks. According to Dan O\u2019Sullivan from UpGuard:\u201cThe credentials needed to build and maintain Viacom servers across the media empire\u2019s many subsidiaries and dozens of brands.\u201dAlong with passwords and Viacom, servers manifests, the presence of access key and secret key for AWS account is quite worrisome because accessing the bucket would compromise the Viacom servers, storage, and other databases so attackers can easily launch phishing scams or abuse the IT systems of the multinational corporation for a botnet.\u201cAnalysis reveals that a number of cloud instances used within Viacom\u2019s IT toolchain, including Docker, New Relic, Splunk, and Jenkins, could\u2019ve thus been compromised in this manner,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan.The leaked database was discovered on August 30, and UpGuard immediately notified Viacom; the company responded quickly and closed the gaps within merely a few hours. In its statement, Viacom claimed to be trying to diminish the risk posed by the leaking of its database. According to Viacom spokesperson:\u201cOnce Viacom became aware that information on a server\u2014including technical information, but no employee or customer information\u2014was publicly accessible, we rectified the issue. We have analyzed the data in question and determined there was no material impact.\u201dWhile O\u2019Sullivan points out that this incident is a clear reminder of the \u201cpotentially enormous\u201d cost of this sort of massive data leaks from worlds leading organizations.\u201cExposed in this incident were nothing less than the master controls needed to harness the power of a digital media empire and turn it towards nefarious aims,\u201d noted O\u2019Sullivan.Previous findings by UpGuard:On June 1st, 2017: Secret Pentagon Files Left Unprotected on the Amazon Server On June 21st, 2017: 200 Million US Citizens Got Their Personal Data Exposed On July 12th, 2017: 14 Million Verizon Customer Records Exposed On August 17th, 2017: An electronic voting firm exposed 1.8M Chicagoans data On September 4, 2017: Trove of Private Military Contractor Job Applicants Exposed Online", "topics": ["Amazon", "breach", "database", "Hollywood", "internet", "Phishing", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "title": "Massive Viacom Data Exposed Through Amazon Web Services", "date": "September 22, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "Another \u2018Aggressive\u2019 Locky ransomware campaign launched with 20 million attacks in a single day.Barracuda Advanced Technology Group (BATG) has identified an \u2018aggressive\u2019 Locky ransomware threat launched in about 20 million attacks on the very first day, and the campaign seemingly has started just yet.On Tuesday BATG stated that it was \u2018actively monitoring an aggressive ransomware threat that appears to come in the largest volume from Vietnam,\u201d while the number of attacks was rapidly \u2018growing.\u2019 According to the blog post, India, Colombia, Greece, and Turkey are other prominent targets of attackers, but the volume of attacks is comparatively low in these regions.In their blog post, it was revealed that the attacks were initially launched in a generic email and later as \u2018Herbalife\u2019 brand email impersonating to be a \u2018copier file delivery.\u2019 However, researchers identified another email from the same campaign but with a different approach as it had the subject line \u201cEmailing \u2013\u201c followed by the name of the file attached in the email such as \u201cEmailing \u2014 10008009158.\u201dReportedly, around 6,000 fingerprints have been discovered hinting upon the fact that the attacks are generated automatically through a template that can randomize portions of the files.

These signals are recorded by an attacker through a video camera.The embedded data is then decoded and beamed to an infected camera from where they are intercepted and decoded by the malware. The two-way channel is established by the malware to allow attackers to communicate with compromised networks despite being air-gapped. This channel transmits data from a video camera to the attacker.The purpose of instilling IR light is to make the camera capable of seeing in the dark without illuminating the surroundings. If these cameras are hacked, the attackers can easily flash the IR light on and off to transfer data to anyone that comes in the range of the camera. The disturbing part is that all of this would be conducted secretly.Moreover, once hacked the lens of these cameras can receive additional commands when the hackers aim IR light signals at it. Believe it or not but hackers can aim any network even those that aren\u2019t linked to the camera.Now consider this scenario; if the attackers get malware to be installed on the publicly viewable surveillance camera with IR capabilities connected to the attackers\u2019 network then they can use it as a modem and control the malware or steal/manipulate the data.Researchers claimed that attackers can also communicate with these surveillance cameras from tens of thousands of meters distance. So data could be easily leaked from any network at 20 bit/sec bit rate per camera and deliver the data at a bit rate of over 100 bit/sec per camera. When more than one camera is involved then the bit rate may become higher than this.

The CCleaner\u2019s cloud version 1.07 was affected.CCleaner, a subsidiary of anti-virus giant Avast and security software for Windows was compromised by hackers last month potentially allowing them to take control of a device by inserting a backdoor that might have downloaded malicious software including malware, ransomware, spyware or keyloggers \u2013 Currently, there are approximately 2.5 million affected users while the company claims it has had over 2 billion total downloads by November of 2016.The targeted CCleaner software that was bought by Avast in July 2017 from its original developers Piriform allows Windows users (and other OS) to scan and clean unwanted files (including temporary internet files, where malicious programs and code tend to reside) and invalid Windows Registry entries from a computer. But according to security researchers at Cisco Talos, the software itself was compromised by a backdoor and compared it to the dangerous Petya dick viper attack that originated from Ukraine, spread across Europe and also targeted firms in the United States.According to Cisco Talos\u2019 blog post, the download server for CCleaner was compromised with a backdoor on September 11, 2017, and the firm was able to identify the threat on September 13, 2017.\u201cWe identified that even though the downloaded installation executable was signed using a valid digital signature issued to Piriform, CCleaner was not the only application that came with the download. During the installation of CCleaner 5.33, the 32-bit CCleaner binary that was included also contained a malicious payload that featured a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) as well as hardcoded Command and Control (C2) functionality. We confirmed that this malicious version of CCleaner was being hosted directly on CCleaner\u2019s download server as recently as September 11, 2017,\u201d said Cisco.\u201cIn reviewing the Version History page on the CCleaner download site, it appears that the affected version (5.33) was released on August 15, 2017. On September 12, 2017, version 5.34 was released. The version containing the malicious payload (5.33) was being distributed between these dates. This version was signed using a valid certificate that was issued to Piriform Ltd by Symantec and is valid through 10/10/2018. Piriform was the company that Avast recently acquired and was the original company who developed the CCleaner software application,\u201d Cisco further explained.Update your CCleanerAvast has acknowledged the attack and urged users to update CCleaner software to version 5.34 or higher. In a blog post, vice president of product at Piriform Paul Yung wrote that \u201cBased on further analysis, we found that the 5.33.6162 version of CCleaner and the 1.07.3191 version of CCleaner Cloud was illegally modified before it was released to the public, and we started an investigation process. \u201cThe threat has now been resolved in the sense that the rogue server is down, other potential servers are out of the control of the attacker.\u201cUsers of CCleaner Cloud version 1.07.3191 have received an automatic update. In other words, to the best of our knowledge, we were able to disarm the threat before it was able to do any harm.\u201d However, free users of CCleaner are urged to update the software manually since the \u201cfree version\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically update itself. Therefore, users have to do it manually.Statement from MorphisecIn an email conversation with Israeli cybersecurity firm Morphisec, HackRead was told that Morphisec stopped the attack in August, as documented by the attack reports in their customers\u2019 management console. Some customers have this reporting part of Morphisec\u2019s solution onsite. However, Morphisec has no visibility into what exactly they stopped.In some cases, customers send Morphisec their attack reports because they have a special interest in some prevented attack. That was the case with the CCleaner attacks. The customer shared with Morphisec the attack report, which also included the attack via CCleaner Morphisec prevented. Michael Gorelik, VP R&D, Michael and the R&D department started to look into that report because they discovered a security app was part of the attack chain.According to Michael Gorelik, \u201cWe strongly believe that each security vendor has the responsibility to inform software companies about threat discovered in their software. We were the first to contact Avast about the threat and shared all the information we could to help them. Luckily, we were able to heavily rely on the unique attack log our solution generates. We are happy to have contributed to the resolution of a threat concerning so many Avast users.\u201d\u201cA backdoor transplanted into a security product through its production chain presents a new unseen threat level which poses a great risk and shakes customers\u2019 trust. As such, we immediately, as part of our responsible disclosure policy, contacted Avast and shared all the information required for them to resolve the issue promptly. Customers safety is our top concern,\u201d said Gorelik.Gorelik and his team discovered this on September 11, at which time they informed Avast (exact timing was September 12, 8:35 a.m. PST). Morphisec received confirmation from Avast that without Morphisec\u2019s alert, they wouldn\u2019t have been aware of the current threat.Read Morphisec\u2019s findings here.At the moment it is unclear who is behind this attack but based on its success it is easy to guess that the attack was highly sophisticated and attackers knew what they were on to.

Fitbit manufactures both.The analysis revealed that there was indeed a way through which communication between fitness tracker device and cloud server could be intercepted. It is worth noting that the data captured by the fitness tracker device is transmitted to a cloud server for further analysis. Hence, by intercepting their communication, it is quite easy for anyone to access personal information and also generate fake activity logs/records.The researchers also demonstrated that the end-to-end encryption system that is responsible for protecting the data on the device could be circumvented.

This particular app was downloaded millions of times, and hence data from such an astounding number of devices was leaked due to this app.Security experts observed a stark similarity between these malware, which is that the number of infected devices is not in hundreds or thousands but millions in both instances.

OurMine is a recent example of a hacking group using leaked passwords of LinkedIn users to hack their accounts on other sites.Recently, a new phishing scam has been detected in which Premium LinkedIn accounts are being used to trick users into giving away their login credentials and phone numbers in the hands of cybercriminals.The scam was discovered by Malwarebytes\u2018 lead malware intelligence analyst J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura who noticed that unsuspecting users have been receiving phishing links in private message and InMail hiding behind URL shortener ow.ly and gdk.mx a free hosting provider.The message comes with following content:\u201cI have just shared a document with you using GoogleDoc Drive, View shared document http://ow.ly/[].\u201dUpon clicking the link, users are taken on a compromised website hosting a Gmail phishing page that asks them to log in with their Gmail id and passwords. It further asks for a phone number, and secondary email then displays a decoy Wells Fargo document hosted on Google Docs.

Currently, it is unknown how many Premium accounts are being used to spread this scam.Here is an example phish message sent to InMail feature:\u201cThis kind of attack via social media is not new \u2013 we have seen hacked Skype, or Facebook accounts send spam \u2013 but it reminds us of how much more difficult it is to block malicious activity when it comes from long-standing and trusted user accounts, not to mention work acquaintances or relatives. This also makes such attacks more credible to potential victims and can lead to a snowball effect when victims become purveyors of phishing links themselves,\u201d Segura wrote.This is not the first time when cybercriminals have used LinkedIn for phishing attacks. In November 2016, a scam used Dropbox as bait to not only steal LinkedIn login credentials but also aimed at financial details, driving license and passport copy for identity theft.LinkedIn and other Internet users are advised not to open messages or emails from an unknown sender, never click or download attachments from an email whose sender is not known to them.

According to analysis, some of the documents released online are of sensitive nature.The group\u2019s latest target Vevo is also no ordinary firm at all as it is a joint venture of a number of mainstream music firms namely Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, Google\u2019s parent firm Alphabet Inc., Warner Music Group and Abu Dhabi Media.The cache of internal files that have been posted online by OurMine comprises of official documents, promotional content, and videos.

It is time that the company invested some of its earnings in tightening its site\u2019s security.OurMine is known for targeting famous organizations\u2019 websites or social media accounts of known celebrities to demonstrate how weak the security measures implemented by these high profile firms are. To hack Vevo and acquire such massive amount of data; OurMine hackers hijacked Okta account of a Vevo employee. Okta is a workplace app. When the data was hacked, the group reached out to the employee and was told to \u201cfuck off\u201d therefore the hackers posted the data online and sent Gizmodo an email stating that they would remove the data if the company asks them to do so. When Vevo was inquired about the data breach, a spokesperson admitted that Vevo has experienced data breach caused by a \u201cphishing scam via LinkedIn.\u201d As per the spokesperson, the company was currently busy in investigating the \u201cextent of exposure\u201d and addressing the issue.In an email conversation with HackRead, Rich Campagna, CEO at Bitglass said that \u201cAcquiring credentials to access sensitive data is increasingly easy and incredibly lucrative for today\u2019s hackers. The ease with which credentials can be compromised starts with risky behavior among users. Many end-users, for example, have a habit of recycling passwords across corporate and personal accounts, including personal social media, banking, and corporate email. This practice poses a risk to all data accessible to that user. Enterprises must follow best practices in authenticating users, starting with a proactive approach to identifying suspicious logins. Dynamic identity management solutions that can detect potential intrusions, require multi-factor authentication, and integrate with existing systems for managing user access can be much more effective than basic password protection. For example, if a system records an employee logging into a cloud application from a host of different countries, it can alert IT security teams of suspicious behavior and they can lock that account, preventing a possible breach.\u201dRemember, OurMine is known for using leaked credentials from previous data leaks including MySpace, LinkedIn, and Dropbox. So far, the group is known for various high profile breaches so far including the hijacking of WikiLeaks\u2019 website, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Pinterest and Twitter accounts and HBO\u2019s Twitter handle, has admitted having conducted the data breach.

Based on its extensive use the IT security researchers at Sophos have discovered that there is a new RAT malware called Kedi that uses Gmail to steal data from the targeted computer. The malware relies upon spear phishing mechanism for its distribution. The infected email opens a 32-bit Mono/.Net Windows executable that is written in C# language. The malware is disguised as a Citrix utility, but once it invades the targeted device, it changes its guise into an Adobe file and installs itself in Adobe\u2019s %Appdata% folder. The registry starter hook shows this path: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \u201cAdobe Updates\u201d = c:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\reader_sl.exeWhile the infected endpoint is stored at: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\DefaultVisualStyle \u201cHR\u201d = <md5 of machine name>Kedi RAT can evade security scanners and uses Gmail to create a connection with its C&C server. The main objective of spreading Kedi RAT is to steal data. The malware can perform a variety of functions most of which are command-driven, such as it is equipped with AntiVM/anti-sandbox features, it can upload and download backdoors, serve as a keylogger, capture screenshots, run embedded payloads and extract them too along with extracting usernames, domains, and computer IDs.None of these functions are extraordinary but what makes it different and somewhat more efficient is that it can use Basic HTML version of Gmail as its main source for communicating with its C&C server while it can also use DNS and HTTPS requests to communicate.Through Gmail, the malware receives instructions from the attackers for performing its functions as well as it \u201cnavigates to the inbox, finds the last unread message, grabs content from the message body and parses commands from this content. To send information back to command and control, base64 encodes the message data, replies to the received message, adds encoded message data and sends its message,\u201d explains Sophos\u2019 blog post.Sophos discovered the spear phishing attack last week, and it is not clear whether Kedi is involved in any other widespread campaign, but it is quite possible that it starts targeting more users soon enough. Therefore, if you want to stay protected, it is important to be cautious while opening links or documents received via email from the unauthorized or unknown sender. Users must also keep their operating systems and all installed applications updated with latest security patches and install updated version of an anti-virus application.", "topics": ["backdoor", "Fraud", "gmail", "internet", "keylogger", "Malware", "Phishing", "Scam", "security", "TROJAN", "Windows"], "title": "Disguised as Citrix Utility, Kedi RAT Exploits Gmail to Transfer Data", "date": "September 14, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Kromtech\u2019s security researchers have identified two point-of-sale (POS) malware strains namely AlinaPOS and JackPOS hosted on more than 4,000 ElasticSearch servers. It is the same platform that was targeted in the MongoDB ransomware campaign. In total there are over 15,000 servers on ElasticSearch that don\u2019t possess any authentication and password protection while the POS malware strains are hidden in more than 4,000 servers. It is surprising that the infections have been there since 2016 while the latest infection activity was noted in August 2017. Researchers also discovered that the two malware strains are now available for sale on the Dark Web hacking forums while cyber criminals have been using them since 2012. The command and control servers of the two malware strains run on the infected hosts. Therefore, every infected server at ElasticSearch becomes part of a wider POS Botnet network providing command and control facility to POS malware clients, who then collect, encrypt and transfer sensitive financial data like credit card information. The data is stolen from infected Windows based computers, POS terminals and/or RAM. What\u2019s even more surprising is the fact that almost 99% of these infected servers are hosted in AWS/Amazon Web Services, which is an otherwise trusted source. According to the blog post from Bob Diachenko from Kromtech security, the reason of distribution of infection is that when taking up offers of free AWS T2 micro instance from AWS, which is part of the Elastic Compute Cloud, users skip the necessary security configuration to ensure quick installation. This offer is available for versions 1.5.2 or 2.3.2 of ElasticSearch only and this simple mistake have serious consequences such as sensitive data is exposed to cyber criminals. This hints at the fact that the malware acquires full administrative privileges on the infected machines. \u201cThe absence of authentication on some ElasticSearch servers allowed attackers to take full administrative control on the exposed instance. This opened a range of possibilities for them \u2013 starting from the hidden use of resources and remote code execution to complete destruction of previously saved data,\u201d noted Diachenko.But why cyber criminals opted to host the malware strains on Amazon? The reason, according to Diachenko, is that on AWS we get a free T2 micro (EC2) instance of around 10 GB of disk space. Diachenko explains why hackers opted for ElasticSearch servers: \u201cThe main reason for malicious actors to use ES servers is that (if open) their configuration allows not only read but write/install external files without additional confirmation. ES interface (Kibana) does not see these files. It\u2019s highly effective because even if one or several infected servers shut down, the rest will work as usual and stolen cc data will be processed in other ways.\u201dKromtech has notified Amazon as well as the affected organizations regarding the hidden POS malware strains. A majority of the affected systems are located in the US. When the malware takes over control of a machine, cybercriminals can remotely access the server\u2019s resources. This allows criminals to steal, delete or save the data stored on the server. It is, therefore, important that Sysadmins check their ElasticSearch requests and duly patch or reinstall and block the external ports. \u201cReinstall all compromised systems. Otherwise, you need to clean up all suspicious processes, check your systems with antivirus and also monitor you system during next three months for any anomaly connection,\u201d says Diachenko.", "topics": ["Amazon", "Botnet", "Cyber Crime", "Fraud", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "MongoDB", "Ransomware", "Scam", "security"], "title": "4,000 ElasticSearch servers found hosting PoS malware", "date": "September 14, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Usually, a bug bounty program helps companies secure their software and products from zero day vulnerabilities that can cause massive damage if cyber criminals get their hands on them.But Zerodium, an American information security company, and premium zero-day acquisition platform have launched a Tor Browser Zero-Day Bounty; the purpose of which is to get hackers and security researchers to find zero-day flaws in Tor browser on Tails Linux and Windows operating system and report it to the company.In return, Zerodium will award a sum of $1 million to the successful participant.

Another important rule to keep in mind is that while JavaScript exploits are eligible for submission, a hacker with fully functional zero-day exploit without JavaScript will go home with more money.Furthermore, the submission report research must rely on exclusive, unknown, unpublished, and unreported zero-days, and must bypass all exploit mitigations applicable to each target category.

In August, the company launched a program to hack Messenger apps such as Telegram, WeChat, iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal and Facebook Messenger.The company also invited hackers to find zero-day flaws in iPhone and remotely hack the device and receive $1,500,000 in return. Moreover, platforms like Windows 10, Chrome, Firefox, and WordPress, etc. are also in line for the hackers to try their skills.However, since the company has suggested that these exploits will be shared with government it will be important to see the response from privacy advocates since Microsoft a couple of months ago slammed government agencies for not sharing vulnerabilities with manufacturers and piling up codes of software that can be easily stolen by hackers and exploited for their own unscrupulous gain.Tor network itself launched its first public bug bounty program back in July this year.

The patch, (OS Build 15063.608), was part of Microsoft\u2019s monthly \u201cPatch Tuesday\u201d series containing security updates for 85 different flaws including the serious .NET framework flaw that allowed hacking of targeted computers through malicious MS Office attachments.The update was released on Tuesday and offers security updates for all versions of Microsoft Windows as well as other products. However, the most important vulnerability that it patches is the .NET framework flaw that affected Windows 10 systems.Regarding the vulnerability, Microsoft wrote on its advisory page that:\u201cA remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework processes untrusted input. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability in software using the .NET framework could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\u201dThe vulnerability has been codenamed CVE-2017-8759. It affected the .NET programming framework and allowed remote code execution. According to FireEye security firm which discovered this vulnerability, the flaw was exploited through a malicious MS Office document uploaded in rich text format (RTF) while the exploitation occurred in July 2017. This flaw attempted to install FinFisher or FinSpy spyware developed by the UK based Gamma Group specifically for law enforcement agencies. However, FireEye did not point out which agency deployed FinFisher/FinSpy spyware.FireEye also noted that the zero-day vulnerability that allowed installation of malware on Windows systems is the second flaw that has been identified in Windows OS this year. As per FireEye researcher\u2019s analysis, apart from selling the spyware to law enforcement, financially motivated cyber criminals also benefitted from it.\u201cThese exposures demonstrate the significant resources available to \u2018lawful intercept\u2019 companies and their customers. Furthermore, Finspy has been sold to multiple clients, suggesting the vulnerability was being used against other targets,\u201d FireEye said.FireEye has described the flaw as a SOAP WSDL parser code injection vulnerability. That\u2019s because it allowed malware to inject arbitrary code in the definition contents of SOAP WSDL while the attachments responsible for inserting the malware were identified as a common attack vector. The .NET flaw scrubbed malicious input from data that was fed to the Web Services Description Language (WSDL).The attacker compelled Windows user to open the email containing the malicious document or application. Once injected, the code created a process for retrieving an HTA script, which in turn deleted the source code and library to download and execute \u201cleft.jpg\u201d file. Don\u2019t be confused by this file\u2019s classification as a JPG image since it was everything else than an image file. It was an executable document and instantly installed FinSpy spyware, a malware that used heavily obscured coding as well as built-in virtual machine to hide its functions.Microsoft believes that the NEODYMIUM group carried out the attack exploiting the .NET framework flaw because the same group previously exploited a similar zero-day vulnerability using spear-phishing attachments to install FinFisher spyware.Patch Tuesday includes patches for some important vulnerabilities along with the serious .NET framework flaw including Remote Code Execution patches for MS Office, Internet Explorer 11 and Edge and patch for a BlueBorne BlueTooth flaw that allowed attackers to hack Windows PCs, Android and Linux devices.", "topics": ["Bluetooth", "Flaw", "internet", "Malware", "Microsoft", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability", "Windows"], "title": "Microsoft Patches 85 Flaws, One Allowed FinFisher Spyware Installation", "date": "September 13, 2017"}, {"authur": "Carolina", "body": "Why hack websites when you can hack electronic sign boards for political reasons \u2013 That\u2019s excatly what happened in Modesto city as witnessed by local residents.On the eve of September 11, an electronic road sign in the city of Modesto, California was hacked and defaced with a message against the President of the United States Donald Trump.

(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});According to blog post by Jeff Williams, co-founder, and CTO of Contrast Security, the Struts vulnerability can either be CVE-2017-5638 (which was made public back in March 2017) or the recently exposed CVE-2017-9805 but he assumed it to be the former as it is much easier to exploit and his company has observed widespread use of CVE-2017-5638 over the past few months.Williams noted that as it is the norm, organizations took a long time, well over four months, to learn to deal with the CVE-2017-5638 because even in the leading organizations the gap between identification of a flaw and updating the applications is spread over months. That\u2019s why it isn\u2019t surprising that massive breaches are happening and the leading cause is Web application attacks.\u201cThe *average* Web application or API has 26.7 serious vulnerabilities. That is a staggering, unbelievable number. And organizations often have hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of applications,\u201d wrote Williams.On the other hand, Rene Gielen, vice president at Apache Struts, states that the team behind Struts induces great effort in \u201csecuring and hardening the software\u201d and always try to fix problems as soon as they are identified. However, Gielen urges that in order to prevent breaches like Equifax it is important for users to be sure about the supporting frameworks and libraries that are embedded in the software products they are using and also to keep themselves updated about the latest security announcements that might affect those products. Furthermore, users must always update supporting frameworks to ensure that there is speedy security fix in place for the vulnerable products. It is important because a majority of breaches take place because of failure in updating software components that have been identified as vulnerable to exploitation.In an email conversation with HackRead.com, Alex Smith, Director of Security Products at Intermedia said \u201cWhile the scale of the Equifax breach doesn\u2019t reach the heights of some previous breaches, such as Yahoo, it is by far the most invasive when you look at all the sensitive personal data accessed. Impacting 143 million consumers touches well over 50 percent of American\u2019s that rely on bank loans and credit scoring. This latest breach could have wide-reaching implications for how Americans identify themselves in the future, such as when applying for banking and credit services \u2013 simply knowing a name, date of birth, address and social security number shouldn\u2019t ever be enough. This breach could finally be the security wakeup call the US needs to widely adopt digital identity tokens, and potentially a digital national identity scheme similar to other countries such as Belgium.\u201d  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});", "topics": ["breach", "Cyber Attack", "Cyber Crime", "Data", "Equifax", "hacking", "internet", "Privacy", "security", "Vulnerability"], "title": "Equifax Hack Blamed on a Flaw in Apache Struts Framework", "date": "September 12, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Bashware Technique Can Exploit Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to Hide Malware Making 400 Million Computers Vulnerable.Security firm Checkpoint\u2019s researchers Gal Elbaz and Dvir Atias have discovered a new attack method that allows hackers hide all the known malware and bypass even the best security solutions. The attack technique has been dubbed as Bashware that gains control of the built-in Linux shell in Windows system and lets malware bypass the common security tools such as anti-ransomware and anti-virus software. Since Linux shell is available to Windows users, researchers fear that millions of computer systems running Windows 10 are currently at risk.For your information, WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux is a feature in Windows 10 that has recently been integrated into the system by Microsoft. The reason was to make it easier for developers to perform code testing in Linux and Windows. WSL currently is activated manually, but Bashware automates the process to enable WSL and execute malicious payloads stealthily.In their blog post, researchers claimed that they have named the technique Bashware because Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions. The currently available security solutions, as per Elbaz and Atias, are not yet adapted to track processes of Linux executable files that run on MS Windows. This allows cybercriminals to run malware without the fear of getting it detected and also use the features of WSL to hide from security software and programs because they haven\u2019t been integrated into the proper detection mechanisms.When they tried to infect Windows systems they were successful in bypassing the security software despite that the systems were equipped with the leading anti-virus and security products. This means Bashware is capable of affecting \u201cany of the 400 million computers currently running Windows 10 PC globally,\u201d read the blog post.According to their findings, Bashware possesses both user mode and kernel mode components due to which it becomes possible to create a fully compatible layer for initiating an environment that not just appears but also functions like Linux without needing to \u201cfire up any virtual machine.\u201dIt is worth noticing that Microsoft released containers called Pico processes that allowed the execution of ELF binaries on Windows. When unmodified Linux binaries are placed in Pico processes, the WSL forces Linux system\u2019s calls to be redirected into the Windows kernel. \u201cThe lxss.sys and lxcore.sys drivers translate the Linux system calls into NT APIs and emulate the Linux kernel,\u201d wrote Elbaz and Atias.Bashware loads the malware through a four-stage method which has been described by the researcher duo as a \u201cgeneric and cross-platform\u201d method utilizing WSL to ensure that both ELF and EXE malicious payloads are executed sneakily so that most credible security products could be bypassed. On the other hand, Bashware never leverages implementation flaws or any logic in WSL design.WSL is quite well-designed, wrote the researchers, so what lets Bashware function in the way it has been identified is the lack of awareness within the security solutions manufacturers and the fact that this is a relatively new technology abusing Windows OS in an entirely novel manner.\u201cBashware is so alarming because it shows how easy it is to take advantage of the WSL mechanism to allow any malware to bypass security products,\u201d wrote Checkpoint researchers.With Bashware, hackers don\u2019t need to write malicious codes for Linux and run them through WSL on MS Windows because Bashware installs software called Wine, which not just opens but also hides known Windows malware. However, to use Bashware, cybercriminals need to have the PC admin privileges on the targeted computer. This is not a big deal nowadays since hackers can easily acquire admin privileges through phishing attacks or use stolen credentials.\u201cWe believe that it is both vital and urgent for security vendors to support this new technology to prevent threats such as the ones demonstrated by Bashware,\u201d warned the researcher duo.To help security vendors in dealing with this kind of attack, Microsoft has taken necessary steps already. According to Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson, it is a low-risk issue since to use the method; hacker has to enable developer mode, install the component, reboot and install WSL, which is not an easy feat.Watch the attack demo below", "topics": ["hacking", "Infosec", "Linux", "Malware", "Microsoft", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability", "Windows", "Windows 10"], "title": "Bashware lets malware evade detection by exploiting Windows 10\u2032 Linux Shell", "date": "September 12, 2017"}, {"authur": "Uzair Amir", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});It looks like Google is finally taking serious measures to secure its most used product the Chrome web browser.

Dubbed Xafecopy by researchers, the malware has infected 4,800 users in 47 countries with over 37.5 percent damage identified by researchers in India followed by Mexico, Turkey, and Russia.The malware targets WAP billing payment method and steals money from a targeted devices without the knowledge of the victim. The malware is hidden in utility apps such as BatteryMaster and claims to save battery time, but in reality, once the app is installed it loads malicious code on the targeted device.From there, Xafecopy checks for websites with Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) billing feature and steals user money. The WAP billing is a type of mobile payment that charges fees directly to the user\u2019s smartphone bill without the need of putting login credentials of card data. However, to bypass the \u2018captcha\u2019 system developed to protect users from theft and spams; the malware uses JavaScript files.Furthermore, Xafecopy can also send SMS messages (most likely premium rate SMS), steal and delete incoming SMS messages.Previously, Ztorg malware was found following similar tactics by using JavaScript files to by pass captcha.Roman Unuchek, Senior Malware Analyst at Kaspersky Lab said that \u201cWAP billing can be particularly vulnerable to so-called \u2018clickjacking\u2019 as it has a one-click feature that requires no user authorization.

This is a feature in Microsoft OS that notifies developers about the drives that are newly registered. Therefore, the bug is quite serious as it renders security tools useless as it blocks the program\u2019s ability to detect malware threats.Related: OLE flaw lets malware infected PowerPoint files evade antivirus detectionAs per the blog post from security firm enSilo, the issue is a random one that originated from a \u201ccoding error in the Windows kernel\u201d while the error is present in the recently released version of Windows OS, the Windows 10 as well as the previous versions since the release of Windows 2000.It is rather ironic that the bug affects PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine since the basic purpose of this routine was to identify malware threats and prevent them from entering the Windows system. The routine was introduced as a method to notify registered drivers in different parts of the kernel when a \u201cPE image file\u201d is loaded to virtual memory, i-e, (kernel\\user space).Researchers identified that \u201cafter registering a notification routine for loaded PE images with the kernel the callback may receive invalid image names.\u201dThis means, when the registered notification routine was invoked, the kernel supplied a series of parameters, which then initiated proper identification of the PE image that was being loaded. The parameters are part of the prototype definition of the callback function.Security researcher Omri Misgav stated that Microsoft Security Response Center was notified about the bug, but the company doesn\u2019t see this as a critical security issue at all. enSilo founder and CTO Udi Yavo also noted that he notified Microsoft about the issue back in January but to no avail.\u201cThis flaw exists in the most recent Windows 10 release and past versions of the OS, dating back to Windows 2000\u201d\u201cThis bug has security implications on security vendors that rely on Microsoft documentation when using the API in order to monitor loaded files. Since there is no documentation of the bug and no formal workaround, this can potentially cause security vendors to miss malware. We are not aware of any intention to create a fix to this,\u201d Yavo told SecurityWeek.Yavo however, admitted that the routine doesn\u2019t function as it is being specified.\u201cSome references indicate the bug was somewhat known, but\u2026 its root cause and full implications weren\u2019t described in detail up until now,\u201d read the blog post on enSilo.To resolve the issue, Microsoft suggests using a file-system mini-filter callback to monitor PE image files loaded to the virtual memory as executable code. However, researchers claim that this method is useless because it cannot be used to determine if the section object is created for the loading of PE image file or not since enSilo researchers have noted that the parameter that identified the loaded PE image file effectively is the FullImageName parameter.They also claimed that kernel utilizes an entirely different format for FullImageName. The paths that are provided for dynamically loaded user-mode PE files don\u2019t have the volume name, and in some instances, the path is malformed to such an extent that it even points to a completely different file and sometimes it leads to a non-existent file altogether.Researchers conclude after thorough analysis that the Cache Manager and the way file-system driver maintains file name are responsible for the errors and a coding error eventually causes the invalid name issue to take place.Related: Microsoft not releasing patch for 20-year-old SMB flaw", "topics": ["hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Microsoft", "security", "Technology", "Vulnerability", "Windows", "Windows 10"], "title": "Security Apps Fail to Detect Malware Threats Due to Windows Kernel Bug", "date": "September 9, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "It\u2019s a fact that Android is one of the most vulnerable mobile operating systems and at the same time, people around the world widely use Samsung\u2019s smartphones.

Some of these can easily be exploited by remote hackers, and this would affect the intended operations of the device.ICS-CERT issued an advisory on Thursday in which it was reported that above-mentioned syringe infusion pump from Smiths Medical could be remotely exploited. It is worth noting that these pumps are used across the globe for delivering small doses of medicines from a syringe, and these are typically used in acute care settings.According to ICS-CERT, the purpose of syringe infusion pump is to accurately deliver medication in critical care patients such as neonatal and pediatric intensive care units as well as the operating room. Smiths Medical is one of the leading firms in the US that manufactures specialty medical devices.The company is currently trying to figure out the solutions for fixing the vulnerabilities in its wireless syringe infusion pumps, and the company has promised to release patches for the identified flaws in the upcoming version 1.6.1 of the device. The new version will be releasing in January 2018.An independent security researcher Scott Gayou has identified these vulnerabilities. As per the findings of Gayou, the flaws are present in version 1.1, 1.5 and 1.6 of the firmware. The researcher hasn\u2019t revealed much about the vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation until a patch is released, but it is being claimed that the flaws are highly severe and critical.According to ICS-CERT, the pump has one of the most critical of all security holes the \u2018CVE-2017-12725\u2019 which has CVSS score of 9.8 can automatically establish wireless network connection unless the default configuration of the device is changed.

Then there is the lack of authentication and hard-coded credential for the FTP server of the device issues that are tracked as CVE-2017-12720 and CVE-2017-12724. Another flaw is the lack of proper host certification authentication tracked as CVE-2017-12721. It makes the pump vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.Other flaws are of medium severity as these let the attacker crash the communications module of the device, authenticate to telnet through hard coded credentials and access passwords by exploiting the configuration files.Smiths Medical has suggested users assign static IP addresses to the device until a patch is released. Furthermore, the company urges customers to remain cautious about malicious DNS and DHCP servers or any malicious activity, set unique and strong passwords, create backups on a regular basis and to install the device on isolated networks only.ICS-CERT, on the other hand, suggests that the FTP server should be disabled, unused ports must be closed and the traffic is going to the pump must be duly monitored. There must be firewalls behind the devices and it is also advised that the pumps be disconnected temporarily from the networks until the patches are released.This is the second time in one month that a medical equipment has been found vulnerable to life threatening vulnerabilities.

It captures information using plugins to compromise webcam and microphone output along with documenting log keystrokes, carrying out surveillance and access external drives.The modular malware UNITEDRAKE is compatible with systems running on Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 up to Windows Server 2012. UNITEDRAKE is described as a \u201cfully extensible\u201d data collection tool that is specifically developed for Windows machines to allow operators the chance of controlling a device completely.As cited by ZDNet, the malware modules like FOGGYBOTTOM and GROK can successfully listen to and monitor communications, and keep a check on keystrokes, webcam, and microphone. When the task is completed, the malware is able to self-destruct. Understandably, the NSA developed this tool to carry out mass surveillance and performed bulk hacking.We first heard about UNITEDRAKE RAT back in 2014 when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed an array of confidential documents in a high-profile scandal exposing the espionage tactics used by the NSA for decades. Snowden revealed a glaring truth related to NSA spying tactics that the agency had been using multiple malware programs to infect not hundreds or thousands but millions of computers across the globe to acquire valuable, sensitive data.On the other hand, ShadowBrokers group made headlines in 2016 when it claimed to have robbed various exploitation tools used by the NSA including the notorious ETERNALBLUE that was a vital component in the WannaCry ransomware campaign causing damages to systems worldwide. The claim was proved to be authentic by security experts as well.ShadowBrokers has now decided to release two data dumps every month dubbed as the Monthly Dump Service. For its latest data dump, the group is expecting to receive 500 Zcash, a type of cryptocurrency, which facilitates secure, private transactions. It is worth noting that the current rate of Zcash is US$248 per unit or A$309.50 per unit.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The data dump also includes a UNITEDRAKE manual, which means the group is trying to generate additional interest among cyber criminals, vendors, and government groups to subscribe to services which provide access to the stolen exploits and malware models.According to ShadowBrokers, five NSA data dumps are in the pipeline currently and the group is demanding a whopping 16,000 Zcash for files to be released on November 15. Moreover, to further enlarge the profits, ShadowBrokers intend to make previous data dumps available again for purchase and this time the price range will be somewhere between 100 ZEC ($24,000) and 1600 ZEC ( $3.8m).The group\u2019s subscription service is currently operating discreetly. However, the members have started complaining about the tools not working as expected. A few months back one of its subscribers came out in public and complained that the \u201cWine of the month\u201d club was a fake scheme.", "topics": ["Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "LEAKS", "NSA", "RAT", "security", "Shadow Brokers", "Snowden", "Spying", "Surveillance"], "title": "New NSA Data Dump: ShadowBrokers Release UNITEDRAKE Malware", "date": "September 7, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "Google Chrome with 2 billion active users is the most used web browser in the world.

Well, that is exactly what happened in Japan when authorities got to know about a 13-year-old public junior high school (his name has not been revealed) who sold a computer malware because he needed money.Initially, the boy tried selling the malware on Twitter but since the social networking site doesn\u2019t provide money transfer option, the 13-year-old sold malicious software on Mercari, a mobile marketplace, The Japan News reported.According to Nara Prefectural Police\u2019s cyber crime unit, the teen admitted selling the malware to four other kids between the age of 14 and 19 because he needed money.The teen shared a website link with the four which hosted the malware designed for targeting several devices including iPhone.The boys have admitted buying the malware for pranks in exchange of \u00a5860 to \u00a51,500 worth of points from Mercari marketplace.The whole feat took place in March 2017, but the details of it have been revealed only now.

According to a group of researchers from Zhejiang University, the most popular of all voice assistants namely Siri and Alexa both contain a critical flaw. It must be noted that these apps cover almost every mobile platform including iOS and Android. Therefore, whether you carry an iPhone or a Nexus, your device is at risk. The team of researchers managed to translate typical audio commands into ultrasonic frequencies using the DolphinAttack method. These frequencies are much higher than the normal range audible by human ear; however, microphones and the voice assistant powering software can decipher them. It is a highly simple translation process, but through this technique, it is possible to control any gadget with words that are uttered in frequencies we cannot hear.Related: 4 Security Vulnerabilities That Affected Voice Recognition TechnologyThe research team stated that the commands could be anything from a simple command like \u201cHey Siri\u201d to forcing the iPhone to open a malicious website or even asking Nexus 7 to call on \u201c1234567890\u201d, or Amazon\u2019s Echo could be asked to \u201copen the backdoor.\u201d Attackers can easily push an Audi Q3 to change its navigational system settings and add a new location. The consequences are various and truly diverse, and not to forget dangerous as well. That\u2019s because adversaries can try to manipulate the software of voice assistant in any possible way. It is safe to say that the seemingly harmless, human-friendly UI programs have huge security repercussions.In the research paper, the team stated that (Pdf) the attacks could be made from a few inches distance so to hack gadgets like Apple Watch or Amazon Echo, the attacker has to be within the required distance. But hacking Apple iPhone was quite easy as the hacker can easily walk by you while you are on the road or at a public place. All they need to do is play their desired command in inaudible frequency. So, you can expect your browser such as Chrome or Safari to load a site, run a code, install the malware and let the cyber criminals access your phone easy to check out your communications and data.To check how each voice assistant reacted to hacking, the researchers used a smartphone and $3 hardware including small speaker and amp. They noted that the exploitation is enabled by both hardware and software problems. The software that powers voice assistants like Google Home, Siri and Alexa, and microphones installed in the device can pick up frequencies above the average human ear limit of 20khZ and perform all sorts of tasks as narrated to them by the hacker.The Chinese research team identified that every mainstream voice assistant has the same flaw when it comes to commands rendered from above 20khZ. We can assume that the higher the level of user-friendliness the greater will be the vulnerability of any software. We use web browsers that can collect cookies without notifying us to let marketers track us on the web; we store our data on the Cloud where hackers can easily steal it to sabotage our private lives; and now there are the voice assistants that although promise to made our life easier but actually can prove to be detrimental to our privacy.\u201cWe have tested these attacks on 16 VCS models including Apple iPhone, Google Nexus, Amazon Echo, and automobiles. Each attack is successful on at least one SR system. We believe this list is by far not comprehensive. Nevertheless, it serves as a wake-up call to reconsider what functionality and levels of human interaction shall be supported in voice controllable systems,\u201d said researchers.Their research will be presented at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Dallas, Texas from October 30th to November 3rd. However, a quick solution before the official one is turning off these apps by going into settings. How to disable Siri on iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch?Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button.Under Press and Hold to Speak, select one of these options:Siri: Siri will respond when you press the Home button.Voice Control: Classic Voice Control will respond when you press and hold the Home button. This will also turn off Siri.Off: There will be no response when you press and hold the Home button. This will also turn off Voice Control and Siri.How to disable Alexa App on Android devices?Open the Alexa app on your phone, tablet or in your web browser.Select skills from the sidebar menu.Find your desired skill and select it.Tap on enable to turn it on.Related: New App Will Stop Voice Hacks Using Smartphone CompassWatch the demonstration here:", "topics": ["Amazon", "Android", "Apple", "hacking", "iOS", "iPhone", "Privacy", "security", "Siri", "Voice Recognition", "Vulnerability"], "title": "DolphinAttack: Voice Assistant Apps Siri and Alexa Can Be Hacked", "date": "September 6, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "A few years back Lenovo Inc., a world famous and seemingly reliable laptop manufacturer firm headquartered in Beijing, found itself in hot waters due to the startling revelation that the company\u2019s laptops had pre-installed adware called VisualDiscovery developed by Superfish.The software was responsible for compromising security protections installed by the users on their laptops. It performed a man-in-the-middle attack on private and secure connections due to which attackers could gain free access to the system and spied on encrypted communications.Related: Study Reveals Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo Phones Contain Malware By-defaultLenovo although released a tool for deleting the adware back in 2015 but the act was challenged by a 32-state coalition in the court in 2015. After the two-and-half years long battle in the court, Lenovo has finally given in and agreed to pay $3.5 million by signing an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Connecticut, and 31 other states. The company has pledged to change the way it sells devices too. The settlement agreement was announced on Tuesday.The FTC issued the following statement to confirm the agreement:\u201cAs part of the settlement with the FTC, Lenovo is prohibited from misrepresenting any features of software preloaded on laptops that will inject advertising into consumers\u2019 internet browsing sessions or transmit sensitive consumer information to third parties.\u201dThe FTC further explained the stipulations Lenovo would have to abide by:\u201cThe company must also get consumers\u2019 affirmative consent before pre-installing this type of software. In addition, the company is required for 20 years to implement a comprehensive software security program for most consumer software preloaded on its laptops. The security program will also be subject to third-party audits.\u201dLenovo has maintained the stance that it doesn\u2019t agree with the allegations and that it was unaware of the exploitation of the app by third parties. However, the company is paying the fine to close the case for good. Furthermore, the company claims that it had already stopped selling the software in 2015.\u201cWhile Lenovo disagrees with allegations contained in these complaints, we are pleased to bring this matter to a close after 2-1/2 years. To date, we are not aware of any actual instances of a third party exploiting the vulnerabilities to gain access to a user\u2019s communications,\u201d read Lenovo\u2019s official statement on the agreement.In August 2014, Lenovo installed an adware called VisualDiscovery on thousands of laptops to automatically deliver pop-up ads. However, the software blocked the browsers from notifying or warning the user about not visiting the malicious websites the links of which the pre-installed adware posted. The adware could steal valuable information such as Social Security Number, private credentials, and similar sensitive data. This, claims the FTC, was a clear proof of the way Lenovo compromised the privacy of consumers.The preloaded software \u201ccould access consumers\u2019 sensitive information without adequate notice or consent to its use. This conduct is even more serious because the software compromised online security protections that consumers rely on,\u201d stated Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting chairman of FTC. The FTC also noted that the data stolen by VisualDiscovery was not received by or sent to Superfish, the Palo Alto, California-based firm.Ohlhausen stated that the 750,000 Lenovo laptops that were sold between August 2014 and June 2015 were equipped with VisualDiscovery. The list of affected Lenovo computers includes the following brands that were released during the above mentioned period:E-Series, Edge Series, Flex-Series, G-Series, Miix Series, S-Series, U-Series, Y-Series, Yoga Series, and Z-Series.It is believed that young and low-income group of consumers were the primary targets in this scheme. The software was tracking everything on the computer from login credentials to personal data, medical information, emails, bank account information and other sensitive data. So the website that was apparently selling furniture was collecting private and financial data. That\u2019s because Superfish was a third party vendor, states Ohlhausen, and it is hard to believe that all this while Lenovo was unaware of the data capturing.

According to security experts, the malware was developed by the same authors who were responsible for creating the now non-functional Dyre banking Trojan. Some operators if Dyre were arrested in Russia in the final quarter of 2015.The newly discovered Trickbot campaign is very much alive and active at the moment, and experts have observed that the malware, which can already target financial platforms like Paypal, is further aiming to expand its scope by reaching out to institutions from Nordic countries. Moreover, it now possesses additional support for stealing funds stored in Coinbase (dot) com accounts. The new campaign uses an email that is apparently sent by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC); however, it is nothing else but a social engineering trap.Trickbot has claimed its targets around the globe. In the latest Trickbot campaign, more than 8,600 emails have been sent out until now, and main target locations include the UK, Australia, France and Canada, while most of the recipients have the TLD/top-level domain of \u201c.com,\u201d stated Forcepoint Labs in their official blog post.\u201cCoinbase is a crypto-currency exchange site that operates exchanges of Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. With Coinbase being targeted, non-traditional currencies are now also at risk of being stolen from would-be victims of the Trickbot banking Trojan,\u201d said researchers.Researchers claim that the new campaign has been active for the past few months; the malware has stolen the login details, authentication codes and other sensitive personal data from its target systems. The Blockchain platform hasn\u2019t prevented the attacks, and as per the blog post by SANS ISC\u2019s Brad Duncan, all the domains that have been identified were registered with GoDaddy.

The samples discovered by Forcepoint security experts show that Trickbot instructs its configuration files to generate and overlay an unauthentic login page whenever the website Coinbase.com is visited by a user in the targeted device\u2019s browser. Since the latest campaign targets Coinbase, therefore, it is apparent that the cryptocurrencies are also vulnerable at the moment.We can easily state that the current campaign is a challenge to the reliability and stability of Blockchain platform considering if cryptocurrency gets stolen through malware attack then it will be a grave issue because every coin has a unique code.

This is why Amazon recently introduced \u2018Macie\u2019: to discover, classify and protect sensitive data in AWS S3. [\u2026]Organisations using IaaS must leverage at least some of the security technologies available to them, either from public cloud providers, IDaaS providers, or CASBs, which provide visibility and control over cloud services like AWS. It could also be argued that these AWS server misconfigurations could have been avoided with basic security best practices such as limiting access from outside the corporate network, encrypting highly sensitive data, and training employees on security risks.\u201dTigerSwan was founded in 2008 by retired US Army lieutenant colonel and Delta Force operator James Reese. Since then the international security and global stability firm have provided its services during the infamous Iraq war, 2014 Sochi Olympics and Standing Rock Protests (Dakota Access Pipeline protests, DAPL).However, in May 2017, The Intercept cited leaked documents indicating that the firm used counterterrorism tactics at standing rock to \u201cdefeat pipeline insurgencies.\u201d In 2011, the firm also won a one year contract in Saudi Arabia where it provided construction and security services for the South Gate Entry Control Point, Eskan Village, Riyadh.In their official statement, the firm has acknowledged the issue and said that: \u201cAt no time was there ever a data breach of any TigerSwan server.

If the information is available; the site will show following results:If you are wondering since there are no passwords available why would someone buy this data? Well, for social engineering attacks emails and phone numbers are worth everything as attackers can search for these emails in previous data breaches like MySpace, DropBox, and LinkedIn.

The latest ransomware campaign is a true case of how hackers can trap users and cause widespread damage by simple tweaking of an already lethal malware.According to security experts at AppRiver, the notorious Locky ransomware is back in action with utmost evilness. In the latest campaign attackers have sent out malicious Locky ransomware via a whopping 23 million infected emails.AppRiver has posted a sample email that shows how effortlessly attackers managed to affect so many devices at once. The email has just a single sentence \u201cdownload it here\u201d and the sender\u2019s name while the subject line is also chosen randomly from a standard list. There are simple terms used in the whole email such as documents, images, photos, pictures, and scans while \u2018please print\u2019 is the most complex phrase.The attackers have tried to benefit from the naivety and unsuspicious nature of a large number of internet users. When one is launching ransomware to 23 million potential targets, then the campaign is bound to claim some victims. Those who did fell prey to this trap had to pay a considerable sum to regain access to their files, which at the time of this writing was about .5 Bitcoin (more than $2300) for a single device. You can easily imagine if there were even one or two thousand compromised devices out of the 23 million then the attackers would have easily made a few million dollars.The latest attack is quite dangerous. The malware traffic outrage started on Monday at around 7 a.m. CST, exactly when workers in the US arrive at offices. They were welcomed by malicious, \u2018extremely vague\u2019 emails sitting in their inboxes, stated AppRiver security research manager Troy Gill.The email contained a ZIP file attachment, which was a VBS (Visual Basic Script) file. Inside this attachment was another ZIP file. When the user clicked this second file, a downloader was executed, and the modified version of Locky was unleashed via \u201cgreatesthits[dot]mygoldmusic[dot com]\u201d stated the AppRiver post.Once downloaded, Locky ransomware starts encrypting entire data on the infected device and adds [.]lukitus to them. When encryption stage is completed, the attackers change computer\u2019s desktop background with another image on which the instructions for decryption are noted and an HTML file named \u201cLukitus[dot]htm\u201d is uploaded. Unsurprisingly, the victim is asked to install TOR browser first and then sent a Darkweb link for paying the demanded ransom. When the payment is received, the victim is redirected to decryption service.A post from AppRiver informed that the campaign was launched all across the US earlier this week and it is reportedly one of the largest ransomware attacks in 2017\u2019s second half. It is worth noting that ransomware remains the biggest cyber-threat since 2016 and its intensity has only increased over time with a 600% increase in ransomware attacks in comparison to last year. Last year Locky was the dominating malware while this year the top slot has been claimed by Cerber variants so far until Locky made a full throttle come back recently.According to Gill, the attacks haven\u2019t subsided or stopped yet, as per the post, AppRiver detected over 5.6 million messages on Monday and still there is no information about any method to reverse the Locky ransomware strain.Therefore, to help out the users, AppRiver suggest regular updating of their computers\u2019 software and hardware with security patches so that all the flaws and vulnerabilities are fixed timely, and ransomware or other malware exploits are prevented. In this regard, automatic software updates are your best bet, but you can also customize settings to get the newest updates regularly.

This is how the chip is capable of accessing the data on the host computer and therefore when it is compromised it starts serving as a backdoor and allows an attacker to gain full control of the device.Already there have been attempts to disable ME chip, but these have remained restricted to preventing the computer from booting or crashing the computer system totally but to no avail because ME components have been cleverly integrated by Intel into computer\u2019s key processes, e.g., initialization, power management, and processor\u2019s booting.Intel ME system is an entirely different processor embedded in Intel\u2019s CPUs, and it has no link with the main CPU as it has a separate Operating System, hardware bus driver, memory manager and file system, etc. It also has full access to various sensitive system components like system memory, keyboard, and video network. Therefore, it can easily access and obtain data as well as crucial control components of a computer, and if ME chip is disabled, then the computer will stop functioning.The defect was believed to be fixed to some extent using ME Cleaner, but the risk will not be eliminated because of the way the chip has been designed.

The only difference is the way scammers try create genuine looking emails so that recipients are lured into opening them and clicking on the malicious attachment.There is a new email scam in which residents in Connecticut, United States are receiving fake emails attached with malware. This time scammers have disguised this malware containing emails into Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official emails. Therefore, the IRS and the Department of Revenue Services (DRS) are collaborating to spread the word about the new email scam. The primary targets of this new scheme are the taxpayers mainly in Connecticut.Related: Firm loses $44m due to an online email scamKevin Sullivan, DRS\u2019 commissioner, states that the purpose of this email scam is no different than the rest of them. Scammers are trying to obtain \u201cpersonal information, passwords, and money,\u201d notes Sullivan, cyber criminals are using every possible trick to lure users into \u201cclicking a link or opening an attachment.\u201dIRS Commissioner John Koskinen has termed this scam as another twist to the already tried and tested formula of email ransomware scam as it also involves fake, inauthentic emails posing to be sent by reliable institutions with the sole objective of hijacking computer data and take cash in exchange for it.Let\u2019s have a look at the fake emails that supposedly are sent by the IRS and FBI.Recipients are requested to download a questionnaire by clicking on a link present in the email. This questionnaire is allegedly property of the FBI, and the bureau wants the user to fill up the form in order to understand the new changes in the tax compliance law. However, the changes are false and so is the link because it doesn\u2019t take the user to FBI\u2019s questionnaire but download ransomware on the computer.Ransomware is different from spyware; it is a malicious software that hijacks all the data stored on a device and victim can reclaim it only after fulfilling the demands of the scammers usually in the form of cash or crypto currency.You might very well be acquainted with the prevention techniques so far but once again let us remind you never to open emails from unidentified or suspicious senders and never click on unreliable email attachments no matter how genuine you feel these might be.The warning alert issued by Commissioner Sullivan can be read here:Related: How To Prevent Growing Issue of Encryption Based Malware (Ransomware)This is not the first time when a ransomware scam has hit users in the name of IRS.

At the same time Anti Public Combo List and Exploit.in list with millions of accounts were already leaked online. But now, here\u2019s another threat to unsuspecting users \u2013 thanks to Benkow, a security researcher based in France for revealing it.According to Benkow, he has got hands on a spambot by the name of \u201cOnliner Spambot\u201d containing email addresses and clear text passwords of 711 million users from around the world, one of the largest single set of data. The database is hosted on a server in Netherlands and is publicly available for anyone to access without any password protection.The database has been used to send out spams and Ursnif banking trojan to users since 2016. Ursnif steals banking information from target computers including credit card data. Here is an example of malware infected email sent by scammers using Ursnif.\u201cTo send spam, the attacker needs a huge list of SMTP credentials. To do so, there are only two options: create it or buy it. And it\u2019s the same as for the IPs: the more SMTP servers he can find, the more he can distribute the campaign,\u201d Benkow said.The database has been verified by Troy Hunt of HaveIbeenPwned (HIBP) who wrote a blog post explaining that 27 percent of the leaked accounts were already part of HIBP and predominantly from data breaches such as LinkedIn, Anti Combo list, MySpace, and Dropbox.\u201cIt took HIBP 110 data breaches over a period of 2 and a half years to accumulate 711m addresses and here we go, in one fell swoop, with that many concentrated in a single location. It\u2019s a mind-boggling amount of data,\u201d said Hunt.Here is a screenshot from the leaked data.To check if your email is on file, go to HIBP and just put the email address in the search bar for results. If you are the victim, it is advised to change your password and enable 2-Step Verification (also known as two-factor authentication), it allows you to add an extra layer of security to your account.Gaurav Banga, Founder, and CEO, Balbix told HackRead.com that \u201cFrom an enterprise perspective, employees often use the same password for sensitive corporate applications and their personal social media accounts. As a result, information such as valuable login credentials can be exposed and compromised when a social platform provider gets hacked. Enterprises need a way to continuously monitor the risk of credential theft from password sharing between corporate trusted and unknown websites and apps.\u201dSalim Hafid, Product Manager, Bitglass also commented on the issue and said that \u201cAt scale, phishing attacks that bypass spam filters and spoof legitimate sources are no doubt more effective than typical phishing strategies. These targeted attacks, where malware is delivered to millions of individuals, can spread at higher rates and yield more information.\u201dRemember: Never open spam or unknown emails Never click links or download attachments from such emails Change your password regularly If you are using the leaked email on other accounts, change their passwords as well. Keep an eye on any unsuspicious activity on your account Check your banking transactions regularly and in case of suspicious transaction contact your bankIn all probability it may be just a matter of time when the above discussion database will be accessed by cyber criminals, therefore, follow the steps we mentioned above and stay safe online.For further technical details on the leak visit Benkow\u2019s blog post here and Troy Hunt\u2019s blog post here.", "topics": ["Banking", "Cyber Crime", "hacking", "internet", "LEAKS", "Malware", "Password", "Scam", "security", "Spam", "TROJAN"], "title": "Onliner Spambot dump exposes 711 Million email and passwords", "date": "August 30, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "IT Security Vendors Successfully neutralized Deadly WireX Android Botnet through Collaboration \u2013 Google Removes Malicious Infected Apps from Play Store.Attacks like those launched through Mirai botnet in 2016 or WannaCry and NotPetya in 2017 had a global impact. Unsurprisingly, a whopping number of organizations were affected, and security experts were criticized left, right and center. This is what compelled tech firms in initiating an informal collaborative research on finding out ways to neutralize another major bot called WireX.The firms that united against WireX included Akamai, FlashPoint, RiskIQ, and CloudFlare. Security researchers and experts from these firms collaborated and published a series of blogs to explain how they and researchers from other organizations including Google identified, studied and eventually neutralized WireX. It must be noted that it wasn\u2019t a takedown attempt but a neutralizing effort that resulted in isolating the guidelines that could stop the abnormal GET and POST traffic. Google was also roped in to detect and delete the apps from the Play Store and disinfect all the affected devices.WireX was used for the first time on 2nd August, but it failed to create much havoc since the attacks were low scale, which is probably because the malware at that time was in its developmental stages. However, it resurfaced once again about two weeks back, and it wasn\u2019t possible to ignore it this time around.From August 15th, explained the experts, the attacks intensified and became prolonged with some being sourced from at least 70,000 synchronized IP addresses resulting in shutting down of various high-profile websites from the hospitality sector. The attacks became more and more volumetric with the passage of time. These attacked the application layer by sending legitimate looking web traffic that was HTTP GET requests. At this stage, a number of cyber-security experts detected the attacks and the collaborative effort was planned and organized.The initial investigation involved researching upon historic log information. It revealed that there was a direct link between the attacking IP addresses and a malicious program, which quite possibly was \u201crunning on top of the Android operating system.\u201d Logs from August 17 onwards depicted involvement of an Android app, which was searched using wide-range of variations in the name and parameters of the app bundle. Researchers came to know that multiple other apps (about 300 apps) were available from the same name, identical description and by the same authors. These were harmless looking apps with somewhat benign functions.A majority of these malicious apps were media or video players storage managers and ringtone apps, etc., but these contained \u201cadditional hidden features\u201d that users aren\u2019t aware of and the malware \u201cstayed alive and active in the background.\u201d The affected devices were apparently in large number since the attacks were launched from over a hundred different countries, which meant that the malicious app was distributed globally.Once the infected apps were identified, Google not only blocked the 300 malicious apps from its Play Store but also is currently in the process of deleting them from all the affected devices. \u201cThe researchers\u2019 findings, combined with our analysis, have enabled us to protect Android users better, everywhere,\u201d stated Google.Currently, available anti-malware tools identified the malware hidden in the apps as \u201cAndroid Clicker.\u201d The app started as a click fraud malware but was later used as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) tool. This sort of collaboration between experts from tech firms, however, is a novel step and an exciting new phenomenon. As stated by Flashpoint\u2019s security research director Allison Nixon:\u201cThis research is exciting because it\u2019s a case study in just how effective collaboration across the industry is. This was more than just a malware analysis report. The working group was able to connect the dots from the victim to the attacker. The group also used the information to better mitigate the attack and dismantle the botnet \u2014 and this was completed very quickly.\u201dWhile security researcher and senior network architect at Akamai, Jared Mauch, noted that in case of WireX the team was able to \u201cfully uncover\u201d the functioning of this malicious software through quick information sharing and collaborative research between the experts.CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince was feeling proud of the research as well as the team\u2019s effort involved in rapid investigation and mitigation of this \u201cdangerous discovery.\u201dRiskIQ\u2019s threat researcher Darren Spruell claims that the operation of WireX shows the \u201cvalue of collaborative response from security firms, service providers, and law enforcement.\u201d", "topics": ["Android", "Botnet", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "hacking", "Infosec", "internet", "Malware", "security", "Technology", "WannaCry"], "title": "Dangerous WireX Android DDoS Botnet Killed by Security Giants", "date": "August 29, 2017"}, {"authur": "Waqas", "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Sarahah is a new app that is gaining popularity among the masses lately with over 18 million downloads collectively on Apple and Google online stores. The app sends anonymized, blunt messages to its users and it has become the third most downloaded free software on iOS devices. The app claims to serve as a way to receive \u201chonest feedback\u201d from employees and folks, but according to Bishop Fox\u2019s senior security analyst Zachary Julian, Sarahah is performing many other tasks apart from Honest Feedback.Sarahah was developed in Saudi Arabia; it is the most recent one of a series of apps like the now defunct Secret that promises to ensure anonymity with disturbing privacy practices. Immediately after it is launched, the app extracts and uploads all the contact numbers and email addresses from the device\u2019s phone book without informing or notifying the user. Though Sarahah asks permission to access contacts, it doesn\u2019t reveal that the data will be uploaded or used in any way.When Julian installed the app on his Galaxy S5 Android 5.1.1, he learned about the secret function of Sarahah that it uploads private information. Julian\u2019s phone already had BURP Suite, which is a monitoring software installed for intercepting internet traffic that enters and leave the device. This allows the owner of the device to track the data being sent to remote servers. So, when Sarahah was launched on the device, BURP Suite identified the malicious activities of the app. This is how Julian identified that the app transmits all the email and phone contacts that are stored on the device. The method of data transfer is employed on both Android and iOS devices. The app prompts the user initially asking for permission to \u201caccess contacts.\u201dAs per Julian\u2019s findings, if the app hasn\u2019t been used in a while, it will again share the contacts. This feature of Sarahah has been demonstrated by Julian in a video as well, which can be viewed here:  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});He tested the data sharing tactics of Sarahah by using the app on Friday night and then booting it on Sunday morning, realizing that the app again shared his contacts.\u201cIf the app hasn\u2019t been used in a while, it will again share the contacts.\u201dZain al-Abidin Tawfiq, the developer of Sarahah, responded to the news by tweeting that this particular issue will be fixed in the next version of the app. While speaking with The Intercept, Tawfiq stated that the feature was developed as \u201cfind your friends\u201d option, which got altered due to some technical issue. A partner, who no more works with Tawfiq and co., was supposed to fix the flaw but it apparently wasn\u2019t dealt with. However, Tawfiq claims that the app does not store contacts on its databases.Sarahah App asked for contacts for a planned \u201cfind your friends\u201d feature\u2014 ZainAlabdin Tawfiq (@ZainAlabdin878) August 27, 2017According to security firm Red Mesa founder Drew Porter, with free apps like Sarahah, such issues are quite common. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer that you have to worry about the data on your phone, it\u2019s that you have to worry about the data on your phone that\u2019s somewhere else that you have no control over being compromised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, \u2018Oh, this company can see my information, and I\u2019m okay with that.\u2019 You now have to think about the security of that company,\u201d says Porter.Porter also said that what Sarahah does is concerning because of the critical nature of the information being retrieved and shared by the app. He added: \u201cYou don\u2019t know the security of the company that is getting it. We\u2019ve seen popular apps before, total information leakage comes out, and it\u2019s devastating to those companies. I believe it\u2019s even more devastating to the user whose information was compromised.\u201dJulian believes that it is not a technical flaw but a deliberately designed function of the app since it asks for permission to access contacts but never mentioned that the data will be uploaded to a server. On iOS devices, it asks for permission of accessing contacts \u201cto show you who has an account in Sarahah\u201d while on Android devices it does not give any reason for accessing contacts or never asks for permission in the first place.\u201cThe privacy policy specifically states that if it plans to use your data, it\u2019ll ask for your consent,\u201d says Julian but this cannot justify sending the contacts on the server without any specific notification. Similarly, on iOS devices, the app never shows who else is using Sarahah as it claims to do while requesting for contacts access permission.\u201cSarahah has between 10 and 50 million installs on just the Play Store alone for Android, so if you extrapolate that number, it could easily get into hundreds of millions of phone numbers and email addresses that they\u2019ve harvested,\u201d noted Julian.Currently, it is unclear in what way the information uploaded by Sarahah is used, but it is mentioned in the privacy policy that none of the information will be sold to third parties without user\u2019s consent. Therefore, if it does extracts and uploads contact information, then Julian asserts that it would be much better that the company comes clean and informs the user about where the data is going and why is it being stored.Source: The Intercept  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});", "topics": ["Android", "app", "internet", "iOS", "Privacy", "Saudi Arabia", "security", "Social Media", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Technology"], "title": "Sarahah App Uploads Your Contacts List on Unidentified Server", "date": "August 28, 2017"}, {"authur": "Carolina", "body": "Beware of Email promising Game of Thrones Spoilers because it Installs Malicious Malware.Cybercriminals aren\u2019t apparently over with the Game of Thrones (GoT) exploiting obsession yet.

If that wasn\u2019t enough, now there is full-fledged email scam that distracts you with GoT spoilers and injects malware into your computer.According to California based cyber-security firm Proofpoint, which detected the scam on August 10th when the company received malicious emails bearing the subject line \u201cWanna see the Game of Thrones in advance?\u201d it was enough to alert security experts at the firm about the emergence of a new malware scam related to GoT.On August 10 Proofpoint detected malicious email messages (Figure 1) purporting to contain unreleased Game of Thrones content. The email used the subject line \u201cWanna see the Game of Thrones in advance?\u201d These lures are especially relevant since Season 7 of Game of Thrones premiered in July and concludes on Sunday, August 27, and the email claims to contain spoilers for the current season.It is clear from the subject of the email that hackers want to exploit the natural curiosity of GoT fans by promising to reveal the never-seen-before content of the series.\u2019 Several links in the email apparently will guide the user to the unseen GoT content, but when the user clicks on them, they install malware on the computer.In this particular scam, scammers lured users by promising to show season\u2019s finale episode in advance and demanded money for every episode. Unsurprisingly GoT fans got thrilled. This shows cyber criminals are on a mission of making the most from the much anticipated and most watched season 7 of GoT as the season concluded on August 27.The malicious email works on clickbait method; instead of showing unseen scenes of GoT episodes, it contains a Microsoft Word attachment, which installs a 9002 remote access Trojan if the user clicks on the attachment. Scammers have tried every possible trick to make the email seem legit; they have gone as far to include preview-like details of the GoT episodes. However, when the file is downloaded the 9002 remote access Trojan or RAT is installed.According to Russia based cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab, the recent rage of targeting GoT is a new form of cyber-crimes. Hackers are trying their best to break into channels\u2019 security, obtain consequential information and leak it online sometimes to become famous and sometimes to demand ransom.If you are a GoT fan don\u2019t open any email tricking you to watch unreleased episodes of Game of Thrones in advance.
