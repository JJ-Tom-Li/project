In such scenario, finding a USB port installed somewhere or charging facility at public outlets seems to be a blessing. Public charging ports are installed almost everywhere for the users and vicitors convenience such as at airports, conference centers, cafes, parks and planes, etc. All you need to do is plug in your cell phone and feel relaxed and relieved.However, Drew Paik from IT security security firm Authentic8 told CNN that this is a very dangerous thing to do because the outlet might be hacked and all the data present in your phone could easily be transferred to a hacker.More: Malware can Convert your Headphones into Microphone for HackersAuthentic8 is the developer of Silo web browser that facilitates anonymous web surfing. The revelation from Paik is surprising and concerning as he states that simply through plugging in your phone into a hacked charger or power strip would lead to getting your device infected at once and all your data will also be compromised. The reason is that the cord used to plug in your mobile phone is also used for sending data to and from the device.For example, if you connect your iPhone to your Mac device using the same charging cord, you can easily transfer images and music from your mobile to your Mac. Hence, through compromising this particular cord, a hacker can extract all sorts of data from your mobile including pictures, emails, contact numbers, SMS messages, etc., without your knowledge obviously.This kind of hacking is called \u201cJuice Jacking\u201c, which was a term created by security researchers in 2011 and this was followed by the creation of another term called \u201cVideo Jacking\u201c, which was introduced in 2016. This referred to phone\u2019s ability to record everything that you typed or looked at due to being compromised by a hacked port.\u201cIf they\u2019re desperate and need to upload your selfie, take your chances,\u201d warned Paik.The findings of the research were demonstrated by Authentic8 at the RSA security conference held in San Francisco. The company installed a charging station at its stall and offered to charge cords to visitors so that they could charge their devices. Then the security firm ran a social experiment to analyze the number of people who used this charging service, which turned out to be quite overwhelming with over 80% of the audience using the charging facility provided by Authentic8. Paik noted that none of these visitors seemed to care about the security aspect of charging mobiles from a public station despite the fact that they were attending a security conference.More: Internet Connected Plugs can be Easily Exploited by HackersThe repercussions are various and diverse, which is why Paik recommends that instead of putting their data in danger, users must carry their chargers or invest in portable USB battery pack. They may also buy USB cords of their own and connect the chargers using their ports. The bottom line is that, if you are concerned about the security of your phone\u2019s data, it is better to stop using public ports at all.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Charging Smartphone in Public Ports Leads to Data Hack \u2014 So Let\u2019s Stop", "date": "February 18, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Bluetooth", "Germany", "hacking", "internet", "IoT", "Privacy", "security", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Toys"], "body": "  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});The trend of manufacturing internet connected smart toys is certainly gaining momentum. Dolls, teddy bears and other toys are now able to create a bond with the kids simply through their enhanced interactivity. However, the fact cannot be ignored that with blessings come bane; these web-connected toys are although seemingly very playful and helpful in keeping kids busy, but there are several other repercussions associated with smart toys. The most important one being that of surveillance and perhaps this is the reason why governments are banning these toys.As per reports, Germany has banned the doll My Friend Cayla citing that it can listen to the conversations of kids and apart from responding in real-time to them, it also conducts surveillance. The Bundesnetzagentur or German Federal Network Agency, which oversees country\u2019s telecommunications, believes that this isn\u2019t an ordinary doll but a surveillance device.More: UK May Approve Bill Allowing Spying on Individuals via Their Kids ToysBundesnetzagentur regards the doll as an authentic example of \u201cunauthorized wireless transmitting equipment\u201d because devices that contain hidden microphones and/or cameras and can transmit signals or data without detection are capable of violating people\u2019s privacy. In this regard, kids\u2019 toys cannot be overlooked, stated Bundesnetzagentur. This is why the doll has been banned in Germany since as per German law the selling and usage of any toy that can transmit signals and record sound or images without getting detected must be banned.The abovementioned doll is not just sold in Germany but Australia too. Along with Bluetooth, it is equipped with internet connectivity, and it utilizes speech-to-text technology to communicate with kids. This particular feature has been criticized by security experts and German telecommunications watchdog officials as they state that companies can use the toy to carry out direct marketing to the parents or the child. The agency does not plan to take any legal action against parents who didn\u2019t immediately destroy the doll, but they do believe that parents must ensure that their privacy is not hindered or breached with the use of such toys.My Friend Cayla has been created by Genesis Toys and distributed by The Vivid Toy Group. The company is known for creating smart technology equipped toys and many of its products have been scrutinized previously for revealing personal data to not just the manufacturer but also to malicious threat actors and hackers since it has unsecure Bluetooth devices embedded inside. The Vivid Toy Group stated previously that hacking examples were scarce and only conducted by security experts but still, they would make sure that the app used with the doll is upgraded. Still, experts allege that the risks are there and there hasn\u2019t been any upgrading in the software.According to the UK Toy Retailers Association, the doll doesn\u2019t pose or offer any \u201cspecial risk, \u201d and there is \u201cno reason for alarm,\u201d however a privacy advocate group Center for Digital Democracy would beg to differ since its report in December last year identified threats possessed by My Friend Cayla and I-Que Intelligent Robot. In their complaint to FTC, CDD explained that both toys have been spying on kids and parents sending their data including conversations to company\u2019s servers which are then analyzed and stored in another cloud server. That\u2019s not all, in 2015, \u201cHello Barbie\u201d toy was also criticized for spying on kids by recording their conversations and sending them to company\u2019s servers.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Carolina", "title": "Goodbye Spy Toy: Germany Bans My Friend Cayla Doll", "date": "February 18, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Apple", "Dark Net", "dark web", "internet", "Mac", "Malware", "Ransomware", "security"], "body": "Hackers are selling a malware for Mac devices on a prominent dark web marketing claiming that it is undetectable and comes with capabilities including taking full control of macOS devices by evading anti-virus detection.Dubbed Proton by its developers, the malware is a RAT (Remote Administration Tool) and is being sold in one of the leading closed Russian cybercrime message boards. The discovery was made by Sixgill, a cyber-intelligence company that detects cyber-attacks and sensitive data leaks originating from the Dark Web before they occur.In their threat report, researchers at Sixgill explained that the initial price of Proton RAT was 100 BTC (USD $100,000), but lately it is being sold 40 BTC (USD $41891) with unlimited installations while a license to install on a single PC with genuine Apple certifications would set a cyber criminal back only 2 BTC.Proton comes with capabilities including taking full control of a targeted device, keylogging, Observers with SMS notifications, SSH/VNC tunneling with VPS, webcam/screen surveillance, premium customer support, file uploadings, and downloads.\u201cProton can present a custom native window requesting information such as a credit card, driver\u2019s license and more. The malware also boasts the capability of iCloud access, even with 2FA enabled,\u201d notes Sixgill.Sixgill\u2019s report also highlights the threat Proton possess against Mac OS. For instance, hackers are selling this malware with genuine Apple code-signing signatures. This means there has been a lot of sophistication behind the development of Proton.\u201cThe author of Proton RAT somehow got through the rigorous filtration process Apple places on MAC OS developers of third-party software, and obtained genuine certifications for his program. Sixgill evaluates that the malware developer has managed to falsify registration to the Apple Developer ID Program or used stolen developer credentials for the purpose,\u201d reveals the report. The report further goes on to explain that \u201cgaining root privileges on MAC OS is only possible by employing a previously unpatched 0-day vulnerability, which is suspected to be in possession of the author. Proton\u2019s users then perform the necessary action of masquerading the malicious app as a genuine one, including a custom icon and name. The victim is then tricked into downloading and installing Proton.\u201dA full list of Proton\u2019s features can be checked below:\u201cSixgill\u2019s Dark Web intelligence platform leads the way in early detection of cyber security threats when the damage can still be avoided\u201d, said Avi Kasztan, CEO and Co-founder of Sixgill. \u201cOur analysts are constantly on the lookout for new and emerging threats, and we work closely with law enforcement authorities to report this activity.\u201dThe developers have also uploaded a video demonstration on YouTube explaining how Proton works and information about its installation.Although the threat report identified that hackers are aiming at selling Proton malware to companies, families, sysadmins and parents; it is obvious that putting their listings on the dark web cybercrime message boards is an open offer for cyber criminals to take advantage of this malicious software.This is not the first time when hackers have been selling malicious software on a dark web marketplace.

However, In July last year, over a hundred officials were targeted by malicious cyber-criminals as they managed to compromise their cell phones/tablets and infiltrated data and transferred it to the command and control center. Moreover, the infected devices also received Trojan updates and this helped the attackers conduct further damage to their systems. Now, it is being observed that this campaign is still active and most recent attacks were reported in February 2017.According to researchers at Kaspersky Labs, this campaign is still in its early stages and mainly affects devices running Android operating system. When a device gets compromised, these turn into spying devices and attackers enact a very sophisticated process of gathering intelligence information by controlling the audio and video capabilities along with collecting GPS data and SMS functions.More: Pics of IDF women soldiers helped hackers to breach Israeli Military ServersThis particular campaign relies a lot on social engineering and leverages social networks to attract targets into providing classified data and get malicious apps downloaded on their phones. It is worth nothing that only IDF officials are being targeted in this campaign. The attackers are not as technically proficient but have managed to use a variety of social engineering skills. Among the victims are the IDF servicemen from various ranks; a majority of whom are posted on the Gaza strip.The process of luring victims involves targeting them via social networks and installing malicious apps on their devices by sending them malicious links containing APK file. The victims install the app, which then demands permission to perform some important tasks such as to delete and install packages, write external storage and receiving access to the internet and network state.The dropper then checks out the configuration server to find out the device model and then selects the kind of payload to be downloaded. It also sends a list of all the applications installed on the phone and a variant will then act as a YouTube layer while some would act as messaging or chat application. One of these payloads is a WhatsApp_Update which can execute manual commands that are triggered by the operator and gathers data from different sources on a regular basis. The WebSocket protocol is used by the payload to attract a real-time interface and send commands to the payload which resemble a reverse shell. The payload performs checks on the mobile phone after every 30 seconds and keeps collecting data so that every incoming bit of data whether images or SMS and location changes is quickly transferred to the attackers.More: Hamas Hacked Dozens of IDF Soldiers\u2019 Phones Using Seductive Female ImagesKaspersky Labs stated in its blog post that the campaign is a clear threat for the Israeli DefenseForce/IDF and was specifically launched to get data regarding the way ground forces operate and gather intel on the kind of tactics and equipment used by the IDF.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "IDF targeted by sophisticated cyber espionage through Android devices", "date": "February 17, 2017"}, {"topics": ["FISA", "hacking", "internet", "NSA", "PRISM", "Privacy", "security", "Snowden", "Spying", "Surveillance", "USA"], "body": "Dec 31st was the expiry date for section702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

The recent incident yet again proves how critical IoT devices could be if their security isn\u2019t improved.Verizon Enterprise\u2019s RISK (Research, Investigations, Solutions and Knowledge) department researchers were tasked with the investigation of internet blockage at an unidentified US university and they discovered that [PDF] a few thousand infected IoT devices are responsible for cutting off the internet. The attackers reprogrammed the devices in such a way that they started attempting to connect with seafood-oriented websites sporadically.The attackers hacked 5,000 devices so that these send out DNS queries continuously (DDoS attack) and to fulfill their malicious objectives they used a variety of devices from vending machines to street lamps. The university\u2019s network, resultantly, started to slow down as the malware in the IoT devices started attacking its drink vending machines. When one device was infected, the malware started searching for more vulnerable devices and the chain reaction followed suite. When a single device was infected, the malware modified its admin password making it difficult to remove the infection.The report explained that \u201cThe botnet spread from device to device by brute forcing default and weak passwords \u2013 The firewall analysis identified over 5,000 discrete systems making hundreds of DNS lookups every 15 minutes.\u201dWhen the IT staff of the university got a hint of the malware attack, they quickly responded by tracking down the new passwords and since these were transmitted in clear text format instead of being encrypted, their job became easier as they were able to intercept them using a packet-sniffing app. After receiving the list of new passwords, they launched a fix, which was an automated antidote that reset all the passwords and broke the chain of the botnets by freeing the devices.\u201cShort of replacing every soda machine and lamp post, I was at a loss for how to remediate the situation.

This is why the IT department of the university has urged that companies regularly inspect the network settings for their manufactured IoT devices and keep them separate from Internet access as well as from other devices. Also, organizations need to use standard IT assets along with IoT devices and employ regular security protections like changing default username and passwords for the devices and keeping strong Wi-Fi network passwords.Source: Verizon Enterprise | Image Source: Flickr/PatrickDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Someone DDoSed A University Server By Hacking Its Vending Machines", "date": "February 14, 2017"}, {"topics": ["cyber attacks", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "security"], "body": "Researchers have issued a warning that hackers are resorting to the use of file-less malware programs to gain stealth access to the systems of organizations. This new form of attack is not only severe regarding its consequences but also represents a new threat, given its growing level of popularity. Here are details about this new form of stealth malware that you need to know.This is a new form of malware that manages to hide within a computer system and successfully escapes detection. Conventionally, cyber security experts could detect malware in any system because malware programs usually depend on the hard drives of computers for their operation. Thus, anti-malware programs can detect malware by scanning all the files that are on the hard drive of a device.However, this new form of malware does not depend on the files on the hard drive of a device for its survival. In practice, the malware hides in the kernel of RAM of a device. Usually, ordinary users do not know how to access these areas of a device. Therefore, this new form of malware can remain in a device for a long time, giving the hackers unfettered access to a device and the system to which the device is connected.Researchers at Kaspersky Lab indicate that hackers have devised new techniques that they use to control this new type of malware. You should bear in mind that so far all indications are that hackers use this type of malware to launch attacks against institutions across the world. For instance, researchers at Kaspersky Lab have pointed out that hackers are using this new type of malware to attack the systems of banking institutions across the world specifically. The hackers stealthily use file-less malware to gain deeper access to the systems in useHackers follow these steps when using file-less malware programs to launch attacks:1 Hackers hack the servers of their target. At this stage, the hackers use some of the most common exploits to gain unauthorized access to the servers of their target. Once the hackers can access the servers, they start looking for vulnerabilities that they can take advantage of. 2 The hackers then infect their target computers with special malware. For the hackers to successfully infect the computers of their targets, they rely on specialized tools such as Meterpreter and PowerShell scripts. The attackers use inventive methods to successfully infect the computers of their targets with special malware programs. 3 Once the script of the hackers has been successfully installed on the target computer, it hides in the RAM or Windows registry. The ability of the malware program to hide in the RAM or other odd places in a computer makes it very dangerous in the long run. On the one hand, it makes it impossible for security experts to detect any abnormal activity on a computer. On the contrary, it makes it possible for the malware program to collect as much information as it can from the targeted device. In practice, the script looks around for passwords and other sensitive sets of information. 4 The malware program then starts to channel the information that it gathers in a device to the attackers. To achieve this objective, the malware uses special procedures that help it tunnel the trove of data it steals to a C2 server. 5 Once a user reboots a computer, the malware disappears from the device, making it impossible for detectors to pinpoint any abnormal behavior on the computer.So far, the malware has been successfully detected in more than 40 countries around the world. Researchers, using sophisticated tools have managed to pinpoint particular cases in which hackers have been using this new form of malware to gain access to the systems of enterprises.In all cases, it appears that the modus operandi of the hackers using this type of malware does not change. The hackers repeatedly target financial institutions with the sole aim of gaining access to ATM cards and other forms of credentials that they can use to steal money from the banks.In conclusion, this new kind of malware poses a significant danger to institutions and individuals.

They have come to the conclusion that Marcher has been there since 2013 and its attacking tactics have been evolving since then. Until now, the Trojan has managed to infect thousands of Android devices with a single botnet and also stolen a considerable number of payment cards. On the whole, 9 Marcher botnets have been discovered by the researchers.According to Securify researchers, in late 2013 when the Trojan became activated it trapped users through Google Play phishing pages to get their payment card details. In March 2014, the primary focus of attacks became German financial institutions because analysis suggested that a majority of Marcher\u2019s victims were Germany-based banks. However, by 2016, the malware\u2019s target list spread to over 60 organizations across the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, Spain, Poland, Turkey and many other countries. The malware was hidden in apps that were believed to be harmless and pretty reliable such as Netflix, Super Mario Run game and the popular messaging app WhatsApp.Securify researchers explained about the malware: \u201cMarcher is one of the few Android banking Trojans to use the AndroidProcesses library, which enables the application to obtain the name of the Android package that is currently running in the foreground. This library is used because it uses the only (publicly known) way to retrieve this information on Android 6 (using the process OOM score read from the /proc directory).\u201dSecurify researchers have identified the nine botnets of Marcher and each of the botnets contain new modules and can perform targeted web injects as directed by the attackers. One of the nine botnets targets banks in France, Austria and Germany and until now it has managed to infect over 11,000 devices. 5,700 infected devices were in Germany while 2,200 in France and the command and control server of the attackers has stored 1,300 payment card numbers apart from other significant banking data.Although most of the devices that got infected through Marcher were using the Android 6.0.1 version, it is also a fact that over 100 infected devices were running Android 7.0. Marcher performs its task by firstly inspecting the apps enabled by the victim and if the targeted app is identified, then it displays an overlay screen to deceive the victim and obtain sensitive information.The malware can also avoid detection or removal by security products by blocking mobile antivirus applications. Around seven months back, researchers noted that Marcher was able to block eight antivirus apps and according to latest analysis it can block over two dozen apps.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Android Banking Trojan Marcher Infects Devices to Steal Payment Cards", "date": "February 14, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Cyber Crime", "internet", "School", "security", "USA"], "body": "As per the claims from the Sweetwater Union School District, a shocking incident occurred at Chula Vista\u2019s Rancho Del Rey Middle School where a teacher mistakenly showed porn to his 7th-grade students while the class was underway.

Welchering\u2019s findings were seconded by another researcher Hermann Sauer. The researchers collaborated together to evaluate the new app and identified the majority of data received by Adjust comprises of personal details of the users.It must be noted that Firefox Klar was launched in 2016 as the German Firefox Focus version offering enhanced user data privacy.According to Welchering, the collected data is transmitted to another company called Adjust GmbH, which is a German data aggregation service. Furthermore, he acknowledged that the data collection feature is hidden in the \u201cSend anonymous usage data\u201d option, which is available in the Settings menu of the browser and comes activated by default for all new users of Firefox Klar.Experts are referring to these claims as shallow findings because the researchers did not specifically state the exact range of data collection or precisely which information is being transmitted and used the term Extensive to define the nature and extent of data collection.As expected, Mozilla has come out in public and openly denied these claims from German researcher. In a reply to news website Bleeping Computer, Mozilla explained its employed data collection practices for mobile devices on a support page and provided a clear-cut explanation of why, when and what sort of data it collects from users.This particular post also explained the relationship Mozilla shares with Adjust and the company did admit that the collected data is sent to and saved by Adjust\u2019s backend instead of Mozilla. This was indispensable, as per Mozilla, because Adjust SDK is already part of Firefox Focus, Firefox for Android, Firefox for iOS and Firefox Klar. These apps occasionally deliver anonymous summaries regarding the frequency of application usage, but these summaries just include information about when the app was actively used. Firefox Klar and Firefox Focus also share information about the features of the app that users prefer to use, which is yet another anonymous report containing information about the filters being selected by users and how many times the search, erase and browse tabs were pressed.According to Mozilla, the alleged personal data that is collected by the SDK is the IP address of the user while installing the app while the other is just regular data that all apps collect to understand how users are interacting and using the apps.We also cannot say for sure if Mozilla is guilty or not unless the researchers provide authentic details about their claims and findings.

In most cases, you are exposed to dangers every time you use your standard email communication services. Here are some of the dangers that you get exposed to when you are using your ordinary email communication service.1 The emails that you send and receive are not encrypted. Since the messages are not encrypted, it means that a hacker who successfully accesses the messages can read them.2 It is easy for third parties to access your messages. In this case, government spies and cybercriminals can access the emails that you send and receive via your standard service.3 Your ISP stores copies of the emails that you send and receive. Because of your ISP stores copies of your messages for some time, it means that you cannot be sure about your privacy when you are using standard email services.Related: Why You Should Use These 5 VPN ServicesHowever, you can secure your email communications by using special email services. Encrypted email services are special in that the basis of their service offering is to secure your communications. To achieve this objective, these use any of the many pro-security features.

The flaw has been dubbed as Ticketbleed, keeping in mind its similarity with another such bug, Heartbleed.How does Ticketbleed work? Ticketbleed is a vulnerability in the BIG-IP SSL networks that allows for SSL sessions to be leaked which are as large as 31 bytes. This happens due to the inherent SSL ticket system being designed in a way that stores certain pieces of information from previous SSL sessions.This is because doing so allows for better loading time as the server does not need to connect to the server anew. Rather, it can resume the SSL session that was previously started by retrieving the information from the previous SSL tickets. Such information, however, contains certain encrypted data that is sensitive. Ticketbleed, as such, allows attackers to access this information very conveniently. Essentially, the attackers can get their hands on SSL session IDs and 31 bytes of uninitialized memory.\u201cThe vulnerability lies in the implementation of Session Tickets, a resumption technique used to speed up repeated connections. When a client supplies a Session ID together with a Session Ticket, the server is supposed to echo back the Session ID to signal acceptance of the ticket. Session IDs can be anywhere between 1 and 31 bytes in length. The F5 stack always echoes back 32 bytes of memory, even if the Session ID was shorter. An attacker providing a 1-byte Session ID would then receive 31 bytes of uninitialized memory, according to technical details section of Ticketbleed website.\u201dF5 virtual server flaw, dubbed Ticketbleed, is similar to Heartbleed.Ticketbleed vs. Heartbleed: The researcher claimed that the vulnerability is similar to its counterpart, Heartbleed regarding the consequences. However, with Heartbleed, the data that could be retrieved amounted to as high as 64k. Ticketbleed, on the other hand, only allows for 31 bytes of data at a time.Here's the story of how Ticketbleed was found while debugging a @Cloudflare customer issue, analyzed and reported https://t.co/BDl2GEsoJR pic.twitter.com/nZXdbECDLd\u2014 Filippo Valsorda (@FiloSottile) February 9, 2017The flaw, Valsorda explains, exists due to the way the ticket system works. As of now, a mitigation plan has been issued by F5 to eradicate the flaw. Nevertheless, little is known as to what exactly is being done to resolve the issue.

It is indeed a very useful platform that is known for its efficiency and effectiveness. However, Gmail may not be as effective as we think it is.According to a recent research conducted by Renato Marinho at Morphus Labs, Gmail does not seem to spam emails that are sent with the @gmail.com address, even if it is a fake one. The trick is used to bypass Google\u2019s spam recognition system and hence the email seems valid when in reality, it has been generated from another server altogether. This means such an email does not go to the spam folder; rather, it appears in one\u2019s inbox.Sadly, it is not that easy. However, one may view the address in the sender\u2019s field as that may reveal the Gmail address to be generated from a different server. Nevertheless, this is no use since most spam emails are capable of injecting malware just by being clicked and viewed. What is more disappointing, is that for Android and iOS users, such an option of finding the server\u2019s actual name in the sender\u2019s field is not available.Research suggests that whenever a spam email with a fake Gmail address is trying bypass Gmail spam filters, it has to connect to the Gmail\u2019s server by appearing to be valid. As such, the spammer can easily mask the fake Gmail address as if it is a legitimate one and go through. \u201cAlthough it has not been considered a security bug, in our opinion, it would be better if Gmail could at least adopt the same behavior we saw when trying to spoof a non-existing Gmail account in which security alerts were shown. Additionally, we suggest to make it possible to view message security details within the Gmail iOS app, as today these users have no ways to verify if they are being spoofed\u201d, writers Marinho.Although the trick can be potentially harmful, Google does not seem to be very serious about it. When asked as to what should be the course of action to counteract the problem, Google said that it is not a big issue as it does not interfere with a user\u2019s privacy.An opinion such as this can jeopardize the reputation that Google has on the market.

The essence of the TOR network is that you can comfortably access the internet as an entirely anonymous entity, overcome all manner of geo-restrictions and even access the content that many search engines do not list in organic searches.However, a couple of years ago, the FBI managed to hack the TOR network and disrupt the operations of the network. Also, in the recent past, some regimes have managed to block TOR in their countries. However, you can still access the internet with a level of privacy similar to what TOR has been providing.TOR works by repeatedly moving your traffic among hundreds of servers across the world. By moving your traffic in quick succession among hundreds of servers across the world, the TOR browser makes it impossible for third parties to track you down by monitoring your IP address. Also, the browser helps you to access all content that the mainstream browsers usually hide. If you use any of the conventional browsers, you may not access some sites that form the dark web. However, the TOR browser helps you to access all the sites that are hidden in the dark web.Here are some of the best alternatives to TOR. You should note that these alternatives may not offer you the level of performance similar to what you experience when you are using TOR. However, they will provide you the basic level of privacy, anonymity, and access that you may need when browsing the internet. Here are some of the best alternatives to TOR that you can use:I2P stands for the Invisible Internet Project. This is a system that uses complex procedures to encrypt your traffic in layers. The approach that this system uses to encrypt your traffic makes it one of the best alternatives to the TOR browser.Many people describe this system as \u2018the internet within an internet\u2019 because it uses TCP/IP and UDP sessions to make layers of networks that help to hide your identity when you are online. Therefore, the use of strong encryption protocols and the approach of building layers of networks are the two features that make I2P one of the best alternatives to TOR.Yandex is another important browser that you can use as an alternative to the TOR browser. Several things make Yandex one of the best alternatives to TOR. In the first place, Yandex has unique features that automatically scan the internet for various forms of malware. The browser automatically protects you from any kind of malware, regardless of the websites that you visit.Also, Yandex prevents third parties from tracking your location and behavior when you are online. TOR was regarded as the best browser that you could use to remain anonymous when browsing the web. However, many people now consider Yandex as another important replacement of TOR regarding the ability to hide your IP address when you are online.Whonix runs on the Linux OS. The essence of the browser is that it actually hides your IP address when you are online so that no third party can access your identity when you are browsing the internet. Also, Whonix runs on a special network called the Whonix-Workstation. The Whonix-Workstation is so secure that only the connections that you make to it via the TOR that can go through. Therefore, regarding privacy and security, Whonix is an important alternative to TOR.The disconnect is dedicated to disconnecting you from websites that attempt to collect information about you or those that try to track down your location. When you are using Disconnect, you will repeatedly receive messages informing you of specific websites that attempt to track your activities. Disconnect will automatically terminate your connection to specific sites that it deems risky for your privacy. However, it is clear that Disconnect lacks the highly advanced security features similar to those of the TOR system. Needless to say, you may find it necessary to use Disconnect as a way of supplementing your online level of privacy and security.Several things make Globus an excellent alternative to the TOR browser. However, two of these features are quite important. First, the browser uses a sophisticated network of VPN servers to keep your communication anonymous. The VPN servers of the service actually hide your traffic and make it impossible for third parties to track you when you are online.Second, Globus uses the TOR software to protect you against malware. You need to bear in mind that hackers often use malware to access the devices of their victims. Therefore, a good alternative to the TOR browser should protect you against any form of malware. Globus does protect you against malware by relying on the TOR software.Freepto is a useful alternative to the TOR browser, thanks to the manner in which the software effectively hides your identity when you are online and makes it practically impossible for trackers to monitor and successfully unmask your identity. If you choose to use Freepto, you will have to make sure that you carry it on a special disk.The software automatically encrypts all the data that you store on the portable disk. Another good thing about this software is that many activists are using it as a way of escaping possible tracking by law enforcement agencies. Therefore, you can rely on Freepto as a worthy alternative to the TOR browser.Epic combines all the strong features that are found in some of the conventional browsers in use today including Firefox and Chrome. You should remember that the TOR browser is based on the Firefox browser. Therefore, the fact that Epic browser contains some of the best features that are found in some of the conventional browsers means that the browser functions in a manner that is similar to that of the TOR browser.You can use the Epic browser to successfully evade trackers and cyber criminals in general. The browser helps you to remain anonymous when you are online and this is the main feature that makes it a good alternative to the TOR browser.By far, Tails is the closest thing near the TOR system that you shall ever come across. Tails is a sophisticated OS that contains a number of features, applications, and programs similar to what the TOR system use to have.The Tails OS usually boots from an external drive. Therefore, when you are using this OS, you do not have to worry about the possibility of leaving your documents exposed on various devices. As long as you carry the external drive containing the OS, you can successfully and anonymously use any computer at any time. Once you are through with your work, you can eject the disk and not trace of your activity will be left on the computer at all.JonDo Live is another important alternative to the TOR browser. The OS has various inbuilt features and programs that you can use to stay anonymous when you are online as well as safeguard your online privacy.  More importantly, this OS uses the TOR software as a means of protecting you against malware programs when you are online. One of the most distinctive features of the TOR system relates to its ability to protect users from malware attacks. Therefore, since JonDo Live uses TOR software to protect you against malware, it means that you can comfortably use the OS in the place of the TOR browser.The focus of Tox is on secure instant messages. Initially, the platform was built to provide users with a secure and reliable method of exchanging instant messages and even conferencing online. However, over the course of time, people have started using the platform as an alternative to the TOR browser. You can successfully communicate with your colleagues in a secure manner when using this platform.In conclusion, these are some of the best alternatives to TOR that you can use. They are important alternatives because they help you to browse the internet as an entirely anonymous entity. Also, they help you to avoid sites that attempt to track your online activities. Lastly, they protect you from various forms of malware when you are online.", "authur": "Ali Raza", "title": "Tor and Its 10 Best Alternatives", "date": "February 10, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Apple", "Browser", "ICLOUD", "internet", "iPhone", "Privacy", "Safari", "security"], "body": "Elcomsoft is a Moscow based firm that creates forensics software said it was possible [Pdf] to retrieve your deleted browser history beyond a year.

Moreover, the job of hackers is made easier thanks to misplaced or lost gadgets, clicking on suspicious links implanted with malware, replying to a phishing email with sensitive information and transfer of money via unsecured resources.Despite increased knowledge about not clicking malicious or suspicious looking links in an email, company employees are often tricked into clicking. This, in turn, provides a secure gateway for hackers to exploit susceptible company networks.Once a hacker gets access to a company\u2019s network, the firewalls and security patches can do very little about it. Small businesses often don\u2019t allocate enough resources or do not hire the services of third-party security providers to deploy strong firewalls or updated security patches, resulting in loss of valuable information by the hackers, once they get hold of it.DDoS attacks are becoming more common as the resources available to carry out these attacks are increasingly becoming more common and less expensive including increasing trend of DDoS for hire services. Small businesses often tend to have loose ends when it comes to their website\u2019s architecture, making it vulnerable to DDoS attacks.How Have These Threats Shifted in the Last Year or Two?With the advent of IoT, most small businesses are trying to establish their foothold in this new sector. Resultantly, creating opportunities for small businesses. Sadly, most of the time these devices which include video conferencing systems, IP monitored security systems, connected climate control systems, VoIP phones and even smart bulbs are not protected enough, making them vulnerable to hacking.Some Strategies to Counter These ThreatsSmall businesses tend to ignore the fact that their sensitive information accompanies their employees inside and outside of their office premises, and that it needs to be protected at all times.

In this scenario, third parties can be hired to do the stress testing to determine any loopholes in the system clearly.These steps if implemented can protect small businesses by keeping them in \u201cprepared mode\u201d and help to allocate necessary resources.DDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.", "authur": "Waqas Khan", "title": "Protecting Small Business from Increasing Cyber Attacks", "date": "February 10, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Botnet", "Cameras", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "hacking", "Malware", "Mirai", "security"], "body": "Antivirus firms Dr.Web\u2019s researchers have identified a new variant of Mirai bot, the infamous IoT malware. This new variant is capable of targeting Windows systems and can take on more ports than its Linux version. Dr.Web researchers have dubbed the new version as Trojan.Mirai.1.Mirai\u2019s Windows version is in use by cybercriminals for infecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices and conducting distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The original version of the malware was discovered in August 2016 by a researcher MalwareMustDie. Back then, it was identified as malware designed to target IoT devices and turn them into controllable bots specifically. Many high-profile organizations including DynDNS, security researcher Brian Krebs\u2019 blog KrebsOnSecurity and OVH hostings were among the key targets.More: Meet the Leet DDoS Botnet, Just as Powerful as MiraiThe purpose of developing a Windows compatible version of the notorious malware, according to Dr.Web researchers, was to ensure that Mirai is \u201cspread to even more devices.\u201dMirai malware is capable of infecting a diverse array of devices, but its main targets happen to be internet routers and IoT devices such as CCTV systems and DVRs. Once the malware manages to infect a device, it selects random IPs and tries to log in through the SSH or the Telnet port. To do this, it utilizes the list of default admin credentials of the targeted device.The new version is believed to be a Trojan developed for Microsoft Windows. It is written in C++ language. According to researchers, it has been designed to \u201cscan TCP ports from the indicated range of IP addresses to execute various commands and distribute other malware.\u201dWhen it is launched, the malware creates a link with its C&C (command and control) server and downloads the \u201cconfiguration file (wpd.dat), and extracts the list of IP addresses.\u201dAfterward, it launches the scanner and also checks for other ports. After Trojan.Mirai.1 succeeds in compromising a new device with the malware, it runs the Linux OS and also launches various commands to create a DDoS Mirai bot, but if the device is running MS Windows OS, it just releases its copy. Additionally, it creates DBMS user through using the login ID \u201cMssqla and password Bus3456#qwein.\u201dThese credentials provide it the sysadmin rights.

Another negative aspect of this incident is that the company did not inform its workers about the breach, reports The Register.The breach took place in September last year when a hacker exploited vulnerabilities in Sports Direct\u2019s employee portal that was using DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) based content management system.An anonymous source told The Register that the stolen data contains unencrypted data of employees including emails, phone numbers, names and postal address. The source also claimed that the hacker left a phone number in Sports Direct\u2019s system for the owners to get it touch with them. However, it is still unclear if the data is being sold on the Internet or leaked on the Internet.What\u2019s worse about this breach is that although the company found out about the breach in December, it didn\u2019t bother to inform the employees affected by the breach itself; it did, however, inform the authorities.Wieland Alge, GM and VP EMEA at Barracuda Networks said that \u201cthe employee portal breach at Sports Direct highlights that not enough is being done to get the correct security procedures and systems in place. Although it does not seem like the attackers were able to get their hands on financial information, only gaining access to email addresses, full names and phone numbers can lead to serious problems, perhaps leaving employees open to targeted phishing attacks.\u201dThomas Fischer, threat researcher and security advocate at Digital Guardian also commented on the issue saying that \u201cPublic and private organizations alike have a duty of care, not to mention legal obligation, to protect data. By failing to update its systems and appearing to disregard security best practices, Sports Direct has let its employees down. If GDPR was already in enforcement, the repercussions for Sports Direct could have been far greater as it appears that the company was in violation of two requirements of the regulation.First, under the GPDR, companies are required to use appropriate measures to protect all personal data, so the employee information should have been encrypted. Second, companies are obliged to report suspected incidents to the authorities within 72 hours. The incident also reminds us of the dangers of not notifying the affected parties. Sports Direct has failed to inform employees of the breach, putting those affected at further risk. With personal details in their hands, hackers may have targeted employees through phishing and social engineering attacks \u2013 and the employees would have had no reason to believe anything was suspicious.\u201dThis is not the first time that Sports Direct has been in the news regarding its employees. According to an undercover investigation by The Guardian, it was revealed that the owner of the company Mike Ashley, 22nd richest man does not only pay workers below the minimum wage but also involved in the mistreatment of employees.At the time of publishing this article, Sports Direct denied commenting on the report.

Initially, there were three flaws (identified about two weeks back) for which WordPress has already released security updates. However, we later learned that there was another huge vulnerability that allowed cyber-criminals to obtain unauthorized remote access to manipulate WordPress sites by editing or even deleting pages. This vulnerability was disclosed by the security firm, Sucuri.It must be noted that after the release of WordPress 4.7.2 in January 2017, the CMS/content management system\u2019s developers revealed that the latest version contained all the necessary patches to fix the three previously identified flaws, namely SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and access control concerns.However, a week later, developers claimed that there was another flaw for which a patch was also included in the latest version update. This flaw was quite dangerous as it allowed cyber-criminals to gain administrator privileges. This was a content injection vulnerability which affected the REST API. The site admins had a week to patch the flaw but failed to update their sites. Last week, Sucuri disclosed the flaw; sending hackers into overdrive to capitalize on mistakes made. Thousands of sites have since been hacked with all their home pages carrying \u201cHacked By\u201d messages.Sucuri stated that hackers had compromised not hundreds but thousands of websites due to the availability of unpatched websites in such large quantity. The firm further stated that it was the delay in patches being implemented which resulted in such a large number of pages being affected.Sucuri did inform WordPress about the vulnerability and a patch was included in the recent release from the company, but apparently, admins of the sites did not update their sites manually; perhaps they were relying on the automated updating feature, which unfortunately wasn\u2019t working. Within 48 hours, hackers had started exploiting the flaw.According to Sucuri, four different hacking groups were involved in the latest hack campaign involving WordPress websites. The exploitation is being conducted across the globe and there are apparently four campaigns running simultaneously against unpatched WordPress sites. One of the groups has managed to compromise over 66,000 pages while two groups have compromised 500 pages.The company was able to make the assumption that there are four or maybe more perpetrators of the crime because they have identified various IP addresses. W4l3XzY3 and Cyb3r-Shia are believed to be the groups conducting mass attacks. Sucuri has suggested that users must block following four IP addresses immediately: 176.9.36.102, 185.116.213.71, 134.213.54.163, 2a00:1a48:7808:104:9b57:dda6:eb3c:61e1.The IP address 37.237.192.22 is believed to belong to the hacker, so it is better that users block this one too. Two different hackers By+NeT.Defacer and By+Hawleri_hacker are using the same IP address, 144.217.81.160.According to SecurityWeek, there is a fifth hacking group involved too, but all the actors participating in the exploitation of the unpatched sites are mostly novices trying to boost their popularity online. However, security experts fear that the flaw will be used to perform search engine poisoning. As CTO and founder of Sucuri Daniel Cid pointed out: \u201cThere\u2019s already a few exploit attempts that try to add spam images and content to a post.

However, the notion is about to change. According to the analysis of two security researchers Claudio Guarnieri and Collin Anderson, there is a Mac-based malware dubbed as MacDownloader that is apparently being used by Iranian hackers to launch attacks against the US defense industry and human rights communities, especially those focused on Iran. They managed to identify the malware while researching cyber spying and surveillance activities of Iranian hackers. The researchers discovered this malware on an unauthentic US aerospace firm United Technologies\u2019 website. The same site was used previously in another spear phishing email hack attack, but at that time it targeted Windows-based systems. During that campaign, researchers also identified involvement of Iranian hackers.The malware is easily available for download via an Adobe Flash Installer and interested downloaders can choose from getting either Windows-based or Mac-based version. The malware is designed to spy on the targeted computer and obtain important credentials. To perform its task, the malware generates fake system login boxes, which it collects from Keychain, the password management system of Apple Inc. Researchers claim that the malware is not of superior quality and seems like the work of an \u201camateur developer.\u201dThey were able to drive this conclusion because when the malware is installed, it creates a fake Adobe Flash Player dialog box just to announce that adware has been discovered on the computer and it can clean it up.Researchers claim that these dialog boxes are full or \u201ctypos and grammatical errors,\u201d which hints at the fact that the developer(s) didn\u2019t pay enough attention to the quality of the malware at all. Moreover, malware cannot run a script to download other malware to the infected Mac. Still, the malware is regarded as a threat since it evaded detection from the antivirus scanning and aggregating engine VirusTotal.Also Read: Iran\u2019s Shamoon malware haunting Saudi Arabia againThe involvement of Iran was proven through circumstantial evidence; such as researchers discovered an exposed server uploaded by macDownloader that displayed names of wireless networks, which belonged to Iranian hacker groups.

Verify.ly suggests that these are extremely common apps, with a combined total of 18 million downloads. The problem is that these apps possess no protection against the devastating silent data interception of TLS-protected data.The research team at Verify.ly tested the shortlisted 76 apps, which included browser apps, Vice News app and various VPN apps and found all of them to be exploitable. Apparently, attackers can launch a silent man-in-the-middle attack using the inherent vulnerability and intercept, exploit and even steal crucial user data such as bank account login credentials.Verify.ly founder Will Strafach released a detailed report in which he outlined the findings clearly, and stated that 33 apps out of the vulnerable 76 are categorized as low-risk while 24 are in the medium-risk group and 19 are counted as high-risk apps.Strafach further stated that their system has shortlisted \u201chundreds of applications\u201d that are likely to have higher vulnerability to data interception.

Strafach stated that to protect data, it is a better idea to switch off your Wi-Fi and cellular data. Also, it is a wise strategy to use cellular data to login to your bank account, making transactions and balance inquiry. The reason is that cellular networks are not as easy to be tracked as Wi-Fi networks are.Strafach did not reveal the list of high-risk apps. The reason for this is that researchers have already informed the impacted companies and given them a time of 60 to 90 days to issue security apps. The list will be revealed upon a follow up within two to three months since cyber criminals can use those apps if their names are published before patching them.

What\u2019s happening is that users receive a message on their Facebook profile page, which is usually sent from any of their friends. The message bears the title \u201cThis is you?\u201d the question mark at the end of the title makes the user curious to find out if he or she is there or not.Embedded in the message is a YouTube video link that would supposedly show the video in which the friend identified the recipient to be present.

This is why it has become difficult for Facebook to block these links although the company is trying to reduce the impact of the scam by preventing them to their best ability.

Some links may redirect you to Amazon probably because the scammers have signed up for the affiliate marketing of Amazon.com in which the company gives referral commission. Once you click on the link, any future purchases you make from that website will help the scammers earn some cash.Some links may also lead to another phishing scam in which the user is shown a Facebook login page and requires login credentials to be entered to access the video.

The demand for VPN services has been on the rise in the recent past, thanks to the trend in which governments in various countries around the world are adopting legislation that limits the digital privacy rights of individuals. The problem is that you may find it hard to choose the most appropriate VPN service that you can use. Well, we have done the research part for you and here are five top VPN services for you and the reasons as to why you should use them:One of the main reasons as to why you should use IPVanish is that the service does not keep client logs at all. In practice, all services maintain only the records that they need to bill their clients and improve their services. However, some services maintain detailed records of the activities of their clients. The problem with services that keep detailed information about the activities of their clients is that law enforcement agencies can force such clients to give up the records.The good thing about IPVanish is that it does not keep clients logs. Because the service does not keep client logs, law enforcement agencies cannot obtain detailed information about the online activities of individuals who use the service.There are several reasons as to why you should use VyprVPN. In the first place, this VPN service has its proprietary network infrastructure, unlike what the case with many other VPN services. Because the service has its unique network infrastructure, it offers its clients relatively high connectivity speeds. Therefore, if you are to use a VPN service to stream content online, you should consider using VyprVPN because of the high connectivity speeds that you will experience.Second, the service has a unique feature called the \u2018Chameleon\u2019 stealth technology that overcomes internet censorship. The feature helps to bypass the specific restrictions that authorities place on ports as a way of blocking access to particular websites. Therefore, you should use VyprVPN to defeat Internet censorship practices and access content at fast speeds.Express VPN is one of the oldest VPN services on the market. Given the long period in which the service has been in operation, the service is now one of the best regarding the use of security features and other attributes. You should use Express VPN to safeguard your online privacy. The service uses some of the most advanced security features for VPN services. For example, it has the kill switch engage feature that helps to prevent leakage of IP addresses when you lose your connection to the VPN server.The service also has a .onion web address. You can use the web address to access the web in a more secure way than it is the case when you use the ordinary servers of the service. Therefore, you should use Express VPN to remain totally safe when you are online at all times.First, You should use NordVPN because it allows you to make payments using Bitcoins. Not many VPN services allow you to pay using new methods such as Bitcoin and others. Therefore, the fact that Nord VPN is among the few VPN services that allow you to use this mode of payments makes it one of the VPN services that you should use.Second, Nord VPN does not keep logs of the activities of its customers. Additionally, the service uses unyielding encryption methods, the most notable one being P2P. You can use this service to keep your communication safe by relying on its use of a highly reliable strong encryption protocol.Third, Nord VPN has a strong focus on protecting the privacy of its clients. The service has its headquarters in Panama, a small country with highly liberal laws in place. Therefore, governments that seek to snoop on what their citizens are doing find it difficult to access the content of NordVPN clients. Therefore, you can rely on this VPN service to remain anonymous and safe when you are online.The main reason as to why you should use HideMyAss VPN relates to its strong focus on the security of its clients. The service uses some of the most advanced VPN security features to keep your traffic safe from third parties. Therefore, when you use it, you can rest assured that third parties will not find it easy to access your traffic.Second, HideMyAss has a reputation as one of the VPN services on the market with secure server networks. The service has servers spread in many countries across the world. Because this service has a strong server network, it provides its clients with high connectivity speeds at all times.In conclusion, you should use these five VPN services because they use strong encryption protocols, accept different payment methods and do not keep logs of client data. Moreover, these VPNs have additional security features that make them the best services that you can rely on to safeguard your digital privacy.", "authur": "Ali Raza", "title": "Why You Should Use These 5 VPN Services", "date": "February 5, 2017"}, {"topics": ["hacking", "internet", "Phishing", "Phishing Scam", "Scam", "security", "Social Media", "twitter"], "body": "Twitter account verification means your account will get a blue verified badge.

The anonymous hacker has been dumping files from what has been described as a 900 GB sized trove stolen from Cellebrite.About a month ago, it was reported that a hacker had successfully breached the security systems of Cellebrite and stolen a large amount of highly sensitive data from the servers of the company. It was not clear how the hacker had managed to pull off the feat but what was clear was that the hacker was motivated by the desire to hack into the systems of Cellebrite and expose the inner workings of the much-feared phone hacking company.According to MotherBoard\u2019s report, the files that the hacker is currently dumping on the dark web contain various hacking and cracking tools that Cellebrite has been using to crack into the security features of older versions of iPhones and phones operating on other operating systems such as Android and Blackberry OS.It is reported that the hacker pointed out the need for governments and other institutions to learn that hackers can easily expose the goings on in companies such as Cellebrite that help governments across the world to spy on their citizens.\u2018As we move towards a highly authoritarian society, it is important to note that the debate about the use of backdoors by government institutions will only get stronger as time goes by,\u2019 the hacker added.The leaking of the files coincides with the recent political developments in various countries in the world. Various countries have already put in place legislations that allow government agencies to use backdoors to surreptitiously monitor what individuals do when they are online.Interestingly, in the United States, the debate over digital privacy is set to get more intense, with the new Trump-led administration now in place.It has been reported that the dumped data was accessed from a remote Cellebrite server that is connected to the Universal Forensic Extradition Device (UFED). The UFED is a flagship device of Cellebrite that the company uses to rip data from nearly any mobile device in the world.A person using the UFED has to get physical access to the phone before accessing all the data from the phone by using the UFED. The data that the hacker is dumping contains files that are used to jailbreak into the old versions of the iPhone and expose the PIN number as well as other personal details of the user. It is reported that the dumped data also includes code that can be used to rip off data from a BlackBerry device.According to the hacker, the entire code that has been dumped can be effectively used to access nearly any type of Blackberry device.\u2018This python script has been ripped and can be used to effectively access any BlackBerry device,\u2019 the hacker wrote in one of the README files attached to the dumped data. However, some observers have pointed out that some of the leaked tools may not necessarily be genuine. According to Jonathan Zdziarski, a forensic researcher, some of the dumped tools look like those used by other groups of hackers to attempt to jailbreak into some versions of the iPhone.Tony Gauda, CEO of ThinAir said that \u201cThe breach at Cellebrite is a privacy advocate\u2019s nightmare come true. And, while the legitimacy of the files leaked today hasn\u2019t been confirmed, this incident is a clear example of why backdoors are seen as a double-edged sword by members of the technology community. Software exploits that allow law enforcement to exfiltrate data during criminal investigations become extremely dangerous when in the wrong hands, and firms such as Cellebrite must acknowledge the huge target they have on their backs.

Eset, a cybersecurity firm, has discovered a phishing scam targeting PayPal users to steal their login credentials.In this scam, cybercriminals are sending fake emails tricking users into believing that their PayPal account has been limited due to \u201csome unusual activity\u201d which can be resolved only through contacting the official PayPal by clicking on the link embedded in the email. However, the bad grammar and syntax used in the email are enough to expose that the email was sent by crooks, not the PayPal security team.Upon clicking on the login tab and filling the login bars with their PayPal email and passwords users are taken on a website which has nothing to do with PayPal yet an official-looking PayPal warning page is displayed explaining to users how their account was put on restriction and instructing them that in order to claim their account back they need to click on the \u201cContinue\u201d tab.This means the scammers are not only after your PayPal but something more. This is where the scam initiates its final attack by taking users on to another official PayPal looking page and asks for their full address, city, state, zip/postal code, country, phone number, mother\u2019s maiden name, date of birth and social security number (SSN).Since PayPal never asks users for their SSN number this is another example how unsuspecting users should identify a scam. The reason cybercriminals are after user\u2019s family and financial details could be to conduct a large-scale identity scam using their credentials or to carry another scam on another network.Although this scam uses a fake email to steal PayPal login, it is indeed a fact that twice in the past scammers used government emails for similar scams. Also, currently there are several other scams targeting PayPal users including \u201cConfirm new security question scam, suspicious activity scam, payment made without permission scam and changes to legal agreement scam.If you have an account with PayPal, it is advisable to log in to your PayPal account by entering the web address into your browser\u2019s address bar or via an official PayPal app. The PayPal website has a verified green signature as shown in the screenshot below:  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});PayPal users are also often hit by smishing scams where cybercriminals send phishing links in text messages.

So when there is a security flaw in its system, it affects millions of users on the Internet. That is exactly what has been discovered by security researchers at Sucuri, an Internet security company which revealed that WordPress websites are vulnerable to a critical and easily exploitable zero-day Content Injection vulnerability.Sucuri found a Content Injection or Privilege Escalation vulnerability affecting the REST API allowing an attacker to modify the content of any post or page within a WordPress site. However, there is good news since Sucuri discretely reported the vulnerability to WordPress security team who handled the matter professionally and informed as many security providers and hosts and implemented a patch before this became public.If you are using WordPress on your website the only way you may be at risk is if you have not updated your WordPress to the latest version 4.7.2. The update was issued on January 26th. In their blog post, Marc Alexandre Montpas from Sucuri stated that \u201cThis privilege escalation vulnerability affects the WordPress REST API that was recently added and enabled by default on WordPress 4.7.0. One of these REST endpoints allows access (via the API) to view, edit, delete and create posts. Within this particular endpoint, a subtle bug allows visitors to edit any post on the site. The REST API is enabled by default on all sites using WordPress 4.7.0 or 4.7.1. If your website is on these versions of WordPress, then it is currently vulnerable to this bug.\u201dMontpas further stated that \u201cThis is a serious vulnerability that can be misused in different ways to compromise a vulnerable site. We are hiding some technical details to make it harder for the bad guys, but depending on the plugins installed on a site, it can lead to a RCE (remote command execution). Also, even though the content is passed through wp_kses, there are ways to inject Javascript and HTML through it. Update now!\u201dIf you or your friends are using WordPress, it is highly advisable to update your website and inform others about the issue so they can also update their WordPress to the latest version. WordPress has also acknowledged the issue and published a blog post earlier today urging users to update their WordPress since it poses a \u201csevere security risk\u201d for users.

Using these security flaws, any attacker can fully bypass the password on Netgear routers, modify the configuration, create an army of botnets by infecting multiple routers and develop entirely new firmware.The new vulnerabilities were identified by Simon Kenin, a security researcher at Trustwave while he was trying to access the web interface of Netgear VEGN2610 router and forgot the password. He tried to fuzz the server using various parameters manually and finally identified a file bearing the name \u201cunauth.cgi.\u201dIn a blog post, Kenin revealed details of his finding: \u201cI started looking up what that \u201cunauth.Cgi\u201d page could be, and I found two publicly disclosed exploits from 2014, for different models that manage to do unauthenticated password disclosure.

Those two guys figured out that the number we get from unauth.cgi can be used with passwordrecovered.cgi to retrieve the credentials.\u201dCVE-2017-5521: Bypassing Authentication on NETGEAR Routers.Then Kenin tested the same technique with some other models of Netgear routers and received similar results. Finally, he was convinced that even with erroneous coding he could access the credentials quickly. Kenin further revealed that the bug was \u201ctotally new\u201d and when both bugs were tested on different router models from Netgear, he identified that the second bug was applicable on a wider range of router models. He noted that the flaws affected some models; Trustwave researchers managed to point out tens of thousands of exploitable devices, which could be accessed remotely. The original number of affected devices could very well reach a million.The security advisory from Trustwave is available here. The flaws are a treasure trove for remote attackers as Kenin explained that \u201cThe vulnerability can be used by a remote attacker if remote administration is set to be Internet facing. By default, this is not turned on. However, anyone with physical access to a network with a vulnerable router can exploit it locally. This would include public wifi spaces like caf\u00e9s and libraries using a vulnerable equipment.\u201dIt must be noted that since the arrival of Mirai malware, millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices including CCTV cameras and routers have become vulnerable to large-scale DDoS attacks.

The forums from where the data was stolen are Xbox 360 ISO and PSP ISO. These two forums are dedicated to providing downloadable ISO files from gaming titles without any charges.HaveIBeenPwned, a website that allows internet users to check if their personal data has been compromised by data breaches revealed that 1.3 million users from PSP ISO and 1.2 million Xbox 360 ISO users got their accounts compromised. According to the site, the attacks occurred in September 2015. During the attack, hackers stole email IDs and IP addresses of the users along with user IDs and salted MD5 password hashes.Although the hack attack happened in 2015 but hackers have leaked the data online only now and probably the data has already been bought and sold on the Dark Web marketplace. It is also suspected that the data could be used in subsequent scams and illegal log-in attempts.As per the analysis of Mark James, ESET security specialist, such stolen data is always a prized commodity for malicious cyber criminals since these come handy while carrying out scams and phish attacks. James states that the data is valuable since it helps in enticing unsuspecting users and retrieving more information from them to conduct full-fledged identity theft.\u201cQuite often people using seemingly low-security websites don\u2019t enforce good password security because it\u2019s not a financial target, but all data has a value and will be reused for other purposes.

Typically they have weaker security, so it is easier for attackers to gain access to the passwords. Attackers rely on the fact that most users will reuse the forum password on other sites. While user education into the dangers of choosing easily guessed, or re-using passwords should continue. Companies need to evaluate all their digital assets equally from a security perspective.

When the ransom amount was paid, the computers were unlocked, and the hotel\u2019s systems regained their functioning.\u201cThe restoration of our system after the first attack in summer has cost us several thousand euros.

The criticism received by ZTE and Huawei for collecting and sending data to China shows how these apps can invade your privacy without you being notified about it.As you know, Virtual Private Network app or VPNs are considered a reliable way to ensure data safety while using applications. VPNs encrypt the data that is being shared by you online and hence, provide full security for the information. However, contrary to popular belief, not all the VPNs are as reliable and secure. Research conducted by Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of South Wales and UC Berkley found that nearly 38% of Android VPN apps are infected with malware; making blind trust of these apps a not so prudent move.Must Read: 7 Online Activities That Can Get You Arrested The research teams studied around 234 VPN apps that were uploaded on Google Play Store and a startling one-third were identified to be tracking users via malware. There were apps which carried out malvertising campaigns while 18% of them didn\u2019t encrypt internet data as promised. 8 out of 10 apps requested permission to access sensitive data such as text messages and user account credentials. This proves that the primary function such VPN apps are required to perform, which is to ensure the protection of user data, is not being performed by the available apps at all. The fact cannot be overlooked that these VPN apps are used by hundreds and thousands of users across the globe.To carry out the research, the team downloaded tools to reverse-engineer APK (Android Application Package) package that is used in the apps. Then they checked the Android Manifest file, which provides information like requested access permissions about the app and the source code. Later, they ranked the apps based on their findings. The ratings were given as per the anti-virus ranking.The top ten worst VPNs as finalized by the research team include these apps: 1. OkVpn, 2. EasyVpn, 3. SuperVPN, 4. Betternet, 5. CrossVpn, 6. Archie VPN, 7. HatVPN, 8. sFly Network Booster., 9.

Speculations are rife that the website has become the target of a raid from law enforcement for being a controversial platform of breach notification. The assumption comes from the message posted on Pastebin by a user. The message read:\u201cLeakedSource is down forever and won\u2019t be coming back. Owner raided early this morning. Wasn\u2019t arrested, but all SSD\u2019s got taken, and LeakedSource servers got subpoenaed and placed under federal investigation. If somehow he recovers from this and launches LS again, then I\u2019ll be wrong. But I am not wrong.\u201dIf this is true, then most likely the US law enforcement authorities are responsible for the raid.It is indeed true that LeakedSource is a rather controversial website for some since it garnered criticism and to some extent resentment from many companies that wanted to keep the information about data breaches confidential. Until now the site has highlighted a number of data breaches including  Last.fm, FriendFinder Networks, LinkedIn, VerticalScope, Rambler and DailyMotion. It is worth noting that 2016 has been quite a difficult year for organizations and users alike since the year showcased a record-breaking number of data breaches and around 4.2 billion records got exposed. Since then, the website has been sticking out like a sore thumb for those affected by the breaches the most.Since 10th January, the Twitter account of LeakedSource has remained inactive and on various occasions, LeakedSource users have complained about the website being unresponsive or offline. The same seems to be the case in this scenario as well but this time users are speculating that the site may never come back online. Users are naturally irritated as some of the site\u2019s users claimed on hacker forums that they recently bought LeakedSource subscription.The threat from law enforcement raiding and taking down such websites always lingers on to those running them. So, does this mean, the law enforcement will raid every breach notification website? Probably not, says Troy Hunt, owner of another breach notification website Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), in his latest blog post.Hunt noted: \u201cLeakedSource provided sensitive personal information obtained from data breaches to anyone willing to pay for it. It was a service that occasionally popped up in news stories and recently appeared on Wired. I\u2019ve been asked for my views on the service in the past and how I felt about them providing passwords to people who didn\u2019t own them. If I\u2019m honest, it\u2019s not something I gave much thought too\u2026 until someone sent me my personal data.\u201dAustralian security expert Troy Hunt claims that the difference between his service and LeakedSource is that his site is never used for nefarious purposes while the same cannot be said about LeakedSource. The reason is the presence of sensitive information on the website in large proportions. Allegedly, the site\u2019s databases stored 3.1bn accounts, and all those users who bought subscription could access to these accounts. They could easily access important, private data such as usernames, cleartext and hashed passwords, IP addresses and email IDs. This made the site vulnerable to exploitations from malicious threat actors.He further stated that HIBP has been running successfully for the past three years and he has also been making changes to address the changing sentiments of the public and the variations in the \u2018data breach landscape.\u2019\u201cFor example, when news of the Ashley Madison data breach hit, I elected to build out functionality to keep data from \u201csensitive\u201d breaches beyond the reach of anyone who doesn\u2019t own the email address impacted by the incident (or the domain it sits on). At the time, that took a lot of thought, but in retrospect the conclusion was simple: the data could cause serious harm to people so let\u2019s make sure that can\u2019t happen.\u201dHunt explains that LeakedSource wasn\u2019t appropriately protected either. The site was operating via CloudFlare and services like CrimeFlare made it an easy task for the law enforcement to obtain the real IP address of the site. Hunt notes that no matter who is responsible for the closure of LeakedSource and whether it has been closed or not, the incident presents an opportunity to reconsider the ethics of handling private data.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Breach Notification Website LeakedSource Allegedly Raided, Shut Down", "date": "January 27, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Android", "APPS", "Google Play", "hacking", "internet", "Malware", "Ransomware", "security"], "body": "CheckPoint, a renowned security firm, has discovered that at least one app on Google Play Store is infected with Charger Malware.

In that case, Yingmob, a Chinese hacker group, was claimed to be responsible for it.CheckPoint noted that HummingBad was also a \u201csophisticated and well-developed malware\u201d that employed a rootkit and chain-attack tactic to acquire complete control over the infected phone/device. It targeted non-Google apps and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities and security flaws that provided it root privileges on devices running on older Android OS versions. Google eventually shut it down, but by then HummingBad was installed in over 50,000 apps as it was infecting apps on a daily basis. It displayed 20 million malicious ads and helped the attackers make $300,000 per month as revenues. Out of the 10 million users who downloaded apps infected with HummingBad, around 286,000 were located in the US.HummingWhale is different from HummingBad regarding impact and severity. It is much more sophisticated than HummingBad and launches different fake apps and ads after gaining control of the device. It also controls its command and control center to virtually kill the device it inhabits. It has so far affected 20 apps on Google Play Store. Unlike previous version HummingBad, HummingWhale doesn\u2019t root devices but includes virtual machine tactics that let the malware perform ad fraud more convincingly.Just like HummingBad, the latest variant is also launched to generate revenue by showing fake ads and installing apps automatically. Whenever a user tries to close the ads, the new tactics included in the malware allows the downloaded apps to run in the virtual machine after the creation of a fake ID that lets attackers make money through referrals. HummingWhale uses VM feature, which is implemented through the malicious APK installation dropper called DroidPlugin. DroidPlugin is an extension developed by Chinese firm Qihoo 360.Quite contrary to previous versions which created havoc and affected many devices, the current problem is under control already since Google has gotten rid of the infected apps. CheckPoint\u2019s security researchers believe that it is unlikely that the same Chinese gang is behind this recent wave of attacks involving HummingWhale.

Moreover, the company noted that it never allows governments to receive backdoors into its systems and they will not give this authority to any government even if they are pressurized.In a statement, WhatsApp explained that:\u201cThe design decision referenced in the Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks.\u201dThe Guardian published a report which was based on the research carried out by independent researcher Boelter in April 2016. Boelter stated that he did inform WhatsApp\u2019s parent company Facebook when he identified the Retransmission Vulnerability, but he received the reply that it was an \u201cexpected behavior.\u201dWhatsApp argues that the key retransmission method is the company\u2019s deliberate \u2018design decision\u2019 which has been taken to curb the risk of messages being lost when the phone is switched, or SIM changed.After numerous attempts, the Guardian finally responded with a detailed statement regarding the whole matter.

The hackers offered Racingpulse.in an unimaginable favor by providing decryption key of a maximum of three files which should not be more than 10mb in size for free. This was probably done to prove that they did hack all the files on the site.

It seems Brian Krebs has been working hard to unmask the creator of Mirai botnet that has been creating havoc in the world of online security by compromising a huge number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to create a series of infected botnets.After his website had gone down for four consecutive days due to a massive attack ranging up to 665 Gbps data traffic, Krebs started investigating to ascertain the identity of the person who was responsible for the attack and much more such attacks on high-profile organizations including DynDNS. According to Krebs, his analysis is a result of \u201chundreds of hours of research\u201d as he was \u201cdesperately seeking the missing link between seemingly unrelated people and events.\u201dKrebs stated that a majority of DDoS attacks are launched to make quick cash. For instance, a company that offers DDoS protection would want to launch DDoS attacks on certain targeted clients so that they get convinced about the dangers of not obtaining their service and give into hiring them for DDoS protection.In Krebs opinion, the same happened to his website and many other websites such as French hosting service provider OVH and Deutsche Telekom that were attacked with Mirai malware using hundreds and thousands of botnets in 2016.Now the most important revelation; Who was behind the attack on Krebs website?As per Krebs research, Protraf Solutions owner Paras Jha is responsible for recent attacks involving Mirai botnets, including the attack on his website krebsOnSecurity. Protraf Solutions is a DDoS protection service provider firm.Initially, it was believed that a hacker who uses the name Anna-senpai was behind Mirai botnet. However, Krebs careful investigation has revealed that this assumption was not wrong at all since Anna-senpai is one of the many aliases of Paras Jha.In response to how he can claim that Jha is behind the DDoS attacks launched through Mirai botnets, Krebs stated that his first clue was that Mirai was linked with a botnet code family known as either Bashlite, Q-bot and Torlus. This particular group infects systems using infected IoT devices and then it searches the web for other vulnerable IoT so that the botnet army could become stronger.The second clue was the involvement of Lelddos, a criminal gang that has launched massive attacks on the server industry that supported Microsoft\u2019s Internet game platform Minecraft. This group attacked server providers including ProxyPipe for not availing Minecraft fix through a certain online server protection service. So basically, Krebs is stating that Jha was the one behind the attacks on servers that supported Minecraft and didn\u2019t use his DDoS protection service.Krebs also noted that DataWagon\u2019s owner Christopher CJ Sculti is an accomplice of Jha. DataWagon is another DDoS protection providing firm. So, Krebs claims that Lelddos gang comprises of Sculti and ProTraf owners. Krebs also revealed that apart from many other leads, a former co-worker at ProTraf admitted that Jha was responsible for Mirai. As expected, Jha has totally denied that he is Anna-senpai or that he is involved in the Mirai-based attacks.Source: KrebsOnSecurity", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Researcher claims to expose identity of Mirai Botnet Author", "date": "January 20, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Encryption", "government", "NSA", "Privacy", "ProtonMail", "security", "Spying", "Surveillance", "Tor"], "body": "ProtonMail, launched in 2014 by a group of MIT and CERN experts, is the largest email encryption service provider in the world having more than two million users.

Such as Egyptian government blocked encrypted chat application Signal and the UK government\u2019s approval of the Investigatory Powers Bill aimed at tracking the activities of web browsers.It is worth noting that ProtonMail\u2019s onion site was developed after consulting Roger Dingledine, the developer of the Tor software and president of Tor Project.

It has been dubbed by Apple Inc., as Fruitfly while Malwarebytes named it as Quimitchin, a name inspired by Aztec spies. This newly identified malware spy on biomedical research centers. It is being speculated that the malicious code has remained active for many years and has only been detected now.The malicious code was discovered by Malwarebytes after one of its IT administrators identified a strange pattern of incoming network traffic from a compromised Mac. Reportedly, this malware has been designed to capture screenshots, compromise the webcam of Mac machine and simulate key presses and mouse clicks. Apart from these features, it also performs the regular malware function of providing the attacker or hacker the ability to remotely control the device.Must Read: 11 easy tips to secure your Mac against hackersAccording to a blog post from Malwarebytes researcher Thomas Reed, neither his firm nor Apple have yet discovered how this malware is being distributed. What they have managed to identify though is that it is based upon old-school coding techniques, which are so old that probably date back to the time when the Mac OS X was launched in 2001.The most disturbing aspect is that Fruitfly also contains Linux shell commands and when Reed tried to run the malware on Linux machine, it worked \u201cjust fine\u201d and only the Mac-specific code didn\u2019t run. This means, the malware developers didn\u2019t know much about the Mac system and they used old documentation for its development.\u201cThe presence of Linux shell commands in the original script suggests that there may be a variant of this malware that is expressly designed to run on Linux, perhaps even with a Linux executable in place of the Mach-O executable. However, we have not found such a sample,\u201d noted Reed.Fruitfly is a relatively simplistic malware as it uses just two files; there is a .plist file that serves as a launching agent while the other is .client file, which runs all the time. The .client file serves as an obfuscated Perl script through which the contact with the command and control server is made.Also Read: Tech Support Scammers Targeting Mac Users with DoS attacksAccording to Reed, this script includes code for \u201ctaking screen captures via shell commands\u2026it [does] this both using the Mac \u201cscreencapture\u201d command and the Linux \u201cxwd\u201d command. It also has code to get the system\u2019s uptime, using the Mac \u201cuptime\u201d command or the Linux \u201ccat /proc/uptime\u201d command.\u201dReed noted that despite the fact that this malware is spotted easily, somehow it has remained undetected for a pretty long time. In fact, he stated that the malware had been successfully compromising Mac systems for the past few years. He further added that this is not merely speculation but a reality since the malicious code of Fruitfly was modified when the cyber-criminals wanted to address OS X Yosemite, which was released in October 2014. One reason that explains the undetectable nature of this malware is that it was used in limited proportion on strictly targeted machines.The main purpose of infecting Macs with Fruitfly was to perform spying operations and biomedical research institutes were its main targets. When a Mac is infected with Fruitfly, it acquires information from local networks and all the devices that were connected with it. The malware downloads a Perl script that is launched from the command and control server and utilizes mDNS to create a map of other devices connected to the local network. It can easily extract their names, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as well as the ports in use.

The latest exploit involving Samsung SmartCams further strengthens this notion that IoT devices are quite vulnerable to hacks.Since the time Samsung\u2019s SmartCams went on sale, they have become victims of exploitation by cyber-criminals. In the latest exploiting spree, the attackers have attempted to convey commands as the root user. In the previous such attacks, the remote command execution and modification of admin password were the primary achievements of the attackers. It must be noted that the Smartcams were developed by the former division of Samsung called Samsung Techwin now known as Hanwha Techwin. The holding stake of Samsung Techwin was sold in 2015 to the South Korea-based Hanwha Group.Read More: Nearly 80 Sony IP Camera Models Plagued with Backdoor AccountsIn the first attack, the local web interface of the SmartCam was completely removed, due to which users could connect to the Smartcam through the SmartCloud website of Samsung. The company was hoping that this tactic would prevent other upcoming exploits. However, they didn\u2019t remove the actual web server and only deleted the interface which was being run by the server. This paved the way the for the second wave of exploits in which commands were being issued on the Smartcam as root.The attackers injected a certain file into the iWatch webcam monitoring service of the SmartCam posing as a firmware update. This allowed them to execute commands remotely as the root user since the web server runs as root.Samsung claims that Hanwha Techwin is responsible for the SmartCams that are being sold by Samsung. It is an IP cam that lets users connect to Samsung\u2019s dedicated range of services and view recorded events or live streaming from anywhere around the world. It also allows uninterrupted monitoring of babies or pets as well as serves as a reliable home and business security measure.The vulnerability was discovered by Exploitee.rs and the researchers stated that:\u201cThe iWatch Install.php vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a special filename which is then stored within a tar command passed to a PHP system call. Because the web server runs as root, the filename is user supplied, and the input is used without sanitization, we can inject our commands within to achieve root remote command execution.\u201dRead More: $55 surveillance camera hacked by Mirai botnet within 98 secondsSource: Exploitee", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Botnet of things: Samsung SmartCams vulnerable to hackers", "date": "January 16, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Fraud", "hacking", "internet", "Netflix", "Phishing", "Phishing Scam", "Scam", "security"], "body": "If you have a Netflix account you might be at risk of falling prey to a new phishing scam that targets Netflix users through emails.

The company maintains that this phishing campaign is aimed at obtaining personal and financial information of Netflix\u2019s customers. The scammers have used some different tactics of malware and encryption, which make this campaign different from other phishing scams. These tactics help the campaign prevent detection from spam stopping applications and phishing filters and easily deceives and trap innocent users.

It is being distributed through spam emails that appear as invoices and contain a ZIP file in which an HTML Application or HTA file is stored. The file pretends to be a .DOC or .PDF file. Therefore, the victim believes it as a simple document and opens it. Once opened, the file extracts a Jscript in the %TEMP% folder after which it inserts an encoded script into it and runs the file.This new ransomware has been named as Spora and researchers noted that this is quite a sophisticated malware having well-implemented encryption features, very organized payment portal and numerous options for a ransom payment. Usually, ransomware offers just one package for a ransom payment, but Spora offers several packages such as victim can choose only to recover encrypted data or opt for recovering data and gain immunity from future ransomware attacks.Read More: LG Smart TV Screen Bricked After Android Ransomware InfectionAccording to Emsisoft\u2019s research team, It leverages encryption using the Windows CryptoAPI and the process of encryption is a combination of RSA and AES keys. The public RSA key is embedded within the executable file and its purpose is to create a fresh pair of 1024 bit RSA keys, one of which is private while the other is a public key. To encrypt it, another 256 bit AES key is generated, which aids encryption using the public RSA key along with information stored in a .KEY file.As apparent, the encryption process is quite complex and that\u2019s why researchers claim that Spora is a powerful ransomware. It is also worth noting that Spora carries out encryption without relying upon instructions from a command and control/c&C server link. Its encryption process is so strong that a decryption tool developed for a victim won\u2019t help another victim of the same ransomware. That\u2019s why at the moment security researchers are unable to assist victims through offering a particular remedy for files restoration without paying the ransom since no single mechanism can work for all.The pricing procedure of Spora is also quite distinct. The ransomware determines how much the victim needs to pay and the .KEY file stores critical information about the victim and the machine such as the date of infection, username and location of the system. This file also includes a campaign ID in the form of a hard coded identifier. This depicts that Spora is being sold as ransomware-as-a-service.Through storing the data in .KEY file as six numeric values, the malware manages to assess ransom amount and these values are also added in the user ID sent to the attackers by the victim for accessing the payment portal.There are in total five 5-character blocks that are separated by a hyphen and if five characters aren\u2019t added in the last block, then it is \u201cpadded with Y-characters,\u201d explain the researchers.

The message shows a link having the title \u201cYou are in this Video?\u201d and requests the recipient to click on it to see the video that features him/her. The title may vary in different messages, such as it could be \u201cThis video belongs to you?\u201d or something like that.Here is a screenshot of the malware sent to of our friends embedded behind a link:This is an old-school, widely tried-and-tested strategy through which scammers lure innocent users to click open dangerous links designed specifically to steal login credentials or infecting the victim\u2019s computer system with malware. Many users get trapped in this scam mainly because the message appears on the social network\u2019s private messaging service, the Facebook Messenger, and it is apparently sent by a friend. The reason why another of your Facebook contact sends you this malicious message is that his or her own account has already been compromised.The scam utilizes the natural inclination of users to check out a message in which their friend claims that they are featured. When the recipient clicks on the link, they become a victim of phish attack or malware scam. The phishing scam tricks victims into providing their login credentials by directing them to fake Facebook login pages, which seem totally genuine to users. These fake pages then steal the login information and immediately transfer it to the scammer.In this particular scam, the fake login page does not show the Facebook.com domain but asks the victims for their username and password. When the information is entered, the scammer accesses that account if two-step authentication is not enabled by the user.Another variant of this scam is the malware scam. The link that appears on the Facebook Messenger chat window directs the victim to sites infected with malware. The victim is asked to download a codec, plugin, video update or some other software in order to be able to play the video. When the user downloads the requested software, it infects the entire computer system.It must be noted that these two methods are being utilized by scammers in this latest scam. You may receive any one variant but the basic purpose remains the same, to hijack your Facebook account. Then your account will be used to send this malicious link to other contacts on your profile page.It is recommended that if you have fallen into this trap, do change your Facebook password immediately and run an anti-virus scan to cleanse your computer of viruses and bugs.More: Facebook Post Tagging Scam Steals Your Login Credentials", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Facebook users hit with \u201cYou are in this video?\u201d malware scam", "date": "January 14, 2017"}, {"topics": ["Facebook", "Fraud", "internet", "Privacy", "Scam", "security", "WhatsApp"], "body": "WhatsApp has lately become the prime target of malicious threat actors and scammer probably due to the widespread global following that the platform enjoys.

The victim is required to share this message with 13 of his contacts on WhatsApp in order to avail the offer. This obviously is an attempt to keep the scam spreading.When the victim shares the link with 13 others, they expect to receive free internet however, they only get redirected to other sites which ask for subscription or offer costly SMS services.

The soldier remained unaware of this data capturing.As soon as the phone was infected the seducers completely stopped contacting the soldiers, this sudden change of attitude alerted them about some kind of foul play and they informed their commanders.A senior IDF official told The Jerusalem Post that the male soldiers were the key targets in this campaign but some female soldiers were also trapped. The victims involved a major as well but the campaign was believed to be a low-level threat. However, the fact cannot be ignored that this could have been a serious national security issue.\u201cThere is, of course, a potential of serious harm to national security, but the damage that was actually done was minor, anyone who was infected is not infected anymore,\u201d said the official.No arrests have been made so far because the soldiers were unaware of the trap and they were just the victims. The infected phones have been re-formatted so that they Hamas operatives aren\u2019t able to compromise them any further.In order to increase public awareness regarding the risks involved in using social media and how to ensure that general public is prevented from such traps, Operation Combat Hunter was launched by the military as a precautionary measure. The military is also expanding restrictions on the use of social media by Israeli soldiers. Such as, high ranked military personnel (those who are Lieutenant-Colonel or above) cannot upload their pictures in uniform or disclose that they are IDF soldiers. The IDF has also released the pictures of 16 characters that Hamas is using to entice and trap Israeli military personnel.Read More: Israel\u2019s Major Traffic Tunnel Hit by a Massive Cyber-AttackNew guidelines for using social media have also been released by the Military Intelligence according to which soldiers can only befriend those people who they know personally and they cannot upload confidential information or download applications from third-party sources.Furthermore, the IDF plans to train its soldiers to become aware of the threat that is posed by the posting or uploading of personal pictures on social media platforms. A new division will also be created that will operate 24/7 and will immediately notify the military about any suspicious online activity.The IDF noted that over 3,000 IDF related Facebook groups are currently active out of which dozens are closed groups that allow soldiers to openly discuss operational issues. Hamas managed to infiltrate these pages after gaining the trust of the admins. Now, the pages\u2019 administrators have been alerted as well and instructed to add only those people to their groups whom they already know.The joint operation was conducted by the IDF\u2019s Information Security Department and Cyber Defense Unit in collaboration with Shin Bet. The main platform exploited by Hamas to carry out this campaign was Facebook. It is believed that through this campaign, Hamas only managed to get images of IDF war rooms, armored vehicles, tanks, observation devices and the location of soldiers posted in the border area.This is not the first time when Israeli military has embarrassed itself with such scams.

Bitcoin is a non-governmental and peer-to-peer currency, and it is the first currency of its nature. Bitcoin is famously known as a virtual currency, and its maker is trying to make it equivalent to the currencies issued by the government.  Unlike other currencies issued by a central bank, the Bitcoins have no support from governmental institutions. Bitcoins are generated through mining process. The blockchain is not an official currency, but it is a system to clear, settle, track, record and validate the ownership of assets as they are traded. A growing number of institutions and services are shifting their transaction systems to those based on blockchain technology. It is all because of reliability and flexibility the blockchain offers. Nowadays we can observe a leap in popularity of services and platforms, intended to be used for Bitcoin exchange and trading.The Bitcoin blockchain is a popular technology that involves ledges transaction to maintain the network of servers known as \u201cnodes\u201d. Every node manages a ledger reflecting the possession of assets. The blockchain ledger is disseminated because it is controlled simultaneously on all of the nodes in a network. It is easy to obtain a complete and continuous record of all transactions from its origination. Valid transactions are entered into the blockchain ledger in blocks or group with the help of cryptographic methods to confirm the reliability of all transactions. The transactions are recorded in the blocks to chain all of them in a ledger.The blockchain technology is flexible to wide range transactions, such as:The blockchain makes it easy to use professed smart contracts, such as embedded contracts in computer codes that may implement themselves automatically on the occurrence of discrete events. For instance:In legacy networks, all participants manage their ledgers with discrepancies and duplications that result in disagreements. It can increase the settlement time and require intermediaries with associated overhead cost. You can\u2019t alter a transaction after validating it in a shared blockchain based ledger. The business organizations can save costs and time while decrease risks. The blockchain technologies give assurance to improve transparency among automation, willing participant, and increase trust in recordkeeping and ledger customization.Blockchain unanimity merchandise offers the benefits of the consistent and consolidated dataset with fewer errors, near-real-time reference data, and flexibility for the participants to modify the descriptions of properties they own. No participant member will own the source for information contained in a shared ledger. The blockchain technologies lead to escalating integrity and trust in the flow of information among participating members. Immutability mechanisms of the blockchain technologies may lead to the reduced cost of regulatory compliance and audit with enhanced transparency.The contracts executed on the business networks with the use of blockchain technologies are final, automated and smart. They have lots of benefits for business organizations, such as reduce cost, increase execution speed and decrease the risk with the opportune settlement of contracts.       The blockchain technology is becoming more established in health officials, financial areas, developers, and vendors are looking to use it in the healthcare industry. Bitcoin cryptocurrency backs the blockchain technology, and it is a worldwide phenomenon to attract criticism and devotion. The blockchain-in-healthcare lab is designed by Philips and a new vendor of blockchain Gem also joined him. In healthcare, the blockchain may provide a secure and transparent record of health data and protect the details of data itself. It is a valuable piece of the puzzle; the blockchain is premised on the mathematically derived pseudonyms for distributed ledger verification.The HIPAA privacy rules may prohibit the use of mathematically-derived pseudonyms because of de-identification and re-identification (PHI) protected health information. Valid non-HIPPA blockchain complaint can resolve this limitation. Same issues have been highlighted about the blockchain use to support accurate ratings for travel sites and e-commerce and individuals, like police officers, colleagues, landlords, doctors, and teachers because of potential privacy threats. The irreversible nature of distributed blockchain \u201ctrust\u201d system also increase concerns about individual undermining.The blockchain is used to create a smart health profile and ties that profile to any individual patient. This profile will allow patient and financial information to be accessed and securely stored and relieve one of the fixed issues in Medicaid. It is a tested program to enroll beneficiaries and re-qualify them for healthcare services. It is good to keep information updated.  If you want to address the challenges of your blockchain in healthcare (HIPAA non-compliance), you have to combine blockchain with dynamic data obscurity to support non-mathematically derivative dynamically mysterious identifiers to address the compliance issue of HIPAA and overcome the Mosaic effect and enable privacy controls of granular. The obscurity may support the comparative use of data in a responsive manner. The combination of data obscurity and blockchain can be supportive of the requirements of privacy rules of HIPAA.Blockchain programs in healthcare enable health providers to share their networks without compromising integrity, data security, and data privacy. They can manage the lifecycle records of a patient with the help of blockchain. Streaming of medical bills through blockchain will be easy.The blockchain technology can automate the labor-intensive procedure required to settle the financial transactions and increase the speed of your work. It will reduce the cost of the transaction and replace the manual process of data entry. The blockchain system is useful to automate your business, and it is especially good for real estate. In real estate, the blockchain will help you to settle a lease and sales record of properties quickly.

Almost every organization is offering exclusive programs to white hat hackers and security researchers in order to identify potential security flaws in their networks, operating systems and other devices. Many websites and software developers are now coming up with attractive bug bounty programs through which upcoming hackers can receive recognition and also make quick money by reporting bugs pertaining to vulnerabilities and exploits.Through these programs, developers not only discover but also fix the reported bugs before the public gets a hint about it thereby preventing instances of widespread exploitation. So far many bigwigs of the computer and tech world have adopted this strategy namely Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Reddit and Square. Netgear is the latest to join the bandwagon.More: Inflight Entertainment Service Provider Gogo Launches Bug Bounty ProgramWe have already written about the latest study from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s public vulnerability database (CERT), in which it was revealed that Netgear routers R7000 and R6400 and some other models are vulnerable to command injection flaw. The vulnerability, if exploited by malicious threat actors, can help them in obtaining root privileges after which they will be free to run arbitrary commands. The code for exploiting Netgear routers\u2019 vulnerability is also released online and this aspect makes the situation a lot more worrisome for the company.This is why Netgear has decided to launch its first bug bounty program through which other vulnerabilities in the company\u2019s routers could also be identified before anyone exploits them.

Organizations use them regardless of their size; from MetLife, LinkedIn, City of Chicago, Expedia, BuzzFeed to KMPG and The Guardian there are several other high-profile platforms that are currently taking advantage of MongoDB.At the same time, having a high-profile customer doesn\u2019t mean that platform is completely secure. That\u2019s why in 2016, in two different incidents, hackers leaked more than 36 million and 58 million accounts respectively from unsecured MongoDB.More: LG Smart TV Screen Bricked After Android Ransomware InfectionNow, unsecured MongoDB databases are being hijacked by a hacker, who is not only wiping out these databases but also storing copies of them and asking for a ransom of 0.2 bitcoins (roughly US$ 211) from admins in exchange of the lost data. Those admins who haven\u2019t created backups of these databases are seriously helpless because the rate of Bitcoin is also increasing and the latest rate is 1 Bitcoin = USD1063.93.The hacking campaign was discovered by security researcher Victor Gevers, co-founder of GDI Foundation, a non-profit organization. Gevers notified owners about the presence of vulnerable, non-password-protected MongoDB databases and also informed that around 200 of these installations have been wiped out by the hacker.Gevers believes that the hacker(s) might be utilizing an automation tool but they manually select their target databases. Hacker seems to be interested in databases that contain important information/data or he chooses companies that are most likely in a position to pay the ransom to get their data back.In a conversation with SecurityWeek, Gevers said that \u201cThey use some sort of automation tool, but they also do some of the work manually. If they used a fully automated tool, we might have seen all exposed MongoDB databases being hijacked in one swift move.\u201dBut that was old news; as per recent tweet by Shodan founder John Matherly, approx. 2,000 databases have been erased. It must be noted that Shodan is the platform where a majority of MongoDB instances can be located. As of now, 16 admins/organizations have already paid the ransom to obtain the lost data.The attacks on MongoDB databases have been going on for more than a week and servers from across the globe have been targeted. Researchers believe that the attacker, who uses the alias \u201charak1r1\u201d does not encrypt the stolen data but runs a script, which replaces the database content with the ransom note.Gevers attempted to access one of the open servers and identified that instead of the database content there was just one table available for viewing, which was titled WARNING.

Or you can choose to restart the database server with -auth option after you create users who can access the database,\u201d according to Gevers.To see if you are also a victim or not simply check the MongoDB accounts and note if there is any new secret (admin) user; then check the GridFS for any newly stored files and finally inspect the log files in case some unauthorized user has tried to access MongoDB instances.If you want to prevent yourself from being the victim of hacking, you need to enable authentication, which should provide you \u201cDefense in depth,\u201d in situations when the network gets attacked. To do this, you need to edit the MongoDB configuration file \u201cauth-true.\u201dMore: San Francisco Railway\u2019 Fare System Hacked for 100 Bitcoin RansomMoreover, you need to enable firewalls and disable remote access to MongoDB databases if you can. For admins, it is recommended to block access to port no. 27017, which can be done by using firewalls.

It is worth noting that these sorts of malware campaigns are usually designed to work on Google\u2019s operating system instead of the iOS.Cyber Criminals Targeting Users with WhatsApp Gold Version Malware ScamThe reason why Indian android OS users are frequently being targeted by hackers in such campaigns is that Indian market is very popular for low-cost, cheap Android smartphones that run on older versions of the android OS.Hackers are attacking two key organizations in India to compel users to click on the word documents attached in the malicious WhatsApp message. This message has names of two major organizations of India namely National Defense Academy/NDA and National Investigation Academy/NIA.

This is why the general public has started believing that computer hacking involves the use of keyboard and intricate programming.However, CNN went a step further and used footage from the year\u2019s most popular game Fallout 4 believing that no one would recognize it. The footage was used by CNN in one of its recent stories on President Barack Obama\u2019s proposition of sanctions against Russia due to the country\u2019s alleged involvement in cyber-attacks on important US institutions over the past few months. In this particular news report, CNN posted an image of the hacking mini-game from the very famous RPG Fallout 4.In the game Fallout 4 and all of its previous versions namely Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, the players need to hack computers for unlocking doors and safes in order to get information.

Gone are the days when people were crazy about smartphones and tablets only, now they want everything from their fridges and washing machines to coffee makers and light bulbs to become smart and linked to the internet, but there is a problem. According to latest research from Scotland Yard these smart appliances might be able to provide critically important digital forensic evidence from the crime scene, which could be used by detectives to solve criminal cases including murders.In 2015, British government\u2019s investigatory bill came up with a proposal on making it legal to hack smart toys in order to allow investigators to get to pry on suspects. Now, Mark Stokes, Scotland Yard\u2019s digital forensics chief, told The Times that IoT devices have the capability of revolutionizing crime-scene investigation and it is important to train detectives to be able to find digital footprints in order to track events. This training would allow law enforcement authorities to establish the legitimacy of alibis or rule out inconsistencies in the statements given by witnesses.Unsecured Security Cams Giving Away Images of Sleeping Babies, Cafes and Banks\u201cThe crime scene of tomorrow is going to be the internet of things. A \u00a33,000 fridge with a built-in family hub in it will soon be \u00a3400. Wireless cameras within a device such as a fridge may record the movement of suspects and owners,\u201d said Stokes.\u201cDoorbells that connect directly to apps on a user\u2019s phone can show who has rung the door and the owner or others may then remotely if they choose to, give controlled access to the premises while away from the property. All these leave a log and a trace of activity,\u201d Stokes further explained the concept in detail.Such as the latest Family Hub fridge from Samsung is equipped with a camera that can conduct live feed of the contents of the fridge. Stokes believes that the data and timeline logged by this smart fridge along with the images captured by its internal camera can surely be used as crucial evidence in some kinds of criminal cases.In this regard, the authorities in the UK are planning to create a digital forensics kit. This kit is reportedly being developed to let investigators download data from the crime scene and scan data using microchips. This could be used as an alternative method to confiscate a number of devices that were in use where the crime happened.Hackers Steal Parents, Kids Data in a Massive Data Breach on Toy ManufactureThis isn\u2019t something novel because the law enforcement authorities in the US have already started the trend of using data from smart devices. For instance, Arkansas Police asked Amazon to provide data from one of its Echo devices to collect data for a murder investigation. Amazon though declined this request citing that the company wouldn\u2019t provide this information without a genuine and \u201cbinding\u201d legal requirement.Police in Arkansas was actually investigating the murder of Victor Collins. In 2015, Collins was found dead in the hot tub manufactured by Echo System. The police took data as evidence from the electric water meter, which illustrates that heavy volume of water, was used on that day, which detectives believe may be so because whoever committed the crime might have tried to wash the blood away from the patio.It is worth noting that Echo home entertainment system is owned by James Andrew Bates. The Echo system delivers a variety of functions including weather forecasting, light switches, thermostat controllers and plays music too. Additionally, it has the capability of improving its functioning through changes in the owner\u2019s voice using AI technology, which is why the device could be useful in solving the case of Mr. Collins\u2019 murder.After Spying Webcams, Welcome the Spy Toys \u201cMy Friend Cayla and I-Que\u201dHowever, Amazon\u2019s reluctance in the provision of evidence points out an important aspect linked with using IoT devices in a criminal investigation, which is of violation of user privacy.

Now, there is a new Android-based Trojan discovered by Kaspersky Lab researchers known as Switcher Trojan because of its ability to firstly infect the device\u2019s Wi-Fi routers and then switch users of that infected network to various infected sites. This means, the Trojan doesn\u2019t directly targets the users but acts as a facilitator of attacks that eventually convert victims into its co-conspirator.More: Beware: Android Super Mario Run is Actually Malware; Don\u2019t Download ItAccording to the analysis of Kaspersky Lab researchers, there are two versions of this malware that are currently affecting android devices. Both the versions are being utilized to hijack nearly 1,280 wireless networks. The firm\u2019s mobile security expert Nikita Buchka states that most of these infected networks are located in China. One of the two versions pretends to be a mobile client for Baidu, a popular Chinese search engine, while the other appears as a version of an app that locates and shares WiFi login information.When the victim downloads any of the two versions, it immediately performs the key task of infecting the router through brute-forcing, which is password guessing attack directed on the router\u2019s admin web interface. Research suggests that the malware has a list of over 2 dozen username and password combinations which let it access the web admin interface of the router.When this is done the Switcher Trojan swaps out the DNS servers\u2019 addresses of the router for a fake server that is being controlled by the attacker(s). The IP addresses used by the malware are 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11 and 120.76.249.59. There is an extra DNS too that comes in handy for the attackers when the fake one doesn\u2019t perform or is detected.More: Low-cost Android Smartphones Shipped with Malicious FirmwareAfterward, all the requests from the devices that are made on the infected network are re-routed to the attackers\u2019 servers. This action makes the victims vulnerable to all sorts of attacks including phishing, malware, redirection and adware.Kaspersky Lab Researchers noted that:\u201cThe ability of the Switcher Trojan to hijack [DNS] gives the attackers almost complete control over network activity which uses the name resolving system, such as internet traffic. The approach works because wireless routers generally reconfigure the DNS settings of all devices on the network to their own \u2013 thereby forcing everyone to use the same rogue DNS.\u201dBuchka explained that the developers of this malware didn\u2019t make the sections of its command and control website too perfect but they did leave a publicly viewable table that contained full statistics of internal infection. A review of the website revealed that the attackers have so far infected 1,280 Wi-Fi networks within a few weeks\u2019 time.Researchers claim that the operating mechanism of Switcher malware shares a remarkable resemblance with DNSChanger malware that is now being used as an exploit kit. Another security firm Proofpoint recently observed that there was a campaign that was targeting wireless routers and modifying DNS entries for stealing traffic. But in that campaign, the vulnerable routers were those made by D-Link, Pirelli, Comtrend and Netgear.

It is a known fact that Facebook uses your profile information to display relevant ads but not many are aware of the fact that it also gathers a lot of information from offline data brokers for this purpose.More: US Immigration asking foreign travelers for their social media account detailsCollecting information about users is nothing new and presumably, users have gotten used to this aspect of using Facebook. However, using information that you have entered about yourself, the articles or posts that you check out and the pages you have \u2018Liked,\u2019 the videos you have watched etc., are not only collected by Facebook but also used to sell ads.According to ProPublica\u2019s research, this process isn\u2019t very simple and Facebook apparently has moved a few notches higher in this aspect. The social network has contracts with various data brokers that offer information about users\u2019 offline life. This exchange of information includes places that you like to dine in, how much money you make and the number of credit cards you have.The data about your offline life is then used by Facebook to further polish its strategic placement of online ads. But the downside is that users are totally kept in the dark about this hijacking of offline life of users.ProPublica identified this strategy of Facebook when it created a tool to encourage users to share whatever they found about this aspect of the social network.

According to Imperva researchers, the attack was most probably the result of the attackers \u201cnot being able to resolve the IP address of his actual victim, which was masked by Incapsula proxies.\u201d\u201cBasically, the entire attack was just a mishmash of pulverized system files from thousands upon thousands of compromised devices,\u201d researchers explained in their post.The company couldn\u2019t identify the IP address or the sort of devices used to launch the attack because the malicious actors used fake IPs to remain undetected. However, it was clear that thousands of infected devices were utilized as botnets for the attacks and the only clue left by the attacker was the \u201c1337\u201d signature that was left in the TCP header.It was also identified by payload analysis that the attack was launched via two distinct SYN payloads and the packets ranged between 44 and 60 bytes. Some really large packets were also noticed, which ranged from 799 to 936 bytes. The reason was that the lower range was used to achieve higher Mpps packet rates and the larger range was used to enhance the capacity of the attack to up to 650 Gbps.Use of SYN packets shows that Leet and Mirai both are quite different from each other since Mirai isn\u2019t designed to conduct large-scale SYN attacks and has hard coded TCP options including MSS, SACK, TSVAL, and WSS. Additionally, Mirai payloads are created from random strings.It is indeed true that the year 2016 has been one of the most disturbing years considering the huge number of DDoS attacks launched this year and the exceedingly high ranges that were attained by the flood of traffic.

The research further reveals that Cerber has started \u201ctargeting companies\u2019 databases to maximize profits from the ransom, so this is another reason to take additional precautions.\u201dExclusive Tips: How to secure your cyber infrastructure from threats like ransomware?With this fresh campaign, cyber-criminals are basically trying to exploit weaknesses that prevail in mainframe internet browsers such as Silverlight, Internet Explorer, Edge and software like Flash Player.The campaign starts with infecting genuine websites through injecting malicious script, which is actually the Nemucod generic malware downloader. The script then redirects the traffic to a Cerber gateway called Pseudo Darkleech. It is a kind of malware infection that adds a strong clouding layer so that detection could be avoided. Nemucod is used in this campaign because it can easily run Cerber ransomware. Remember, Nemucod was recently used in another campaign in which hackers were using images on Facebook Messenger to drop Locky ransomware. However, it was firstly identified in December 2015 as a \u201cTrojan downloader.\u201d What makes this campaign different from other ransomware campaigns is the fact that this time cyber-criminals have incorporated several types of malware in one single attack.

The attacker(s) aim is to make the infection persist until the encryption of the data on the victim\u2019s computer is completed, and the attacker could ask for ransom. When data encryption is complete, the victim is asked to pay the ransom, which ranges from 1.24 BTC (bitcoins) to 2.48 BTC, equivalent to $1,068 to $2,136 as per the latest BTC rates.On the other hand, Pseudo DarkLeech makes use of secret iframe injections and randomizes elements to let the malware operate without getting detected.

In this article, we\u2019re going to review some more tips that will help you work and study online without having to worry about your information getting stolen.One of the easiest ways to minimize the risks of information theft is by accessing your office network or the online learning program\u2019s platform using a computer you can trust. This can be your own laptop or desktop computer that only you can use.Take proper steps to add security measures to the laptop. An up-to-date antivirus, firewall software and good user management are all that you need to get started. When you access the family nurse practitioner course you\u2019re taking online, for instance, you don\u2019t have to worry about other users stealing your login info.Do you know that you\u2019re more likely to have your password stolen online than when it is written down in a notebook and stored at home? Writing down passwords actually enables you to have different passwords for different accounts, which means you can secure your online presence further without a problem.Work out a way to write down passwords without actually mentioning the account they are for. For example, you can use initials to mark which passwords are for which accounts. Keep the note safe by storing it in a locked drawer or another safe place around the house.You should also consider using a tested-and-tried password management software. 1-Password and similar software can help you store passwords for multiple accounts safely. Even better, these apps can also suggest a strong password for your accounts by generating random strings you can use in one click.One last weak link to fix is the password recovery option you use on different accounts. We often choose security questions that are easy to remember. Unfortunately, most of the security questions \u2013 and their answers \u2013 are about things that information thieves can also find online.The name of your first dog may be posted on your Instagram or Twitter account. Your story about that visit to your aunt\u2019s house may reveal her name and the answer to another security question. Your favorite teacher at high school and other common security questions are just as easy to guess or figure out.Switch to a security question only you can answer, apply the previous tips we\u2019ve covered in this article, and be sure to stay up to date with the latest security tips here on HackRead.

In October, they tried to raise 10,000 Bitcoins, which equals to around $7.8 million, through crowdfunding by selling the second batch of files which included information like vulnerabilities, RATs, exploits, data collection tools and persistence methods. However, this scheme also could not be beneficial.Now, according to a post on Medium, Shadow Brokers have come up with a new strategy to make some bucks from the stolen data by selling it directly through a new website. The group is now selling the stolen exploits for 1,000 bitcoins, which is about $780,000. Shadow Brokers have released a batch of files citing that the IPs that the files mentioned did correspond to the Equation Group machines.Reportedly, the leaked files targeted a large number of devices manufactured by renowned brands including TOPSEC, WatchGuard, Fortinet, Juniper Networks and Cisco. The files seem to be associated with an NSA-linked actor.The platform being used by the Shadow Brokers is called ZeroNet, which is used for hosting websites with blockchain and BitTorrent tech. The hacker group is trying to create a site to sell the stolen exploits for 1,000 Bitcoins for the whole data and the price of individual exploits is between 1 and 100 Bitcoins per exploit.The data has also been sorted by the group this time around as they have categorized it in respective categories such as Trojan, Implant and Exploit. Interested visitors would get screenshots of the files they intend to buy.One of the available files is signed with a PGP key; it features a fingerprint that matches the fingerprint of the original dump. Interested parties need to email a member of the group, who will then send the Bitcoin payment address. Once the payment is made, a link to the required file will be sent by Shadow Brokers along with the decryption key.", "authur": "Owais Sultan", "title": "You can now buy hacked NSA tools for Bitcoin 1000", "date": "December 19, 2016"}, {"topics": ["breach", "Cyber Crime", "Data", "hacking", "internet", "LinkedIn", "security"], "body": "LinkedIn acquired Lynda.com in 2015 for a whopping $1.5 billion.

However, the company has affirmed users that there is no evidence regarding exposure of their passwords or public leaking of the hacked data.Yet, LinkedIn has confirmed that around 50 to 55 thousand users of Lynda.com are notified to reset their passwords on an immediate basis. As a precautionary measure, LinkedIn will also notify 9.5million other users whose entire learner data (excluding the passwords), which is also stored in the hacked database.Currently, there is no indication about the possible perpetrators of the data breach or the \u201cunauthorized third party\u201d as the company puts it. We have no information whether the data breach was conducted by a security researcher trying to scan the internet to identify vulnerable databases or this is the work of a malicious hacker.Investigators are doubtful at the moment because of the ongoing spree from white hat hackers who try to locate publicly accessible databases in order to notify the related company and expect some kind of reward in return. It is very much possible that this data breach is a result of efforts by white hat hackers. However, going by LinkedIn\u2019s record so far in data breaches we can also speculate that malicious attackers could be involved.Over the years, LinkedIn has suffered too many data breaches such as in 2012, passwords of 117million users of the website were stolen. In May 2016 the data from that breach was exposed by hackers on the DarkWeb. Initially it was claimed by LinkedIn that only 6.5million accounts were hacked but in reality over 117million users were affected.However, the alleged hacker behind LinkedIn breach was arrested in Prague in October this year.

Frisk wrote a blog post to explain his findings and the process in detail. According to his blog post, the MacOS FileVault2 allows attackers \u201cwith physical access\u201d to obtain the password in the clear text simply by plugging in the \u201c$300 Thunderbolt device\u201d regardless if the mac is sleeping or locked.\u201cThe password may be used to unlock the mac to access everything on it.

If the mac is sleeping it is still vulnerable,\u201d wrote Frisk.Also Read: This $5 hacking tool lets attackers bypass security on locked computersThe faults in MacOS identified and exploited by Frisk include the insufficient protection against Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks prior to the starting of MacOS. It was noted by Frisk that the Mac EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) allows the devices that are plugged in over Thunderbolt to control memory without activating DMA protections. This hint upon the fact that Thunderbolt devices are equipped with read and write access to the memory.The second issue exploited by Frisk is that MacOS stores password to the FileVault encrypted disk in clear text format in memory even if the computer is locked or in Sleep Mode.\u201cThe second issue is that the FileVault password is stored in cleartext in memory and that it\u2019s not automatically scrubbed from memory once the disk is unlocked. The password is put in multiple memory locations \u2013 which all seems to move around between reboots, but within a fixed memory range,\u201d explained Frisk.Also Read: A USB device can steal login credentials even if the PC is lockedIt is worth noting that PCILeech is a device that can automate DMA attacks and obtain Mac FileVault2 passwords in seconds.

Now, Comodo Threat Research Labs have identified a new malware Tordow v2.0 which is the first mobile banking Trojan created specifically for Android devices affecting users in Russia.It has become a serious threat for Android users because it tries to obtain root privileges after infecting a device, which is unlike other banking Trojan since they never seek to gain root privileges for performing their malicious tasks. The reason why this new malware tries to obtain root privileges is that the attacker wants to take full control of the device and perform a variety of operations.Read: Low-cost Android Smartphones Shipped with Malicious FirmwareAccording to Comodo Labs\u2019 research team, this malware can perform the following functions on an infected device:> Making phone calls > Monitoring SMS messages > Downloading additional software > Installing programs > Stealing login credentials > Accessing contacts list > Encrypting files stored on the device > Opening and visiting web pages > Handling banking data > Deleting security software > Rebooting the device > Renaming files > Asking for ransom by serving as ransomware > Collecting information about the software and hardware, operating system, model, internet service provider, manufacturer and location of the device.Tordow 2.0 can search Google Chrome and Android browsers for locating sensitive information. The malware is being distributed via apps that are available on third-party stores online. Such as versions of Pokemon Go, Subway Surfer and Telegram that are available at third-party stores are all infected with the malware. If the user refrains from downloading apps from third-party sources, then it is able to prevent the infection. This is why security researchers always stress upon downloading apps from authentic and reliable sources.Read: Over 300k Android Devices Infected with Banking TrojanIn case a user downloads any of these third-party apps, which are delivered as APK files, the attackers perform reverse engineering to infect the device with Tordow 2.0 malware. The apps are then re-uploaded on the stores. It is also possible that the attackers try to distribute the infected apps through social media platforms. So always beware of such apps.\u201cDon\u2019t download apps from a third-party store.\u201dWhen the Trojan is installed, it tries to obtain root privileges and once this is done, it creates contact with its command-and-control server and from there it gets additional instructions. The prime objective of the attackers is to use banking information and make some money easily. User\u2019s financial information is in great danger due to Tordow 2.0. Since the malware obtains root privileges, therefore, it gets a bit difficult to delete it; using firmware to remove the source app that caused the issue in the first place will not help either.The Trojan has CryptoUtil class functions through which it can easily encrypt/decrypt data via AES algorithm.

After all, if you\u2019re the type of person who stays abreast of these issues, there\u2019s no way your computer is unsecured. Perhaps take the time to consider the possibility just this once, because unless you\u2019ve done the necessary digging required to change the default passwords on every single one of your connected devices \u2013 your smart fridges, smart TVs, Apple Watches and wireless video baby monitors \u2013 there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re part of one of the biggest, baddest botnets in the history of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.A new breed of botnetAs defined by DDoS mitigation provider Incapsula, a botnet is a group of internet connected devices that have been hijacked through malware so they can be remotely controlled, often without the owners\u2019 knowledge. Once a botnet has been assembled it can be used for a number of malicious purposes, most notably for distributed denial of service attacks, which use the tremendous number of devices in a botnet to direct malicious traffic at a target website or server in order to overwhelm it and render it unusable for legitimate users.Traditionally, botnets have been largely made up of infected computers, but with the way the internet has evolved there are now many more internet-connected devices for attackers to choose from. The newest trend in botnets comes courtesy of the Internet of Things (IoT) \u2013 all those innovative internet-connected devices that are revolutionizing homes, commercial establishments and public spaces around the world. This is a dangerous innovation because security on these devices is lacking, to say the least. Security so far has not proven to be a major priority when it comes to the development of these devices, and rare is the consumer who thinks to secure their smart appliances and fancy new gadgets. The Mirai botnet and other IoT botnets are taking advantage of these oversights, assembling massive zombie armies that are now being unleashed on the internet.Mirai mayhemThe Mirai botnet is made up of IoT devices that have been infected with Mirai malware, a malware built to find and infect IoT devices using default passwords, and to launch distributed denial of service attacks. The Mirai malware is so serious about its dirty work that it will actually remove other malware found on the device. Some of 2016\u2019s most notorious DDoS attacks came courtesy of the Mirai botnet. First came the 620 Gbps attack on online security blogger Brian Krebs, then called the biggest DDoS attack in history. Then came the 1 Tbps attack on French hosting provider OVH, which replaced the Brian Krebs attack as the biggest attack in history. Following that was the 1.2 Tbps attack on DNS provider Dyn that yanked PayPal, Spotify, Netflix, Twitter and other major websites and platforms off the internet. The Dyn attack is still currently known as the biggest DDoS attack in history.The estimates of the number of IoT devices snared up in the Mirai botnet started around 50,000, jumping to 100,000 and then 150,000. A pair of hackers is now offering Mirai botnet-powered DDoS for hire services, claiming 400,000 infected devices. The problem with vulnerabilitiesThe DDoS attacks being launched by Mirai and other IoT botnets have major consequences that ripple across the internet, costing organizations incredible amounts of money and causing widespread frustration and anger amongst users who are unable to access the websites they need.Even if an IoT device owner were to somehow not care that their device is being used by remote attackers to wreak havoc across the internet, there are other aspects of malware infection that should be concerned. Major ones. If an attacker is able to use a default password to enlist a device as part of a botnet, an attacker is also able to use a default password to take control of the device, accessing data and other sensitive information, possibly even audio and video feeds in the case of CCTV cameras, baby monitors, nanny cams and more. You can check if you have a device vulnerable to the Mirai malware by using this TCP/IP scanner. Regardless of what the scanner says, if your devices have default passwords, they need to be changed. No exceptions. This will protect you and your family as well as the internet at large. You also need to disable all remote or WAN access to your IoT devices. This open port finder is a good tool for checking for remote access capabilities on SSH (22), Telnet (23) and HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) ports.

Congratulations, the advanced security features of the platform will protect you for life\u2026or so you\u2019d like to think. Unlike ready SaaS solutions, online website builders with centralized managements, WordPress is a popular open-source CMS with open code with lots of security vulnerabilities. And believe me, these vulnerabilities can be easily used to bring harm to your website and business. You need to defend yourself, and the best way to do so is add reinforcements. I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 plugins! However, plugins aren\u2019t a 100 percent foolproof. In fact, it\u2019s now being said that the more plugins, themes, and custom codes you add to your WordPress blog, the higher the likelihood of getting hacked. No, what you need to do is secure your site\u2019s administrator. Betcha didn\u2019t know about that! To know how to find out below.Read: How to secure your cyber infrastructure from threats like ransomware?Limit Plugin UsageTry not be tempted by the various plugins available for WordPress. Install only the ones you think are indispensable. The more careful you are with your plugin choices, the more secure your site will be. Plugins not only hamper your security but affect the performance and speed of your site as well. Too many plugins can drastically slow down your WordPress site. Your best bet would be to consider plugins that combine multiple items on your must-have features list.Premium Plugins for Free? No ThanksWe can understand the temptation to download and install free premium quality plugins when on a budget, but it\u2019s best not to do so. Unless you purchase them from an official source, illegal versions of premium plugins generally contain malicious code. Not to mention the fact that piracy is illegal! So, the next time you spot premium plugins available for no cost, be very wary \u2013 what was once a good plugin with the excellent code has now become a hacker\u2019s direct line into the backend of your website. Ask yourself \u2013 Are all these risks worth saving a few bucks?Automatic Core Updates are a MustYou should update your WordPress installation as soon as a new version\u2019s released. Older versions of WordPress have their security flaws listed all over the Internet. It won\u2019t take long for a hacker to use that info and mount an attack against your website. Make site maintenance a regular habit. Or, if you\u2019re too lazy, you could always turn on automatic updates. This fulfills both your criteria of a hands-off approach and a secure website.Automatic Updates for Themes and PluginsThemes and plugins generally need to be updated manually. However, if you don\u2019t schedule site maintenance regularly, configuring automatic updates might be the best way to stay on top of things without any immediate intervention.Get Rid of the Theme and Plugin EditorThere are plenty of developers who make tweaks and changes to WP platform themes and plugins on a regular basis. This step is not meant to them. In the case of users who don\u2019t use the built-in theme and plugin editor on the WordPress dashboard occasionally, it is better if the option is disabled. What does the editor have to do with security? Well, for starters, this editor is used by authorized WordPress users and if their accounts get hacked, the editor might be responsible for the downfall of the entire website. All this can be achieved with a few code modifications.Remove PHP Error ReportingThe backend of your WP website is rife with weak spots and holes. Actually, very few sites aren\u2019t. However, this does not excuse the fact that if a theme or plugin doesn\u2019t function properly, an error message would be flashed across the screen. The problem stems from the fact that such error messages sometimes include your server path, the whole of which is visible in the error report. Thus, disabling error reporting is the best possible solution.Never Put Author Usernames on DisplayNever leave the WordPress defaults intact. It makes it very easy for hackers to find out your username, and since, more often than not, you are the administrator too, they get access to your admin username as well. This is never a good sign. Hackers can use even the smallest bit of info to compromise your site. The best course of action would be to hide the username of the author. Then if hackers try to get admin information, they\u2019ll be directed back to the homepage.Always Monitor the Activity on Your DashboardIf your site has lots of visitors, you should always keep a close eye on what\u2019s going on using your dashboard. It isn\u2019t that all of them are up to no good, but sometimes when there\u2019s too much activity on your site, it pays to be alert. The tiniest misstep can have huge repercussions. This is perhaps the reason why a lot of admins choose to log their dashboard activity \u2013 it enables them to retrace the user\u2019s steps up to the point when the site broke down. The dashboard even gives you the opportunity to retrace your own steps.Your security receives a much-needed boost as you can now connect the dots between a particular action and a particular reaction. Now if your site breaks down due to a certain file upload, you can investigate deeper to see if any malicious code was present or not.It is possible that you might find the automated information log for WordPress difficult to use and cluttered. In that case, you can always go for a plugin that organizes all of the data.Keep the Login Page HiddenIt\u2019s true that hiding some elements of your page won\u2019t deter hackers from accessing them, but at least you\u2019ll put up one heck of a resistance. And that is always a good sign! You can rename or relocate your login page to confuse hackers. Most brute force attacks are automated, so when your login page is a little different than the norm, the impact of the attacks will be weaker. There are loads of plugins that can help you make such a simple change.Update Your ComputerIt\u2019s often seen that despite the best security measures, hackers are accessing the WordPress site. This occurs due to vulnerabilities in the computer itself. Your only solution is to keep the system updated. Install software patches as soon as they are released. Upgrade to a newly released operating system as soon as possible.The task of safeguarding your WordPress site involves a lot more than security plugin installation. You need to devise a complete strategy, taking even subtle nuances into consideration. We sometimes tend to overlook the smaller things, but these can make all the difference between good security and great security.Read: How to use Google Search to locate your lost Android Smartphone or Tablet", "authur": "Lesley Haught", "title": "10 Ways to Protect Your WordPress Site You Didn\u2019t Know About", "date": "December 16, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrency", "internet", "Malware", "Money", "Privacy", "security", "Technology"], "body": "Zcash, a cryptocurrency that debuted on 28th October 2016, is believed to be more anonymous than the overhyped Bitcoin.

Reportedly, hackers are installing software on Windows-based computers and forcing the machines to mine Zcash for them.

While founder and CEO of Zcash, Zooko Wilcox said users need to take preventive measures such as downloading anti-malware.\u201cUnfortunately, we have no way to prevent this kind of thing, since Zcash is an open source network, like Bitcoin, that nobody (including us) controls. Our recommendation to security companies that detect this kind of activity, like Kaspersky, is that their software should alert users when potentially malicious software (like that described in their blog post) is detected, and give the user the option of shutting it down or, if it was deliberately installed by the user, allowing it to run,\u201d said Wilcox.Also Read: Bitcoin Mining malware infects Seagate Central NAS devicesNevertheless, Zcash is claimed to be ASIC resistant, lightweight and very much decentralized and makes mining with plebian hardware a profitable idea in the long run.

According to Gostev, \u201cdownloading mining software to a PC doesn\u2019t necessarily have severe consequences for a user\u2019s data.\u201d\u201cHowever, it does have the effect of increasing the energy consumption level of their machine, which results in more expensive electricity bills.

Even while the company was assessing its systems following the discovery of the 2014 breach, this separate and larger breach went completely unnoticed. It\u2019s clear organizations lack adequate visibility of their data. You don\u2019t stand a chance defending digital assets you can\u2019t see. Yahoo isn\u2019t the only company with a breach just waiting to be discovered, and until the industry prioritizes reducing the time spent on investigations, this cycle will continue.\u201dVishal Gupta, CEO of Seclore also see a negative impact on Verizon and Yahoo\u2019s deal after the series of mighty data breaches.\u201cYahoo is learning for the second time this year that the most dangerous data breach is the one that goes undetected, and it could have a significant impact on negotiations with Verizon. With the details of over a billion users compromised, there is no doubt that the leaked information has already been leveraged by cybercriminals in one way or another. While payment details weren\u2019t stolen, the hackers made away with names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other PII that can be used for highly targeted spear-phishing campaigns. Until organizations responsible for safeguarding large amounts of user information shift to a data-centric security model, they remain highly valuable targets for hackers, who will continue to come up with inventive ways to infiltrate systems.\u201dCasey Ellis, CEO and founder, Bugcrowd commented that as every failure is an opportunity it may also be an opportunity for Yahoo to prove itself as a resilient firm.\u201cIn a year full of high-profile, bigger-than-ever breaches and DDoS attacks it should no longer be surprising that anyone is hit by a major breach. As before, it\u2019s likely that at this point Yahoo is already past the assessment stage, having determined the initial damage and the value of the assets that were affected. But what is the next step? They are likely trying to determine how to prevent this from happening yet again. This is yet more proof that security is a moving target, which is why continuous testing should be fundamental for any organization \u2013 especially those that handle sensitive data.There is a tendency for organizations to focus on finding the perpetrator in these attacks, but especially given understaffed security teams, a better area of focus is not the who, but the what. Just as you can\u2019t control which burglar shows up at your door, you can\u2019t control which treat actor attacks you. However, you can control where you are vulnerable, locking your door and closing the vulnerabilities in your systems.In security, it\u2019s not about proving you\u2019re secure, it\u2019s about proving you\u2019re resilient. This will be yet another opportunity for Yahoo! to prove just that.\u201dRichard Henderson, Global Security Strategist, Absolute warns users about changing their passwords since the elements behind this breach can conduct further scams by trying their luck on users\u2019 financial information using the same password.\u201cThings get dicey when we look at the long-standing problem of password reuse. If the billion password hashes have been broken, then that provides a ton of ammunition for attackers to attempt to get into other accounts belonging to the same target. If you used the same password for your bank or for your iCloud picture storage as you did for Yahoo, then an attacker has all he or she needs to breach those other accounts.Organizations watching these developments should be taking the time to thoroughly review how they are storing passwords themselves \u2013 if they\u2019re not storing hashes appended with a long enough random salt (and it needs to be a unique salt per user) \u2013 then they need to get on top of that right away.Beyond that, there are lots of companies out there that comb the web for password lists and will compare them against their own users\u2019 passwords. If there\u2019s a match, the password has been reused and should be changed.On the user side, you can mitigate the risk that a breach like this will lead to someone getting into your other internet assets by ensuring every password you use is unique, random and varied. A password manager program can make this simple for you. Using multi-factor authentication whenever it is offered also will lower your risk profile.\u201dIt was just last week when a hacker reported critical bug in Yahoo that allowed attackers to read anyone\u2019s email at any time whilst a couple of months ago Yahoo was slammed by its users when it was revealed that the company built a software to secretly scan user emails for the NSA.In case you want to delete your Yahoo account click here to go through our complete guide on Why and how to delete your Yahoo email account permanently.", "authur": "Waqas", "title": "Yahoo hacked; More than 1 billion user accounts impacted", "date": "December 15, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Botnet", "cyber attacks", "Cyber Crime", "DDOS", "FBI", "hacking", "internet", "Mirai", "security"], "body": "Young hackers are creating quite a lot of trouble for the US cyber security agencies lately.

For security reasons Yahoo has a filtration process for HTML messages helping it to keep malicious code block from reader\u2019s web browser, however, Pynnonen was able to bypass the filtration process by sending a YouTube link in the email allowing him to execute JavaScript code and read user\u2019s emails.\u201cAs long as the URL pointed to a white-listed website such as YouTube, it was not further sanity checked or encoded,\u201d writes Pynnonen.The good news is that the flaw has been fixed.

To participate, players need to download the collaboration software of Surface Defense and get registered after which they can run this program locally on a PC. To disrupt online services, traffic is routed via Tor.For every ten minutes spent on the attacked website by bombarding it with fake traffic, one point will be given to the attacker. This point will then be traded with the standalone version of Sledgehammer that can be fully customized by them and sold to other hackers too.To maintain healthy competition among the participants, a live scoreboard is shown on the forum so that everyone is aware of the earned points. Some of the users have already made hundreds of points.This new scheme of launching DDoS at selected websites was identified by Forcepoint Security Labs. The scheme was discovered at the Turkish Dark Web hacking forums Turkhackteam and Root Developer while there are approx. 24 websites that are currently on their hit list.

Reportedly, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and several other competitive institutions have agreed to the rapid sharing of information and analysis related to cyber threats. The coalition of otherwise cutthroat competitors reflects one of the smartest possible moves in a game that is too often won by the bad guys. Because companies within a common industry typically suffer similar attacks, the formation of the subgroup within the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) will be among banking\u2019s best tools for detecting complex threats and attacks. Other industries should follow finance\u2019s lead.Industry-driven threat sharing can be the difference between detecting an attack early in the incident or far too late. For finance \u2013 as well as other vulnerable sectors, such as healthcare and manufacturing \u2013 there has never been a more relevant time to form information-sharing alliances. Nowadays, there are many systems and best practices in place to make sharing threat information with industry peers as easy and beneficial as possible; however, companies, IT teams and even security professionals still resist doing so. This is, to an extent, understandable. Sharing requires all parties to invest time, money and effort into a centralized platform that accounts for distributed networks. Perhaps more importantly, this kind of collaboration requires trust, and that is a complicated quality to foster among competitive organizations.The first step to overcoming these challenges is to lower the barriers and make the process as quick and painless for participants as possible. This will need some level of technical support to make industry collaboration actionable in a timely manner, including automating processes like threat reporting. Whether that support comes from internal teams or external third parties, organizations will have to structure or standardize their data for easy sharing and consumption to help support actionable and efficient processes. This step is key since teams are understandably reluctant to divert any time during an attack away from mitigation to report out to an industry group.Tackling the trust issues around reputation damage and data reliability is even more challenging. If commercial markets aren\u2019t leading the way to cross this and other barriers to information sharing, governments will have to step in to instill regulations or required frameworks.Companies in industries that witness increased threat need the leadership of internal and external visionaries to make information sharing the norm. Chief information security officers, sector organizations like FS-ISAC and industry computer emergency readiness teams (CERTs) all have a role to play in promoting defensive information sharing.Once the will is established, the success of cross-company information sharing will come down to how easy it is for participants to do it. Easy information sharing will require:Additionally, the regulators must take an active role in rallying for greater information sharing.

This series features the IPELA ENGINE signal processing system of Sony.It is discovered that the security cameras have backdoor accounts that can be exploited to gain control of the device. Such as Mirai malware can attack IoT devices and turn them into a botnet.These backdoor accounts can easily provide hackers complete access to the security cameras. It must be noted that the security cameras by Sony are used by high-profile organizations around the world.It is also identified that there is a CGI binary (prima-factory.cgi) file that lets a remote user enable the Telnet service by sending a specially designed HTTP request to the device. This request requires the inclusion of authentication data. However, the username and password (primana/primana) are already present in plain text format.Hackers can utilize these credentials to send out a request to the CGI binary file and activate Telnet service after which he can leverage the root account and acquire remote access with increased privileges.Once the hackers obtain root access they can easily carry out a variety of actions including spying on the user of the camera, disrupting the operations of the camera and even manipulate videos. They might also compromise the network that is housing the camera or infects the device with Mirai or similar malware such as Bashlite or Lizkebab.Sony has already released a Firmware update to delete the backdoor accounts. The updates contain hardcoded password hashes for the root and admin users. Until now researchers have managed to crack admin password but it is believed that root password can also be obtained by the hackers quite conveniently. The admin password has been identified to be \u201cadmin.\u201dThe identified vulnerability of Sony IP cameras can be exploited by hackers having network access provided that the web interface of the camera is exposed. According to a research, there are thousands of unprotected cameras in the United States. Also, just a couple of weeks ago, a researcher has his surveillance camera hacked with Mirai malware within 98 seconds only as soon as it gets connected to Wi-Fi.SEC Consult stated that the \u201cprimana\u201d user account is actually a backdoor and is apparently introduced by Sony purposefully for testing its devices. Researchers have also identified a similar account dubbed as \u201cdebug\u201d and contain this password: \u201cpopeyeConnection.\u201d However, its functionality hasn\u2019t yet been identified by the research team.In a blog post, SEC Consult\u2019s researchers stated that:\u201c\u201dAn attacker can use cameras to take a foothold in a network and launch further attacks, disrupt camera functionality, send manipulated images/video, add cameras into a Mirai-like botnet, or to just simply spy on you. We believe that this backdoor was introduced by Sony developers on purpose (maybe as a way to debug the device during development or factory functional testing) and not an \u2018unauthorized third party\u2019 like in other cases (e.g. the Juniper ScreenOS Backdoor, CVE-2015-7755).\u201dSEC Consult notified Sony about the discovered vulnerabilities on 11th October after which Sony released firmware updates for the IP camera with versions 1.86.00 and 2.7.2 on 28th November.If you own an IoT device use this online Internet of Things (IoT) Scanner to make sure it is not hacked.

As soon as the attackers get control of the device, they can perform a variety of devastating actions such as killing the patient. All that is required is pushing a button.In their paper [Pdf], researchers identified that these compact heart devices fully rely upon a proprietary wireless communication system. In a majority of cases, this communication system utilizes a long-range Rf channel. This channel can be easily hacked by attackers/cyber-criminals without even being close enough to the device. When the attackers are able to intercept the connection between the IMDs and the monitors, they can carry out a variety of attacks such as DDoS attacks or reverse engineering.\u201cAll these attacks can be performed without needing to be in close proximity to the patient.\u201dThrough compromising IMDs the cybercriminals can control the device and compromise its security system altogether, which is indeed an issue to be concerned about. It hints at the fact that smart devices like the IoTs and IMDs that use a wireless network to communicate aren\u2019t reliable at all as these can be easily compromised by even non-expert hackers.Also Read: Researchers show how medical robots can be hacked during surgeryWhile discussing what kind of attacks can be conducted and how poor is the security researchers said that:\u201cWe want to emphasize that reverse-engineering was possible by only using a black-box approach. Our results demonstrated that security-by-obscurity is a dangerous design approach that often conceals negligent designs,\u201d the researchers stated in the paper. Our first attack consisted of keeping the ICD alive while the ICD is in \u2018standby\u2019 mode by repeatedly sending a message over the long-range communication channel. The goal of this attack was to drain the ICD\u2019s battery life, or to enlarge this time window to send the necessary malicious messages to compromise the patient\u2019s safety.\u201dThe researchers recommended that to mitigate such threats, it is a wise idea to jam the signal. But it is a short-term remedy. To implement a more powerful security system, it is advised to enable standby mode when the communication isn\u2019t taking place.This is not the first time when researchers have demonstrated how life-saving medical devices can be life-threatening for patients.

The two weaknesses are as follows:\u201cFirstly, the current online payment system does not detect multiple invalid payment requests from different websites. This allows unlimited guesses on each card data field, using up to the allowed number of attempts \u2013 typically 10 or 20 guesses \u2013 on each website,\u201d added Ali.\u201cSecondly, different websites ask for different variations in the card data fields to validate an online purchase. This means it\u2019s quite easy to build up the information and piece it together like a jigsaw. The unlimited guesses, when combined with the variations in the payment data fields make it frighteningly easy for attackers to generate all the card details one field at a time,\u201d Ali explained.Also Read: How To Steal Data and Information From Computers Via HeatEvery card field that is generated, states Ali, can be used to generate another field and the process goes on. If the hits are distributed across multiple websites, then it is possible to expect a positive response to every question within merely two seconds. This is same as any online payment process.\u201cSo even starting with no details at all other than the first six digits \u2013 which tell you the bank and card type and so are the same for every card from a single provider \u2013 a hacker can obtain the three essential pieces of information to make an online purchase within as little as six seconds,\u201d says Ali.To get card details the hackers need to use online payment websites for guessing the data and the transaction\u2019s reply would confirm whether their guess was right or wrong.The paper\u2019s co-author Dr. Martin Emms said that there is \u201cno magic bullet\u201d for those concerned about the security of their debit and credit cards but some steps can be taken to curb the potential risk of getting card hacked.\u201cUse just one card for online payments and keep the spending limit on that account as low as possible. If it\u2019s a bank card then keep ready funds to a minimum and transfer over money as you need it,\u201d recommends Emms.

It is an exceptional product that can help you maintain optimal privacy by evading CCTV cameras installed at the roadsides and also to alert other drivers on the road when you are enjoying night-time biking adventure.Reflectacles is the name given to the range of light-reflecting sunglasses and eyewear created by Scott Urban. Urban has utilized the most authentic reflective materials that are only used in high-class applications for creating Reflectacles.It is worth noting that Reflectacles is not just for bikers to be noted by other drivers but it is also suitable for pedestrians. There are a few versions of the product and each is created with the high-quality retro-reflective material.Such as Reflectacles Ghost has the ability to reflect both visible and infrared lights. This means, security cameras that work using infrared technology, which basically means a majority of such devices, will never capture your facial features when you are wearing Reflectacles Ghost. Therefore, you can term it as an anti-facial recognition device. Reflectacles Ghost can also reflect visible light, due to which drivers on the road will be able to notice you at once as soon as you enter the road no matter if you are walking or riding a bike. This model is available in just one color, grey.Also Read: These Anti-Surveillance Tools Will Protect Activists and Their PrivacyReflectacles Originals, on the other hand, can only reflect visible light and is available in seven different colors namely, Neon, Gold, Blue, Silver, Orange, Red and Green.

However, it isn\u2019t yet confirmed by the central bank of Russia if hackers were trying to impact the worldwide financial system or not with this latest attack.The idea comes from the analysis of Symantec Security\u2019s researchers that there is a very dangerous hacking group dubbed as Lazarus, which is trying to bring down the global banking system. It is believed that the group is operating from North Korea. However, the involvement of Lazarus in the attack on Russia\u2019s central bank is not yet confirmed.On Friday, the Russian government notified the press that there was an attempt by malicious cyber criminals to disrupt the trust that their public have on the national financial system, which was foiled by the concerned Russian authorities.Also Read: 50 hackers Who Stole $25million Arrested by Russian AuthoritiesAs per the investigations conducted (FSB), Federal Security Service of Russia, the hackers used a collection of computer servers based in the Netherlands to carry out the hack attack on Russian banks.

The below given screenshot shows what data is available:Although DoubleFlag claims both Experian and WhoIs databases are new and never been leaked on the Internet or were never part of the leaked databases before, we would like to state that there are several other vendors selling the same WhoIs data since the exact same database is available for public download on Bestwhois. In fact, DoubleFlags\u2019s listing description for WhoIs data matches with the publicly available WhoIs database description and also with the data description of other vendors.When it comes to Experian data there is no indication if it is fake however the description published by DoubleFlag matches with the description available on Poris Data Services, known for selling automotive mailing lists including postal addresses, vehicle information of US vehicle owners and B2B lists. The data may be real and if it is, it\u2019s a massive privacy threat for Experian customers.We have now received an official response from Experian in which the company has denied its servers being breached by a third party.

The leaked data included high resolution of scans of ID card of employees of the company raising concerns that it may be used by impostors to impersonate as licensed explosive handlers. Most instances of data and identity theft have motives such as scamming and fraud. However, this particular leak has the potential to cause some serious damage.

The volume which represents only a fraction of the total exposure assured Vickery that the leak was real and must be fixed at the earliest.A file that Vickery downloaded through the leak was an excel spreadsheet that apparently contained the personal information about all the workers of Allied Horizontal. Ironically, Vickery used the same file to look up the CEO\u2019s personal mobile number and gave him a call last Monday (28th, November).After hearing about the whole situation from me, he realized the gravity of the situation.Vickery asked him if he could reach the IT unit of the company and he readily made his IT people call Vickery.

However, researchers have warned that hackers can also target users with phishing emails carrying Gooligan-infected infected links.Once the victim installs that app, Gooligan gains root permissions and replaces the original app by conducting a privilege escalation attack similar to rooting apps like Towelroot and Kingroot or even malware like Godless and HummingBad.The Gooligan attack that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 (Jelly Bean, KitKat) and 5 (Lollipop) exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153) and sends data to its Command and Control (C&C) server.

In a statement, the company confirmed the attack:\u201cThe attack attempted to infect routers with a malware, but failed, which caused crashes or restrictions for 4 to 5 percent of all routers.\u201dThe reason why the company was targeted was that it had vulnerable internet routers. Due to Mirai botnet, nearly one million Deutsche Telekom customers experienced internet connectivity issues.Also Read: $55 surveillance camera hacked by Mirai botnet within 98 secondsThe news was reported on Monday and it was revealed that the company immediately identified Mirai as the main source of the attack. It was also reported that Mirai malware managed to infect over 500,000 IoT devices including routers, CCTV cameras and DVRs.Now with the new and improved version of the malware, security researcher Johannes Ullrich from SANS technology Institute states that the number of infected devices will increase at a rapid pace.Ullrich observed the infections in IoT devices and came to the conclusion that the malware has been upgraded especially to exploit a specific vulnerability in internet routers manufactured by Zyxel.The purpose behind creating Mirai malware was to exploit internet connected devices that operated with default logins and passwords. The attackers had to just scan the web for such and then used their database of over 60 password combinations to crack the device.However, research reveals that Mirai\u2019s new version is capable of targeting a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) service flaw. This service is embedded in routers from Zyxel. Currently, the actual number of affected devices is not yet clear. According to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s analysis, around 900,000 of its total 20 million customers experienced internet service issues due to the attack.Contrary to the telecom firm\u2019s statement, Ullrich states that Mirai\u2019s new version successfully ensnared some of the IoTs. In fact, Ullrich also established a web server to serve as a honeypot, which could be lured in the attack. He mentioned that once the malware infects a device, it looks for other vulnerable devices instead of keeping exploiting it. By Monday morning, Ullrich was able to identify 100,000 unique IP addresses that attempted to infect the honeypot that he created.Also Read: Also Read: $55 surveillance camera hacked by Mirai botnet within 98 secondsResearch has also identified that Mirai doesn\u2019t simply infect the devices but creates a botnet of these devices, which can be understood as creating an army of computers that can be completely controlled by the attacker. The army will then be used to launch large-scale DDoS attacks.As of now, Mirai\u2019s new version hasn\u2019t launched any DDoS attack and the customers of Deutsche Telekom faced connectivity issues only. The telecom firm has issued an advisory to its customers for eliminating the infection.Ullrich believes that this new version of the malware has infected internet routers of other internet service providers and enterprises as well. The problem is that others probably aren\u2019t aware of the issue. Ullrich also stated that possibly 1 to 2 million routers might be infected.Mirai-related attack against Zyxel & rebadged routers.

The hacked email was backed with another email address (cryptom2016@yandex.com) which was also protected with the same secret question and answer as the cryptom27 email address.Upon taking over both emails the researcher shared a number of conversations and logs with Krebs that gives an indication of the hacker\u2019s whereabouts and previous targets. For example, IP address of more than 300 logins shows the hacker was singing in from Iran, the account owner name was mentioned as Ali Reza, a common name in Iran while a phone number linked to another account belonging to a hosting company in Russia.A habitual extortionist:The inbox of MUNI hacker revealed much more than what one would expect, for instance, the favorite target of the attacks were the construction industry. After going through his emails it was clear that he has been earning some big bucks through ransom scams such as China Construction of America Inc., was forced to pay 24 Bitcoins ($17,500) on Nov. 27 Sunday, in order to unlock about 60 of their servers infected with Mamba ransomware.Other targets that were infected by this attack include CDM Smith Inc. in Boston, King of Prussia, Pa, based Irwin & Leighton, the Rudolph Libbe Group, Indianapolis-based Skillman and Libbe Group, a construction consulting firm. It is however not confirmed if all these firms were forced to pay ransom or not \u2013 or if they have got their files back or not.We recommend our readers to go through Kreb\u2019s blog post for a further analysis of the hacked inbox.Pay ransom or not? = NOTThe FBI tells victims to pay the ransom and get their locked data back, however, it is a wrong practice which only helps hackers to exploit innocent users.

According to Wired, Israeli security researchers from Ben-Gurion University [Pdf] have developed malware that can convert your headphones into microphones to record all your conversations.Mordechai Guri, the head of the research team from the university\u2019s Cyber Security Research Labs, believes that people usually overlook the probability of headphones or earbuds being vulnerable.\u201cEven if you remove your computer\u2019s microphone if you use headphones you can be recorded,\u201d noted Guri.Israeli researchers have also created \u201cSpeake(a)r,\u201d a proof-of-concept that demonstrated the way hackers can easily hijack your headphones and record audio even if the microphones have been disabling or even removed.Speake(a)r basically uses the headphones as microphones and converts vibrations into electromagnetic signals. That\u2019s how it manages to record audio from across a room.However, the revelation comes as no surprise because the transformation of earbuds into recording devices is already discovered phenomenon and there are countless YouTube videos that demonstrate how it is done. The reason is that the headphones\u2019 speaker uses the vibrations produced by its membrane into the air to turn electromagnetic signals into sound waves. These particular membranes also function in reverse, that is, these can pick sound vibrations and turn them into electromagnetic signals.The difference between already known and publicly available information and the analysis of Ben Gurion university researchers is that the malware they have created uses a lesser-known feature of RealTek audio codec chips to carry out the hack. It basically modifies the function of a computer\u2019s output channel to work as an input channel. This allows the malware to capture audio while the headphones remain linked with an output-only jack. It must be noted that the headphones don\u2019t even have a microphone channel.Also Read: WindTalker Attack Leaks User Data Using Smartphone\u2019s WiFi SignalsThe research also revealed that the attack can literally work on any desktop computer primarily because the RealTek chips are extremely common. So no matter which operating system you are using Windows or MacOS, there is every possibility that your audio can be recorded. It is even possible on laptops.Guri further stated that the vulnerability is real; \u201cit\u2019s what makes almost every computer today vulnerable to this type of attack.\u201dThe researcher also tried to test the same technique of hacking audio using a pair of Sennheiser headphones. It was learned that they could record audio from 20 feet distance. To check the quality of sound, the researcher compressed the recording and passed it onto the internet and they were astonished that they could tell the words were spoken by a male.Guri says that the technique is quite \u201ceffective. Your headphones do make a good, quality microphone.\u201dCurrently, there is no guarantee that a basic software patch could fix the eavesdropping issue because RealTek chips\u2019 ability to switch between output and input channels isn\u2019t an accidental bug, it is an inherent feature.

According to court documents the agency used a single warrant and compromised more than 8,000 computers in 120 different countries.Some information related to this secret hacking operation was disclosed by Motherboard in January this year in which it was reported that the FBI deployed a malware to over one thousand visitors who allegedly frequented a child pornography website on the darkweb. The case garnered immense publicity back then as the child pornography Playpen website case.Also Read: FBI Caught Paedophile By Infecting Tor Web BrowserHowever, a latest report compiled after reviewing court documents suggests that the magnitude of this hacking operation was larger than what was being speculated. What happened was that the FBI collected more than 8,000 IP addresses to hack computers that were located in 120 different countries. The startling fact is that the computers were all attacked using a single warrant.It is apparent that this is by far the largest known hacking campaign by a law enforcement agency and it also demonstrates how the policing crime may affect dark web in the future. The revelations have come at a time when the United States is gearing for changing the current laws regarding mass hacking and the government is expecting magistrate judges to allow mass hacking of computers in any country.According to Colin Fieman, a federal public defender,\u201cWe have never, in our nation\u2019s history as far as I can tell, seen a warrant so utterly sweeping.\u201dBasically, the case was about the investigations conducted by the FBI in relation to dark web\u2019s child pornography website Playpen. The agency seized this particular site in February 2015 but did not shut it down. Instead, the agency started running this website from a government server for around 13 days. Though the agency had administrative control of Playpen but even then the investigators couldn\u2019t see the original IP addresses of visitors of Playpen. That\u2019s because users connected to this site through Tor network.To break this shield of anonymity, the agency deployed NIT (network investigative technique). The technique involves using malware to hack computers. This particular malware included an exploit for Tor browser and with its help the agency was able to hack into the computers of all the visitors of Playpen\u2019s child pornography threads. The malware sent the real IP addresses of the suspects to FBI.Also Read: Sextortionist jailed for life, FBI searching for 350 online victimsCourt files revealed that more than 1,000 IP addresses of users in the US were obtained by the FBI.

However, he didn\u2019t expect it to occur in less than two minutes\u2019 time.

So, it is obvious that the camera wasn\u2019t a very reliable one and was not created by a top-class brand.Stephens stated that although this vulnerability in security cameras can be fixed with simple password change or a firmware update but not all users are aware of it and this also cannot be done in two minutes.Here is a series of tweets from Stephens explaining what happened and how:1/x: So I bought a surveillance camera pic.twitter.com/HbmPzrZgFK\u2014 Rob Graham\u0669(\u25cf\u032e\u032e\u0303\u25cf\u0303) (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20162/x: I setup a RPi as a router/firewall/NAT to isolate it from my home network, and rate limit outgoing stuffhttps://t.co/DTcqOUKyF3\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20163/x: Within 5 minutes, it was compromised by the Mirai botnet/worm: pic.twitter.com/ZL3kLk5HI3\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20164/x: then grabs the processor info directly pic.twitter.com/dURoy9tYgA\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20165/x: looks for \u2018wget\u2019 or \u2018tftp\u2019 in order to download binaries the easy way pic.twitter.com/iqKynmX41o\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20166/x: that doesn\u2019t work, so has to download the virus binary the hard way pic.twitter.com/BMEJjyCNH6\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20167/x: And when it\u2019s done, it runs the binary, and the box is now officially infected: pic.twitter.com/iggDPSZlri\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20168/x: Actually, it took 98 seconds for first infection pic.twitter.com/EDdOZaEs0V\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 20169/x: but by something that isn\u2019t Mirai, but something else similar to it pic.twitter.com/acgDOiPQs3\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 201610/x: This camera I got off https://t.co/O9nibldQwY for $55:https://t.co/C7NmuGB5uM\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 201611/x: Bah, I\u2019ve got my isolation rules setup wrong, blocking outbound TCP, so I\u2019ve been inadvertently preventing further infection pic.twitter.com/SVwMsNgVpG\u2014 Rob Graham \ud83e\udd83 (@ErrataRob) November 18, 201612/x: Ignore that last tweet.

It also collects the entire content of the \u201ctext messages, contact lists, call logs, location information and other data,\u201d on the mobile and this data is then sent to a Chinese server.It is also not clear, as of now, whether the software collects data for advertising purposes or for intelligence agencies.A spokesman from Adups stated that the firm is a private enterprise and the software is nothing else but \u201ca mistake,\u201d the company is not associated with the Chinese government. It is alleged that the software was developed for aiding customer support for an unidentified Chinese company, which is one of the clients of Adups.It seems that the customers in the US who use their phone internationally and users of prepaid phones are the most affected ones. A US-based phone company BLU has announced that its 120,000 phones have been affected and the company has already updated these devices to fix the issue.This secret backdoor software has seriously startled everyone in the cyber-security fraternity and authorities in the US are trying to find out the nature of the data mining.Kryptowire was able to discover this software while one of its researchers bought an inexpensive BLU R1 HD phone while leaving for a trip overseas. While he was setting up the device, he noted an \u201cunusual network activity\u201d and for about a week, he noticed that the phone was transmitting text messages to a server in Shanghai that was registered with Adups.

Then, it customizes a ransom note according to the identified information but does not encrypt files like other ransomware malware \u2013 It does threaten victims with bogus legal proceedings in case they fail to pay the ransom.According to Proofpoint, the penalty notice only emerges when and if it finds some concrete evidence of child pornography or Torrents media files.With its scraping and scanning capability, the ransomware can display correct personal data, which it takes from Skype and social media profiles.

The attackers have basically tried to exploit the victim\u2019s fear of exposure and possible legal complications that may result from leaking of such sensitive information. Proofpoint has also pointed out that it is the reputation of the victim that is actually at stake and this is what attackers are eyeing with this campaign instead of going for the usual technique of data encryption.

The research was covered by Bleeping Computer who noted that it happens because of the way \u201cusers move fingers across a phone\u2019s touchscreen.\u201d Researchers have explained that this movement \u201calters the WiFi signals transmitted by a mobile phone, causing interruptions that an attacker can intercept, analyze, and reverse engineer to accurately guess what the user has typed on his phone or in password input fields.\u201dIt is also revealed that WindTalker can work only if and when an attacker is able to gain control of a rogue Wi-Fi access point. That\u2019s because it enables the attacker to collect WiFi signals\u2019 instabilities.The attacker can identify the exact same PIN or password entered by the victim by understanding when to collect WiFi signals from the target mobile phone. Along with this, full control over the WiFi access point is also important. To accomplish this task, the attacker must know the exact moment when a PIN or password is entered by the victim.Controlling of WiFi access point can also help an attacker to monitor user\u2019s traffic and discover the time when a user accesses pages that require authentication information. The WindTalker attacks are usually about 68.3% accurate; however, their accuracy level may vary with the model of the smartphones. The accuracy can be enhanced by continued monitoring of what the user types; the more data collected by the attacker, the higher will be the attack\u2019s accuracy.All of this is made possible by leveraging CSI/Channel State Information, which is a part of the Wi-Fi protocol that provides general information about the Wi-Fi signal\u2019s status. When the user uses the phone\u2019s touch screen to type text, the hand movement modifies the CSI properties of the outgoing Wi-Fi signals of the phone. The attacks can easily accumulate the changes in CSI pattern and log on to the rogue access point.It is also possible to isolate chosen portions of CSI signal. The attacker only needs to carry out a standard signal analysis and signal processing along with guessing the characters typed by the user.Researchers also tested WindTalker\u2019s successfulness in a real-life situation by attempting to recover the required transaction PIN user enters to verify Alipay mobile transactions. In a majority of cases, these PINs are sent to a fixed range of IP addresses. If the attacker is able to identify it accurately, then it will be possible to start the PIN Wi-Fi signal collection procedure.WindTalker attack was demonstrated at the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in October.

It needs one laptop to fulfill the deed. This new technique has reduced the infrastructure requirements for pulling off wide-scale attacks.Typically, DDoS attacks require big numbers to accomplish the malicious task; such attacks usually involve hundreds of thousands of devices as well as countless IP addresses. Collectively, they bombard a network or server with humongous amounts of data to make the service halt its operations and stop functioning. The attacker uses the infected devices to send out fake requests to a server so that all of its resources get tied up and the system gives up. Technically it is also called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.However, there is a new kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that doesn\u2019t require so many devices to launch a full-fledged, wide-range attack. The technique is dubbed as \u201cBlackNurse\u201d and has been discovered by a Danish company TDC. This particular kind of attack doesn\u2019t need a huge army of devices to block the server.What BlackNurse does is that it sends out a certain Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message in low volume. This message can easily overwhelm the processor of a firewall. If the internet connection is fairly quick, the method just needs one laptop to conduct the massive attack.Previously the attackers utilized Ping Flood, which is a relatively different ICMP attack used to bombard servers with heavy traffic.In their analysis report, the TDC explains [Pdf] about how they identified BlackNurse and how it works. Some excerpts from the report are as follows:\u201cThe BlackNurse attack attracted our attention because in our anti-DDoS solution we experienced that even though traffic speed and packets per second were very low, this attack could keep our customers\u2019 operations down.\u201d\u201cThis even applied to customers with large internet uplinks and large enterprise firewalls in place. We had expected that professional firewall equipment would be able to handle the attack.\u201dIt is also noted that BlackNurse is a lot more efficient than customary techniques of DDoS despite using one laptop. It is even more effective than the series of large-scale DDoS attacks that took down DynDNS\u2019 servers and the security researcher Brian Kreb\u2019s blog site.Netresec, a renowned security firm, states that BlacKNurse can disrupt any network with just a fraction of what was required in the above-mentioned attacks as it only needs around 21 Mbps to take down a firewall. It is also different because, with little effort, it inflicts similar damage done by other attacks of up to 1 Tbps. It is also identified that BlackNurse uses ICMP type 3 Code 3.  (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});Netresec has noted that the most vulnerable firewalls are those created by Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Sonicwall and Zyxel.

Reportedly, Spotify\u2019s Mac, Windows and Linux based apps are involved in writing hundreds of gigabytes of data. This data writing is being performed on a daily basis and it is being stored on the computer\u2019s hard drive. Needless to say that such massive amount of data written on a daily basis would substantially reduce the lifespan of your hard drive.It is better to switch to the mobile or web version of the app for the time being. The data writing and storing continues even when the app is in idle mode and not busy storing locally. Ars Technica could clearly explain the reason behind this sudden change in the app\u2019s storing habits but the company has urged music lovers to avoid using Spotify apps for Windows, Mac or Linux operating systems.It is also important to note that even SSD (solid-state drive or solid-state disk) come with a limited range of read-write cycles despite that these don\u2019t have moving parts.

Then you will be interested in knowing more about the latest change in the security measures by the Social Network. So let\u2019s find out what the fuss is all about.Alex Stamos, the Chief Security Officer at Facebook, stated that the social network has bought passwords sold by hackers on the Black Market and cross-referenced these passwords with the ones encrypted on their platform thereby protecting their users.The reason, as per Stamos, is to keep the accounts protected from security breaches.Stamos was speaking at Lisbon\u2019s Web Summit where he explained the new technique Facebook would be relying upon for safeguarding users accounts. The Web Summit is being held in Lisbon, Portugal.CNET quoted Stamos: \u201cKeeping Facebook safe and keeping it secure are two different things; security is about building walls to keep out threats and shore up defenses. It turns out that we can build perfectly secure software and yet people can still get hurt.\u201dThe passwords bought from the Black Market are those that were stolen from mass data hacks like Yahoo, Dropbox, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace and are now offered for sale by the hackers.Stamos also revealed that passwords reuse is the number one cause of security breaches on the internet and Facebook is most vulnerable in this respect as it attracts over 1.3 billion visitors on a daily basis. If the users have not kept strong passwords, then their accounts would be vulnerable.Such as \u201c123456\u201d is the most commonly used password, and in stolen databases, this password was identified in a majority of the accounts. So if anyone on Facebook uses the same password and security team at the social network discovers it by cross-checking the stolen passwords with their users\u2019, the account will automatically be termed as exploitable.Naturally, the user will be prompted to change the password that he or she has been using since day one on Facebook. This step is aimed at creating a safety-based culture at the social network to prevent abuse of user accounts. The website will be offering a variety of tools for safeguarding user account ranging from the customary two-factor authentication to facial recognition feature.

Here are some of the latest online dangers that children are occasionally involved in along with an all time, one stop solution in shape of a monitoring application.PornographyWhile many parents are occasionally worried about inappropriate online pop-ups, little do they consider the fact that there are millions of kids in the world that are voluntarily seeking out pornography online. Adult content online seems to strip our kids off of their innocence, hence taking away precious young years of their lives. In the future, these children tend to develop other intimacy problems that are very hard to deal with the especially cause of years of conditioning.SextingSexting has spread like a virus in the youth of today. Statistically speaking, over 35% kids have reported sending out sexts (sexting) to others in their social circle. The idea of taking and sending nudes has been developed through the over objectification of body imagery through the media. This tends to become a form of acceptance ritual which the kid may get involved in to fit into a group. However, little do these kids understand is that body image is not formed through predefined notions about physical ratios and aspects. Currently, there are different campaigns going on online to tarnish the idea of a \u201cperfect body\u201d.GamblingWhile minors may not be allowed in casinos, doesn\u2019t mean they cannot gamble easily online. And gambling doesn\u2019t specifically only include money but can be over a variety of different things. However, the most common source is online markets through which various applications are usually purchased. This is the hub where e-credit, credit cards or even mobile credit has been used and hence can be used for future gambling endeavors by kids as well.CyberbullyingBackyard bullying has become a thing of the past as with the advent of the internet, kids prefer social media interactions over physical meetings and interactions. Social media is a place where rumors can fly high. Moreover, different profiles may get hacked as well. On the other hand, bullies may target someone and tarnish their image online which would cast a shadow on the kid\u2019s life forever.Drug distributionThe drug industry has strangely evolved over the years. Once upon a time, the selling and purchasing of drugs were an activity only limited to the shadows. However, today you will come across many different \u201cspecial items\u201d being sold through online advertisements. Many code words are used to stay off the radar, however, everyone especially these smart kids knows what they mean and where they can get some easily. Drug distribution has become more enhanced and the industry has become more connected through the internet.Solution:TheOneSpy is one stop shop solution for computer and cell phone monitoring especially when it comes to children. This monitoring application comes with an array of features which will help you protect your kid from different online dangers found on the internet. Not only will you be able to adequately track your kid\u2019s physical location but also keep a close eye on his or her online activities, friends and peers circle, conversations and different interests. Some parents have also acknowledged that monitoring applications have helped them build better relationships with their kids as they are able to better talk and relate to their kids and their day to day problems.ConclusionThe concept of monitoring applications may seem shady at first but when it comes to the safety and security of your kid, anything, and everything is acceptable. Working parents especially find it so much easier to stay tuned with their kids\u2019 lives when they are using monitoring applications because it helps them remotely stay in touch with their day to day activities even though they may not be physically present. Usually, the best way to go about is by directly confronting your kid and letting him or her know that you will be monitoring their cell phone and computer usage especially when it comes to internet usage. This way you will not have to worry about any conflicts that may erupt if the kid finds out through other means.", "authur": "Aine Carrara", "title": "Top 5 Online Dangers For Kids", "date": "November 9, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Donald Trump", "Election", "Elections", "internet", "security", "USA"], "body": "Maybe some Americans were serious when they threatened they would move to Canada if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump became successful in his often polarizing campaign for the White House.Canada\u2019s main immigration website appeared to suffer repeated outages on Tuesday night as Trump took the lead in several major states and his prospects for winning the U.S. presidency turned markedly higher.

So, when people fail to get the desired warmth despite having proper heating mechanism indoors, they are bound to get really angry. This is what happened to residents of two well-facilitated apartment buildings in Lappeenranta.This weekend, the environmental control mechanism at two apartment buildings in Lappeenranta suddenly and surprisingly stopped functioning due to which people had to suffer a lot in the cold weather. However, the disturbing fact is that the systems weren\u2019t just out of order or got blocked out but these were taken down through a DDoS attack.The buildings that suffered heat cut were both managed by Valtia. Valtia is a Lappeenranta based facilities service provider firm. According to the CEO at Valtia Simo Ruonela, it was indeed true that the central heating and hot water systems of the two apartment buildings were attacked with DDoS and to thwart the attack, the systems automatically rebooted. But afterward, the system got stuck in an infinite loop causing the unannounced heat cut.The good news is that on the day the heating systems went down, Lappeenranta wasn\u2019t that cold as it usually is with weather just being around 20\u00b0F. In winters, the city\u2019s temperatures go as low as -25.Regarding the shutting down of the heating systems, Valtia immediately relocated the affected systems, addressed the attack and then brought the systems back online.

The core objective of these programs is to make Google\u2019s apps and systems more protected and secure.However, it isn\u2019t an easy feat to accomplish since to qualify for Google\u2019s VRP, it was vital that the bug/vulnerability is identified in any of these categories mentioned below:\u201cCross-site scripting,Cross-site request forgery,Mixed-content scripts,Authentication or authorization flaws,Server-side code execution bugs\u201dWhen the vulnerability is identified as a valid one, the hacker can expect to receive up to $20,000 by Google.Ahmed Mehtab, a student from Pakistan and the CEO of Security Fuse, is the latest to win this prize money by Google. Mehtab discovered a flaw in Gmail\u2019s authentication or verification methods.If a user has more than one email address, Google lets the user link all of the addresses and also lets emails of the primary account be forwarded to secondary accounts.Mehtab identified an inherent flaw in the verification bypass method adopted by Google for switching and linking email addresses, which leads to the hijacking of the email IDs. He discovered that the email addresses became vulnerable to hijacking when one of the following conditions occurs:* When the SMTP of the recipient is offline* The email has been deactivated by the recipient* Recipient doesn\u2019t exist or invalid email ID* The recipient does exist but has blocked the senderHere is how hijacking can be conducted: the attacker tries to verify the ownership status of an email address by emailing Google. Google sends an email to that address for verification. The email address cannot receive the email and hence, Google\u2019s mail is sent back to the actual sender and this time it contains the verification code. This verification code will be used by the hacker and the ownership to that particular address will be confirmed.Watch how it\u2019s doneThis is not the first time when a Pakistani hacker has reported such critical security flaws.

This is why every single attack that is carried out using Mirai malware is huge and conducted at a massive scale.Therefore, there is certainly no doubt about the fact that cyber-criminals would try to utilize this ability of Mirai malware for disrupting internet services of not only a city but an entire country.An example we have already seen in the recent case of internet shut down across the US. A few weeks back, there was widespread Internet shut down in the US due to a series of DDoS attacks launched against the main DNS hosting service provider in the country DynDNS. In that particular attack, over 100,000 infected IoT devices were used. It was believed that this was an underwhelming attack since the capability of Mirai malware was much more than this.Last week, we came to know that hackers were out to disrupt the internet service in an African country Liberia through Mirai IoT botnet called Botnet 14. Apparently, plans are underway to attack a whole country\u2019s internet service by launching a wide-scale DDoS attack. Naturally, cybercriminals would be seeking to launch the attack through infecting vulnerable, unprotected IoT devices infected with Mirai.In October, the malware\u2019s developer released its source code on the internet, which made it all the more convenient for cybercriminals to launch attacks as per their capabilities. Experts are suggesting that the upcoming DDoS attacks would be bigger and may reach up to 10 Tbps, which is what the cyber criminals needs to take down the internet of a country.Kevin Beaumont, a renowned security expert, believes that Botnet 14 is now being used to launch DDoS attacks against the \u201cLonestar Cell MTN\u201d networks. It must be noted that Lonestar Cell MTN is a telecom firm responsible for providing internet service across Liberia through an undersea ACE fiber cable.In a blog post published by Beaumont today, the security researcher noted that:Transit providers explain Beaumont, have also confirmed that the launched attacks surpassed 500 Gbps as far as size was concerned but it is also true that these attacks could not be continued for a long time.Beaumont also added that the traffic volume suggests that the botnet 14, which he has dubbed as \u201cShadows Kill Botnet,\u201d is owned by the same cybercriminal who attacked Dyn network.The issue to be concerned about is that if the DynDNS service can be disrupted for almost a day with only 100,000 Mirai botnets then what would be the outcome when attackers would utilize over 1 million botnets?The situation is worrisome because with such huge capacity, not only Liberia but the attacker can easily deprive all the 23 countries in the African and European continents of internet services if it is provided through the ACE fiber cable.The threat is increasing with the increasing number of vulnerable IoT devices because Mirai malware would keep infecting them one after another.

This attack resulted in the cancellation of all the activities that the hospital planned for the day.The attack was conducted by the National Health Service. All the operations and organ transplants due to be conducted at NHS\u2019s Lincolnshire and Goods Trust were canceled immediately and transplants were diverted to other hospitals.

Obviously, unsuspecting users would get easily deceived and this would mark the beginning of a nightmare for them.One such ransomware that is currently creating havoc among Windows users is the Fantom ransomware, which is being distributed in the form of a Windows OS update. Currently, we cannot surely state the way this ransomware is distributed but we can certainly inform you about how it operates.Once it has penetrated itself into a computer system, it embarks on the usual ransomware routine, which is as follows:* Generation of encryption key* Data encryption* Transferring the data to a command and control server* Asking for ransom money in exchange for the encryption keyALSO READ: \u2018NO MORE RANSOM\u2019 ANTI-RANSOMWARE PORTAL; RECOVERS ENCRYPTED DATA FOR FREEFirstly, the malware searches for the file types that it could encrypt by scanning the machine and then uses the encryption key to encrypt these files. It must be noted that the Trojan can encrypt over 350 different types of file extensions including a variety of audio files, images, and document formats. While encrypting the files, the malware changes the extension of the files to .fantom.These processes occur in the background at the time when the user believes that a critical Windows update is being installed on the computer. Once the malware becomes fully functional then it executes two programs, one, the cryptor and another one with the name WindowsUpdate.exe.The program containing the name WindowsUpdate is only there to create an authentic appearance of the malware and to deceive the victim. This program presents the trademark blue screen that is usually displayed when Windows is being updated, which keeps the user engaged. In the background, the malware encrypts the required files. The update in progress message is actually showing the progress of the encryption underway simultaneously.The fake update of Windows OS runs in full-screen mode and blocks all access to other applications and programs. Even then if the user suspects something fishy going on, nothing can be done because the malware won\u2019t stop encrypting files.After data encryption is complete, the malware deletes the executable files and instead generates a ransom note in a file titled a.html. This note is copied into every folder and the wallpaper on the computer\u2019s desktop is also replaced with this message. The note contains an email address so that the victim could get in touch with the attacker to get information about the terms and conditions of the ransom and payment process.Experts believe that only Russian-speaking hackers display this type of ransom note that contains contact information. There are other clues as well, which hint at the involvement of Russian hackers such as they usually use Yandex.ru e-mail address and their English is always bad.

The lists were actually hacked by the Equation Group for launching attacks.We first heard about ShadowBrokers earlier in August when the group launched an auction of the Equation Group\u2019s exploits. These exploits were discovered by the Kaspersky Lab in February last year. It is also speculated that the exploits were identified by the NSA. The group claimed that if it managed to make around 1 million Bitcoin through this auction then it would dump more unencrypted files. Kaspersky Lab did confirm that there was a \u201cstrong connection\u201d between the dumps from the Equation Group and the ShadowBrokers.However, things haven\u2019t turned out as expected for the ShadowBrokers because the group is finding it hard to attract bidders and reach its target amount even after so many months. Now, the group is adopting desperate measures to gain attention from the public. The latest note and those preceding this one are a clear indication of the growing unease and irritation among ShadowBrokers.It must be noted that the servers are quite old since the lists range from 2001 to 2010 while a majority of the compromised servers are located in Pakistan, India, Iran, Japan, China, Russia, Bosnia and South Korea, etc. This could be the reason why few are interested in the auction.A UAE-based security startup Comae\u2019s researcher Matt Suiche discovered while inspecting the links that around 331 IP addresses were compromised through the spy tools pair known as Intonation and PitchImpair. According to Suiche, currently there is not a great deal of information available but most of the folders contain some configuration variables and metadata but there isn\u2019t any \u201csource code this time.\u201dWhereas ShadowBrokers claimed in another note that multiple missions were conducted through these compromised servers and the pitch has been renewed so that the exploits could be put up for sale. Auctioning of the exploits started in August. A note further described that:\u201cMaybe tools no more installed? Maybe is being cleaned up?

That\u2019s quite true because the current bid is just 2.006074 Bitcoin which is equal to $1,414. That\u2019s quite a meager amount and we are also startled that there hasn\u2019t been much movement in terms of bidding since August.The Shadow Brokers continue to grapple for publicity and money.

Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures.\u201dThe group also posted its opinion regarding the influence of political corruption on the US elections and even went a step ahead and threatened to disrupt the general elections further, which are due to be held in the second week of November. The group states:\u201cMaybe people not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots?

Discovered in mid-February 2016, this file-encrypting epidemic proved to be sophisticated enough to fly under the radar of conventional antimalware defenses. Furthermore, the creators of this nasty infection are proficient in implementing cryptography, leveraging a data locking mechanism that security experts have yet to find a viable response for. To top it off, this plague targets healthcare institutions, telecom companies, universities and even governments, not just individual users.Also Read: New Ransomware Asks User to Play Click Me Game while Encrypting DataThe Locky campaign is a process rather than something static. It has given rise to five distinct spinoffs during eight months of its operation, and there are probably more to come. Every new update fine-tunes the ransomware so that it can counter decryption efforts more efficiently and obfuscate its activity to evade detection. Let\u2019s have an insight into how this strain has evolved over time.The first iteration of Locky introduced a number of properties that were novel on the ransomware arena. First of all, its authors borrowed a distribution tactic from the infamous banking Trojan called Dridex. The malware-tainted downloader would arrive with phishing emails that contained a rogue invoice.The Microsoft Word document attached to these emails recommended the recipient to enable macros. By doing so, users ran the risk of unknowingly triggering a malicious VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script that downloaded the ransomware executable to the Temp path and launched it.Another new thing about Locky was that it found and encrypted personal files on unmapped network shares along with mapped ones, the local drive, and removable drives if any. Therefore, even if a network path wasn\u2019t represented as a drive letter, it was subject to scanning by the infection anyway. The ransomware applied a fusion of the symmetric AES-128 and asymmetric RSA-2048 ciphers to make the infected users\u2019 important files inaccessible.Locky version 1.0 completely scrambled its victims\u2019 filenames, turning each one into a string of 32 hexadecimal characters plus the .locky extension at the end. An entry like 8469F0FE8432F4F84DCC48462F435454.locky is an example of this drastic transformation. The infection dropped ransom notes called \u201c_Locky_recover_instructions.txt\u201d on the desktop, which provided links to the victim\u2019s personal decryptor page. The ransom amounted to 0.5 Bitcoin.Also Read: The Nastiest of all Ransomware Mamba Encrypts Entire Hard DriveThe second edition of Locky appeared in early August 2016. The extortionists made a number of external adjustments to their product and started leveraging a somewhat different distribution tactic. The first conspicuous tweak was the new .zepto extension that replaced .locky in the file renaming paradigm.Similarly to its forerunner, the Zepto edition would jumble filenames to turn them into lines of 32 hex characters. However, these strings contained five blocks separated by hyphens, for instance, 034BDC22-54D4-ABD4-F065-F642E772A851.zepto. The new ransom notes were called \u201c_HELP_instructions.html.\u201d The Trojan would also replace the desktop background with a BMP version of the decryption manual.The distribution mechanism underwent a change as well. The cyber crooks gave up the macros trick and switched to JS (JavaScript) or WSF (Windows Script File) installers enclosed in ZIP email attachments. The phishing emails were masqueraded as invoices, bank account reports, job offers or delivery reports.A major enhancement in the Zepto iteration was the so-called \u201cautopilot\u201d feature that took effect in mid-September. It meant that the ransomware went with hard-coded RSA keys and didn\u2019t need to obtain ones from its Command and Control server. This offline encryption principle allowed the infection to get around firewalls that could otherwise detect and block the C&C communication. Also, the crooks no longer had to set up dozens of new C2 domains daily. A downside of this approach was that it became problematic for the criminals to get real-time infection statistics.Having given the innovative offline encryption method a shot, Locky devs shortly abandoned it for an unknown reason. One guess is the perpetrators couldn\u2019t do without accurate stats on the number of successful installs. Anyway, the new \u201cOdin\u201d spinoff discovered on September 26 was phoning home to exchange information with its Command and Control servers again.The third edition of Locky appended the .odin extension to one\u2019s distorted files, hence its generic name. The names of ransom notes changed to \u201c_HOWDO_text.html (.bmp).\u201d Whereas payload delivery still relied on phishing, the threat actors started engaging an encrypted DLL installer. This way, the ransomware became harder to detect. The ransom size didn\u2019t change and still amounted to 0.5 Bitcoin.Also Read: Father Kills son, commits suicide after police ransomware asked him for fineThe new .shit extension that the fourth edition of Locky appended to victims\u2019 files reflected the true essence of the ransomware. This variant went live on October 24. A noteworthy tweak was that the ransom notes were called \u201c_WHAT_is.html\u201d and \u201c_WHAT_is.bmp.\u201d The post was delivered with spam emails containing a zipped HTA, JS or WSF file disguised as a receipt or complaint letter. Interestingly, the \u201cShit\u201d edition opted for offline encryption again, with RSA keys embedded right in code.It took Locky makers less than 24 hours to release another version of the ransomware. Such a rapid change is an uncommon move for this family. Who knows, perhaps the bad guys felt ashamed to use a swear word for their file renaming pattern? The only substantial difference between the latest edition and its one-day-old .shit file predecessor is the new .thor extension.This iteration has emerged in the wake of a massive increase of spam detected by security analysts. As earlier, the phishing campaign involves the paycheck, receipt, invoice, order, or wrong credit card charge themes that are likely to dupe recipients into loading the attached files. The most widespread formats of these dangerous attachments include JS, VBS, and EXE. These files are embedded in ZIP archives and may be masqueraded as regular Microsoft Office documents. The Thor variant uses the same names of ransom notes as its predecessor: \u201c_WHAT_is.html\u201d and \u201c_WHAT_is.bmp.\u201dAlso Read: \u201cNo More Ransom\u201d Campaign Saves 2,500 Ransomware Victims, 1.3 Mil EurosIt\u2019s worth mentioning that every new version of Locky is a faster-moving target for researchers. Its authors have been experimenting with offline encryption lately, where the infection can do its filthy job without connecting to external servers. This is a serious wake-up call for the security industry that needs to come up with new defenses against the evolving strain.

This method has been labeled as AtomBombingIt has been named so because it depends on the Windows atom tables\u2019 mechanism; these are specially designed tables that are provided by the operating system. The tables can be used for initiating data sharing between various applications.According to Tai Liberman, a researcher at Ensilo, the team at the firm has discovered \u201ca threat actor can write malicious code into an atom table and force a legitimate program to retrieve the malicious code from the table.\u201dIn a blog post, Ensilo researcher wrote that \u201cwe also found that the legitimate program, now containing the malicious code, can be manipulated to execute that code.\u201dThe reason why this latest code-injection remains undetected by antiviruses and endpoint security systems is that it is based on genuine and legitimate mechanism and that the mechanism of atom tables is currently part of all versions of Windows OS. Therefore, it is too difficult to release a patch considering that it does not indicate any vulnerability.There are numerous reasons behind using code injection method in malware such as in banking Trojans the code injection can infect browser processes to observe and change locally visited websites while using banking websites. Due to this feature, hackers are able to steal login credentials as well as payment card information. They also can redirect any transaction to their own account.Moreover, the malicious code injection can help attackers in bypassing limitations that let only a certain data to be accessed by particular processes only. Such as, for stealing encrypted passwords used for another application the code injection can help or it may also aid in capturing screenshots of the user\u2019s desktop despite the malware process doesn\u2019t have the necessary privilege.Liberman also wrote that \u201cbeing a new code injection technique, AtomBombing bypasses [antivirus] and other endpoint infiltration prevention solutions.\u201dBitdefender\u2019s senior threat analyst Liviu Arsene stated that even if the attack is not targeted towards exploiting any software weakness, security vendors can detect or delete/block the malicious payload. Hence, if the payload still gets executed and attempts to inject the malicious code into an authentic application then it would be possible to detect and block it. That\u2019s because security vendors usually monitor processes and services across their execution lifespan.Microsoft has urged that its customers must observe safe and responsible computing practices in order to avoid malware infection through AtomBombing.

An employee in the North America office read the notification and clicked the attachment looking like an MS Word document.This incident happened in a company that instructs its staff members to abstain from clicking suspicious links and attachments, as well as runs an advanced security monitoring tool, firewalls, and up-to-date antivirus suite. However, the hack succeeds as it exploits the primeval urge to explore the unknown inherent in human nature. Careless clicking on links and attachments remains the most common infection vector.The virus starts installing itself on the victim\u2019s computer. The file is basically a new strain of extortion Trojan dubbed Locky that often updates its versions. The infection initiates connections to several remote servers. Some connections have been terminated as the security tool installed recognizes their IP addresses as blacklisted. Eventually, the full ransomware package delivery completes from the server that is not marked as malicious.Since this version of the Locky Trojan is brand new, the security suite fails to detect the newcomer in the course of its introduction. However, the follow-up observations would reveal suspicious communications.Very soon after its setup, the ransomware dispatches a notification to its server. The message informs the C&C that ransomware has been installed successfully and needs the encryption key to scramble the data. The security software detects suspicious traffic and communication and submits it for the consideration of IT staff.Meanwhile, the ransomware is scanning hard drives for data files to encrypt, excluding the latest items to avoid early awareness of the victim. Locky encrypts detected files with strong algorithms like RSA and AES. The fastest machine in the world is theoretically able to unlock files, but the computations are going to last for years. Basically, the encryption is too strong. The victim often must pay the crooks for the decryption tool.The Locky ransomware typically demands to send around $400 payable in Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Frankly, you either send the requested amount or have your data locked. Switching off your PC, disconnecting it from the network, or doing any other manipulations cannot help. Only recent backups may help to minimize loss.A security analyst has recognized the invasion. He informs top managers and other employees of the Trojan. The IT security team manages to disconnect the office from the local and global networks. The file encryption on the affected machine is ongoing while experts detect the physical PC. Fortunately, Locky failed to propagate beyond a single machine.Another IT analyst recalls an attack that took place some weeks before and targeted an investment business of similar scale; the invasion was not spotted in good time. Within less than six hours the cryptovirus hit almost a terabyte of files disrupting an ongoing work of about fifty employees. The company managed to recover the files from the reserve copies. Its IT team was quite positive the infection had been cleaned at all of their multiple local offices. The reality failed the assumption. In five days, a concealed copy of the same extortion virus launched its delayed ransom attack at another location.The compromised PC has been found. IT stuff wipes it clean and rebuilds from scratch. Any data kept on that machine is destroyed.There are still some after-effects to face. Certain types ransomware steal files and send them to their own servers. Ransomware authors continue their extortion attempts by threatening to put all data online and make it publicly available. These guys know their victims. They try to attack businesses that deal with highly sensitive information: legal advisories, insurance agencies, and healthcare institutions.Plenty of ransomware victims pay for the decryption of their data. A single strain of ransomware collected $121 million in just half a year.Keep in mind that purchasing the encryption key does not restore your data automatically. Ransomware authors are usually not the best software developers. Their code may contain a number of flaws so that the compromised data may crash for good.

As per Symantec Security report, crypto viruses are wrecking approximately 50,000 computers monthly.SourceFlickr/Christiaan Colen ", "authur": "David Balaban", "title": "Locky Ransomware in Action: Real-World Attack Description", "date": "October 27, 2016"}, {"topics": ["Bitcoin", "Cyber Crime", "Dropbox", "hacking", "internet", "LinkedIn", "security"], "body": "Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, the 29-year-oldRussian hacker was arrested in Prague when he was ordering food.

This could be ten times bigger the size we witnessed on Friday.Also Read: Hackers take over security camera; live stream girls\u2019 bedroom on InternetThe apocalyptic onslaught: According to Forbes, a darknet forum has been selling hacked IoT devices with 180,000 bots that can allegedly carry DDoS attacks up to 1 Tbps. The price for 50,000 bots has been set to $4600 whilst 100,000 bots are available for $7500. Remember, Internet\u2019s largest ever DDoS attack was 1 Tbps conducted on OVH hosting through Mirai botnet and 145,000 hacked IoT devices but at this time it is unclear if the botnet for sale has any connection with Mirai botnet or it took any part in the DDoS attack on Dyn servers.What is a DDoS attackA DDoS attack is basically the influx of traffic pushed into the servers of a target website. Therefore, the user cannot access a website through that service provider and the entire system goes down. However, when it comes to the listing on the darknet researchers say that this is the first they have seen such IoT botnet being sold out in this way.How to protect your IoT devices from hackersIn a conversation with Chief Science Officer for Morphisec Mr. Mordechai Guri, HackRead was told that hackers prefer IoT devices due to the fact that they are connected with the Internet and secondly most customers never change default passwords for their devices.\u201cIoT devices in general are the perfect platform for attackers to issue DDoS attacks. First, they are have full Internet connectivity \u2013 most of the time they remain idle, hence can be easily abused for DDoS purposes. Secondly, IoT devices, due to their diversity and complexity, have almost no in-device security products installed (e.g., Anti-Virus). Consequentially, attackers can easily spread their bot on IoT devices, without being detected for a long time. Thirdly, they are prevalent, so botnets on IoT devices in the future may consist of many millions of bots. Finally, such an attack is difficult to mitigate, as most IoT devices are embedded systems. Unlike ordinary PCs, removal of malware from IoT devices is a challenging issue in itself,\u201d said Guri.We at HackRead are working on an in-depth article that will highlight key features about protecting your IoT devices however for now if you own an IoT device change its default login credentials.

The flaw allows the attackers to target a specific memory chip and thus gaining control of the entire system. Drammer has the potential to put millions of users at risk, especially when combined with existing attack vectors like Stagefright.Also Read: New Android Malware Asks for Selfies; Steals Credit Card DetailsNot a new methodThe attack goes by the name of Rowhammer which is not new. Previously, security researchers found a similar flaw in systems running on Linux. The flaw could also be exploited to launch a Rowhammer attack. This time, however, it is the Android devices that are in danger.How it Works?Essentially, the Rowhammer, as the name suggests, targets a row of transistors in a memory chip. These are the DDR DRAM chips found in mobile android devices. The attack is usually executed through a harmful app unbeknownst to the user.Primarily, the attacker implants the code in such an app. When the code is executed, the app keeps on accessing a specific row of transistors. It is a repetitive process which causes that row of transistors to cause an electric disturbance with the rows nearby. This leads to a leak in electricity which eventually results in a bit flip.A bit flip in turn, is simply the interchange of bits of data in random positions. Due to such randomization of bits, the attacker is able to change values for data stored on the chip and gain access to the victim\u2019s device.Also Read: 2016 Best Hacking Apps for Android PhonesProof-of-conceptIn order to test the attack, the researchers themselves devised an attack aimed at mobile devices such as Samsung, LG etc. The project was named \u201cDRAMMER\u201d. The mechanism allowed the researchers to gain root access to the victim\u2019s device.

It states that it is crucial to fix the issue and we can expect an update coming soon in November.However, the real issue is the inherent design of the chips and software. The Rowhammer attack exploits an innate weakness in the design. This means it may be a while before Google can come with another design concept that eradicates the inherent weakness.Read Next: After Linux, TCP Exploit Expandable to 80% of Android DevicesH/T Security Affairs Research Paper: VUSec Image Source: Flickr/Uncalno Tekno", "authur": "Owais Sultan", "title": "Millions of Android Devices Vulnerable to DRAMMER Attack", "date": "October 25, 2016"}]
