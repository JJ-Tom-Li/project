This is according to a report that has been published on Monday by Websense. To monitor the requests originating from millions and millions of computer systems that have been protected by different products of this company, it has run its threat detection and intelligence network which will detect the different java versions that are being used in these computer systems and are also available on the web browsers. Email and web gateway products for the security of business operations are being provided by Websense and they have also entered into partnership with the Facebook authorities so that they can ploy a check on the clicks that users make on social networks for threatening content.The telemetry data which is gathered by the company reveals that only around 5.5 percent of the browsers that are java enabled have updated versions of software\u2019s browser plug in i.e. Java 6 Update 43 (6u43) and Java 7 Update 17 (7u17). These versions were released back in the month of March to deal with the exploits and the vulnerability issue.As per Websense, a cool exploit kit already contains the exploits which is used by cybercriminals for the purpose of launching mass drive through downloading attacks that poisons computer systems with malware when one visits compromised websites. The kit requires a subscription fee of around 10,000 US dollars which means that it is not within the range of many of the cybercriminals. Websense\u2019s data has also revealed that many browsers installations that are Java enabled are vulnerable through different exploit kits that are cheap to subscribe to.The company showed that around 75 percent browser installations that are java enabled are vulnerable or can be exploited with the use of four different exploit kits that are not only cheap but are also available on a wide scale. Balckhole 2, redKit, Gong DA and CritXpacks are the name of those kits and they target a vulnerability which is known as Java 7 Update 17 (7u17).  The company also went on to show that 75 percent of such browser installations are using Java versions which are about 6 months old and about two third of the systems (java enabled) are using versions that are more than one year old.Users are not banking on the java 7 update 11 which has been released by Oracle and which prevents java applets to enter inside the browser without a confirmation check by default.The data which has been investigated by Websense also reveals that the vulnerabilities which are already very much known to the masses at large (zero day attacks) are not be given much of an attention.Security experts have advised in the recent past that oracle should devise a way to improve on the rate of adoption for Java updates. They say that it can possibly be done via offering options such as automatic and silent updates as has been done by Google and similarly by Adobe in flash player, Adobe Reader and Chrome. Silent updates of software are not a popular ploy in the corporate worlds where patches are to be inspected for stability and compatibility issues before they are incorporated into the systems.  However if such updates are implemented in consumer space, they can shorten the fragmentation that occurs in Java versions.[Via: Websense]Follow @HackRead", "authur": "Waqas", "date": ""}, {"topics": ["hackers", "hacking", "SECURITY NEWS", "Vulnerability News", "Vulnerable IP Addresses", "Vulnerable Machines"], "title": "Hacker Maps Internet by Enslaving Thousands of Vulnerable Machines", "body": "A security researcher has raveled some fantastic results over the percentage of vulnerable networks and devices around the world.

They choose the PDFs the root cause for the spread of the malwares, the most interesting fact was that the PDFs contained highly matured content there was no spammy content in the PDFs to give an idea of what was going on to the victim.Once the system has been exploited by the PDF file a small downloader is secretly installed into the system. This downloader is really tiny i.e. 20 kb which is designed to exploit the unique fingerprint of the system which the downloader finds out via some mathematical calculations.

Where users are waiting to test the new search features, the hackers are anxiously waiting to test their skills to hunt some Facebook accounts.  Facebook\u2019s Graph Search is basically a search engine which will work within the network, finding results based on posts, tags, friends, families and uncountable Facebook members. Its an undeniable fact that this new Graph search engine is a genius concept and very useful medium of search based on your friends and their interest. For example, your friends who like Miami Vice and living in Miami or your friend\u2019s Favorite coffee shop nearby.

Facebook Graph Search is adding more juice to it by providing same service as Google but with more personal context.  CORE Security\u2018s security strategist Alex Horan explains the upcoming headache for the Facebook users: This means Facebook will want it to have as much information available as possible to respond to each query, ensuring people have a positive experience. This directly goes against the desire expressed by people to keep their information private.By using Graph search, the attacker will be able to gain more personal and up to date information on the victim by matching their current info with the one available in past. Richard Wang, manager at Sophos Labs, says that: Graph Search might be a startling eye-opener for many. This will probably lead more users to discovering that they have shared more than they expected and gives scammers the opportunity to target particular groups of people.Robert Scoble praised the privacy model behind the tool. Scoble explains: \u201cYou can only see items shared to public or shared with you specifically due to your friend arrangements.\u201dPC World reports that That is true, and Facebook deserves credit for building in privacy controls.

According to the statistics, a rise of over 13 billion is predicted by the year 2021 in comparison to the year 2012.But the sector is facing serious security issues physically and online. There were a number of instances where hackers attacked online gas and oil industries. Due to this, there have been heavy investments upon the security of online systems. A security analyst on this said:\u201c\u201dGlobal oil and gas companies are investing capital in new infrastructure projects, driving the need for security solutions at these facilities,\u201d.\u201cWith increasing awareness of threats, companies are adopting a security-risk management approach and implementing risk assessment of their facilities to ensure security Return on Investment\u201dThere have been a number of systems introduced to combat cyber attacks, the systems include access control, video surveillance and intrusion-detection. You might be wondering why there has been such a wide range of system introduced. Why not go a simplistic one? So, the answer for it is that hacking these days have become such sophisticated that hackers somehow find a way to break into the system. The security expert on this said:\u201cThe threats may vary from information theft to a terrorist attack, but the economic impact and financial damage in case of an attack will be much more significant,\u201d\u201cIt would also depend on the motive of the attacker. For example, a cyber attack to remotely control a SCADA system can have more serious consequences than a cyber attack to steal information\u201dBut, taking into consideration the current status of cyber security it doesn\u2019t looks easy for the oil and gas industries as there has been a lack of investment in this way, especially by the governments. The security managements haven\u2019t been up to the mark, they have been really slow in comparison to the hacker\u2019s moves. To, this the expert advised the oil and gas suppliers:\u201cSuppliers of security systems should aim at designing an integrated security solution that proactively identifies, assesses and mitigates risks and threats originating from within the facility as well as from well beyond it,\u201d\u201cOn their part, oil and gas companies and operators of critical oil and gas facilities need to do a threat and risk assessment of their facility to ensure there is no over spending or under spending on security-related matters.\u201d", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"topics": ["US Power stations Malware", "USB Malware", "USB Virus", "Virus found"], "title": "Malware Found in Two US Power Stations Infecting the Control System", "body": "The US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) has reported that two US power stations were attacked and infected by a malicious malware in the last quarter of 2012.The experts have blamed not anyone else but USB flash drives filled with viruses for infecting and compromising the industrial control systems in both cases.

Yesterday, the information security training and penetration testing firm Offensive Security said that while scanning they discovered that DOM-based vulnerability is still present and every Yahoo mail user is in danger and on the edge of loosing their accounts if they click the malicious link. Two days ago, a hacker  Shahin Ramezany (aka Abysssec) posted a video on YouTube showing how to hack Yahoo accounts by a using DOM-based XSS vulnerability. The information security training and penetration testing firm then contacted Abysssec and discussed the claim by Yahoo that vulnerability has been fixed but Abysssec told the firm that vulnerability can still work with a simple modification. With little modification to the original proof of concept code written by Abysssec, it is still possible to exploit the original Yahoo vulnerability, allowing an attacker to completely take over a victim\u2019s account. The victim has to be lured to click a link which contains malicious XSS code for the attack to succeed.

Below are some details, methods and tips to make your system safer from stealer and hackers.Imp: Some of the security tips include editing and changing of the Registry, so I will advise you to create a Restore Point and/or a backup for your registry.Always Install Windows In a different directoryWindows usually, automatically installs itself in Local Disk (C:), the WINDOWS directory. Windows 2000, NT, VISTA, and WINDOW7, Will provide an option for WINNT. That is when many of rough Exe files and virus are allowed to install automatically during windows installation. To get rid of these rough program, you have to install your window in any other drive then Local Disk (C:) \u2013 It is totally up to you whatever you name the directly during installation.        Disable OS/2 Subsystem and POSIXWindows vista, windows 7 and XP come with (little) documented subsystems which allow its compatibility with OS/2 systems and UNIX. These systems are enabled default or automatically but are rarely used by the user, or most of the user does not have any idea about these programs. Hence, if disabled, it will surely save your system from hackers.       Do not leave your default passwords blankDuring installation, Windows XP, 2000, Vista and windows 7 sets up an Administrator account with overall prompts and system access with the help of a password. Now Guess what? By leaving the passwords as default, it will allow the password to be blank. If you don\u2019t want to put up a password, you can simply click NEXT.Always Disable the Guest accountWindows XP, Vista, and 7 provide an option for a Guest account, that sounds OK to everyone because it is for a guest? Yeah right!!  We know that it is used for limited access, but yet it is a danger for your PC and it can cause a lot of damages. If you are not using the guest account, then disable it forever.  Go to \u2014 Control Panel \u2013User Accounts \u2013Guest Account\u2013Turn Off the Guest account.Disable simple File SharesIn Windows XP, Vista and windows 7, the file sharing mode is easily accessible and exploited, as it is easy to share files via LAN. Well, it is easy for hackers to access as well. So turn it off, click on My Computer\u2013click Tools\u2013Folder Option\u2013View tab\u2013uncheck and\u2013Use Simple file sharing (Recommended).Turn off all unneeded ServicesWindows XP, 2000, window vista and 7, all come up with many background services and programs which are not necessary or are never to be used.  Remote Desktop Sharing, Messenger, Alerter, Servers, Remote Desktop Help Session Manager, Play Device, Host SSDP Discovery Service,  NetMeeting, Remote Registry, Routing and Remote Access Telnet and Universal Plug etc.Don\u2019t save your password in browser historyMost of us are lazy to type our password on every time we access our email accounts, online banking account or any private account that has to be open via password on the internet. Type your password every time you sign in. Don\u2019t save your password in browser history as it can be used by hackers and stealer via cookie stealing script.Enjoy and happy surfing!", "authur": "Waqas", "date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"topics": ["anonymous", "AnonymoX", "internet", "Privacy", "Proxy", "VPN"], "title": "Open Ban Websites Without Any Proxy Software", "body": "How to visit ban websites? this is a question that comes to mind whenever people realize that their favorite website is banned in the university, college, office or even at home sometimes.These websites may be banned for several reasons, sometimes to avoid people from wasting their time rather than working or studying or perhaps due to governmental factors.
