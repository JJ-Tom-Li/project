[{"title": "Notorious KillDisk Malware Turns Into Ransomware", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "A recently discovered variant of the KillDisk malware encrypts files and holds them for ransom instead of deleting them. Since KillDisk has been used in attacks aimed at industrial control systems (ICS), experts are concerned that threat actors may be bringing ransomware into the industrial domain.Previous versions of KillDisk wiped hard drives in an effort to make systems inoperable, but a new variant observed by industrial cyber security firm CyberX encrypts files using a combination of RSA and AES algorithms. Specifically, each file is encrypted with an individual AES key and these keys are encrypted using an RSA 1028 key stored in the body of the malware.CyberX VP of research David Atch told SecurityWeek that the KillDisk variant they have analyzed is a well-written piece of ransomware. The code is similar to earlier samples and its functionality is nearly the same.The ransomware is designed to encrypt various types of files, including documents, databases, source code, disk images, emails and media files. Both local partitions and network folders are targeted.Victims are instructed to pay 222 bitcoins ($210,000) to recover their files, which experts believe suggests that the attackers are targeting \u201corganizations with deep pockets.\u201d The contact email address provided to affected users is associated with Lelantos, a privacy-focused email provider only accessible through the Tor network. The Bitcoin address to which victims are told to send the ransom has so far not made any transactions.Atch pointed out that the same RSA public key is used for all samples, which means that a user who receives a decryptor will likely be able to decrypt files for all victims.According to CyberX, the malware requires elevated privileges and registers itself as a service. The threat terminates various processes, but it avoids critical system processes and ones associated with anti-malware applications, likely to avoid disrupting the system and triggering detection by security products.

The archive is attached to an email and the password to open it is included in the email body. Most recently, the method was used to distribute the Gerber ransomware (the campaign also dropped the Ursnif banking Trojan).Recently, phishers decided to adopt the technique and adapt it to their needs in an attempt to steal banking data. However, instead of an Office document, this attack uses an HTML attachment that has been password-protected.As expected, the email message is personalised with the recipient\u2019s name, as well as with what supposedly represents the first digits of their credit card account number. However, since these digits are standardised, this apparent personalization is only meant to create a sense of legitimacy for the carefully crafted emails without requiring actual knowledge of a potential victim\u2019s actual card number.Furthermore, the spam emails use stolen branding and social engineering tactics to create a sense of urgency and trick the user into giving away their credit card information: recipients are told they need to update their security information for their \u201cnew chip card.\u201dThe HTML attachment used in this campaign was found to be XOR-encoded to make dynamic analysis more difficult. According to Proofpoint, the password protection is implemented with the help of JavaScript. A script named pah.js is used to decrypt the XOR-encoded HTML when the user enters the password.As soon as the user enters the password provided in the email body and the HTML attachment is decrypted, a fairly typical credit card phishing template complete with stolen branding is displayed. The same as in credential phishing attacks performed via HTTP POST, users are required to enter their credentials in the form.The use of a password-protected attachment is meant not only to make detection and analysis more difficult but also to convince users that the email is legitimate. The fact that the password is included in the email body also adds to this sense of legitimacy, in addition to making it easy for the recipients to open the attachment.source: security week", "date": "December 24, 2016", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "Steam Down After Hackers Phantom Squad Initiated DDoS Attack", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "Steam is used by more than 123million gamers, is suffering from a \u201cmajor DDoS attack\u201d by a group of hackers named Phanton Squad, who previously have claimed responsibility for taking down PSN and Xbox Live, claimed repsonsibility for the attack on Twitter.They said they had initiated a \u201cmajor DDoS attack\u201d on the platform \u2013 but shortly afterwards the Twitter account was deactivated.Last month Phantom Squad also claimed responsibility for an attack which caused it to go offline for several minutes.It raises fears that hacking groups could try to launch major DDoS attacks on other gaming services over the Christmas weekend.Currently steam is running as of writing this article.", "date": "December 23, 2016", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "Marvel and Captain America Twitter Accounts Hacked by OurMine", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "\u200bAfter hacking the official Twitter account of NetFlix, OurMine managed to breach some other accounts as well, including those belonging to Marvel and the NFL.While it\u2019s not exactly clear how the hacking group managed to break into so many accounts at a time, OurMine did no harm and only laughed at the weak security systems of the impacted companies.\u201cHey, It\u2019s OurMine, don\u2019t worry, we are just testing your security, contact us to tell you more about your security,\u201d one such tweet posted from the NFL account read.

The group is believed to be responsible for many high-profile attacks, including recent operations aimed at the U.S. Democratic Party, government organisations in Turkey and Germany, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).CrowdStrike believes Fancy Bear is likely tied to GRU, the foreign military intelligence agency of Russia\u2019s Armed Forces, and the company\u2019s recent findings reinforce this theory.This summer, the company\u2019s analysts came across an Android application package (APK) file named \u201c\u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk.\u201d The file contained Russian-language artefacts and its name referenced the D-30, a Russian-made 122 mm towed howitzer that first entered service in the 1960s.The D-30 is still used by the Ukrainian military and, in 2013, artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk created an Android app designed to help personnel reduce the time to fire the gun from minutes to under 15 seconds. According to its developer, the application has roughly 9,000 users.According to CrowdStrike, Fancy Bear took the legitimate Android app and bundled it with an Android variant of X-Agent, a piece of malware that has been used by the threat actor in attacks aimed at high-value targets, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC).The malicious version of the app was distributed on Ukrainian military forums from late 2014 through 2016. Experts believe the legitimate program had been mainly distributed through social media, not via the Google Play store.The Android variant of the X-Agent malware appears to be designed for strategic purposes as it does not cause any damage to the infected device and it does not interfere with the operation of the original app. X-Agent is capable of accessing contact information, SMS messages, call logs and Internet data.\u201cCrowdStrike Intelligence assesses a tool such as this has the potential ability to map out a unit\u2019s composition and hierarchy, determine their plans, and even triangulate their approximate location.

The new malicious program is looking to infect both embedded devices and servers that have an open SSH port by preying on their weak credentials, with the purpose of building a large botnet.The attack method is similar to that observed with Mirai, the Internet of Things botnet that became famous recently after infecting devices in 164 countries: the Trojan searches for poorly-secured devices, infects them, then uses them to spread further. According to ESET, the new threat starts the scan from a small list of IPs, but then incrementally expands the search to more targets.Rakos is written in the Go language and has a binary compressed with the standard UPX tool.The Trojan was observed loading its configuration via standard input (stdin) in YAML format. This configuration file includes various information, including a list of command and control (C&C) servers, the credentials that are used to brute-force devices, and internal parameters.Next, the malware starts a local HTTP server, which allows future versions to kill running instances regardless of their name, and which also attempts to parse a URL query for various parameters. Additionally, the malware creates a web server listening on all interfaces, which is listening to a randomly chosen TCP port (ranging from 20,000 to 60,000).When a remote request is sent to the device via this port, a response containing the IP address is received, researchers say. The malware also sends an initial HTTP request containing important information about the victim device to the C&C server.Interestingly, the researchers noticed that a previous version of the Trojan also scanned for the SMTP service, but that the feature was disabled in the current build, most likely because it is still under development.While analyzing the backdoor\u2019s capabilities, the security researchers discovered that it is also capable of updating the configuration file from a specific C&C location, as well as upgrading itself. Moreover, because it sends information such as the device\u2019s IP address, username, and password, it basically provides the attacker with complete control over the infected device.The botnet wasn\u2019t observed being yet capable of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or spam spreading, but researchers believe that it might receive such functionality, considering the level of control over the infected device it provides the attackers with. source: securityweek", "date": "December 21, 2016", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "This New Malware Drains All The Cash From ATMs", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "A newly discovered family of malware targeting ATMs (automated teller machines) has been designed with the sole purpose of emptying cash from the safes of the self-serve machines, Trend Micro security researchers warn.Dubbed Alice, the malware is the most stripped down ATM threat seen to date. The malware has no information stealing capabilities and can\u2019t even be controlled via the ATM\u2019s numeric keypad. Initially discovered in November 2016, Alice is believed to have been around since 2014, and Trend Micro says that it is only the eighth ATM malware family seen to date, although such threats have been around for over nine years.Use of the malware requires physical access to an ATM, and Trend Micro suggests that it has been designed for money mules to steal all the money available in an attacked cash machine, something that malware such as GreenDispenser was seen doing last year.Unlike that piece of malware, however, the new threat doesn\u2019t connect to the ATM\u2019s PIN pad and can also be used via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), although Trend Micro says that there\u2019s no evidence of such use as of now.Malware analysis revealed that Alice (the name was included in the version information of the binary) was packed with a commercial, off-the-shelf packer/obfuscator called VMProtect, which prevents execution inside debuggers. Further, the malware checks its environment before execution and terminates itself if it determines it isn\u2019t running on an ATM (it checks for a couple of registry keys and also requires specific DLLs to be installed on the system).When running on a machine, Alice writes two files in the root directory, namely an empty 5 MB+ sized file called xfs_supp.sys and an error logfile called TRCERR.LOG. Next, it connects to the CurrencyDispenser1 peripheral, which is the dispenser device in the XFS environment and, if a correct PIN is provided, it displays information on the various cassettes with money loaded inside the machine.Because the malware only connects to the CurrencyDispenser1 peripheral and doesn\u2019t attempt to use the machine\u2019s PIN pad, the researchers believe that the attackers physically open the ATM and infect it via USB or CD-ROM. Moreover, they suggest that the actors connect a keyboard to the machine\u2019s mainboard and operate the malware through it.The security researchers discovered that Alice supports three commands, each issued via specific PINs: one to drop a file for uninstallation, another to exit the program and run the uninstallation/cleanup routine, and a third to open the \u201coperator panel.\u201d This panel is where information on the cash available inside the ATM is displayed.source: securityweek", "date": "December 21, 2016", "topics": ["Hacking News"]}, {"title": "Google Released an Open Source Pentesting Tool Called Project Wycheproof", "authur": "William Fieldhouse", "body": "Google this week announced the availability of Project Wycheproof, an open source tool designed for finding known vulnerabilities in popular cryptographic software libraries.Developed in Java due to its common cryptographic interface, Project Wycheproof includes tests for the most popular crypto algorithms, including AES-EAX, AES-GCM, DH, DHIES, DSA, ECDH, ECDSA, ECIES and RSA.

But all that could be hosted on the page was a video ad.With faked domain registrations, they were able to trick algorithms that decided where the most profitable ads would go into buying their fraudulent web space. Those algorithms typically make bids for ad space most suitable for the advertisement\u2019s intended audience, with the auction complete in milliseconds. But AFK13 were able to game the system so their space was purchased over big-name brands.AFK13 then invested heavily in a bot farm, taking up space in data centers so they could fire faked traffic from more than 570,000 bots at those ads, thereby driving revenue thanks to the pay per click system they exploited.As part of what White Ops called the Methbot campaign, those bots \u201cwatched\u201d as many as 300 million video ads a day, with an average payout of $13.04 per thousand faked views. And the fraudsters had their bot army replicate the actions of real people, with faked clicks, mouse movements and social network login information.It\u2019s unclear where the Russian link comes from.

This feature was added to Mirai Botnet #14 which has infected morethan 3 million devices by the end of November.In late November, a Mirai variant managed to hijack 900,000 routers from German ISP Deutsche Telekom using port 7547. Soon after, the same malware attack was confirmed to have also hit around 100,000 UK TalkTalk and Post Office ISP users. The attacks were revealed to leverage the TR-064 vulnerability, which can be used to steal WiFi network keys in addition to recruiting the router into a botnet.Researchers with the China-based Network Security Research Lab at Qihoo 360, who managed to crack the Mirai DGA, said last week that multiple Mirai samples were using the functionality and that they were leveraging three different top-level domains (TLDs) for that.In a new post, the security researchers reveal that newly observed Mirai samples dropped the initial seed series and adopted a new one. Thus, new domains that matched the Mirai DGA algorithm but no longer featured the previous seed series were detected.The new domains were said to belong to new Mirai variants because layer 2 (L2) domain had the same 12-character length, a-y only, and because all TLDs for these domains were fixed to .online, one of the TLDs observed in the previous samples. What\u2019s more, the botnet operators exercised a strict time control over the creation of the domain, to ensure that the overlapping window was very short.The researchers managed to brute-force the new DGA as well, and they even provided a list of the domains the Mirai samples will supposedly use before the end of the year. However, they also noted that at least one of the already generated domains wasn\u2019t registered.According to a report from BleepingComputer, however, there\u2019s a clear explanation of why that happened: Mirai is moving to Tor (The Onion Router) domains because they are far more difficult to shut down.

Apple was notified about the flaw in mid-August and patched it earlier this month with the release of MacOS 10.12.2.FileVault 2 is a full-disk encryption program that uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key to preventing unauthorised access to the information on the startup disk. Frisk has demonstrated that an attacker with physical access to a locked or sleeping MacBook can retrieve the FileVault 2 password in clear text by connecting a special device to the targeted system\u2019s Thunderbolt port.According to the expert, these attacks are possible due to two vulnerabilities. One of them is related to the fact that while direct memory access (DMA) attack protections are enabled by default once MacOS has started, these protections are not active before the operating system has booted. This allows an attacker to read and write memory from a MacBook by connecting a Thunderbolt device.Since the FileVault 2 password is stored in cleartext in memory at predictable locations, software running on the Thunderbolt device can retrieve the password from memory before it is overwritten. The attacker must gain access to a locked or sleeping MacBook, connect the Thunderbolt device and reboot the computer. The attack does not work if the targeted MacBook has been shut down as the password is no longer available in memory. The device that can be used to carry out such an attack has been dubbed PCILeech, and its source code and hardware requirements have been made available by Frisk.

Thus, the cybercriminals don\u2019t need to invest too much when it comes to adapting their spam and tools to the new location.TrickBot was designed to focus on business accounts, corporate and commercial banking, and wealth management across all targeted banks. The malware was also configured to target commercial banks in India and Malaysia, and IBM security researchers suggest that the cybercriminals are looking to create cash-out options in those countries.The malware\u2019s authors are focused on creating new redirection attacks, and the security researchers noticed that the most recent configuration has a ratio of redirection attack adapted to 58% of the targeted URLs. Previously, the malware featured redirections for only 35% of the target URLs.Unlike TrickBot, other Trojans are reducing their redirection attacks or completely removing them, IBM says. Dridex was previously observed doing this, the same as GozNym, which has reduced its redirection attack ratio to 12% or lower in some geographies.In these attacks, the cybercriminals are creating convincing replicas of the banks\u2019 websites, and trick users into giving up their login credentials and even two-factor authentication data. Some even use the bank\u2019s URL and secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate, which makes them appear even more convincing.

The memo, from CIA Director John Brennan, read as follows:Earlier this week, I met separately with (Director) FBI James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election.The three of us also agree that our organizations, along with others, need to focus on completing the thorough review of this issue that has been directed by President Obama and which is being led by the DNI.The CIA\u2019s investigation found that Russian government hackers had a clear goal of helping Trump win the election.

This is possible because the Linux GStreamer media playback framework offers support for the playback of SNES music files by emulating the SNES CPU and audio processor.The library that makes all this possible is Game_Music_Emu, which works in C and C++ and is very easy to use.The core emulation logic of the faulty Sony SPC700 processor contains at least two vulnerabilities: a missing X register value clamp for the MOV (X)+,An instruction; and a missing SP register value clamp for the RET1 instruction. By cascading the first vulnerability, the Evans managed to achieve reliable exploitation, with all of the technical details published on his blog.For the exploit to work and the drive-by to be successful, the user has to visit a malicious webpage, where audio files encoded in the SPC music format but saved with the .flac and .mp3 extensions are located.The files can be used to load and run the attacker\u2019s code with the same privileges as those of the current user. Depending on the privileges the user has, the exploit could result in the theft of personal data, including photos, videos, or documents, as well as data stored in the browser.To offer a glimpse of the exploit, the security researcher also published two videos, showing the vulnerability being leveraged in both Fedora 25 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Evans also made available the files needed to test the exploit and decided to offer a glimpse at different exploitation contexts in the second clip, although the same exploit file is used for all of them.\u201cThe strong reliability of this exploit makes it work inside Fedora\u2019s tracker-extract process, which has highly variable heap state,\u201d the researcher says.The impact on Linux distributions is mixed, with Ubuntu being impacted the most, as the faulty code is installed and present on the attack surface by default, though the user needs to select the \u2018mp3\u2019 option during install. On Fedora, the attack surface is limited, because gstreamer1-plugins-bad is split into multiple packages, and only gstreamer1-plugins-bad-freeis installed by default.However, the general lack of sandboxing contributes to the severity of the issue. \u201cI think we inhabit the world where media parsing sandboxes should be mandatory these days. There\u2019s hope: some of my other recent disclosures appear to have motivated a sandbox for Gnome\u2019s tracker,\u201d the researcher explains.A few weeks ago, Evans detailed another Linux exploit leveraging Nintendo Entertainment System, one that leveraged a vulnerability and a separate logic error in the gstreamer 0.10.x player.

According to researchers with Network Security Research Lab at 360, at least 53 unique Mirai samples exist, given that they have been captured by their honeypots from 6 hosting servers.What\u2019s more, the researchers reveal that newly spotted Mirai samples that spread through TCP ports 7547 and 5555. Moreover, the researchers discovered that the malware author who uses the email address dlinchkravitz[at]gmail[dot]com has already registered some of the generated domains.According to the security researchers, the analysed malware samples use 3 top-level domains (TLDs), namely .online, .tech, and .support, with each layer 2 (L2) domain having a fixed length of 12-bytes, with each character randomly chosen from \u2018a\u2019 to \u2019z\u2019.

Last year\u2019s attack against the German parliament, and attacks against German politicians in August, are also blamed on Russia.

There is a kind of pressure on public discourse and on democracy, which is unacceptable.\u201d He added that there are indications of Russian involvement. \u201cAttribution to a state actor is technically difficult, but there is some evidence that it is at least tolerated or desired by the state.\u201dYesterday, however, a statement issued by the BfV was more forthright. \u201cSince the start of the Ukraine crisis,\u201d it started, \u201cwe have seen a significant increase in Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns in Germany.\u201d It warns of a broad spectrum of instruments and \u201can enormous use of financial resources on Russia\u2019s part\u201d designed to strengthen extremist groups in order to shape political discourse in Germany.The statement names APT28 as using a campaign that is often executed as \u2018false flags\u2019. \u201cThis approach represents a previously unseen methodology in campaigns that are controlled by Russia.\u201d Note however, that many experts believe that the attack against French television company TV5  was also a \u2018false flag\u2019: in reality APT28 pretending to be ISIS.The statement goes on to say, \u201cSpear-phishing against political parties and parliamentary groups have increased dramatically.

Mail vulnerability that could have been exploited simply by getting the targeted user to open a specially crafted email.Nearly one year ago, Jouko Pynn\u00f6nen of Finland-based software company Klikki Oy discovered a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web version of the Yahoo! Mail service that could have allowed an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code hidden in emails.The researcher said the flaw could have been used to forward the victim\u2019s emails, change their account settings and even create an email worm that attached itself to all outgoing emails.The vulnerability, which earned Pynn\u00f6nen $10,000, existed due to Yahoo\u2019s failure to properly sanitise code in HTML emails.The expert recently decided to take another look at Yahoo\u2019s Mail service and discovered a similar flaw, but this time it was related to code inserted when a certain type of content is attached to an email.The \u201cShare files from cloud providers\u201d attachment option allows users to attach files from their cloud storage accounts, such as Dropbox or Google Drive. While analysing the code inserted into an email when this option was used, Pynnonen noticed some HTML attributes named data-* (e.g. data-URL, data-category, data-embed-URL). Further analysis showed that these attributes are also used when a YouTube video is added to an email.The researcher found a way to abuse these attributes in YouTube video attachments to get arbitrary JavaScript code executed. There was no need for the user to click on a link or open an attachment \u2013 the code would get executed as soon as the email was opened.Similar to the flaw discovered one year ago, this security hole could have been exploited to steal a user\u2019s emails and create a worm that spreads by attaching itself to outgoing emails, the expert said.Pynn\u00f6nen told SecurityWeek that he did not get a chance to test the attack method using the Google Drive and Dropbox attachment options. Yahoo was informed about the vulnerability on November 12 and fixed it by the end of November.Yahoo awarded the expert a $10,000 bounty for the flaw.

This uses Word documents that contain malicious macros and it is abusing PowerShell for a fileless infection.This malware is being distributed by TA530, who is an actor already known to be involved in very highly personalised campaigns. The August distribution campaign, researchers say, was targeting customer service and managerial staff at retailers in an attempt to steal sensitive documents and credentials from the compromised machines.To ensure successful infection, the actor used subject lines for the emails to reference to issues pertaining to alleged purchases from the targeted company\u2019s website. These emails were targeted at employees who could supposedly help resolve the problems, which made it likely that they would open the attached documents, which supposedly contained detailed information about the issue.However, as soon as the recipient opened the document, they would be prompted to enable the macros, which in turn would launch a PowerShell command to download and install the August stealer on the machine. The malicious payload is downloaded from a remote site as a PowerShell byte array, along with a few lines of code to deobfuscate the array through a XOR operation.The security researchers noticed that the macros used in this campaign are similar to those used in a campaign delivering the Ursnif banking Trojan. They are meant to add sandbox evasion capabilities to the distribution attempt by performing checks such as Maxmind, task counts, task names, and recent file counts.The August stealer was written in .NET and its authors used Confuser to obfuscate it. By looking at the source code from a particular sample, Proofpoint researchers determined that the threat can steal and upload files with specified extensions to a command and control (C&C) server, can steal .rdp and wallet.dat files, and can also steal cryptocurrency wallets including Electrum and Bither, in addition to being able to determine whether security tools such as Wireshark and Fiddler are installed on the machine.Additionally, the malware can grab credentials from FTP applications (such as SmartFTP, FileZilla, TotalCommander, WinSCP, and CoreFTP) and messenger apps (Pidgin, PSI, LiveMessenger, and others); can collect cookies and passwords from Firefox, Chrome, Thunderbird, and Outlook; can communicate the hardware ID, OS name, and victim\u2019s username to the C&C server; and can encrypt network data via base64 encoding, character replacement, adding a random key (passed to server encoded in the User-Agent field), and reversing the strings.\u201cAugust could be used to steal credentials and files in a wide range of scenarios. The malware itself is obfuscated while the macro used in these distribution campaigns employs a number of evasion techniques and a fileless approach to load the malware via PowerShell. All of these factors increase the difficulty of detection, both at the gateway and the endpoint,\u201d Proofpoint researchers say.Because cybercriminals are using increasingly sophisticated and personalised email lures, organisations are advised to use email gateways that can detect macros with sandbox evasion built-in.

It was assumed that the UK victims were the outer ripples of the primary attack; and this was confirmed by a subsequent report that quoted the Mirai developer as apologizing for the effect on the Post Office. The UK disruption was apparently an accident and not done intentionally.This version of events is now questioned by the findings of Pen Test Partners. Senior consultant Andrew Tierney reported Friday that the effect on TalkTalk routers was different to the effect on Deutsche Telekom routers. \u201cWe can\u2019t see what is causing the claimed ISP outages for TalkTalk and the Post Office reported in the press. It shouldn\u2019t stop the router routing, and as of yet, the bots haven\u2019t taken part in any attacks.\u201dPen Test Partners concluded, \u201cWhilst the spread and purpose of the bot net is similar to Mirai, there are enough differences with this variant that it should really get a new name.\u201dIn a subsequent post on Saturday, Tierney seems to have named the second worm \u2018Annie\u2019.\u201cThe TR-064 security hole that was reported this week is really nasty,\u201d he reported. \u201cThe worm that exploits this is being referred to as \u2018Annie\u2019. Attackers appear to have cottoned on to the fact that the TR-064 vulnerability can be used for more than just recruiting the router into a botnet.\u201d The additional purpose, he suggested, is to steal the router\u2019s WiFi network key. Worryingly, he also claims that the fix pushed out by TalkTalk will most likely not solve the problem.Following the incident, TalkTalk published its solution: customers should switch off affected routers and leave them for 20 minutes while they update with new software. \u201cAfter 20 minutes try and access the internet again, if you\u2019ve changed your wireless details then you\u2019ll need to use the wireless network name and password on the back of the router.\u201dBut Tierney sees a problem with this: it won\u2019t work as a fix. \u201cNearly all customers never change their Wi-Fi key from that written on the router. Why would they? I\u2019ll bet many don\u2019t even realize they can.\u201d So what happens is that Annie steals the key, and \u201cthe TalkTalk fix simply resets the router, to the exact same keys that have already been stolen!!\u201dHaving acquired the WiFi key, a hacker can listen in to communications and infect the network with additional malware. He would need to be in close physical proximity to the router (outside, perhaps in a closely parked vehicle); but, added Tierney, \u201cif you know the SSID (also stolen using the Annie worm) you can use databases such as https://wigle.net to find your victim\u2019s house.\u201d His solution is that TalkTalk \u201cshould be REPLACING all customers routers urgently;\u201d possibly as many as 55,000.TalkTalk itself is not currently keen to do so. A spokeswoman told the BBC that the number of infected routers had been \u201cnothing in that order of magnitude\u201d. She added, \u201cOur security team does not believe there is any greater risk that a customer\u2019s wi-fi can be used or accessed without their permission as a result of this.\u201dDr. Steven Murdoch from University College London suggested something in between the two positions. \u201cIt\u2019s possible [the perpetrators of Annie] are just security researchers, but also reasonably possible that they are actually criminals that intend to exploit this information.\u201d He doesn\u2019t believe that TalkTalk needs necessarily recall all the routers: \u201cThe hardware is fine, what needs to be replaced is the wi-fi password.\u201dHe does, however, admit that this is difficult. \u201cIf TalkTalk does this online or over the phone, that leaves the customers open to phishing attacks, where a scammer says: \u2018As you heard on the news you need to change your password, please do these things\u2026'\u201dTalkTalk remains adamant that even the password change is unnecessary.

One of the compromised sites, known as a watering hole, belonged to a major public service organisation in Taiwan.When users accessed this website\u2019s registration page, an iframe injected into the footer loaded an exploit landing page. The Internet Explorer vulnerability leveraged by this exploit, tracked as CVE-2016-0189, was fixed by Microsoft in May, but it had been seen in targeted attacks against users in South Korea before a patch was made available.A few weeks after Microsoft resolved the flaw, researchers published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. The PoC code was used by cybercriminals to integrate the security hole into several exploit kits.The same PoC code has been used in the CNACOM campaign, but the payload has been invoked through an Internet Explorer sandbox escape flaw tracked as CVE-2015-0016.In the CNACOM attacks, the exploit code collects information from the device, including its IP address.

What\u2019s more, the researchers explain that reverse-engineering the protocols is highly feasible even for attackers with limited knowledge and resources and without physical access to devices.The research was conducted on the latest generation of a widely used ICD, which uses a long-range RF channel (from two to five meters) for communication, using a black-box approach and inexpensive Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment. While analyzing the protocols, the security researchers discovered weaknesses in them and in their implementations, and they also managed to conduct several attacks against the vulnerable devices.These attacks, which include replay and spoofing, can put patients\u2019 safety at risk, especially since they can be performed without being in close proximity to the patient. The security researchers suggest that the discovered issues affect at least 10 types of ICDs currently on the market and say that manufacturers have been contacted before the publication of the paper.The researchers started their analysis with an attempt to intercept the wireless transmissions between the device programmer and the ICD, and focused on reverse-engineering the proprietary protocol used to communicate over the long-range channel. Next, they looked into ways to activate the ICD before carrying out attacks and discovered several ways to bypass the current activation procedure.After fully reverse-engineering the proprietary protocol, the researchers focused on discovering vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit, and revealed that active and passive software radio-based attacks such as privacy, DoS, and spoofing and replay attacks are possible.

The purpose of both of these is to help developers to locate the bugs in their code which might eventually lead to breaches. Even though the purpose of both of these organisations works for the same cause, one is a paid service while the other is free; one is proprietary while the other is open source.Google has described the OSS-Fuzz as \u2018continuous fuzzing for open source software\u2019. According to the development team in Google\u2019s Testing Blog, \u201cOSS-Fuzz\u2019s goal, is to make common software infrastructure more secure and stable by combining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable distributed execution. OSS-Fuzz combines various fuzzing engines (initially, libFuzzer) with Sanitizers (initially, AddressSanitizer) and provides a massively distributed execution environment powered by ClusterFuzz.\u201dIt fills a gap left by Project Springfield. Since the fuzzing field offered by the Microsoft is a commercial product, it can only be used by the customers willing to pay and afford it. This does not exclude open source developers as they love open source software, but it is noticeable that it is specifically marketed to business customers: suitable for testing in-house software, software acquired through M&A, and even third-party software being considered for purchase.Google notes that \u201cOpen source software is the backbone of the many apps, sites, services, and networked things that make up \u2018the internet\u2019\u2026  An example is the FreeType library, which is used on over a billion devices to display text (and which might even be rendering the characters you are reading now).\u201d It is important that such software is bug-free and secure. \u201cRecently the FreeType fuzzier found a new heap buffer overflow only a few hours after the source change.\u201dThe \u2018continuous\u2019 nature of the service solves another problem: open source software may have multiple maintainers applying software changes almost on an ongoing basis. \u201cOSS-Fuzz automatically notified the maintainer, who fixed the bug\u201d announced Google; \u201cthen OSS-Fuzz automatically confirmed the fix.

According to Zimperium, vulnerabilities in AirDroid allows an attacker to exploit the built-in features and use them against the app users.The main issue that the security researchers pointed is that AirDroid uses insecure communication channels. This means that the app\u2019s millions of users are exposed to a MitM attack and other kinds of attacks.There is also a high risk of information leak along with remote hijacking of update APKs which could result in remote code execution.While analysing AirDroid, the security researchers discovered that the communication channels employed to send authentication data to the statistics server are insecure. While the requests are encrypted with the Data Encryption Standard (DES) symmetric-key block cipher in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, the encryption key is hardcoded inside the application, meaning that the attacker knows it.Armed with these details, an actor on the same network with the target device could execute MitM attacks to grab authentication credentials from the very first HTTP request the application performs, and can then impersonate the user for further requests, Zimperium\u2019s Simone Margaritelli explains.\u201cThis HTTP request can be decrypted at runtime using the 890jklms key hardcoded inside the application and the authentication fields parsed from the resulting JSON. Having this information, the attacker can now impersonate the victim\u2019s device and perform various HTTP or HTTPS requests on its behalf to the AirDroid API endpoints,\u201d the researcher notes.An attacker could craft a payload encrypted in DES with the same exact key to trick the server into spewing user information, which will result in the email and password hash being exposed.
